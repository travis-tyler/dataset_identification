[{"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "This study used data from the 1997 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the 1999 Area Resource File to describe the utilization of specific preventive health care services by rural women and men, and to assess the impact of rural residence, the availability of health care providers and technology, demographic factors, and health insurance status on the likelihood of obtaining the following preventive health care services: blood pressure screening, cholesterol screening, colon cancer screening, Pap smears, mammograms, flu shots, and pneumonia vaccinations. Respondents were grouped by gender, age, and residence in an urban, rural adjacent, or rural non-adjacent county, based on the USDA rural-urban continuum codes. Rural adjacent counties are non-metropolitan counties that are physically adjacent to one or more metropolitan areas and have at least 2 percent of their employed labor force commuting to central metropolitan counties; rural nonadjacent counties are non-metropolitan counties that do not meet the above criteria. Physician to population ratios are lo wer in rural non-adjacent counties than in adjacent counties, and non-adjacent residents generally must travel greater distances to access health care resources. Consequently, nonadjacent residents may be significantly less likely to obtain preventive health services than those who reside in adjacent areas. Eleven logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of the following variables on the likelihood of obtaining each preventive health care service: the respondent=s residence in a rural adjacent, rural non-adjacent, or urban county, Census Region, education, income, race/ethnicity, gender, age, health insurance status, ability to afford medical care, the physician to population ratio and mammography facility to population ratio (mammograms only) in the respondent=s county. Several demographic and health insurance status variables were significantly related to the likelihood of obtaining preventive services, while controlling for other variables. Respondents with less than a high school education are significantly less likely than those with more education to have routine medical checkups, blood pressure screening, cholesterol screening, Pap smears, mammograms, and flu shots. Compared to respondents with employer-provided insurance, uninsured persons and those with individually purchased insurance are significantly less likely to obtain all of the preventive services, while respondents with Medicare or Medicaid coverage were more likely to receive checkups, blood pressure screening, colon cancer screening (Medicare), and Pap smears (Medicaid). Respondents who reported having a time during the past year when they could not afford to visit a doctor were significantly less likely to obtain all services except for colon cancer screening and pne umonia vaccinations. Black, non-Hispanic respondents are more likely than White, non-Hispanic respondents to receive all of the preventive services except flu shots and pneumonia vaccinations. Controlling for demographic characteristics, health insurance status, and health system characteristics, rural non-adjacent residents are significantly less likely than urban residents to have a routine medical checkup, blood pressure screening, cholesterol test, mammogram, Pap test, and fecal occult blood test, proctoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy. Rural adjacent residents are significantly less likely than urban residents to have a routine medical checkup, cholesterol test, mammogram (women aged 40 to 49 years), and fecal occult blood test, proctoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy. Overall, differences between rural non-adjacent respondents and urban respondents were greater than those between rural adjacent respondents and urban respondents. The results indicate that rural residents are less likely than urban residents to obtain certain preventive health services and are further behind in meeting the Healthy People 2010 National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention objectives. Efforts to increase preventive services utilization rates among rural populations need to build on federal, state, and community-based initiatives to increase preventive service utilization by underserved populations, as well as recognizing the special challenges that rural areas present in the delivery of health care services. The results of this study, along with previous research on programs to increase preventive health services utilization among underserved populations, indicate that strategies to increase rural preventive services utilization must reduce financial, geographic, and cultural barriers to care. In addition, efforts are needed to increase awareness of the importance of obtaining these preventive health services among rural populations and health care providers, and to ensure that follow-up diagnostic and treatment services are available to persons with abnormal test results."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A variety of factors are associated with low utilization of preventive health care services including financial barriers, such as lack of health insurance, or insurance that does not cover preventive services, and patient characteristics, such as low income, fewer years of education, lack of knowledge about the potential benefits of preventive services, not having a regular source of medical care, and residing at a distance from medical care (Makuc, Fried, and Kleinman, 1989;The National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Screening Consortium, 1990Bostick, Sprafka, Virnig, and Potter, 1993;Frazier, Jiles and Mayberry, 1996;Faulkner and Schauffler, 1997). Many of the factors associated with low utilization of preventive services are those that characterize rural populations, including lower incomes, lower educational status, and inadequate health insurance. Surveys and focus groups of rural residents have identified several barriers to obtaining preventive health services, including cost, lack of insurance coverage, travel distance, transportation problems, difficulty taking time off work, and lack of recommendations regarding the need for the preventive service from a health care provider (Walker, Lucas and Crespo, 1994;Elnicki, Morris , and Shockcor., 1995;Carr et al., 1996;Sparks, Ragheb, Given, and Swanson, 1996;Strickland and Strickland, 1996;Reding et al.,1997). Some studies in the U.S. and Canada have found that rural populations underutilize many types of preventive health services (OTA, 1990;Bryant and Mah, 1992). Underutilization of preventive services may result in a failure to identify health care problems that might be successfully managed with medication and/or lifestyle changes, e.g., hypertension. Failure to obtain timely screening tests for certain cancers, such as breast, cervical and colon cancer, may result in diagnosis at later stages of the disease, when the prognosis is poorer. There is some evidence that cancer tends to be diagnosed at more advanced stages among rural populations (Monroe, Ricketts, and Savitz, 1992;Liff, Chow, and Greenberg, 1991). This study has two purposes: 1) to describe the utilization of specific preventive health care services by rural women and men, and 2) to assess the impact of rural residence, demographic factors, health insurance status, and health system characteristics on the likelihood of obtaining each preventive health care service."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": "The data sources for the project are the 1997 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the 1999 Area Resource File (ARF). The BRFSS is a state-based survey of the U.S. non-institutionalized population. Through the BRFSS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the states collect data annually on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases. Adults aged 18 years and older are surveyed by phone. Most analyses of BRFSS data on preventive health services have focused on state-by-state comparisons. Some analyses have also compared utilization of preventive health services by gender, and by racial and ethnic groupings. Limited analyses have been conducted of the BRFSS data by rural or urban residence of respondents. The ARF database provides county-level data on the availability of health care providers and technology. Each BRFSS record has a county FIPS code, allowing the data to be merged with county-level data from the ARF. The BRFSS questionnaire includes a core component, consisting of the fixed, rotating, and emerging core, and optional modules (CDC, 1998a). The fixed core is a set of questions asked of BRFSS participants in all states. It includes questions about demographic characteristics, health status, health insurance, tobacco use, and selected cancer screening procedures. The rotating core consists of two distinct sets of questions, each asked in alternating years by all states, addressing different topics. In 1997, the rotating core items covered cholesterol, hypertension, injury, immunization, colorectal screening and alcohol use. The emerging core is a set of up to five questions that are added to the fixed and rotating cores. Emerging core questions typically focus on issues of a \"late breaking\"nature. These questions are part of the core for one year and are evaluated during or soon after the year concludes to determine their potential value in future surveys. Emerging questions for 1997 focused on health care coverage. States may also choose to include optional CDC modules, which are sets of questions on specific topics. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories participated in the BRFSS in 1997. The initial file contained 135,582 observations. After removing respondents whose BRFSS records could not be linked to ARF data using county FIPS codes (e.g., respondents missing county codes or residing in Alaska and Puerto Rico), a total of 130,452 respondents remained. California modified the wording of questions on mammograms and pap smears, so its data were excluded for those services but included for all other analyses. For the initial descriptive analyses, respondents were grouped by gender and residence in an urban, rural adjacent, or rural non-adjacent county, based on the USDA rural-urban continuum codes. Rural adjacent counties are non-metropolitan counties that are physically adjacent to one or more metropolitan areas and have at least 2 percent of their employed labor force commuting to central metropolitan counties; rural non-adjacent counties are non-metropolitan counties that do not meet the above criteria. Physician to population ratios are lower in rural non-adjacent counties than in adjacent counties, and non-adjacent residents generally must travel greater distances to access health care services in metropolitan areas. Consequently, non-adjacent residents may be significantly less likely to obtain preventive health services than those who reside in adjacent areas. Some analyses were conducted of subgroups by age, based on relevant guidelines. Threeway urbanicity comparisons were used to differentiate between urban, rural adjacent, and rural nonadjacent counties. Comparisons were also made between women and men within urbanicity categories, for preventive services that were relevant to both women and men. Z-tests were calculated to identify statistically significant differences between these groups. Next, multivariate analyses were performed to identify which factors significantly affect the likelihood of an individual obtaining each preventive health care service, while controlling for the effects of other factors. The statistical analyses used SUDAAN (Survey Data Analysis for Multistage Sample Design) software, which takes into account the complex sample design used to obtain BRFSS data. The BRFSS excludes households without phones, since it is conducted only as a telephone survey. Overall, 95 percent of households in the United States have a telephone, however, telephone coverage rates vary by geographic location, income, race, and age of the householder. A higher proportion of non-MSA residents (8.2 percent) lack a telephone in their household than central city MSA residents (7.4 percent) or residents of MSAs outside central cities (4.4 percent). Households with annual incomes of less than $15,000 are much more likely to lack a telephone than those with higher incomes. By race and ethnicity, American Indians, Hispanic, and African-American householders are more likely than Asian or White householders to lack a phone. Householders under the age of 25 are also more likely to be without a phone (US Bureau of the Census, 1998). The BRFSS does not employ a direct method of compensating for non-telephone coverage; however, the post-stratification weights used may partially correct for any bias caused by non-telephone coverage (CDC, 1998a). County-level data from the ARF used in the study include data on the number of primary care physicians serving adults (MDs and DOs in family practice, general practice, internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) who are actively practicing in each county as of 1995, county population as of 1996, and the number of Medicare certified mammography facilities in each county as of 1994. We used three sets of nationally accepted preventive services guidelines or recommendations to evaluate the adequacy of preventive services provided to rural and urban women and men: the The results section is organized as follows. First, the report describes basic demographic characteristics of the respondents, and presents data on factors that may influence utilization of preventive services, including health insurance status. Next, for each type of preventive service, the report 1) describes the relevant ACS, HP 2010, and USTFPS guidelines or recommendations; 2) summarizes previous research on utilization rates and factors associated with obtaining the recommended services; and 3) presents the results of bivariate analyses of utilization rates for the recommended services by category of urbanicity and, where appropriate, gender and age, using the 1997 BRFSS data. The final section discusses the results of logistic regression models that examine the relationship between rural residence and the likelihood of obtaining each recommended service, controlling for demographic characteristics, health insurance status, and health system characteristics. Table 1 displays selected demographic characteristics of the women and men in the sample: age, income, education and race. Differences in demographic characteristics between respondents by category of urbanicity are consistent with census data, e.g., non-metropolitan populations generally have higher percentages of persons over age 65, lower percentages of minority populations, and lower average incomes and levels of education than metropolitan populations (Ricketts, Johnson-Webb, and Randolph, 1999). Table 2 shows several statistically significant differences in respondents= self-reported health status by gender and category of urbanicity. Within each category of urbanicity, men are significantly more likely than women to report their health status as Aexcellent.@ Across categories of urbanicity, urban women are significantly more likely than either rural adjacent or rural nonadjacent women to report their health status as Aexcellent;@ urban men are also significantly more likely than either rural adjacent or rural non-adjacent men to report their health status as Aexcellent.@ By source of health insurance, several statistically significant differences also exist by gender and category of urbanicity (Table 3).

Both rural women and men (adjacent and non-adjacent) are significantly more likely to have Medicare than their urban counterparts, reflecting the greater proportion of persons over age 65 in the rural adjacent and non-adjacent populations.

(1989) found that blood pressure screening rates differed by race, income, and age. Low income white women were least likely to be tested while higher income black women were most likely, and women over age 60 were more likely than younger women to have their blood pressure checked. BRFSS data for 1991 indicate that blood pressure screening rates by age and gender were similar, ranging from 96 percent for men aged 18 to 39 years to 99 percent for women in the same age group (Faulkner and Schauffler, 1997). National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data for 1994 indicate that 84 percent of persons aged 18 and over had their blood pressure checked in the last 2 years (USDHHS, 1998). Table 6 shows that respondents in all gender and urbanicity categories have high levels of compliance with blood pressure screening recommendations. This high level of compliance reflects the fact that blood pressure screening is a routine part of basically all medical encounters.\nAnalysis of state-level BRFSS data for 1988 found that the median percentage of adults who reported ever having their cholesterol checked was 50 percent. The median percentage increased with increasing age, and was similar for men and women (Anda et al., 1990). National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data for 1993 indicate that 66 percent of persons aged 18 and over had a cholesterol screen in the last 5 years (USDHHS, 1998).\nSeveral studies have identified lower income and lower levels of education as factors associated with lower rates of mammography screening (Lee and Vogel, 1995;Siegel, Waller, Frazier, and Moriolis, 1993;National Cancer Institute, 1995;NCI Breast Cancer Screening Consortium, 1990, andSparks et al., 1996). Lee and Vogel (1995) found that black women, Hispanic women, and women who lacked health insurance were less likely to be screened, while women with a family history of breast cancer, those who had a previous breast biopsy, and were under the regular care of an OB/GYN were more likely to be screened. In a comparison of data from the 1987 and 1990 NHIS surveys, Breen and Kessler (1994) found that race declined in importance as a predictor of mammogram screening, while income and education remained strong positive predictors. Using NHIS data from 1987 to 1994, Makuc and colleagues (1999) found that mammography utilization increased rapidly between 1987 and 1991 for both low-income and higher income women. By 1994, low-income black women were more likely than low income white women to obtain mammograms, even after adjusting for current health insurance coverage, usual source of care, central city residence, education, geographic region, and age, providing some evidence of the success of targeted screening programs. Physician recommendation has been identified as an important factor influencing receipt of a mammogram. In the North Carolina 1997 BRFSS survey, 86 percent of women who reported discussing mammography with a provider during the past two years also reported having had a mammogram during the past two years, compared to 44 percent of women who did not report such a discussion (Conlisk, Herrick, and Passaro, 1999). Rural residence was found to be a strong predictor of mammography underuse in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (Calle et al., 1993). An analysis of 1988-92 Nebraska BRFSS data revealed that rural Nebraska women were less l ikely than urban women to have had a mammogram in the previous year (Rettig, Nelson, and Faulk, 1994). A study of rural female Medicare beneficiaries found that younger women (65 to 69 years), those with a high school or college education, those with Medicare supplemental insurance, and women who did not have arthritis or diabetes or need assistance with activities of daily living were more likely to have mammograms than women in other categories (Ives et al., 1996). In a sample of 474 women receiving care from a family practice network in rural Michigan, education, health insurance status, income, and physician recommendation were significantly related to the likelihood of having a mammogram in the past two years (40 to 49 years old) or past year (50 years and older) (Kreher, Hickner, Ruffin, and Lin, 1995). Travel distance and time were not significantly related to the likelihood of having had a recent mammogram; however, only 26 percent of respondents lived 20 miles or more from a mammography facility. A study of 606 rural farm women in Minnesota only found a weak association between the likelihood of ever having a mammography and distance to a mammography center; physician recommendation to have a mammogram had the strongest association (Carr et al., 1996).\nUsing 1995 BRFSS data, 59 percent of a national sample of seniors 65 and over received a flu shot in the past year, and 38 percent ever received pneumonia vaccination (Arday et al., 1997). Results were similar for men (60 percent for the flu shot and 36 percent for pneumonia vaccine) and women (59 percent and 38 percent respectively). Rates differed by region, with the North Central and West regions reporting lower rates than the Northeast and Southeast, and by race, with black and Hispanic respondents reporting lower rates than white respondents. A national analysis of 1995 and 1997 BRFSS data revealed that influenza and pneumoccal vaccination rates increased overall, but varied substantially by state (CDC, 1998c). Several factors were associated with receipt of the vaccinations. Persons aged 75 and over were more likely than those aged 65 to 74 years to report receipt of the vaccines. Non-Hispanic whites were more likely than Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks to have had the vaccines. Persons with more than a high school education, those with a checkup within the last year, and self-reported poor health status were more likely to have the immunizations. Data from the 1996 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey indicate that most beneficiaries aged 65 and over who had never received the pneumoccal vaccination did not think that they needed it; those who had not received a flu shot also did not know that they needed it, and were concerned about its safety and efficacy (CDC, 1999). In a phone survey of Iowa seniors 65 and over with chronic disease, residing in rural and urban areas (n = 787), 68 percent received a flu shot in the past year, 57 percent ever received pneumonia vaccination, and 44 percent received both vaccines at recommended levels (Petersen et al., 1999). Factors positively associated with receipt of the influenza vaccine were an education level greater than or equal to a high school degree, having a physician visit within the last year, current prescription medication use, and being a non-smoker. Factors positively associated with receipt of a pneumonia vaccination included age greater than or equal to 70 years, being married, currently working, having Medicare supplemental insurance, having a physician visit within the last year, current prescription medication use, and an increased number of target medical conditions. Receipt of the vaccines was not related to residence in a rural area."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of 1997 BRFSS Data", "text": "Consistent with their greater likelihood of receiving a routine medical checkup in the last two years, women are significantly more likely than men to have had their blood pressure taken by a health Differences between 1) rural non-adjacent women and men, 2) rural adjacent women and men, and 3) urban women and men are all significant at p< .001. professional in the past two years. None of the differences in blood pressure screening rates across urbanicity categories are significant.\nThe proportion of women who have had their blood cholesterol checked within the past five years is significantly higher (p < .001) than that of men in all three urbanicity categories (Table 7). Urban men are also significantly more likely than rural adjacent or rural non-adjacent men, and urban women are significantly more likely than rural adjacent or rural non-adjacent women, to have had a cholesterol check in the past 5 years.  (Potosky et al., 1998). Factors associated with lower rates of proctosigmoidoscopy include less education, younger age, and female gender (CDC, 1996;Potosky et al., 1998). The perception that colon cancer is a Aman=s disease,@ primary care providers= lack of awareness of updated guidelines, patients= lack of compliance with multiple screening tests and their fear of discomfort have been identified as barriers to women undergoing colorectal screening (Donovan and Syngal, 1998). Prior to 1998, Medicare only covered the FOBT, proctoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy for diagnosis and treatment, not for screening purposes. Coverage of these services for screening purposes was added on January 1, 1998. An annual FOBT is covered with no coinsurance or deductible. For beneficiaries 50 years and older, Medicare pays for a sigmoidoscopy every four years, subject to a 20 percent copayment and annual deductible. In addition, for persons at high risk, Medicare covers a screening colonoscopy every two years, also subject to the 20 percent copayment and deductible (Scanlon, 2000).\nThis analysis was based on all women and men aged 50 and over. Table 8 shows that women are more likely than men to have had a FOBT within the past year, but men are more likely to have had a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy within the past five years. By gender and urbanicity category, the percentage of the population that has had at least one of the recommended screening tests for colon cancer (either FOBT within the past year, or a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy within the past five years), ranges from 32.2 percent for rural non-adjacent women to 43.1 percent for urban men. Urban women are significantly less likely (p < .001) than urban men to have had at least one of the tests.  (Potosky, 1998). Several studies have found that lower income and lower education levels are associated with lower rates of Pap screening (National Cancer Institute, 1995;Calle et al., 1993;and Makuc et al., 1989). National Cancer Institute (1995) found that women over age 80 and women under age 65 without insurance had lower rates of Pap screening; Calle et al. (1993) found that women over age 65 were less likely to be screened. Makuc et al. (1989) also identified increasing age and white race as factors associated with not having a recent Pap screen. Potosky et al. (1998) found that, compared to those with managed care coverage, women under age 65 on Medicaid were significantly more likely to have a Pap screen and those without health insurance were significantly less likely. Black women and married women were more likely than white women and unmarried women to have been tested, and level of education was also significantly related to having a recent Pap screen. A study of rural female Medicare beneficiaries found that younger (65 to 69 years), college-educated, and non-widowed women were more likely to have Pap smears than women in other categories (Ives et al., 1996).\nThis analysis was based on women aged 18 and over who did not report having had a hysterectomy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends continued Pap testing of women who have had hysterectomies (Makuc et al., 1989); however, women with hysterectomies were excluded from this analysis to be consistent with CDC=s analyses of the BRFSS data (CDC, 1997). The BRFSS data do not include information on other aspects of a woman=s personal medical history that could affect a health care professional=s recommendations regarding the frequency of testing (e.g., a history of three previous normal screenings, or being at higher risk for cervical cancer because of exposure to human papillomavirus). Some research has suggested that women=s self-reports regarding timing of Pap smears may not be accurate, with women being more likely to overestimate how recently they had a Pap smear (Sawyer et al., 1989;Whitman et al., 1993). Consequently, the proportion of women who have had a test within the past year, past two years, and past three years are presented here. Differences in the rates of Pap screening by urbanicity are similar for testing in the past year, past two years, or past three years (Table 9). For all three time periods, both rural adjacent women and rural non-adjacent women are significantly less likely (p < .001) than urban women to have had a Pap test. \nBecause of the differences among guidelines regarding the age at which mammograms should begin and the frequency with which they should be done, two analyses were done. First, we examined the proportion of women aged 40 to 49 who reported having had a mammogram in the past two years. Second, we examined the proportion of women aged 50 and over who reported having had a mammogram in the past year. For women aged 40 to 49, both rural adjacent women and rural non-adjacent women are significantly less likely (p < .001) than urban women to have had a mammogram within the past two years (Table 10). Among women 50 years or older, both rural adjacent women and rural nonadjacent women are significantly less likely (p < .001) t han urban women to have had a mammogram within the past year; rural non-adjacent women are also significantly less likely (p< .05) to have had a mammogram than rural adjacent women.\nThis analysis was based on persons aged 65 and over in the fifteen states reporting data on influenza and pneumoccal vaccinations in 1997. The BRFSS does not have data needed to identify persons less than 65 years old who would be classified by USPSTF guidelines as being at high risk for influenza and pneumonia. Among persons aged 65 and over, there are no significant differences by gender or category of urbanicity in pneumonia vaccination rates (Table 11). There is only one statistically significant difference in flu shot rates: urban women are significantly less likely (p< .05) than urban men to have had a flu shot in the past year."}, {"section_title": "Cholesterol Screening", "text": "High blood cholesterol level is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States (CDC, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Mammograms", "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths (Janes et al., 1999).

For each model, the dependent variable was a yes/no variable indicating whether or not the respondent had received the recommended preventive service. The independent variables in the models included dummy va riables for category of urbanicity (rural non-adjacent, rural adjacent, and urban); level of education (elementary or some high school, high school graduate or GED, some college, and college graduate); income level (less than $25,000, $25,000 to $50,000, and more than $50,000 in annual household income); race/ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other); gender (if the test was appropriate for both women and men); health insurance coverage (uninsured, individually purchased insurance, employer-provided and other insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare); whether or not the respondent reported having a time in the past year when s/he could not afford a doctor visit; and census region (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South). Continuous variables in the models included age of the respondent and two health care market variables: the number of primary care physicians per 1000 population in the county and the number of mammography facilities per 1000 population in the county (for the two mammogr am models). Age was expected to be related to utilization of preventive services because the incidences of hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and cervical, colon and breast cancer increase with age.  Walker, 1996). Bivariate analyses of the relationship between age and utilization rates for some of the preventive services in this study indicated that the relationships between these variables were not linear, i.e., the relationships changed from positive to negative. Therefore, a squared term for the age variable was also included in the three Pap test models, the colon cancer screening model, and the mammogram model for women aged 50 and over, to account for non-linear relationships between age and utilization rates for these services. Flu shots and pneumonia vaccinations for persons aged 65 and over were the only preventive services in the study for which there were no statistically significant differences by category of urbanicity. At the time the data were collected, flu and pneumonia vaccinations were covered by the regular Medicare program without a copayment, thus the vast majority of persons aged 65 and over had access to them free of charge, regardless of whether they had supplemental coverage. In addition, the immunizations can be obtained in a range of settings in addition to physicians= offices, for example, in pharmacies and immunization clinics provided by public health nurses, consequently they are more accessible in rural areas than other preventive services that require use of specialists and/or specialized equipment, e.g., proctoscopies, sigmoidoscopies, or mammograms. Women and men aged 65 and over NS NS Table 13 presents the odds ratios for the significant independent variables across all models. The results of the tests of significance, beta coefficients, standard errors, and odds ratios for all of t he variables in each model are in Appendix A (Tables A-1 through A-11). In addition to rural-urban differences in preventive services utilization, Table 13 shows that there were statistically significant differences in utilization rates for certain preve ntive health services by education, income, race, gender, age, health insurance status, the ability to afford needed care, and census region. For the most part, the magnitude and direction of these differences were as expected and consistent with the results of previous research. Utilization rates were generally lower for respondents with lower levels of education and household income. For services recommended for both women and men, women were more likely than men to obtain any of the services except for colon cancer screening. Compared to white non-Hispanic respondents, black non-Hispanic respondents had higher utilization rates of all preventive services except for flu shots and pneumonia vaccinations. Consistent with our hypotheses, age had a significant positive effect in all the models, while the age squared variable had a significant negative effect in the models in which it was included. This means that the likelihood of obtaining the preventive service initially increased with increasing age, and then decreased. In comparison to respondents with employer-provided or other health insurance, uninsured individuals were much less likely to obtain the recommended services (odds ratios ranged from .30 to .48). Respondents who purchased their insurance individually were also less likely to obtain recommended services, as were individuals who reported having a time during the past year when they could not afford to see a physician (odds ratios ranged from .66 to .91). The Medicare variable was positive and significant in three models: the medical checkup, blood pressure screening, and colon cancer screening models. The Medicaid variable had a positive, statistically significant effect on utilization of three types of services: medical checkups, blood pressure screening, and Pap smear tests, probably reflecting the amount of contact that women on Medicaid are likely to have with health care providers for pregnancy-related services. Compared to respondents in the South Census Region, those in the Midwest had significantly lower utilization rates for several tests, e.g., checkup, blood pressure check, cholesterol, 3 year Pap test, and pneumonia vaccination. The Northeast and West Census Region variables had more mixed effects, with some rates significantly lower (e.g., blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing in the West and 3 year Pap test in the Northeast), and others significantly higher than the South (e.g., colon cancer screening in both the West and Northeast). The primary care physician to population variable was only statistically significant for two types of preventive services: colon cancer screening tests and Pap tests. The mammography facility to population variable was not statistically significant in either mammogram model."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Using 1997 BRFSS data, this study examined the likelihood of obtaining several key preventive health services in the time frame recommended by nationally accepted guidelines. The results indicate that rural residents are significantly less likely than urban residents to obtain certain preventive health services (even after controlling for demographic characteristics, health insurance status, and health care market characteristics) and are further behind in meeting the Healthy People 2010 National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention objectives. There are several possible explanations for the significant rural-urban differences that remain after controlling for these factors. First, there may be rural-urban differences in respondents= out-ofpocket costs for preventive services that affect preventive services utilization. The logistic models in this study controlled for household income, whether the respondent had any health insurance, their primary type of health insurance coverage, and whether or not the respondent had a time during the past year when s/he could not afford a doctor visit. However, we did not have information regarding coverage of the recommended preventive services, for example, whether each service was covered by the respondent=s insurance, and the dollar amounts of copayments and deductibles, if any, that applied to it. Deductibles and copayments have a significant negative influence on utilization of Pap smears, mammograms, and preventive counseling (Solanki and Schauffler, 1999). Among women and men aged 18 to 64 years old, higher levels of coverage for preventive care are associated with higher use of preventive services, including checkups, blood pressure screening, blood cholesterol tests, mammography, clinical breast exams, and Pap tests (Faulkner and Schauffler,1997). Rural persons in Missouri were found to be less likely than urban persons to have health insurance coverage for preventive services (Hagdrup, Simoes, and Brownson, 1997). Second, there may be rural-urban differences in respondents= access to medical care that were not adequately measured by the two health care market variables in our models, primary care physicians and mammogram facilities per 1000 population in the respondents= county of residence. The county-level data did not allow us to calculate the distance from an individual=s residence to a physician=s office or mammography facility, or whether the respondent had access to a mobile mammography unit. Some counties, especially in the western United States, cover large geographic areas, and residents of those counties may have a considerable distance to travel to medical care facilities, even within the county. Although several studies have identified physician recommendation as a significant factor in patients= decisions to obtain preventive services, we did not have information on whether respondents had been advised by their physician or another health care professional to obtain any of the services analyzed. Consequently, it was not possible to determine whether there were ruralurban differences in the proportion of respondents who have a physician=s recommendation to receive each preventive service. Finally, cultural barriers may also limit rural residents= use of preventive services. Several researchers have suggested that traditional rural values such as self-reliance, individualism, a preference for informal support networks, and reluctance to seek medical care unless seriously impaired by health problems, may make rural residents hesitant to seek preventive care services (Walker, Lucas, and Crespo, 1994;Reding et. al., 1997;Strickland and Strickland, 1996). The Medicare program has expanded coverage of several preventive health services in recent years. Most recently, the Balanced Budget Act increased coverage for breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening, an important step in reducing financial barriers to preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries. The Health Care Financing Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, other federal agencies, states, and community-based organizations are working in partnership to increase preventive service utilization by underserved populations, and have achieved some success in increasing utilization rates of breast and cervical cancer screening, in particular (CDC, 1998b;Scanlon, 2000;Vellozi, Romans, and Roghenberg, 1996). Efforts to increase preventive services utilization rates among rural populations need to build on these initiatives, as well as recognizing the special challenges that rural areas present in the delivery of health care services. The results of this study, along with previous research on programs to increase preventive health services utilization among underserved populations, indicate that strategies to increase rural preventive services utilization must reduce financial, geographic, and cultural barriers to care. In addition, efforts are needed to increase awareness of the importance of obtaining these preventive health services among rural populations and health care providers, and to ensure that follow-up diagnostic and treatment services are available to persons with abnormal test results.          . 3 Omitted category is income $25,000 to $50,000. 4 Omitted category is White non-Hispanic. 5 Omitted category is employer-provided insurance, military, and other health care coverage 6 Omitted category is South Census Region.
