We test the ability of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to simulate watershed-scale variability due to the LSNT, and we use the optimized model to simulate longterm fi eld N dynamics under related conditions. Autoregressive techniques and the automatic parameter calibration program PEST were used to show that RZWQM simulates signifi cantly lower nitrate concentration in discharge from LSNT treatments compared with areas receiving fall N fertilizer applications within the tile-drained Walnut Creek, Iowa, watershed (>5 mg N L \u22121 diff erence for the third year of the treatment, 1999). Th is result is similar to fi eld-measured data from a paired watershed experiment. A statistical model we developed using RZWQM simulations from 1970 to 2005 shows that early-season precipitation and early-season temperature account for 90% of the interannual variation in LSNT-based fertilizer N rates. Long-term simulations with similar average N application rates for corn (Zea mays L.) (151 kg N ha \u22121 ) show annual average N loss in tile fl ow of 20.4, 22.2, and 27.3 kg N ha \u22121 for LSNT, single spring, and single fall N applications. Th ese results suggest that (i) RZWQM is a promising tool to accurately estimate the water quality eff ects of LSNT; (ii) the majority of N loss diff erence between LSNT and fall applications is because more N remains in the root zone for crop uptake; and (iii) year-to-year LSNT-based N rate diff erences are mainly due to variation in early-season precipitation and temperature. A mong the most promising tools available for determining precise N requirements are soil mineral N tests (Schroder et al., 2000) . Th e pre-side-dress nitrate test (PSNT) combined with a split application of N was proposed by Magdoff et al. (1984) and has been found eff ective for determining if corn (Zea mays L.) will benefi t from side-dress N (Klapwyk and Ketterings, 2006; Bundy and Andraski, 1995) . Th e PSNT can help reduce N loss while maintaining acceptable corn yields (Sogbedji et al., 2000; Meisinger and Delgado, 2002) . Th e PSNT in the form of the latespring nitrate test (LSNT) was recommended for corn N fertilization in Iowa (Blackmer et al., 1997) . Th e LSNT protocol involves applying a nominal rate of N fertilizer before corn emergence followed by measuring residual soil nitrate in the top 30 cm of soil during early crop growth and side-dressing additional fertilizer based on soil nitrate concentrations."}, {"section_title": "Soil-Test N Recommendations", "text": "Although soil testing methods such as the LSNT are promising tools, adoption by farmers is limited because of little time between soil testing and fertilizer application; higher labor, equipment, and soil sampling costs; and potential prediction errors in N application rates. Much of the LSNT-determined N rate variability is weather related. Using the agricultural system model LEACHMN, Sogbedji et al. (2001) concluded that economic optimum N rates were minimally aff ected by fi eld variability from drainage class but strongly aff ected by annual variation in early-season precipitation. Field results confi rm that plant available N is most strongly infl uenced by rainfall early in the growing season (Kay et al., 2006) . Also, increasing soil temperature is usually associated with increasing soil organic matter decomposition (Kirschbaum, 1995) , and thus higher plant available N can be expected during years with higher early-season temperature. Agricultural system models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) can accurately simulate variation among year-to-year crop yield and fi eld N dynamics due to fl uctuations such as weather after thorough calibration (Ma et al., 2007b; Li et al., 2008; Th orp et al., 2007) . Th ese models may help our understanding of N rate predictions under long-term weather scenarios (Magdoff , 1991; Sogbedji et al., 2001) . Th erefore, application of thoroughly tested agricultural system models will increase our understanding of annual soil nitrate variation and help stimulate adoption of side-dress fertilizer management operations such as the LSNT. An experiment fi rst described by Jaynes et al. (2004) investigated the LSNT within a 366-ha subbasin of the tile-drained Walnut Creek watershed in Iowa. Th ey compared the LSNT to primarily fall applied N fertilizer treatments in adjacent subbasins. Th ese watershed data have been utilized previously for development, testing, and application of the agricultural systems models ADAPT and SWAT Saleh et al., 2007; Du et al., 2005) . Also, Bakhsh et al. (2004a,b) applied RZWQM to a nearby fi eld within the Walnut Creek watershed that did not include the LSNT subbasin.\nAgricultural system models continue to be used to quantify the management eff ects on nitrate fate. For example, ADAPT was used to evaluate the eff ect of timing and amount of N application in south-central Minnesota and central Iowa (Nangia et al., 2008; Gowda et al., 2008) ; DRAINMOD-NII was used to evaluate the eff ect of drainage design and management (Luo et al., 2010) ; RZWQM was used to evaluate the eff ect of N application rates in central Iowa (Bakhsh et al., 2004a; Th orp et al., 2007) ; and RZWQM was used as part of a larger study of several management practices to briefl y evaluate the eff ect of soil testing in northeastern Iowa . Missing from this research is watershed-scale testing and application of RZWQM and thorough evaluation of the model simulated response to the LSNT compared to fall applied N fertilizer.\nA common aspect of previous studies involving RZWQM is that the model was generally calibrated manually. Th is generally involves manually adjusting model parameters and then running long-term simulations to allow C/N pool sizes to equilibrate. Th is is performed in an iterative fashion to try to match model results with observed soil water, fi eld N dynamics, and plant growth for the period after C/N equilibration (Hanson et al., 1999) .\nAutomatic parameter estimation (calibration) programs such as PEST may be an improvement over manual calibration. Th ese methods specify an objective function based on data-model goodness-of-fi t where user-defi ned model parameters are automatically adjusted until the objective function reaches a minimum (e.g., Doherty, 2004; Doherty and Johnston, 2003) . Using automatic calibration methods such as PEST helps provide an objective, defensible, and repeatable way to calibrate models with many parameters (Rose et al., 2007) . Robust optimization packages also usually allow much easier, effi cient, and accurate model fi t to fi eld measurements than manual calibration (Doherty and Johnston, 2003) . Nolan et al. (2010b) used PEST to calibrate RZWQM for conditions that did not include artifi cially drained soils.\nOur objectives are to use fi eld data described by Jaynes et al. (2004) (i) to objectively calibrate RZWQM using the automatic parameter optimizer program PEST and compare the eff ects of the LSNT on nitrate leaching from RZWQMsimulated and observed data and (ii) to use the optimized model to investigate the long-term LSNT eff ects on fi eld N dynamics compared to single spring and fall N applications, which includes investigating the eff ects of year-to-year weather variability on LSNT-determined N application rates. Figure 1 shows the Walnut Creek watershed located in central Iowa (41\u00b055\u2032 to 42\u00b000\u2032 N; 93\u00b032\u2032 to 93\u00b045\u2032 W). Weather and cropping patterns have been monitored within the 5130-ha watershed since 1991. Details of the location, geology, soils, climate, land use, and farming practices are found in Hatfi eld et al. (1999a) and the associated references. Details of the LSNT-treatment and control subbasins within the watershed are found in Jaynes et al. (2004) ; we briefl y describe them here. Crop cover for fi elds in each subbasin were determined by ground surveys (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) , supervised classifi cation of Landsat photos -1999 USGS, http://landsat.usgs. gov), or cropland data layers (2000 USGS, http://landsat.usgs. gov), or cropland data layers ( -2007 USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2009 ). To avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the analysis and RZWQM simulations, we do not simulate fi elds with crops other than corn and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (e.g., alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.], oat [Avena sativa L.], and pasture)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field Experiment", "text": "Th e LSNT treatment was implemented for 4 yr (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) on 16 fi elds (300 ha) of a 366-ha subbasin within the larger watershed and designated TR1 to retain the terminology of Jaynes et al. (2004) . Simple corn-soybean rotations from 1991 through 2000 were practiced on 69% of the TR1 area (TR1_CS for corn in 1997; TR1_SC for soybean in 1997). Including three more fi elds with some years of consecutive corn before 1997 ( Supplementary Table 1SI ) represents 99% of TR1 long-term management. In 2001, several fi elds categorized as TR1_CS and TR1_SC planted a second consecutive year of corn ( Fig. 2) , which we assumed had little eff ect on our simulations.\nTh e adjacent subbasins CN1 and CN2 were selected as controls for a paired watershed research design. We use CN2 for the calibration watershed for reasons listed below. Crop rotations for 39 fi elds within CN2 (715 ha) were identifi ed. Cornsoybean rotations from 1991 through 2000 were practiced on 491 ha (69%) of CN2, which we categorized CN2_CS and CN2_SC. Including four more fi elds with some years of consecutive corn ( Supplementary Table 1SI ) represent 82% of CN2.. Fifty-four hectares of CN2 practiced simple corn-soybean rotations through 1999 but changed in 2000 to continuous corn, continuous soybean, or undetermined. Assuming this change had little eff ect on our simulations results in six rotations representing 89% of CN2 long-term management.\nFarmers in CN2 were assumed to add N fertilizer in the fall at 165 kg N ha \u22121 before the 1999 corn planting seasons (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) and 185 kg N ha \u22121 thereafter (Jaynes et al., 2004) . When a second consecutive year of corn was planted, we assumed 200 kg N ha \u22121 fertilizer application. Th e LSNT program consisted of applying 56 kg N ha \u22121 shortly before planting. Around late May to mid-June, soil samples were taken and analyzed for nitrate content to determine the required rate of N to apply by side-dressing. Nitrogen fertilizer rates were calculated using the formula y = 1.121 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 (25 -x) (Blackmer et al., 1997) , where x is the average nitrate concentration (mg N ha \u22121 ) in the soil, y is the N fertilizer rate in kg N ha \u22121 , the factor 8 is considered a fi rst approximation for the conversion rate between fertilizer N application and resulting soil N concentration, 25 is the required soil N concentration for full yield, and 1.121 converts the recommendation from pound per acre to kilogram per hectare. Th e total N rates determined with the LSNT (measured soil nitrate concentration, x) for 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 were 168, 118, 174, and 96 kg N ha \u22121 . Rates and timing of N application for TR1 before 1997 and after 2000 were assumed to be the same as the two control watersheds.\nTo confi rm that the LSNT program was meeting plant N requirements, 12 to 16 row check strips were strategically placed within a very small fraction of subbasin TR1 to determine corn yield under diff erent N application strategies. One strip received only the preplant application of approximately 56 kg N ha \u22121 (MIN), whereas another received a nonlimiting N rate (>220 kg N ha \u22121 ; NLIM). A third strip received the LSNT rate. Details on the procedure to analyze corn response to LSNT in the Walnut Creek watershed are found in Karlen et al. (2005) .\nTh e fi elds within each subbasin were extensively drained by subsurface tiles that had been installed over the past 120 yr. Th e fi eld tiles drained into subsurface drainage district pipes that drained each subbasin. Th e partially submerged district drains were instrumented to measure fl ow rate as they emptied into Walnut Creek (Fig. 1 ) by simultaneously measuring water depth and velocity using Flowtote meters (Marsh-McBirney, Frederick, MD). Water samples were taken manually once a week at the fl ow gauge on each subbasin and automatically during runoff events. All water samples were refrigerated until analysis. Nitrate was analyzed by quantitative reduction to NO 2 and measuring the NO 2 concentration colorimetrically with a Lachat Autoanalyzer (Zellweger Analytics, Lachat Instrument Division, Milwaukee, WI). Th e method had a quantitation limit of 1.0 mg N L -1 as NO 3 . Flow-weighted average NO 3 concentrations were computed by summing the product of the weekly/daily NO 3 concentration and total weekly/daily discharge."}, {"section_title": "RZWQM Description", "text": "Th e RZWQM simulates water infi ltration into the soil matrix using the Green-Ampt equation and water redistribution using the Richards' equation.

Nitrogen is released as NH 4 during the decay process and may be nitrifi ed to NO 3 . Figure 3 shows the eff ect of temperature and water-fi lled pore space on the decay rate coeffi cient (k i ) for fast humus, where k i increases with increasing temperature and is highest with P \u03b8 of 59% (see Eq.\n[1])."}, {"section_title": "Model Input and Optimization", "text": "Meteorological model input included daily minimum and maximum temperatures, wind speed, solar radiation, relative humidity, and hourly precipitation. Nitrate and NH 4 ions were added to precipitation at concentrations of 1.0 and 0.5 mg L \u22121 (0.23 and 0.39 mg N L \u22121 ), which are the approximate average annual concentrations for Iowa (from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program website, http://nadp.sws. uiuc.edu/). To reduce spatial variation eff ects caused by selecting one gauge for rainfall input, we used the median weekly rainfall as the most representative gauge for rainfall input to RZWQM from several gauges throughout the watershed (e.g., Hatfi eld et al., 1999b). Th e \"representative\" rain gauge was used for each week's RZWQM breakpoint rainfall input. Solar radiation and humidity were checked using procedures described by Allen (1996) . Th ese included comparing hourly relative humidity against 100%. Daily solar radiation was compared against clear sky radiation and monthly solar radiation compared to temperature estimated radiation. From the two Walnut Creek watershed weather stations where data were collected, the radiation and humidity values that best refl ected these quality checks were used for RZWQM input. In addition, solar radiation was included from the Iowa Environmenal Mesonet station west of Ames, IA (http://mesonet.agron. iastate.edu; 42\u00b01\u2032 N, 93\u00b047\u2032 W). Th e weather data quality control procedure is described more thoroughly in Malone et al. (2010) .\nTh e main components of RZWQM include hydrology, nutrient dynamics, and plant growth. Most of the input parameters were the same or similar to Th orp et al. (2007) and/or Ma et al. (2008) . Parameters that were adjusted from these values or RZWQM default are listed in Table 1 and Supplementary  Table 2SI . \"Adjusted parameters\" (e.g., saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ksat; Supplementary Table 2SI ) were manually or PEST adjusted before the fi nal model optimization described below; brief justifi cations for the fi nal values are reported in the table comments. One reason important soil parameters such as Ksat and air-entry pressure were not included in the formal PEST optimization is that the RZWQM solution to Richards' equation failed to converge with certain combinations of soil parameters. Numerical approximation is required to solve Richards' equation due its nonlinearity, the complex nature of pressure head-hydraulic conductivity-water content relations, and the heterogeneous nature of soil systems. A robust solution to Richards' equation is desirable but not currently possible for certain reasonable sets of constitutive relations, parameter values, and environmental conditions (e.g., Miller et al., 1998) .\nTh e subbasin CN2 was used for optimization because it had similar annual proportions of corn and soybean as TR1 in the LSNT treatment years (1997 Fig. 2) and we wanted to avoid using the LSNT subasin (TR1) for calibration. Optimized parameters determined from CN2 were used for TR1; thus only management (N application and crop rotations) changed among RZWQM simulated subbasins.\nData have been collected on all three subbasins through the present, but we terminate the calibration and testing at July 2001 (2001.5) because several fi elds transitioned to continuous corn in 2001 (Fig. 2) . If we continued model testing after 2001.5, several more fi elds would have to be simulated and composited, which for our objectives would unnecessarily complicate the analysis. We use a decimal system to briefl y designate monthly results and to force January and December to have their fractional parts as 0.0 and 0.9. We used the parameter estimation software PEST for RZWQM optimization in conjunction with the PEST utility software PAR2PAR and TSPROC (Doherty, 2004; Doherty and Johnston, 2003) . In estimating model parameter values, PEST minimized a multicriteria objective function composed of four components representing diff erent observation groups. Th ese were the summed weighted squared diff erences between observed and RZWQM simulated monthly water quality values from 1993 to 2001.5 and 1997 to 2000 annual corn yield, specifi cally (i) monthly N loss in drain fl ow, (ii) monthly drain fl ow amount, (iii) monthly fl ow-weighted nitrate concentration (FWNC) in drain fl ow, and (iv) annual corn yield from the nonlimiting and minimum (NLIM and MIN) N treatments. Th e use of multiple criteria must be accompanied by a suitable selection of relative weights (w i ) when calculating the overall objective function. Weights were chosen so that no criterion was allowed to dominate the objective function: 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.015 were used for N loss, drain fl ow, FWNC, and corn yield, respectively. We also removed monthly N loss, drain fl ow amount, and FWNC from the optimization for months with very low drain fl ow (e.g., <1.0 mm) by selecting a weighing function of zero for those months. Th e Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg optimization methodology that underlies PEST and similar programs has been criticized for being too easily trapped in local objective function minima.\nUsing an objective function that combines multiple criteria and suitable relative weights reduces the problem of local minima (Doherty and Johnston, 2003) . Th e objective function [\u03a6(\u03b2)] based on parameter set (\u03b2) can be summarized as ( ) \nwhere subscript i = monthly or annual ith observation, O = observed values, P = simulated values, w = observation weights, subscript nl = N loss, subscript df = drainfl ow, subscript nc = fl ow-weighted nitrate concentration, subscript cy = corn yield, and n1-4 = number of observations associated with each observation group. Input parameters formally calibrated by PEST were soil root growth factors for corn at four depths (15-30, 30-45, 45-60, and 60-90 cm) , the four interpool transformation coeffi cients for the organic matter pools, the lateral hydraulic gradient, and the pore-size distribution index for the surface three horizons. Model parameters for diff erent components (crop growth, hydrology, N dynamics) were optimized simultaneously because they interact. For example, N uptake by corn is often the largest component of the annual nitrogen budget, and N uptake is sensitive to both N mineralization and root growth factors.\nWe used the utility PAR2PAR together with PEST to keep root growth factors for deeper layers less than shallower layers, to maintain pore size distribution index within a factor of 0.7 to 1.4 for adjacent soil layers, and to adjust soil parameters that are calculated on the basis of pore size distribution index (e.g., unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters). We used the PEST utility TSPROC to process the daily RZWQM simulated runoff and tile drainage from the corn and soybean fi elds of the control subbasin (CN2_CS and \nwhere T is daily tile fl ow amount (cm) or N loss in tile fl ow (kg N ha \u22121 ), RO is daily runoff amount (cm) or N loss in runoff (kg N ha \u22121 ), i represents the crop rotation (e.g., CN2_CS or CN2_ SC), n is the number of rotations (e.g., 2), and f is the fraction of subbasin area in a given rotation (0.526 for CN2_SC and 0.474 for CN2_CS). Note that the fractions were determined as CN2 area in SC or CS divided by sum of area in SC and CS [e.g., 258/(258+233)]. Monthly values for DFX were then computed followed by monthly FWNC in drain fl ow {[(N loss in drainfl ow, kg N ha \u22121 ) \u00d710]/ drainfl ow amount, cm}. We use the term drain fl ow as the sum of subsurface (tile) drainage and runoff because the watershed samples included both, which was partly due to the many surface inlets into the subsurface drainage system. Annual simulated runoff was sensitive to snowmelt; therefore, before the fi nal formal PEST optimization we adjusted the fraction of infi ltrated snowmelt to 0.7 (default was 0.8) to achieve accurate simulated annual runoff compared to runoff calculated using hydrograph separation at the exit of the 5130-ha watershed.\nTo summarize, our optimization scheme involved:\n1. PEST adjusted the user-defi ned model parameters; 2. PAR2PAR calculated the appropriate RZWQM parameters based on PEST parameter adjustments in step 1; 3. RZWQM input fi les were updated for the six scenarios (CN2_CS, CN2_SC, NLIM_CS, NLIM_SC, MIN_CS, MIN_SC); 4. RZWQM was run for each scenario from 1985 to 2001; 5. daily model output for nitrate N loss in tile fl ow, N loss in runoff , tile fl ow amount, and runoff amount was converted to monthly values for CN2_CS and CN2_SC using the PEST utility TSPROC; 6. monthly simulated values of step 5 were used to proportionally compute composite N loss in drain fl ow and drain fl ow amount using Eq.\n[2]; 7. the weighted objective function was computed; and 8. steps 1-7 were repeated until optimization criteria met. Nolan et al. (2010a, b) discusses application of PEST to optimize RZWQM in more detail.\nOne of the advantages of optimizing RZWQM parameters using PEST is effi ciency. Formal calibration of 12 parameters required less than 300 parameter perturbations. Running the six scenarios for a parameter set requires about 15 min or 75 h for 300 parameter perturbations. Nolan et al. (2010a) discusses further application of PEST with RZWQM simulations such as parameter sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of RZWQM predictions."}, {"section_title": "Model Performance and Testing", "text": "Compositing only two RZWQM simulated rotations for PEST optimization of water quality and hydrology output (CN2_SC and CN2_CS) resulted in acceptable calibrations and covered 69% of the watershed management. Including more fi elds would have added considerable time and complexity to the PEST optimization. To test calibrated model performance however, four to six rotations per watershed were composited ( Supplementary Table 1SI ). Two rotations for each subbasin were simple corn-soybean rotations with corn in even or odd years. We composited the daily simulated tile drainage and runoff from each subbasin proportionally using a modification of Eq.\n[2] and then computed the monthly value.\nTo evaluate the calibrated RZWQM simulated hydrology, nitrate loss, and nitrate concentration for 1993 to 2001 across the two subbasins, we use the quantitative statistics Nash-Sutcliff e effi ciency (EF), percent bias (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR):\nwhere \u014c is the mean observed values, P i is the model estimated values, O i is the observed values, and n is the number of data pairs. Model simulations can be considered satisfactory under a monthly time step if (Moriasi et al., 2007) : EF > 0.5, RSR < 0.7, PBIAS is within \u00b125% for streamfl ow, and PBIAS is within \u00b170% for N loss. Th e values of RMSE and EF when model estimates perfectly match observed data are 0 and 1.0, respectively. An EF value less than zero indicates that the average of observed measurements was a better estimator than the model. We will only briefl y discuss hydrology and crop simulations. Our main purpose in the model testing is to determine if RZWQM responds to LSNT treatments compared to fall N application. Th erefore, we briefl y report and discuss model comparisons to observed data such as the individual treatment drain fl ow, crop production, and nitrate loss, but the observed and RZWQM simulated FWNC diff erence between LSNT and control watershed is the most important comparison.\nOne method to examine paired watershed data was described by Jaynes et al. (2004 Jaynes et al. ( , 2001 . We modifi ed this to determine if RZWQM responded to LSNT (TR1) compared to the control watershed (CN2). Our adaption of this method involved fi tting a Gompertz function to both the RZWQM and the observed diff erence in monthly FWNC between the LSNT and control subbasin. A Gompertz function describes a time series with asymptotic decline or growth, nitrate concentration diff erences in our case. We also included an autoregressive (AR) residual component to correct for the eff ects of residual autocorrelation. Nonlinear regression was used to fi t the Gompertz function to the nitrate concentration diff erences. A lag1 residual AR component was added to this trend and the combined model simultaneously fi tted to the data using an iterative least squares method and \"Fair\" weighting to reduce outlier eff ects (e.g., Heiberger and Becker, 1992) . Residual lag values were assumed missing at the start of the time sequence and after breaks in the time series caused by periods of low drain fl ow (<1 mm mo -1 ).\nTh e Gompertz function with the AR residual component can be described by the following:\nwhere A is the upper boundary, C is the diff erence between the lower and upper boundary, b is the rate of monthly N concentration decline (mg N L \u22121 mo \u22121 ), x is the number of months since December 1992 (in January 1993, x = 1), m is the month of maximum decrease (x = 50 to 70), a1 is the lag1 residual coeffi cient, and r is the residual or error."}, {"section_title": "Long-Term RZWQM Simulations", "text": "Th e fi eld experiments for this research compared the LSNT protocol to primarily fall-applied N fertilizer (Jaynes et al., 2004) .

Th e 150.7 kg N ha \u22121 rate was chosen for fall and spring application rates because it was the average RZWQM determined LSNT rate from the long-term simulations. Fertilizer was applied as injected anhydrous ammonia. Historical weather data near the watershed were used for the simulations (1 Jan. 1960 through 31 Dec. 2005 . Although the model runs began in 1960, N mass balance and regression analysis used only the model results from 1970 through 2005, which allowed time for soil C/N initialization. To help improve our understanding of the relationship between long-term LSNT rate and weather variables before soil testing, multivariate regression was performed using temperature and rainfall as predictors and LSNT rate determined by RZWQM from 1970 through 2005 as the dependent variable. Th e regression analysis included power and interactive weather predictors (e.g., temperature \u00d7 precipitation, temperature 0.1 , precipitation 3 ). Power regression was used because weather variables such as temperature and precipitation may have a nonlinear eff ect on N application rate determined from soil testing. Th e interaction terms were included because variables such as precipitation may aff ect soil determined N rate diff erently at high and low temperature. We used stepwise, k-fold cross-validation, and leave-one-out cross-validation for selection of variables. Th e fi nal set of variables is mechanisti-cally plausible and tested using both k-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation.\nTh e k-fold was used in the event of serial correlation of weather variables used in the regression (temperature and precipitation), where the data were split into 6 blocks of 30 observations for model calibration and 6 omitted values for model validation. Th e data used for cross-validation were 1970 to 2005 RZWQM predicted N rate and the predictands for the regression equation (see predictand defi nition below). Th e equation with the fi nal set of included variables produced the lowest predictand residual sum of squares (cross-validation PRESS statistic) and lowest mean square error (MSE) for all the steps in the regression procedure. Predictand is the predicted value for the observations omitted from the calibration blocks. Th e 6 validation blocks for k-fold were 1970 to 1975, 1976 to 1981, 1982 to 1987, 1988 to 1993, 1994 to 1999, and 2000 to 2005. Th is cross-validation technique is described more thoroughly in .\nMultivariate regression, nonlinear regression, and crossvalidation were performed using SAS v. 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Testing: Yield", "text": "Corn yield was simulated within 500 kg ha \u22121 (\u00b15%) of observed values for 11 of 12 observations. Th ese corn yield calibration scenarios included the three diff erent N application types (LSNT, NLIM, MIN) over the 4-yr period of the LSNT treatment (1997 Fig. 4a) . Th e average observed and RZWQM annual yield diff erence between minimum (MIN) and LSNT-determined N application were 994 and 1234 kg ha \u22121 , confi rming that RZWQM corn yield predictions responded to N application rates. Th e least-accurate simulation was for 1998 NLIM, which is underpredicted by about 1200 kg ha \u22121 . Th e 1998 June rainfall was the second-highest monthly precipitation next to the fl ood year of July 1993. Both July 1993 and June 1998 received more than 30 cm of precipitation. Th e poor RZWQM-predicted corn yield in 1998 is attributed to simulation of excessive water logging. Th e crop yield simulations from 1990 to 2000 suggest that RZWQM accurately responded to yearly weather eff ects (Fig.  4b) . Th e simulated yield is presented along with the average annual crop yield for Story County, Iowa (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2009). Among the least-accurate simulations was 1998 corn yield, which was underpredicted by about 1000 kg ha \u22121 (Fig. 4b) . Th e soybean yield was simulated fairly well, with the largest discrepancy in 1993, where yield was overpredicted by 632 kg ha \u22121 (Fig. 4b) . Th e simulated and observed corn yield in 1993 was very low because of excessive rain (64 cm precipitation for May-July); unlike the RZWQM-maize model, the RZWQM-soybean model does not simulate water logging."}, {"section_title": "Model Testing: Drain Flow", "text": "Th e annual average simulated and observed drain fl ows for the three watersheds were within 3 cm of each other (1993-2001.5 ; Table 2 , Fig. 5 ).

(2007; EF = 0.78), where the management was better known and the soil more homogenous. We adjusted the snowmelt infi ltration factor to optimize surface runoff , which results in good simulated average annual runoff of 5.4 cm with an EF of 0.86 for 1992 through 2001; average observed runoff was 5.6 cm (more detailed runoff results not shown).\nFor the most part, the model adequately responded to monthly drain fl ow with an EF of 0.62 and 0.84 for TR1 and CN2 (Table 2) . Supplementary Fig. 1SI shows TR1 monthly drain fl ow; note that TR1 had the lowest EF. An EF of 0.5 can be considered acceptable for monthly drain fl ow (Moriasi et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Model Testing: Nitrogen", "text": "Th e annual and monthly N loss in subsurface drain fl ow was simulated acceptably for TR1 and CN2 with PBIAS within \u00b120%, EF >0.5, and RSR <0.7 (Table 2; Fig. 5 ). Th e annual and monthly FWNC in subsurface drain fl ow showed little bias (< \u00b111%). But the EF was <0.1 and the RSR was >0.9 for both watersheds (Table 2) . Although the EF is low, it is higher than other recent RZWQM evaluations where the specifi c management was more precisely known and soils more homogenous (e.g., Th orp et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008) . Despite low EF values, Li et al. (2008) and Th orp et al. (2007) concluded that the calibrated model was acceptable for estimating the relative eff ects of diff erent management under diff erent conditions on nitrate loss in subsurface drainage.\nTh e annual and monthly FWNC simulations with the lowest EF was CN2 (Table 2) and among the least-accurate simulated FWNC for this watershed was 1996.8 (Fig. 5) . Although the N loss and FWNC were underpredicted in 1996.8 for TR1, CN2 appears the more inaccurate (Fig. 5 ). We simulated spring N application for all watersheds in 1997 rather than fall 1996 applications because of the wet conditions (Jaynes et al., 2004) . Some fi elds may have received fall N application, which would increase the simulated FWNC and N loss. Th e observed FWNC and N loss suggest that CN2 had management that resulted in higher N loss than TR1.\nAnother poorly simulated FWNC for both watersheds was 1999.8 (Fig. 5) . Th e observed and simulated drain fl ow was <3 cm in 1999.8 (Fig. 5 ). For the most part, the poor simulated FWNC was caused by the highest monthly drain fl ow of 1999.8 to be simulated snowmelt in 2000.08 (February 2000) when the monthly simulated FWNC was zero ( Supplementary  Fig. 1SI ). Figure 6 shows the monthly time series of paired nitrate concentration diff erences for the watersheds. Th e Gompertz function with the AR residual component accounted for more than 70% of the variation in observed and RZWQM simulated concentration diff erences ( Supplementary Table 3SI ). Figure  7 also shows that for the most part, annual RZWQM simulations responded to FWNC diff erences compared with the observed diff erences (R 2 = 0.62). Th e poorest simulated annual diff erence was because snowmelt in 2000.08 drives the annual RZWQM simulated FWNC; therefore, little simulated difference was found between the two subbasins. Th e 2000.08 FWNC diff erence is not shown on Fig. 6 because the observed drain fl ow for CN2 was <1 mm for this month. Th e criteria for an observation to be included in the monthly analysis were that all three simulated and observed subbasins produce more than 1mm/month of drain fl ow."}, {"section_title": "Model Testing: Nitrate Concentration Diff erence between LSNT and Control Watershed (TR1-CN2)", "text": "One notable item for the period before implementation of the LSNT is that RZWQM overpredicted the FWNC difference in TR1-CN2 (Fig. 6, 7) . From our knowledge of the watershed management, TR1 should have a somewhat higher annual FWNC than both CN2 and CN1 because it averages 58% of area in corn from 1992 through 1996, whereas CN1 and CN2 averaged <52% (Fig. 2) . Th is suggests that soil and/ or N application rate and/or timing are diff erent between TR1 and CN2.\nAfter 1998.3, the 95% confi dence bands for the Gompertz function did not include the null hypothesis that the RZWQM simulated concentration diff erences were equal to the averages before LSNT implementation, which indicates a signifi cant decrease in TR1 nitrate concentration due to the LSNT treatment (0.64 mg N L \u22121 for TR1-CN2; Fig.  6b ). Jaynes et al. (2004) reported similar timing for observed diff erences. Our observed 95% confi dence bands did not go above \u22122.0 (TR1-CN2) after 1998.25 (results not shown). Th us, as Jaynes et al. (2004) reported for the observed data, for the most part the RZWQM simulated nitrate concentration coming from LSNT-treated watershed can be considered signifi cantly lower than nitrate concentration coming from the control watershed after the latter half of 1998. Th erefore, RZWQM is a promising tool for predicting the water quality eff ects of LSNT implementation in watersheds.\nTh e 95% confi dence bands from the simulated diff erences approach zero after 1998.5 partly because of runoff or snowmelt (e.g., 2001 .25) the preceding month. High simulated runoff or snowmelt results in a high residual value between the RZWQM value and the Gompertz function (e.g., 2001.17; Fig. 6) . Th is in turn results in a high upper confi dence band the following month due to the high lag1 autoregressive residual component. For simplicity, we did not include simulated basefl ow in our drainfl ow computations and RZWQM predicts nearly no N loss under runoff . Th e observed watershed measurements on the other hand included basefl ow, which would tend to show diff erences between treatments.\nAnother reason for the high upper confi dence bands after 1998.5 was that RZWQM-simulated nitrate concentration diff erences tend to be lower than observed in the spring and summer and higher than observed in the fall and winter. Th ese simulated diff erences also result in a high residual error with Eq.\n[7] (r x ). For example, RZWQM simulated concentration diff erences between 1998.75 through 1999.17 are much higher than observed (and Eq. [7] predicted), whereas diff erences from 1999.3 through 1999.5 are much lower than observed and much lower than Eq. [7] predicted (Fig. 6) . A high r x component of Eq.\n[7] for a specifi c observation results in a wide confi dence interval for that observation. Overpredicted winter nitrifi cation by RZWQM was previously reported (Ma et al., 2007b; . Th is causes RZWQM to simulate deeper peak soil nitrate than fi eld observations for the springsummer when N fertilizer is fall applied . Th erefore, RZWQM simulates acceptable annual diff erences between LSNT N applications and fall N applications except when runoff and snowmelt are driving annual FWNC (e.g., 1999.8;  Fig. 6, 7) ; however, the timing of monthly simulated diff erences are less accurate than desired."}, {"section_title": "Application of the Tested Model: Long-Term LSNT Treatment Eff ect", "text": "We used the calibrated model to simulate the average 1970 to 2005 plant available nitrogen (NH 4 and NO 3 ) budget for three treatments: LSNT, average LSNT rate applied at planting, and average LSNT rate applied in the fall after harvest (Table 3) . We used the specifi c LSNT determined rate each year for the LSNT simulations; the average of these variable RZWQM simulated LSNT determined rates from 1970 to 2005 was 150.7 kg N ha \u22121 . Th ese simulations indicate that LSNT lost 1.8 kg ha \u22121 less N (\u223c8%) in tile drainage than the single spring application with <1% corn-yield diff erence (Table 3) . Th e simulated tile drainage N diff erence between LSNT and single fall application was much larger at 6.9 kg N ha \u22121 with about 1% corn yield diff erence. Th e N budget suggests that LSNT has slightly greater N uptake by crops than fall or single spring applications (1.4-5.4%). Th is contributes to substantially less percentage N loss in tile drainage (8.8 to 33.8%) due to more N remaining in the root zone for crop N uptake during the growing season under LSNT. Similarly, Malone and Ma (2009) reported that 4% greater crop N uptake results in 30% less N in subsurface drainage in northeastern Iowa. In contrast to these modeling results, the analysis on the fi eld data from this study did not quantify the water quality benefi t of soil testing compared to single spring N applications (e.g., Jaynes et al., 2004) .\nWe used the same long-term average N rate for the three treatments. Th e average annual rate may diff er, however, between corn fi elds with soil testing and fi elds with no soil test. If average annual N rates were lower for LSNT, N loss would be less. In the Corn Belt, for example, about 17% of corn acres were tested for soil nitrogen during 1996 to 2001. About 4% less nitrogen was applied on those fi elds than the average for corn fi elds not tested (Kim and Quinby, 2004) . In Iowa, about 6% less nitrogen was applied to fi elds with soil N tests during 1996 to 2005 (USDA Agricultural Resource 106.9 \u2020 Each treatment is the average of two rotations (corn in odd years and corn in even years).

Small changes in nitrogen-containing fertilizer use (e.g., adjusted according to annual soil testing) may substantially reduce nitrate delivery to the Gulf of Mexico (McIsaac et al., 2001) .\nAlthough lower N fertilizer rates are often recommended with the LSNT, implementing the program within the Walnut Creek watershed costs about $5 ha \u22121 yr \u22121 (Saleh et al., 2007) . Th is additional cost partly explains why only about 12% of corn fi elds in Iowa were tested for soil nitrogen in 2005 (USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey, http:// www.ers.usda.gov/Data/ARMS/app/Crop.aspx). Part of the higher LSNT cost is due to soil sampling (Saleh et al., 2007) . An improved understanding of the year-to-year variability of soil mineral N could lead to a reduced need for soil testing and help increase adoption of side dressing.\nTo explore the relationship between LSNT rate and weather variables before soil testing, we developed the following crossvalidated equation that accounts for 90% of the variation in 1970 to 2005 RZWQM-simulated annual LSNT rate (Nrate; Fig. 8) :\nwhere etemp is early season average maximum temperature for (date -10) > doy > (date -64), doy is day of year, date is LSNT sample date (doy), and eprecip is the total early season precipitation for (date + 1) > doy > (date -28). Th e equation was developed as discussed above in \"Long-Term RZWQM Simulations\" and by systematically adjusting the timing of eprecip and etemp for weather variable calculation similar to , which minimized the variance between annual RZWQM simulated rate and Eq.\n[8] predicted Nrate.\nIn addition to the excellent correlation between Eq.\n[8] and RZWQM simulated LSNT rates, Eq. [8] also accounts for 76% of the variation in 1997 to 2000 observed LSNT rates determined by fi eld soil testing (Fig. 8) . Th e lowest LSNT rates for observed and Eq. [8] were in 2000 and the highest rates were in 1999. Th e least-accurate Eq. [8] determined N rate compared to fi eld observations was in 1998 when the diff erence between the two values was 28 kg N ha \u22121 . Th e large 1998 diff erence between Eq. [8] using observed versus RZWQM estimated sampling dates (Fig. 8) was because of the high early June rainfall (16.4 cm for 1-14 June); the observed RZWQMsimulated sampling dates were 27-28 May and 14 June, respectively. Th is all suggests potential for development of simple tools to estimate side-dressing rates, which could reduce the need for soil testing. Figure 9a illustrates the relationship among early-season precipitation and temperature (eprecip, etemp), and LSNT rate estimated using Eq. [8]. For example, Nrate increases as etemp decreases and eprecip increases. Although interpreting the dependence of rate on the interaction between etemp and eprecip is possible with Fig. 9a, Fig. 9b helps clarify this interaction. Th e variable eprecip aff ected Nrate positively at high etemp but slightly less so at low etemp, and Nrate remained higher throughout the range of eprecip when etemp was low (Fig. 9b) . Th is is supported by the slightly smaller slope of the linear trend through the Eq. [8] computed values under low etemp compared with high etemp (Fig. 9b ). Under the condition of high eprecip compared with low eprecip, Nrate remained higher and less aff ected by etemp ( Fig. 9b ) due to more leaching of crop available N.\nOur long-term modeling results confi rm other modeling and fi eld research. Using the LEACHMN model, Sogbedji et al. (2001) reported that lower economic optimum N application rates were associated with low early-season precipitation due to less denitrifi cation and leaching. Th is agrees with Kay et al. (2006) , where fi eld measurements were used to report that increasing early-season rainfall result in less plant available nitrogen. Increasing soil temperature is usually associated with increasing soil organic matter decomposition (e.g., Kirschbaum, 1995; Eq. [1], Fig. 3 ), and thus higher plant available nitrogen during years with higher early-season temperature. Of course, higher early-season temperature also contributes to increased soil evaporation and reduced tile fl ow, and thus higher temperature contributes to reduced N leaching below the root zone."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results suggest that N fertilizer rates determined from the LSNT protocol are strongly correlated with early-season air temperature and precipitation. Th is conclusion should be treated as an impetus for further research. However, we have demonstrated that a cross-validated statistical model based on early season weather variables could be developed that predicts year-to-year variation in central Iowa LSNT-determined N fertilizer rates. Further refi nement of this model may lead to simple tools that will enhance implementation of the LSNT by farmers, which could be of economic and environmental signifi cance.\nDevelopment of the statistical model used long-term simulations from the agricultural system model RZWQM, which was thoroughly tested using observed data from the Walnut Creek watershed in central Iowa. Th e long-term simulations suggest that the N loss diff erence between LSNT, single spring, and single fall applications is mainly from more N remaining in the root zone for crop uptake. Th e model testing suggests that RZWQM is a promising tool for predicting the water quality eff ects of LSNT implementation in watersheds."}]
