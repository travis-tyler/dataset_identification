The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed a comprehensive framework to ensure no one is left behind. Specifically, targets within SDG4 (Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning) state that children should have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education, including the experience of positive and stimulating learning environments. These targets were set in response to numerous studies pointing to the importance of the early years for all areas of child development. Stakeholders, such as policymakers or national and international organizations active in the field of educational research, are increasingly recognizing early education of children as a prospective field of action (OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development], 2012; Stancel-Pi\u0105tak & Hencke, 2014), indicating a need for further research into the factors contributing to improving children's learning outcomes. Acquisition of early literacy skills is crucial for child development and achievement in reading literacy (Bingham, 2007;NELP [National Early Literacy Panel], 2008;Shanahan & Lonigan 2010), and reading literacy provides a foundation for skill acquisition in other content areas (Anders et al., 2012;Doig, McCrae, & Rowe, 2003). Parents and preschools can both contribute to enhancing children's development by implementing early learning activities (Gelfand & Teti, 1990;Hart & Risley, 2003;NELP, 2008;Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Arora, 2012a;Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Drucker, 2012b;Murray, 1997;Murray & Cooper, 1997;Webster-Stratton & Hammond, 1988). Although children from socially and economically disadvantaged families may benefit from greater developmental support, they may also have less access to stimulating learning activities than their more advantaged peers (Farkas & Beron, 2004;Raikes et al., 2006). A positive nurturing environment at home or in institutionalized early childhood education and care settings has been found to be important for child development, in particular the role of early learning in promoting good outcomes in later schooling and mitigating the learning gaps between socially disadvantaged and advantaged children. In this brief, we present results from in-depth analysis using international large-scale assessment data, which demonstrate that social inequalities and their relationship to learning outcomes commence in early childhood. The evidence from this study suggests that investment in children's early learning skills can be an important factor in establishing positive future learning outcomes."}, {"section_title": "WHAT WE LEARNED FROM PRIDI", "text": "The Regional Project on Child Development Indicators (PRIDI) 1 was a study conducted over the course of 2013 and 2014 using nationally representative samples from four Latin American countries (Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Peru). PRIDI provided important insights into four domains of child development that build the foundation for future learning outcomes: cognition, language and communication, socioemotional development, and motor skills. PRIDI identified and substantiated the importance of a measure that was termed \"the nurturing environment\" 2 for child development. Cognition, language and communication, and socioemotional development, showed stronger positive associations with this measure than motor skills. PRIDI data revealed that social inequalities in child development could appear when a child was only 24 months old, and increased with age, taking three factors into consideration: the socioeconomic endowment of the home, maternal education, and the nurturing environment. Parents with more resources, including education and wealth, invested with greater frequency and intensity in supporting their children's development than parents facing financial and educational limitations. According to the study, by 59 months, the development of a poor and under-nurtured child lagged by as much as 18 months behind richer and more nurtured peers. The under-nurtured child may be unable to recognize basic shapes like triangles or squares, count to 20, or understand temporal sequences (i.e., a sequence of happenings in a space of time households (Verdisco, Cueto, & Thompson, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS AND PIRLS DATA", "text": "While PRIDI provides high quality data on the early learning context of children, it does not connect this context to future school achievement. Moreover, the PRIDI data is limited to four Latin American countries. Inspired by the PRIDI findings, we analyzed data from two international large-scale assessments: the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). Both studies contribute in a unique way to enhancing the empirical evidence on the significance of early learning activities, an important aspect of creating a nurturing environment. IEA's TIMSS and PIRLS assessments provide powerful data sources for the analysis of relationships between achievement and the contexts of learning. The studies implement ability tests for fourth-grade students, allowing for inferences on the achievement of students in reading (PIRLS), mathematics and science (TIMSS) in participating countries. The results of these tests are complemented by background information collected from the students themselves, and their schools, teachers and parents, including retrospective information on early family habits related to early learning activities 4 . Our analysis used data from TIMSS 2011, TIMSS 2015 and PIRLS 2011 including more than 30 educational systems which participated in all three studies, and comparing results from two cycles of TIMSS to analyze trends over time. We explored (1) the engagement in early literacy activities of parents from different educational backgrounds; (2) the 4 Data and documentation are available: http://www.iea.nl/our-data relationship between this engagement and later student achievement in primary school for children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds; and (3) the relationship between children's attendance of institutional early childhood provision and parents' educational background."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MORE HIGHLY EDUCATED PARENTS ENGAGE MORE OFTEN IN NUMERACY AND LITERACY RELATED ACTIVITIES", "text": "Previous research showed that parents with more resources, including education and wealth, generally invest with greater frequency and intensity to support their child's development than parents facing financial and educational limitations (Verdisco et al., 2016). PIRLS and TIMSS data tend to confirm similar patterns of inequality in the majority of the participating education systems, with some variations across them. To investigate how often parents with different education levels engaged in learning activities with their child, we used information collected via questionnaires completed by parents or caregivers (see Appendix, Figure A1). Their responses were used to create two indexes of early learning activities, one related to literacy and another to numeracy (for a full description of these scales, see Martin & Mullis, 2011). Our analysis revealed that, on average, parents with higher educational levels reported more frequent engagement in early learning activities during their children's pre-primary years than those with lower levels of education (Table 1). This finding was generally consistent for all 30 educational systems that participated in TIMSS 2011, 2015 and PIRLS 2011 (see Appendix, Table A1, for further information). Unsurprisingly, we found a very similar pattern for early numeracy activities 5 . 5 Table can be provided by the authors on request Notes: Scale has a mean of 10 and the standard deviation is one. Standard errors appear in parentheses. Parents with a university degree or higher qualification reported engaging more often in early literacy activities with their children than parents with lower levels of education. The larger standard errors for parents with lower levels of education (\"lower secondary\" and \"some primary, lower secondary or no school\") indicate that their play habits are more diverse than those of parents with higher education levels."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Although our analysis showed consistently that more highly educated parents tend to play developmentally stimulating games more frequently with their children, these differences are not equally pronounced across countries (details in Appendix, Table A1). For example, in Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong (SAR), and Singapore, parents with higher levels of education reported significantly higher frequency of engagement in early learning activities than parents with lower levels of education. This suggests that, in these countries, the environment supportive of school success is systematically related to socioeconomic family background. In contrast, in countries such as the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, or Germany, parents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds reported almost negligible differences in the frequency of their engagement. Evidently, in some countries, socioeconomic family background is less closely associated with the frequency of parental engagement in early learning activities than in others. The importance of the problem is underlined by the percentages of children whose parents had low levels of education (see Appendix, Table A1): a relatively large proportion of children were affected by the lack of a stimulating nurturing environment. Larger differences in engagement in learning activities were linked to populations with low proportions of highly educated parents. For example, in Hong Kong (SAR), significantly fewer grade four students have parents with a university degree than in Finland (18% versus 43%)."}, {"section_title": "EARLY LEARNING ACTIVITIES ARE RELATED TO STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT IN LATER SCHOOLING", "text": "The PIRLS and TIMSS data contain empirical evidence that, in the majority of education systems, children from different socioeconomic and educational family backgrounds have varying levels of exposure to early learning activities, but why does this matter? In other words, how does the home environment influence child development and learning outcomes at school? To analyze this question, we conducted a regression analysis of the PIRLS and TIMSS data, predicting a student's outcomes at grade four by the frequency of early learning activities at home (using retrospective information from the parental questionnaires), while controlling for parents' highest educational level (Tables 2 and 3). The analyses revealed positive associations between the reported frequency of early learning activities at home and children's outcomes at school in mathematics, science and reading literacy. The relationship is relatively small, but statistically significant in almost all participating education systems. Notably, the association holds when controlling for parental education 6 , which indicates that early learning activities have their own effect on child development, confirming findings from PRIDI and other studies, as presented in the introduction. On a more detailed level, in many countries, early literacy activities tend to have a slightly stronger association with reading achievement than with science achievement, while the association with mathematics achievement is less pronounced than either of the other two subjects. However, the association of early numeracy activities with achievement is very similar for all three subjects. Moreover, associations vary across different educational systems. In countries of the Gulf region, such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, there are relatively large associations between early literacy activities and achievement; note that, in these countries, relatively few children attend pre-primary education programs for three or more years (Mullis et al., 2012a, b). In reviewing our findings, we conclude that early learning activities may stimulate child development and educational achievement in later years. Our longitudinal analysis of the TIMSS data did not reveal any consistent shifts towards reducing patterns of inequality between 2011 and 2015, however some changes occurred in certain education systems. For instance, the strength of the relationship between early learning activities and student outcomes increased significantly in some countries in the Gulf region, such as Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. In the majority of education systems, the overall pattern remained similar for all subjects and did not change substantially between 2011 and 2015). 6 In this analysis, the parental educational level is artificially set to a constant for all students, consequently revealing the \"true\" effect of early learning activities, independent of parental education (i.e., we assumed that the parental educational level was equal for all students). Unsurprisingly, this association is low because there are many other important factors that influence a student's school performance. 3.6 (1.0) * 5.9 (1.7) * 5.0 (1.2) * 6.4 (1.9) * 4.7 (1.0) * Ireland 5.5 (0.8) * 4.6 (0.7) * 6.1 (0.7) * 5.4 (0.7) * 6.4 (0.7) * Italy 3.2 (1.0) * 3.2 (0.7) * 4.6 (0.9) * 3.7 (0.7) * 5.4 (0.8) * Lithuania 5.0 (0.9) * 2.4 (0.8) * 4.2 (0.8) * 2.6 (0.8) * 5.6 (0.9) * Morocco 1 -4.2 (2.3) 0 .8 (1.5) -1.0 (2.6) 4 .6 (1.9) * 2.1 (2.3) Northern Ireland 1 4.3 (1.4) * 3.7 (1.2) * 4.1 (1.0) * 4.6 (1.0) * 6.4 (1.3) * Norway 3.9 (1.0) * 5.1 (1.2) * 6.0 (0.9) * 5.4 (1.1) * 6.6 (0.9) * Oman 11.1 (0.8) * 6.6 (1.0) * 13.7 (0.9) * 10.7 (1.1) * 11.9 (0.9) * Poland 5.9 (0.8) * 3.6 (0.6) * 6.5 (0.9) * 4.0 (0.6) * 8.4 (0.8) * Portugal 1.4 (0.9) 2 .8 (0.9) * 3.2 (1.0) * 3.9 (0.8) * 3.4 (0.9) * Qatar 2 5.8 (1.6) * 9.6 (1.2) * 10.2 (1.5) * 11.6 (1.2) * 9.0 (1.5) *"}, {"section_title": "Russian Federa\u019fon", "text": "3.5 (0.8) * 2.6 (0.8) * 3.9 (1.0) * 3.9 (0.8) * 5.2 (0.8) * Saudi Arabia 7.6 (2.0) * 0.6 (1.1) 8 .6 (1.9) * 2.4 (1.8) 9 .7 (1. 2.8 (0.8) * 2.6 (0.9) * 4.0 (0.9) * 3.2 (0.9) * 5.7 (0.8) * Spain 4.8 (0.9) * 3.9 (0.7) * 6.3 (0.9) * 5.0 (0.9) * 6.2 (1.0) * Sweden 4.7 (1.0) * 4.5 (0.8) * 6.3 (1.0) * 4.8 (0.9) * 7.2 (1.0) * United Arab Emirates 8.9 (0.9) * 7.9 (0.7) * 11.4 (0.9) * 10.2 (0.7) * 12.5 (0.8) *\n2.4 (0.9) * 2.1 (0.7) * 3.1 (1.1) * 2.9 (0.9) * 3.5 (0.8) * Saudi Arabia 5.8 (1.9) * 0.8 (1.0) 6 .8 (1.8) * 3.8 (1.6) * 7.6 (1.4) * Singapore 2.6 (0.6) * 3.8 (0.6) * 3.7 (0.6) * 3.7 (0.6) * 3.9 (0.6) *"}, {"section_title": "Benchmarking par\u019fcipants", "text": "Quebec, Canada 2 2.2 (0.8) * 3.5 (0.8) * 4.4 (0.9) * 5.0 (0.8) * 6.9 (0.9) * Abu Dhabi, UAE  Data are available for at least 50% but less than 70% of the students in at least one survey."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Data are available for at least 70% but less than 85% of the students in at least one survey.

Our analyses suggest that early learning activities have some effect on student achievement in later schooling. Further, in some education systems, parental engagement with children on stimulating learning activities is unequal across families from different educational backgrounds. Better educated parents tend to support their child's development with greater frequency and intensity than parents with financial and educational limitations. In this regard, policy action could be directed toward enhancing the nurturing environments of young children. Drawing on the regional PRIDI results, we can also conclude that a useful approach would be to raise awareness of the lifelong impact of pre-school education, and to offer parents or caregivers opportunities to learn how to be more responsive to their children's needs. Included here would be teaching parents or caregivers how to listen, understand and communicate more effectively with their children. Our analysis indicates that interventions would be most beneficial for children from families where the parents have lower levels of education. Providing early learning opportunities at the institutional level can contribute to child development and improve schooling outcomes, thus efforts should be made to increase participation in those programs, especially for disadvantaged children. It may be beneficial to provide systematic learning opportunities for children at the institutional level, to mitigate the effects for children whose parents or caregivers, for whatever reason, are unable to provide optimal levels of pre-school support. Earlier analyses, presented in the international reports of TIMSS and PIRLS, have shown clear positive relationships between attendance of children in pre-primary programs and their later school outcomes (Mullis et al., 2012a(Mullis et al., , 2012b(Mullis et al., , 2016; in the vast majority of countries, the data indicated that the longer children attended these programs, the larger was the subsequent effect on their later educational outcomes. Hence, participation in high-quality early education programs can help to prepare the ground for children's future schooling outcomes and has the potential to mitigate the socioeconomic and educational inequalities of diverse family backgrounds.
