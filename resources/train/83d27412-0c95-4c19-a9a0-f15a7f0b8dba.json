Yet an increasing number of countries are choosing to participate in these exercises (Kamens 2013 , Lockheed 2015 . Why?\nThis paper seeks to answer this question empirically, using the experience of the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) as a case.\nInternational large-scale assessments (ILSAs) provide high-quality comparative information regarding the outputs of education systems. These assessments are carried out systematically across a number of countries and yield internationally comparable information regarding students and their cognitive skills. Regional assessments, another type of ILSA limited to a specific world region, have arisen in Africa and Latin America. Since the mid-1990s, ministers of education in Africa have sponsored a periodic regional assessment, the Southern and Eastern African Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ). Also, since the same time, UNESCO, through the Laboratorio Latinamericano de Evaluacion de la Calidad de la Education (LLECE), or Latin American Laboratory for the Evaluation of Education Quality, has sponsored a regional assessment in Latin America, Estudio Regional Camparativo y Explicativo (ERCE), or the Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study; ERCE is also known by the acronyms PERCE, SERCE and TERCE, for the first, second and third study (Ferrer 2006 , UNESCO Santiago 2015 .\nIn 2012, another assessment, the Programme d'Analyse des Systemes Educatif de CONFEMEN (PASEC), which had been less systematic than a typical ILSA, changed to become more standardized across countries and also is partnering with SACMEQ (CONFEMEN 2015) . Table 1 reports selected information about the various ILSAs. Many explanations for the spread of large-scale assessments have been offered. The number of countries participating in any large-scale assessments could increase along with the globalization of education, generally, and of assessment specifically (Kamens 2013; Meyer & Benavot 2013) . The number of countries participating in ILSAs, in particular, could increase as the worldwide technical capacity for undertaking large-scale assessments increases, fueled in part by previous international, regional or national assessments (Lockheed 2010; Greaney and Kellaghan 2009 ). And more countries could decide to participate in ILSAs to benefit from the information that international comparative measures provide; this demand for information could be fueled both by the concerns of educators and by the analytic interests of macro-economists for 2 All ILSAs report results for \"education systems\", which may include cities, states or provinces, or other sub-national units. The numbers in the bulleted points refer to education systems, whereas the remainder of this paper focuses on economies as defined by the World Bank. valid and reliable cross-national data regarding economies' education outcomes (Chabbot & Elliott, 2003; Hanushek & Woessmann 2012; Lockheed 2013 ).\nThe spread of PISA, in particular, provides an opportunity to investigate these explanations. First, we can examine the \"globalness\" of international large-scale assessments, using PISA as an example. If ILSAs are \"global\", then countries in all regions and at all levels of income should have an equal likelihood of participating in PISA, controlling for a country's economic status; if ILSAs are not \"global\", then differences in participation rates should be observed for countries in different regions and at different levels of economic development.\nMoreover, if ILSAs are \"globalizing\", then the rate at which countries join PISA should be comparable across regions and levels of income.\nSecond, we can examine the assessment capacity-building effects of participating in large-scale assessments. If participating in a large-scale assessment builds assessment capacity, then countries that have participated in another large-scale assessment (such as TIMSS, a regional assessment or a national assessment) should have greater assessment capacity and therefore should be more likely to participate in PISA than countries without this experience, controlling for the country's economic status. The assessment capacity that is built through participation could be administrative, technical or both.\nThird, we can explore the role of economists in creating a demand for information by looking at the role the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) plays in PISA. If an economists' organization such as OECD creates a demand for information, then OECD member countries should have a higher level of participation in PISA than other countries, controlling for the country's economic status."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "This paper tests some of these notions empirically, using a purpose-built data set covering over 200 countries and economies 3 as of 2015."}, {"section_title": "A. Data sources", "text": "The data used in this paper come from four main sources: \uf0b7 Economic status and geographic location, from the World Bank.\n\uf0b7 Participation in international and regional large-scale assessments, from published reports and websites of sponsoring agencies. Assessment capacity. A country's assessment capacity is inferred from the country's experience with three large-scale assessments: an international assessment, a regional assessment, and a national assessment. Each country's participation in the longest-operating international large-scale assessment, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), was coded from published reports from each cycle of that assessment Martin et al. 1997 ; Martin et al. 2000; Martin et al. 2004 Countries also build their own assessment capacity through national assessments. The UNESCO Global Monitoring Report provided data on each country's history of national assessments (UNESCO 2015) . The variable used in the analyses was whether or not the country had conducted a national assessment in the three years prior to a specific PISA cycle."}, {"section_title": "Role of economists.", "text": "The indicator for the role that economists play in the growth of PISA is the country's membership in the OECD.

Issues with matching", "text": "All data were matched by country and year, and the unit of analysis used in this paper is the \"country-PISA cycle.\" The assumption is that all countries could have participated in up to six cycles of PISA, depending upon whether or not the country existed at the time of the specific cycle.\nSome issues in matching data were encountered, since both PISA and TIMSS report information on \"education systems\" while the World Bank reports information on \"economies.\"\nThis means, for example, that PISA and TIMSS report results for various education systems in the United Kingdom (Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland) whereas the World Bank reports information for the United Kingdom as a whole. This paper follows the World Bank's policy with respect to country identification."}, {"section_title": "D. Estimation strategy", "text": "This paper uses a logistic regression approach to estimate the effect on PISA participation of a country's level of economic development, region, prior participation in national, regional or international assessments, and OECD membership. The logistic regression analysis estimates the increased odds of a country's participation in PISA at any time, based on these country characteristics. Two models are estimated, one with controls for the six PISA cycles and one without these controls. In addition, a final model is estimated for only the PISA 2015 cycle. overall participation rate for European Union countries 5 is 100%, whereas the participation rate of non-EU ECA countries is substantially lower (64%). Participation in a regional assessment does not appear to build capacity in the same way.\nIn fact, a much smaller share of countries participating in a regional assessment subsequently participate in PISA, as compared with countries that do not participate in a regional assessment.\nRegional assessments may substitute for international assessments in Latin America and SubSaharan Africa. Participation by OECD members. All OECD member countries participate in PISA, and all countries that were members of OECD at the time participated in each PISA cycle (figure 1).\nWhile an increasing number of non-OECD member countries participate in PISA and are referred to as \"partner\" countries in OECD publications, no OECD member country has not participated in PISA. As a result the OECD member countries' participation rates are 100% for all PISA cycles."}, {"section_title": "B. Multivariate comparisons using logistic regressions with odds ratios", "text": "Assessment capacity, geographical location and economic status may be related, and bivariate comparisons do not take this into account. This section explores the likelihood of a country's participation in PISA when these three advantage factors are considered simultaneously. A logistic regression approach (Stata logit regression with odds ratios) is used to estimate the odds of participation in PISA, 2000-2015, based on the above \"advantage\" (non-risk)\nfactors. Separate regressions are run for two groups of countries: (a) all countries and (b) non-OECD countries; in addition, models are run that control for the assessment cycle. The value for the dependent variable-participation in a given PISA cycle -is highest for OECD countries, and higher for all countries than for non-OECD countries. Average values for four predictor variables are highest for OECD countries and higher for all countries than for non-OECD countries; these are: TIMSS participation, national assessments, location in ECA and high-income economy. Values for three other predictor variables are lowest for OECD countries and lower for all countries than for non-OECD countries; these are: location in Sub-Saharan Africa, low-income economy and lower-middle-income economy. The third column indicates that the likelihood of participation in a PISA cycle is affected by a country's capacity for assessment, as indicated by its prior experience with TIMSS or national assessments. Participation in a regional assessment, however, is unrelated to participation in PISA. These odds are similar for all countries and non-OECD countries. Table 7 presents the results for income level, region and assessment capacity considered simultaneously. In general, the size of the coefficients for most of the variables are smaller in the full models than in the models in which the variables are considered in separate groups. All odds are relative to countries with the following characteristics: low-income countries, not in the ECA region, not with prior assessment capacity. The first column presents the model that includes an indicator for OECD membership; as noted previously, OECD membership perfectly predicts PISA participation.\nThe level of economic development strongly increases the odds of PISA participation, with or without an OECD control; upper middle-income countries and high income countries are about 15 times more likely to participate in PISA as compared with low-income countries, and lower-middle income countries are about five times more likely to participate. Countries in the ECA region are about three times more likely to participate than countries outside the region.\nCoefficients for region and level of economic development are higher in the model that does not include a control for OECD membership.\nCountries with prior experience of TIMSS are about five times more likely to participate in PISA, and countries with national assessments are about three times more likely to participate.\nRegional assessments are unrelated to PISA participation, in all models. The strong positive effect for having built capacity through TIMSS participation and the non-significance of regional assessment capacity do not differ between the two groups of countries. Controlling for year of assessment. The above analyses were repeated with dummy variables introduced to control for the PISA cycle year. Controlling for PISA cycle did not change the size or statistical significance of the coefficients for any of the models (table 8). (table 9) . As previously noted, OECD membership perfectly predicted participation in PISA in all years so the variable was not included in the regression. Although the size of the coefficients varied somewhat from year to year, the odds of participation in PISA were consistently higher for: (a) countries with exiting assessment capacity, as shown by their prior participation in TIMSS and their own national assessment, (b) uppermiddle-income and high-income countries and (c) countries in the ECA region. Moreover, the gap between higher income countries and lower income countries increased over time. All odds are compared with countries with the following characteristics: low-income and lower-middleincome countries, not in the ECA region, not with prior TIMSS participation and with no national assessment. Table 9 Globalization across levels of economic development is less clear. Growth in participation is observed for high-income and upper-middle income countries, suggesting globalization. But little growth in participation for low-income or lower-middle-income countries is observed. Virtually no low-income country has participated in PISA (the average share across the six cycles is 1.6%) and the average share of participating lower-middle-income countries is about 13%. The seven 6 countries participating in PISA for Development include two low-income and four lower-middle income countries; if they all complete the assessment on schedule, then the share of low-income country participations would increase to 5.5% and the share of lower-middle income country participations would increase to 18.7%.\nThe low rate of participate for low-income and middle-income countries may also reflect the deterrent effect of the actual costs of participation. At a minimum, participation in PISA requires payment of an international participation fee of 182,000 Euros, payable at 45,500 Euros annually for four years. This amount is a very small cost for upper-middle-income and highincome countries, but may appear greater for lower-middle-income and low-income countries, particularly when added to other direct costs (such as for travel to required meetings) and the incountry costs for implementing the assessment. In the past, the participation of low-and middleincome countries in various international large-scale assessments has been facilitated by the economic support of donors such as the World Bank and the United Nations Development\nProgram (Liberman & Clarke 2012; Lockheed 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Does participation in other types of assessment build the capacity for participating", "text": "in an international large-scale assessment such as PISA? Here, the answer appears much clearer. A much higher share of countries that have participated in another international largescale assessment (TIMSS) go on to participate in PISA. Moreover, countries that have an established national assessment system also go on to participate in PISA at higher rates than countries lacking national assessments. This higher rate of participation can be explained by the increased capacity for assessment that such participation develops, which can be both for the administrative demands of the assessment and its technical requirements.\nThird, is the growth in international large scale assessment driven by the data needs of economists? The results indicate that -at a minimum -country members of a significant organization dominated by economists, the OECD (which sponsors PISA), are far more likely to participate in PISA than non-members. The participation rate of OECD member countries is 100% in all years, whereas the participation rate of non-OECD countries averages around 15% across the six PISA cycles. OECD membership predicts PISA participation perfectly in all years.\nResearch suggests that economists disproportionately use the results from ILSAs in general and PISA in particular in their research on human capital and economic development (Lockheed 2013 Universal basic education (often including secondary education) means that countries can turn their attention from measuring educational access to measuring educational quality. Virtually all countries participating in most international-large scale assessments report high rates of enrollment in primary and secondary education (World Bank 2015 April).\nBetter education information systems means that the requisite information needed for scientific sampling of schools and students is available for all large-scale assessments.\nBetter governance means that a stable and secure environment for providing education can be found (Kaufmann, Kraay & Mastruzzi 2010; World Bank 2015) . Virtually no countries participating in international large-scale assessments have been identified as \"fragile\" or \"conflict\" states at the time the assessment was conducted, and some countries that have participated previously in an international large-scale assessment have ceased to participate after the governance situation eroded.\nGreater ease of doing business means that ministries of education can more easily employ the temporary resources needed to complete an international or regional assessment (World Bank 2014). The average rating for \"ease of doing business\" is higher for countries participating in PISA , as compared with countries in the same economic group that do not participate in PISA (World Bank 2014; OECD forthcoming 2015) .\nMore open information means that the results of assessments can be shared more broadly within the country (Reporters Without Borders 2014).\nThe increase in international large-scale assessments may indeed indicate globalization, but possibly just the globalization of development."}]
