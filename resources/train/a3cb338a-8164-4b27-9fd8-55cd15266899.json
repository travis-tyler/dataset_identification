[{"section_title": "", "text": "This Data Point examines the early labor market outcomes of public high school students, focusing on graduates who earned different numbers of credits in career and technical education (CTE; see definition in figure notes). The Data Point uses data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). HSLS:09 initially surveyed a national sample of grade 9 students in 2009, with follow-up surveys in 2012, 2013, and 2016, including a high school transcript collection in 2013. This analysis is based on HSLS:09 ninth-graders who graduated from public high schools by 2013 and were not enrolled in a postsecondary credential program in 2016. The Data Point examines five labor market outcomes measured in 2016, 3 years after graduates completed high school: labor force participation rate, unemployment rate, pay, job benefits, and job satisfaction. The pay measure is whether the graduate earned more than $10 per hour. 1 The job benefits measure is receipt of health insurance and retirement benefits. These outcomes are examined separately for graduates who earned 0.00-0.99, 1.00-2.99, and 3.00 or more CTE credits during high school. Graduates who earned 3.00 or more CTE credits had a lower unemployment rate than their peers who earned fewer CTE credits. Regardless of CTE participation level, about 9 in 10 graduates not enrolled in a postsecondary credential program participated in the labor force (FIGURE 1). However, among graduates in the labor force, the unemployment rate for graduates with 3.00 or more CTE credits was lower than the rates for graduates who earned 1.00-2.99 CTE credits and graduates who earned 0.00-0.99 CTE credits."}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1.

All stated differences are statistically significant at the .05 level, with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error."}]
