[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different 3 3 rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies 3 4 have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a 3 5 causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), 3 6\nGranger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on 3 7 longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 3 8 (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least 3 9\nfive sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about year. The longitudinal data were 4 0 concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to 4 1 measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. 4 2 Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal 4 3 lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On 4 4 the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even 4 5 relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on 4 6 metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that 4 7 have strong influences over other regions. 4 8 4 9\nKeyword: aging, anterior temporal lobe, Granger causality, LASSO regression, metabolic connectivity, 5 0 7"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Newark, NJ, 07102, USA 1 9\nbbiswal@yahoo.com 2 0 2 1 # Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 2 2\nInitiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Extending our previous work on metabolic covariance networks using 1 0 3 Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images (Di et al., 2017; Di & Biswal, and Alzheimer's Disease Neu, 2012) , 1 0 4\nwe sought in the current study to examine the interregional causal influences of metabolic activity during 1 0 5 aging. fluctuations of region A influences those in region B, so that an event in A can be observed one time point 1 1 0 later in B (e.g. the marked peak at age 66 and 67 in A and B, respectively). 1 1 1 1 1 2\nThe aim of the current study is to explore the causal interregional influences of metabolic activity 1 1 3 during normal aging at the time scale of a year. We leveraged the longitudinal FDG-PET data from the 1 1 4 ADNI dataset, where there were at least five sessions of FDG-PET scans for each subject at a time step of 1 1 5 approximately one year. First, we examined regional age effects of metabolic activity to identify regions 1 1 6 with accelerated declines, with no apparent age effects, and with relative increases. Second, we 1 1 7 performed whole brain Granger causality analysis to identify causal influences, where the metabolic 1 1 8 activity in a region at a certain time point can be predicted by the metabolic activity in another region at 1 1 9 1 3 1\nOnly data from healthy participants were included in the current analysis. All participants 1 3 2 showed no signs of depression, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia, with Mini-Mental State Exam 1 3 3 (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30 and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0. We manually 1 3 4 selected longitudinal FDG-PET images from the ADNI database, with participants who had at least five 1 3 5 sessions of FDG-PET images available. As a result, 72 subjects (25 females) were included in the current 1 3 6 analysis with a total of 432 PET scan sessions. The numbers of available sessions ranged from 5 to 9 1 3 7 ( Figure 2A ). The average age at the first session was 75.8 years (62 to 86 years). For each session, we 1 3 8 calculated a mean image or adopted the only image to represent the session. The intersession interval 1 3 9 with a subject varied from 3 months to up to 8 years for a few rare cases ( Figure 2B ). The mean and 1 4 0 median of the intersession intervals were 1.02 and 0.98 years, respectively. 1 4 1 1 4 2"}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "Histograms of the numbers of sessions for each subject (A) and the intersession intervals for all 1 4 3 the sessions and subjects (B). The participants were typically studied at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 months related to 1 4 4 the first visit, and yearly follow-ups. Therefore, the intersession intervals are likely to be around six 1 4 5 months or one year. 1 4 6 1 4 7\nThe FDG-PET images were acquired from multiple sites with different PET imaging protocols. 1 4 8 high number of ICs, so that the resulting ICs could represent more local variations than large scale 1 7 0 networks (Fu et al., 2018 networks (Fu et al., , 2019 Smith et al., 2013) . This data-driven approach is an alternative to atlas-1 7 1 based parcellation, and may be more representative to local variations of metabolic activity. The ICA was 1 7 2 performed using Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT: RRID:SCR_001953; 1 7 3 http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift) (V D Calhoun, Adali, Pearlson, & Pekar, 2001) . The preprocessed 1 7 4 FDG-PET images from different sessions and subjects were concatenated into a single time series, and 1 7 5 fed into the ICA analysis. Eighty one components were recommended by the minimum description 1 7 6 length (MDL) algorithm implemented in GIFT. After extraction of the 81 components, the ICs were 1 7 7 visually inspected and grouped into eight domains (Supplementary materials) as well as 21 noise 1 7 8\ncomponents. There were in total 60 ICs included in the following analysis. For each IC, the associated 1 7 9 time series were obtained to represent metabolic activity of this source in different subjects and sessions. 1 8 0\nThe 81 IC maps are available at: https://osf.io/4a3vt/. 1 8 1 2.4. Regional age effects 1 8 2\nFor each subject, a general linear model (GLM) was built to examine aging effects. The GLM included 1 8 3 two regressors, a constant term and a linear age effect. The GLM analysis was performed on each IC, and 1 8 4 the \u03b2 values of the age effect were obtained. Group level analysis was then performed on each IC using a 1 8 5 one sample t test model to examine the group averaged effect of age. A FDR (false discovery rate) 1 8 6 corrected p < 0.05 was used to identify ICs that had significant age effects after correcting for all the 60 1 8 7 comparisons. Thereafter, the ICs were sorted into three groups, with significant (relative) increased 1 8 8 metabolic activity, with no significant changes, and with significant decreased metabolic activity in aging. 1 8 9 2.5. Interregional causality analysis 1 9 0 We adopted Granger causality to examine the interregional causal influence of metabolic activity. 1 9 1 Specifically, we treated the longitudinal FDG-PET data as time series, and used autoregressive model to 1 9 2 predict the value of time point t in a region y by the previous time points of another region x, when 1 9 3 controlling for its own previous time points. In the current data, the time step is approximately one year. 1 9 4\nTo account for the variability of intersession interval, the intervals between time points t and t -1 were 1 9 5 added as a covariate or regressed out in the analysis (see below for details). Another consideration is the 1 9 6 order of the model, i.e. how many previous time points are used to predict the current time point. In this 1 9 7 study, we used only the first order model to measure the causal influence of only one previous time point, 1 9 8 which represents a time step of about one year. The limited number of time points in a subject prevents 1 9 9 us to use higher order models. The advantage of using only the first order model is that the sign 2 0 0 information of the beta estimate enables us to differentiate positive and negative predictions. The model 2 0 1 can be expressed in the following form: 2 0 2 \u03b5 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2\nwhere y represents the predicted time series in one brain region, and x represents the predicting time series 2 0 4 of another brain region. y t-1 represent the time series of y t which moved one time point ahead, thus 2 0 5 representing a autoregression model of time series y. The effect of interest is the predicting value of\nWe concatenated the time series across all the subjects to form a long time series for analysis 2 0 8 ( Figure 3) . Therefore, the model is considered fixed effect model. The time series of a subject were first 2 0 9 z transformed to minimize inter-subject variation, where m i represents the total number of time points in a 2 1 0 1 0 subject i. For each subject, we included the time points 2 to m of the time series of a region as the 2 1 1 predicted variable y t . The autoregressive variable y t-1 included the time points 1 to m -1 of the time 2 1 2 series of the same region. The predicting variable x t-1 was the time points 1 to m -1 from another region 2 1 3\nx. After concatenation, there were in total 360 data points in the time series. predicting region, and y represents the predicted region. The superscript represents different subjects, 2 1 7 with a total number of n. The subscript represents the scan session in a subject, with a total number of mi 2 1 8 for a subject i. 2 1 9 2 2 0\nThe model could be applied to each pair of the ICs from the 60 ICs. The intersession interval 2 2 1 between time t and time t -1 were included in the model as a covariate. We first performed such analysis 2 2 2 on each pair of ICs to obtain the predicting effect (\u03b2 2 ) and corresponding p values, which formed a 60 x 2 2 3 60 matrix of causal effects. FDR correction at p < 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons of 2 2 4 the in total 3,540 (60 x 59) effects, where autoregressive effects along the diagonal were not tested."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "This pair-wise approach may identify influences from different regions with shared variance 2 2 6 although maybe only one region has direct influence with the tested region. To overcome this, when 2 2 7 predicting a region x i t , one can add all the other ICs to identify which region can predict x i t . The model is 2 2 8 then as following for a predicted region x i : 2 2 9 \u03b5 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2\nSince all the ICs were included in the model, there was no need to differentiate the variables of x and y. 2 3 1 Therefore, we use x to denote all the time series variables. The superscripts of x now represent different 2 3 2 ICs, where p represents the total number of the IC. Before entering in to the model, a time series 2 3 3 representing the intersession interval between time point t and t -1 were regressed out from all the x t-1 2 3 4 time series to account for the intersession interval variability. Estimating the multivariate model may be 2 3 5 challenging, especially when some of the IC time series may be highly correlated. It can be assumed that 2 3 6 only a small number of ICs may influence the predicted IC. In this scenario, one can use regularization 2 3 7 method to estimate the sparse influence effects, such as using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and 2 3 8 selection operator) (Tang, Bressler, Sylvester, Shulman, & Corbetta, 2012; Tibshirani, 1996) . The 2 3 9 motivation of choosing LASSO over other regularization methods is that the LASSO regularization can 2 4 0 force some parameters in the model to be zero thus resulting in only a small number of non-zero 2 4 1 parameters. This is important in the current context, because the aim is to identify a small number of 2 4 2 interregional influences. Since this model examines the prediction of the time series of one IC by the 2 4 3 time series of all the other ICs, the analysis only needed to be performed for 60 times (compared with 60 2 4 4\nx 59 times in the pair-wise analysis) to cover all the ICs. 2 4 5\nThe LASSO regression was performed using the lasso function implemented in MATLAB. To 2 4 6 determine an optimal regularization factor \u03bb , we used a set of \u03bb from 0 (no regularization) to 0.5 with a 2 4 7 step of 0.001. The identified non-zero influences dropped dramatically as the increase of \u03bb . We identify 2 4 8 the \u03bb where the number of non-zero influences were the closest to the number of significant effects when 2 4 9 using FDR correction in the pair-wise analysis, and reported all the non-zero influencing effects. 2 5 0\nThe resulting 60 x 60 influencing matrix can be treated as a directed network graph, where the 2 5 1 ICs represent the nodes and the causal influences represent directed edges of the graph. We calculated in-2 5 2 degree and out-degree of the 60 nodes to characterize the importance of an IC in the whole brain 2 5 3 influencing graph. To ensure that the degree calculation was not affected by arbitrary defined threshold, 2 5 4 we also explored the graphs from other \u03bb values to verify the identified hub regions are still present. To 2 5 5 1 3 panel of Figure 5 illustrates the age effects of an example IC (IC 56) with no statistical significant age 2 8 0 effect. We first applied pairwise autoregressive model to obtain a 60 x 60 matrix of the interregional causal 2 9 3 influences of metabolic activity between each pair of the ICs (Figure 6A ). When using a statistical 2 9 4 threshold of p < 0.05 of FDR correction, 14 positive and 13 negative causal influences were identified 2 9 5 ( Figure 6B ). We next performed LASSO regression with x t of an IC as the predicted variable and x t-1 of 2 9 6 all the ICs as the predicting variables using a range of \u03bb . We identified the \u03bb value where the number of 2 9 7 non-zero effects was the closest to the number of significant effects in the pairwise analysis. The 2 9 8 resulting influencing effects at \u03bb = 0.162 ( Figure 6C ) look in general similar to the significant effects 2 9 9 identified by the pairwise analysis, although some subtle differences can be noted. There were 15 3 0 0 positive and 13 negative causal influences identified using LASSO regression (Table 1) (Figure 7) . The IC maps were color coded based on 3 1 0 their regional age effects to illustrate the relationships between regional metabolic activity changes and 3 1 1 the signs of causal influences. It can be seen that the influences between two decreased regions or two 3 1 2 increased regions in aging were in general positive, but the influences between one increased and one 3 1 3 decreased regions were in general negative. For example, the bilateral anterior temporal IC (IC# 63 in 3 1 4 Figure 6 ) positively influenced the medial parietal IC (IC# 27), but negatively influenced the basal 3 1 5 ganglia IC (IC# 19) . It is consistent with the direction of the spread of age effects. There were also ICs 3 1 6 that without apparent age effects, where the signs of causal influences with other regions did not show 3 1 7 clear pattern. To better illustrate the topology of the interregional influencing network and to highlight the 3 2 6 regions that are more influencing or influenced to other regions, we plotted the first giant components of 3 2 7 the interregional influencing network using force layout at \u03bb = 0.162, and also at more liberal thresholds 3 2 8 of \u03bb = 0.142 and \u03bb = 0.122 (Figure 8 ). The node sizes represent the out-degree or in-degree of a node in 3 2 9 the network in the upper and middle panels, respectively. It can be seen that the nodes with large out-3 3 0 degree were in general the regions with decreased metabolic activity (blue nodes). The red arrows 3 3 1 highlighted the two nodes that had 5 out-degrees at \u03bb = 0.162 and remained among the highest out-degree 3 3 2 nodes at the lower \u03bb values. These two nodes were also highlighted in Figure 7 , which covered the 3 3 3 bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (IC# 48) and the bilateral anterior temporal lobe (IC# 63). While in terms of 3 3 4 in-degree, there were no clear regions that had exceptionally high in-degree compared with other nodes. 3 3 5\nThe node with high in-degree had no apparent age effects (green nodes) or had increased metabolic 3 3 6 activity with age (brown nodes). The distributions of nodal out-and in-degree confirmed that the out-3 3 7 degree distributions had heavy tailed distributions compared with the in-degree distributions (lower 3 3 8 panels in Figure 8 ). The current analysis identified several hubs that influenced other brain regions, most prominently 3 7 7 the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex. The anterior temporal lobe (IC 63) is connected to 3 7 8 several major white matter tracts such the cingulum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate 3 7 9 fasciculus (Catani & Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008) , which could support its influencing role to other 3 8 0 regions such as the subcortical regions, inferior frontal cortex, and left temporal cortex. To better 3 8 1 characterize its functional correlates, we submitted the IC map into NeuroVault (NeuroVault, 3 8 2 RRID:SCR_003806; https://neurovault.org), and decoded the functions of these maps using large-scale 3 8 3 meta-analytic data from Neurosynth (NeuroSynth, RRID:SCR_006798; http://neurosynth.org/) (Rubin et 3 8 4 al., 2017). The first five functional terms were all about language and semantic processing (See 3 8 5 Supplementary Table S2 ). Studies also showed that electrical stimulation of the anterior temporal lobe 3 8 6\ncan improve proper name recalls in aging (Ross, McCoy, Coslett, Olson, & Wolk, 2011) , and 3 8 7 bilingualism can protect the integrity of anterior temporal lobe in aging (Abutalebi et al., 2014) . Taken 3 8 8 together, the results suggest that language process might be an important factor modulating brain aging. 3 8 9\nThe orbital frontal cortex (IC 48) is connected to the uncinate fasciculus and inferior fronto-3 9 0 occipital fasciculus (Catani & Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008) , which could support its influences to the 3 9 1 posterior visual regions. The functional words related to the orbitofrontal IC were mainly about 3 9 2 emotional processing ( Supplementary Table S2 ). In older population, smaller orbitofrontal volumes are 3 9 3\nshown to be associated with depression (Lai, Payne, Byrum, Steffens, & Krishnan, 2000; W. D. Taylor et 3 9 4 al., 2003) . Taken together, emotional process might also be an important factor modulating brain aging. 3 9 5\nHowever, although previous studies have shown associations between resting-state brain activity and task 3 9 6 activations (Di, Kannurpatti, Rypma, & Biswal, 2013; Yuan et al., 2013) , the extent to what resting-state 3 9 7 brain activity can reflect certain brain functions are still largely unknown. Further studies might need to 3 9 8 design proper tasks to better link functions to brain activations. 3 9 9\nA limitation of the current analysis is the potential confounding effect due to partial volume 4 0 0 (Bonte et al., 2017; Rousset, Ma, & Evans, 1998) , i.e. whether an observed effect is due to the changes of 4 0 1 bona fide metabolic activity or the changes of underlying gray matter volume. However, the following 4 0 2 reasons make the partial volume confounding less problematic. First, the current analysis adopted within 4 0 3 subject comparison, which has already minimized the partial volume effects due to inter subject 4 0 4 anatomical variability. Second, we applied ICA analysis to identify independent sources of metabolic 4 0 5 variability. Some components that were likely due to enlargement of ventricle and are spatially 4 0 6 overlapped with the included ICs, have been already removed. For example, there was an IC largely 4 0 7 located in ventricle area (IC 79 in supplementary Figure S9 ) but with substantial overlaps with the ICs of 4 0 8 the thalamus and basal ganglia (supplementary Figure S5) . The IC 79 had the second strongest negative 4 0 9 age effect among all the ICs. The included ICs that had spatial overlap with this IC showed no age effects 4 1 0 or even positive age effects, suggesting that the partial volume effects associated with enlarged ventricle 4 1 1 have been minimized in these ICs. Third, even though the observed causal influences may still somehow 4 1 2 contributed by the residual partial volume effects, the causal influences of volumetric reductions may still 4 1 3 be important findings for understanding brain aging. The structural MRI images are available in the 4 1 4 ADNI dataset, but were not always acquired at the same time point as the PET images, making the 4 1 5 incorporation of MRI images in the model difficult. Future studies should certainly consider taking into 4 1 6 account of anatomical information in the analysis. Indeed, it may be theoretically more important to 4 1 7 study the interaction or causal influences between brain anatomy and functions in aging. According to 4 1 8 the compensation model, the reduction of gray matter will lead to elevated functional responses, which 4 1 9 then give rise to less affected behavioral performances (Gregory et al., 2018; Reuter-Lorenz & Park, 2014;  4 2 0 Shafto & Tyler, 2014) . A direct examination of causal influences among local and interregional gray 4 2 1 matter structures, functions, and behavioral performances may provide more insight to the dynamic of 4 2 2 compensation process in aging. 4 2 3\nOne strength of the current analysis approach is that we adopted multivariate methods and 4 2 4 LASSO to include all the ICs in the predicting models, which in theory can prevent identifying ICs that 4 2 5 have indirect predicting effects to the target (Smith et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2012) .
