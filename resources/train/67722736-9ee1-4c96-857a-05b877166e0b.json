[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose The aims of this study were to delineate the epidemiology of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and contrast it with Hispanic-Latino populations in the USA."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Gastric adenocarcinoma is the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide and the leading infectionassociated cancer [1, 2] . Latin American countries have a particularly burden, with some of the highest reported mortality rates [2] [3] [4] . Gastric cancer has marked geographic and ethnic variability. In Latin America, the mountainous areas along the Pacific littoral have the highest incidence and mortality rates, an \"altitude enigma\", including Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Colombia [5] [6] [7] .\nGastric adenocarcinoma, in particular the intestinal subtype, is a multifactorial process, which progresses through a series of histopathology steps: normal mucosa, non-atrophic gastritis, multifocal atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma [8] . The early mucosal inflammation and chronic gastritis is driven by Helicobacter pylori infection, with modulation by host genotypes and responses and dietary and environmental factors [9] . Key influences, which are usually established in childhood, include host of H. pylori strain-specific genetic factors (e.g., cagA and vacAs1m1) and host-risk genotypes (cytokine SNPs, e.g., IL1\u03b2-511 T) [10, 11] . These two key determinants may be \"imported\" at the time of immigration from high-incidence areas, such as Central America, and therefore may be instructive for cancer control among US Hispanics. In contrast, proximal cancers of the gastroesophageal junction and cardia cancer have been associated with gastroesophageal reflux and tobacco [12] . These two cancer groups are now considered separate entities.\nIn the USA, due to significant differences in the median ages, the overall cancer rates are lower among Hispanics, with the exception of gastric and cervical cancers, two important infectious entities [13] . Gastric cancer incidence rates for Hispanics in the USA nearly doubled those of whites [13] . In addition, Hispanics have more distal type cancer than nonHispanic whites [14, 15] . Interestingly, recent studies suggest an increase in diffuse cancer in foreign-born Hispanic men and US born Hispanic women [16] . Hispanic ethnicity has also been associated with diagnosis at a younger age, less differentiated tumors, and different metastasis pattern (more peritoneal and less hepatic metastases) [15, 14] .\nThe literature regarding gastric cancer epidemiology in Central America is limited, with the exception of the national cancer registries of Costa Rica and Panama. The northern nations of the region, the Central American Four (CA-4) are comprised of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, with movement towards economic and health system integration. The CA-4 represents the core low-middleincome countries (LMICs) of Latin America, and population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) and hospitalbased cancer registries (HBCRs) are limited. Importantly, after Mexico, Central America forms the second largest Latino immigrant population in the USA, the majority of who are from the CA-4 nations, and may represent the largest at-risk group for gastric cancer. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of gastric cancer in Central America based upon the available data and with comparison to Hispanics living in the USA."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Central America Data Sources", "text": "We reviewed published data from available resources, including the published literature, International Agency on Cancer Research (IARC), hospital-based cancer registries, and Ministry of Health (MOH) data. Different methods were used to record cancer cases in each country. For the most part, the available data encompassed 10-15-year periods between 1996 and 2011, with the exception of the national Costa Rica registry . Data from Costa Rica and Panama were obtained from their National Cancer Registries (Registro Nacional de Tumores de Costa Rica and the Registro Nacional de C\u00e1ncer de Panama, respectively), both of which are certified by IARC and have national coverage. Data from Guatemala were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (IN-CAN), which is a national referral center for cancer treatment with records of all new patient consultations in their hospitals and clinics. The National Radiotherapy Center in Nicaragua provided data for gastric cancer treatment in their national referral hospital. These latter registries are IARC affiliated only. Data from Honduras was obtained from a prospective, population-based study, which utilized a combined endoscopy and pathology registry to assess gastric cancer incidence in the rural western region of the country [5] . Data from this study was considered high quality, given its geographic representativeness, complete information on histology and anatomical subsite, versus the limited data from the three IARC-affiliated hospital-based registries [5] . Finally, data from El Salvador was obtained from a targeted review of databases from the three largest public hospitals (Hospital Rosales, Hospital Zacamil, and Hospital General ISSS). This study focused on Spanish-speaking nations, and thus, Belize was not included in our analysis."}, {"section_title": "United States Data Sources", "text": "Data from the USA was obtained from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance and Epidemiology End Results Program (SEER) 18 dataset for the period 1985-2009. All Hispanic patients defined by the Hispanic/Latino Identification Algorithm (HLIA) were included [17] . This group was further divided into foreign-born from Central America and Mexico and US-born Hispanics. The Central American group included patients born in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, or non-specified Central America. The US-born group included patients born in continental United States only. Cases with unknown site of birth were not included."}, {"section_title": "Data Classification and Coding", "text": "The aforementioned data sources were reviewed for incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases for the time periods of available data specific to each nation. The demographic variables (age, gender, ethnic group, year of diagnosis, residency setting rural/urban) and two pathological variables (anatomical subsite and histological type) were recorded. Cases with unknown gender or less than 15 years at diagnosis were excluded from analysis. Two centers in our sample (Nicaragua and Panama) had already recorded age in groups subsets (15-44, 45-54, etc.) so data sets were collected to fit in the same age groups. Fifty-five years was selected as the main age cutoff because it was the point estimate closest to 60 years, the cutoff used in the largest US SEER reviews [18, 19] . Anatomical subsite and histological type were grouped using the International Classification of Disease for Oncology 3 (ICD-O-3) codes [19] .\nThe classification of urban and rural status followed the norms of each available nation's data. The cases in Guatemala were classified by their residency municipality (municipio) as rural or urban according to the National Statistics Institute (INE) Population and Habitat 2002 census [20] . In El Salvador, cases were classified as rural or urban by each hospital's database. In Costa Rica data, the National Cancer Registry records cases as urban, rural, or semiurban according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) criteria. Semiurban cases were included in the rural group. All cases in western Honduras, the region bordering Guatemala and El Salvador, were considered rural. Lastly, in the US cases, classification was based on the 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for each county reported. All metropolitan areas were considered urban and the remaining counties were considered rural [17] .\nA summary analysis was also conducted for the Central America Four (CA-4) nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. The nations are interconnected by geography, history, ethnicity, language, and culture. The CA-4 Border Control Agreement opened the borders in 2006 and in some respects, began the transition towards a union of many aspects of their infrastructures and health systems, suggesting that a regional approach to cancer control is necessary. The CA-4 comprises four of the seven LMICs in Latin America, along with Bolivia, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic [21, 22] . Importantly, the CA-4 constitutes the majority of Central American recent immigrants to the USA, which overall make up the second largest US Hispanic immigrant population after Mexico. Given the modest rates of gastric cancer in Mexico, immigrants from the CA-4 may represent those at highest risk for gastric cancer among Hispanics [21] .\nThe four digit topography site codes (C16, stomach cancer) were used to extract and analyze the incident cases of gastric cancer. For the subsite analysis, pylorus C16.4 and fundus C16.1 locations were grouped as fundus, and corpus C16.2, lesser curvature C16.5, and greater curvature C16.6 were grouped as corpus. Histology was classified per the Lauren system and considered intestinal, diffuse, or other based on ICD-O-3 codes using the same classification as Anderson et al. [19] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Raw frequencies and percentage of cases for available data from each nation are reported. Overall incidence rates were not calculated due to lack of population-at-risk data for most countries. IARC country cancer incidence rates (GLOBOCAN 2008) are presented for comparison purposes [6] . Because data sources are heterogeneous and methodology for cases registration is non-uniform, no statistical tests were used to compare differences between countries. Data was summarized using Excel (Microsoft Office 2007) and Stata (Stata SE11.2). Institutional Review Board approval (exempt status) was obtained from a national independent ethics committee in Guatemala (ZUGUEME). All data had been deidentified by the participating institutions prior to receipt by the authors (JEC, JDH) for analysis."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In Central America, a total of 19,741 incident gastric adenocarcinomas were identified from the available data sources of variable intervals during the 1985-2011 period (Table 1) . Fourteen and 15 cases of foreign nationality were excluded from the Guatemala and Costa Rica groups, respectively. Two thirds of cases were male (12,369, 62.7 %), 20.5 % were under age 55, and 58.5 % were from rural areas. As expected, nearly three fourths (14,539) of cases in our analysis were from Costa Rica, attributed to their long-standing national cancer registry. There were no evident differences in gender, age, anatomical distribution, or histologic subtype in the comparison of Costa Rica cases with those of the other Central America countries.\nIn the US SEER database 1985-2009, 7871 incident gastric cancer cases were identified among Hispanics (Table 2) . Twenty-seven cases were excluded from analysis due to potentially contradictory race (14 American Indian/Alaska Native, 13 Asian), despite being classified as Hispanic per the HLIA algorithm. Overall among US Hispanics, 57.8 % were male and 28.9 % were under age 55 (Table 3) . For the US Hispanics born in Central America with gastric cancer (n=1210), 50.3 % of cases were male and 38.1 % were under age 55. The information on anatomic location and histology was somewhat limited in the Central America databases (53 and 67 % unspecified) and SEER database (19 and 58 % unspecified). For reported data, non-cardia gastric cancer was far more common in Central America (83.3 %, n=6904/8285), among US Hispanics (80.2 %, n=4413/5501) and among Hispanics born in Central America (86.3 %, n=746/864). Cancers of the antrum were more common in Central America (73.6 %, n=4495/6105), whereas cancers of the corpus were slightly more common among US Hispanics (53.9 %, n= 2383/4413). We observed that in Central America, adenocarcinoma of the intestinal subtype was more common. Diffuse type was more common in the US Hispanics sample (Table 3) . Specifically, the intestinal type accounted for 64.3 % of gastric cancers in Central America (n=4200/6530) but only 30.5 % among US Hispanics (n=1001/3285) [19] . Of note, in Honduras, the country with highest-quality gastric cancer registry, the diffuse type was more common (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first study to describe the epidemiology of gastric adenocarcinoma in each of the Central America countries. We observed that two thirds of incident cases were male, and half of the patients came from rural areas. In comparison to US Hispanics, the patients were significantly younger [19] . Gastric cancer in developing countries tends to present at younger ages. This finding is likely explained by earlier-lifelong H. pylori infection, along with other host and environmental factors.\nNon-cardia gastric cancer was more common in all three groups (Central America, Hispanics born in Central America, and US Hispanics). Studies with data from US hospitals and SEER reviews show that in general, Hispanics have more distal type cancer than non-Hispanic whites [14, 15, 18] . In addition, most distal incident cases were found in the antrum in Central America, whereas cancer of the corpus was slightly more frequent among US Hispanics. The intestinal subtype was relatively more common in Central America (64.3 %) but less so in US Hispanics (30.5 %), with the caveat that about 50 % of the data from the registries did not report the Lauren classification. This distribution among US Hispanics is similar to the US overall distribution reported since 1977 (37.7 %, n= 9707/25,752) [19] . These findings are consistent with global observations: as countries progress through the epidemiologic transition, there is a drop in gastric carcinoma incidence primarily due to the decrease in the intestinal-type gastric cancer, which is in turn likely related to the decline in H. pylori infection rates and other environmental factors [23, 24] . Epidemiologic studies comparing the gastric cancer incidence in Asians and Asian immigrants to the USA support this transition [25, 26] .\nThe global cancer burden is expected to nearly double by 2030, with an increase from 7.6 to 13.2 million annual deaths and with the majority of the burden in LMICs. Populationbased cancer registries (PBCRs) are important for cancer control, yet nearly one fifth of countries lack PBCRs and nearly all are LMICs [22] . Our study highlights the burden of gastric adenocarcinoma in Central America and also underscores the critical need for cancer registry capacity building A number of hurdles exist to advance PBCRs in low resource settings. These include the traditional Ministry of Health priorities, budget constraints, and pathology service limitations. For instance, in many of the district hospitals in Central America, the central government is unable to fund pathology services, thereby making a standard cancer registry impossible. Studies have proposed alternative approaches to improve national cancer data for LMICs. In Nigeria, information provided by a network of 11 hospital-based cancer registries proved effective to determine the most frequent cancer types and subtypes presenting to the health care system, prioritize resource allocation, and improve cancer care delivery [27] . Clinical information systems which supplement inconsistent pathology services may improve cancer registry data in the LMIC setting. For example, longitudinal endoscopy registries can provide reliable information on gastric cancer incidence and temporary trends and identify risk factors to design and implement targeted prevention efforts [5] . Registry standardization (e.g., IARC CANREG5) may also help improve missing and incomplete data on anatomical subsite and histology, which is common, even in the high-quality Costa Rica and US SEER databases.\nOur study has a number of methodologic limitations. As noted, different diagnostic criteria and recording methodologies were used in each country. Incidence rates could only be calculated for Costa Rica, Panama, and western Honduras. In addition, underreporting is expected to be common in the CA-4 countries with sizeable rural populations: (1) Pathology services are often not available; (2) patients often present with advanced disease, particularly older patients, and often receive minimal or palliative local care [28] . As noted, nearly three fourths of the reported cases in Central America came from the Costa Rica, which only accounts for 11 % of the region's population. We did not observe significant differences in gender, age, anatomical distribution, or histologic subtype between Costa Rica and the other nations. Lastly, regarding the US SEER data, studies have shown that identification algorithms can misidentify Hispanic groups, especially US born Hispanics [29] . Furthermore, information on birthplace on SEER has not been validated, and its accuracy as an indicator of migrant status remains unknown [30] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A significant burden of gastric adenocarcinoma is observed in Central America based upon the available registry data and in spite of the probable underreporting for the LMICs in the areas. Differences are noted between Central America and US Hispanics, although a younger population appears to be affected in both regions. As seen in similar studies, there was a high prevalence of non-cardia and intestinal type of cancer in Central America. Despite the lack of population-based data, our results are consistent with the observation of a decrease in the intestinal-type gastric cancer incidence after migration, which is potentially related to the decline in H. pylori infection rates and other environmental and dietary exposures. Strengthening population-based cancer registries is critical for improved cancer control in Central America and which has implications for the growing US Hispanic population."}]
