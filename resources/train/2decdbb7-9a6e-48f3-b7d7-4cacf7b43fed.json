We determined whether A\u03b2 accumulation was associated with longitudinal changes in memory or executive function.\nAmong baseline-negative individuals, florbetapir slope (mean annual increase 0.002 \u00b1 0.008 standardized uptake value ratio units/y) was not related to age, sex, education, APOE4 status, baseline memory or executive function, temporoparietal glucose metabolism, baseline hippocampal volume, or hippocampal volume change; but it was related to higher baseline cortical florbetapir, indicating that A\u03b2 accumulation was ongoing at baseline in those who accumulated during the study. Over the course of follow-up, 13 individuals converted to florbetapir+ and 14 nearly nonoverlapping individuals converted to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease. Amyloid accumulation among baseline-negative individuals was associated with poorer longitudinal memory performance (p = 0.019), but it was not associated with changes in executive function.

[1] [2] [3] [4] Recent work has shown that A\u03b2-positive status is associated with cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals. [5] [6] [7] [8] However, the earliest stage of A\u03b2 deposition, before A\u03b2 is widespread throughout cortex, remains poorly understood. While some studies have reported no relationship between cognitive change and A\u03b2 accumulation in the negative range, 4, 9 these observations could be due to relatively limited follow-up and small sample sizes.\nA further understanding of the relevance of A\u03b2 accumulation within the negative range is important for understanding the etiology of AD and for developing A\u03b2-modifying treatments. Recent failures of clinical trials of A\u03b2-directed therapies in symptomatic people have motivated the targeting of individuals earlier in the course of disease, in hopes of reducing A\u03b2 well in advance of any clinically significant cognitive decline. [10] [11] [12] A critical question that has emerged is whether pathologically significant A\u03b2 is detectable prior to the onset of widespread cortical A\u03b2 deposition seen in A\u03b2-positive individuals. Evidence for such effects could motivate even earlier clinical trials, before amyloid PET scans become positive, and strengthen the evidence for A\u03b2 as a precipitating event in the pathogenesis of AD.\nWe examined rates of amyloid PET change using 18 F florbetapir PET in cognitively normal individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to determine whether those who were accumulating A\u03b2 were more likely to experience concurrent declines in memory or executive function. While measurement of cognitive change in association with increasing A\u03b2 has been previously limited by noise in longitudinal measurements and very slow rates of accumulation in people with low baseline A\u03b2, larger samples with longer A\u03b2 PET follow-up time have recently become available in study cohorts such as ADNI, enabling detection of subtle and early A\u03b2 changes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Participants ADNI is a multisite longitudinal biomarker study that has enrolled over 1,500 cognitively normal older individuals, people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and people with early AD (adni-info.org).\nAs of January 2017, there were 215 cognitively normal participants with at least 2 florbetapir PET scans.

Twenty-two (10%) were discordant across the 2 reference regions and were excluded from the analyses. A composite memory measurement for one individual at one timepoint was excluded due to missing data, which resulted in outlier status.\nInfluence of baseline florbetapir status on florbetapir slopes Figure 1A illustrates florbetapir trajectories as a function of baseline florbetapir status. We calculated mean annual florbetapir change for these individuals with positive and negative slopes separately (figure 1B) since averaging together negative and positive florbetapir slopes that are close to zero results in loss of information. Negative slopes in baselinenegative nonaccumulators presumably reflect measurement noise, although the possibility that A\u03b2 clearance contributes to negative slopes is conceivable. 27, 28 The mean slope of baseline-negative nonaccumulators was \u22120.004, about half of the magnitude of the positive slope in baseline-negative accumulators (0.008), which was in turn half the magnitude of the positive slope in baseline-positive accumulators (0.016).\nFlorbetapir slopes in baseline-negative normal controls Of the 142 florbetapir\u2212 individuals with at least 2 florbetapir scans, 48 (33.8%) had 2 scans, 69 (48.6%) had 3 scans, and 25 (17.6%) had 4 scans, with a mean florbetapir follow-up time of 3.9 \u00b1 1.4 years (see table 1 for participant characteristics).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We examined changes in cognition that accompanied A\u03b2 changes in cognitively normal individuals. Increasing florbetapir\u2212 PET over a follow-up period of 2-6 years (2-4 scans; mean follow-up time 3.9 \u00b1 1.4 years) in otherwise cognitively normal, baseline A\u03b2-negative individuals was associated with memory decline, and not with baseline cognitive performance or executive function decline. A\u03b2 accumulation in baseline A\u03b2-negative individuals was not related to demographic variables or other biomarkers, but greater accumulation was associated with higher baseline A\u03b2, indicating that accumulation was ongoing prior to the start of scanning. The association was slightly strengthened by the elimination of slopes estimated by only 2 timepoints, which were noisier contributors to the model than slopes estimated by 3 or more timepoints. Over the course of follow-up, 26 participants converted to either florbetapir+ or a non-normal diagnosis (MCI, AD), and these participants played an important role but did not drive the association with memory decline. These results indicate that even individuals categorized as A\u03b2-negative may be in preclinical stages of AD, and that subtle memory decline is an early consequence of cortical A\u03b2 deposition that can be detected even within the negative range.\nIt is important to note that overall the longitudinal cognitive and A\u03b2 changes we detected were subtle and were likely influenced by considerable variability. Examination of baseline-negative individuals in figure 1 , however, shows many baseline-negative individuals with steep and persuasively increasing slopes, which seem unlikely to simply reflect noise. Furthermore, florbetapir change was not related to volumetric change in the hippocampus or in brain regions making up the florbetapir cortical summary region. Practicerelated memory and executive function improvement due to repeated exposure to the neuropsychological battery is another source of variability that can be observed in figure 3 for many baseline-negative individuals (particularly those who were not accumulating A\u03b2). It is therefore apparent that the memory change experienced by those who accumulated A\u03b2 was characterized by the combination of the absence of a practice effect and a decline in performance. This is consistent with a study reporting longitudinal improvement on the same memory composite measurement in a nearly nonoverlapping sample of ADNI cognitively normal individuals. 16 Furthermore, about 18% of individuals in our study converted to MCI or AD (about 3% per year) or to florbetapir-positive (also about 3% per year, but with surprisingly minimal overlap between diagnostic change and change in amyloid status). However, the majority of participants remained cognitively normal and florbetapir\u2212 over follow-up. Overall these findings indicate that there are small but measurable memory changes that accompany A\u03b2 accumulation within the negative range and around the threshold in cognitively normal older individuals, prior to the appearance of extensive and widespread cortical amyloid deposition (A\u03b2 positivity).\nA key feature of our findings is that slight elevations in A\u03b2 within the negative range have not been previously linked to cognitive changes. In contrast, several studies have reported that A\u03b2-positive status is associated with cognitive decline, even in cognitively normal individuals. [5] [6] [7] [8] Our observation that baseline-positive A\u03b2 status was associated with poorer memory decline (and marginally, executive function decline) than baseline-negative status (regardless of subsequent accumulation) was consistent with these previous findings. However, previous work has observed no relationship between cognitive change and A\u03b2 accumulation in the negative range. 4, 9 The fact that we did observe this effect when previous studies have not may depend on a number of factors, including the use of a large baseline-negative, cognitively normal sample, repeated scans over a longer follow-up time than previous studies, and a reference region optimized for longitudinal analyses. An additional feature of our study that may have enabled greater sensitivity was the use of composite memory and executive function scores designed to allow detection of subtle longitudinal change despite considerable version effects in several tests in the ADNI neuropsychological battery. 16, 17 The use of both scores revealed a domain-specific effect such that amyloid accumulation in baseline-negative normal individuals was associated with memory but not executive function decline. This domainspecific effect is in agreement with evidence that memory is uniquely vulnerable to early AD-related changes. 29, 30 It is surprising to detect memory changes that accompany very early stages of A\u03b2 accumulation since recent models of the series of pathologic changes in AD indicate that the proliferation of A\u03b2 is decoupled from memory performance with a 10-to 15-year interval between amyloid positivity and clinically meaningful cognitive deficits.\n2,3 Our findings do not necessarily refute this model, since the cognitive declines we observed were not in the range of clinically meaningful deficits. Rather our findings suggest that there is subtle variability within cognitively normal memory performance that may be explained in part by A\u03b2 accumulation. This accumulation may continue for many years while cortical A\u03b2 remains below the positivity threshold. It is also possible that many of the increasing participants are low reserve individuals who are unusually vulnerable to the effects of A\u03b2 even as they remain below the positivity threshold.\nThere are several limitations of our findings, primarily related to the detection of subtle changes in florbetapir within the negative range. First, we note that rate of A\u03b2 accumulation is strongly influenced by reference region selection. 15 However, our group and others have recently shown that the use of a reference region containing subcortical WM generates longitudinal measurements that are less noisy than those generated with the cerebellum. 15, 31, 32 Our use of this reference region is further validated by our observation of a 3%-4% per year negative-to-positive transition rate that is consistent with a rate of 3.1% reported using Pittsburgh compound B and a completely different analysis pipeline. 33 For determination of baseline florbetapir status, we used a conservative approach, requiring scans to be negative based on cortical summary regions calculated with 2 different reference regions (one optimized for cross-sectional analyses and one optimized for longitudinal analyses). This approach limited the possibility of including baseline-positive individuals who were falsely categorized as negative and who might have biased our results. Finally, while these results imply that preclinical AD may be detectable at earlier disease stages than previously reported, doing so in the context of a clinical trial will be challenging both for the reasons noted above and because considerable longitudinal follow-up is required to establish an individual as an accumulator. It remains possible, however, that a simpler heuristic will ultimately be able to estimate this individual characteristic with acceptable likelihood.\nWe found that A\u03b2 accumulation in cognitively normal, baseline-negative individuals was associated with poorer trajectories on memory (but not executive function). While previous work on A\u03b2 accumulation has primarily focused on the cognitive trajectories of individuals with widespread cortical A\u03b2 at baseline, the current findings in baseline-negative individuals are relevant to research studies and clinical trials of therapeutic treatments aimed at targeting individuals prior to Results of mixed effects models predicting longitudinal cognitive composite measurements (A = memory; B = executive function) in baseline florbetapirnegative normal controls. The primary predictor of interest is florbetapir accumulation (represented by the interaction term time \u00d7 florbetapir change; bottom row).

While we did not identify any other baseline biomarker differences between accumulators and nonaccumulators, future work should address the possibility of other biomarker changes that accompany cognitive decline, and whether other changes in other cognitive and functional domains are also detectable.\nAuthor contributions S.M.
