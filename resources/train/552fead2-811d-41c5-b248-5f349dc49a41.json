Although all constructs reside at one level at least, an organizational setting like formal education is inherently multilevel given the natural nesting of students within classes within schools within school districts. Having to deal with multilevel issues should be assumed when studying phenomena in these multilevel settings (e.g., Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994; Morgeson & Hofmann, 1999) .\nThe essential feature is that these multilevel measures are not conventional educational achievement or psychological measures because they have been designed to provide only aggregate-level information, for example, tracking how a state is performing on a mathematics or science assessment. This aggregate-level information is in contrast to the typical use of educational and psychological measures that are used for assessment of individual differences.\nBefore turning to the question of measurement validation per se, it seems fitting to say a few words about how and in what way multilevel measures may be high stakes. A common feature of high-stakes testing with individual differences measures is that the test taker is directly impacted by the use and interpretation of the test scores. On the other hand, for multilevel measures, one may conclude that the stakes are actually not very high for the individual test taker-in our examples the children or students. Because of the multilevel nature of the assessment system, the testing and assessment results are designed to provide only aggregate-level information. It should be noted, however, that multilevel measurement can be, and often by the very nature of its use in shaping policy and day-to-day initiatives is, high stakes. That is, the multiple levels of the multilevel measurement system do not buffer the child or student from implications of assessment use. An example of these high-stakes results is discussed by Linn (2006 Linn ( , 2008 and Kane (2006) when considering the consequences of test use in policymaking and evaluation. We return to the issue of high stakes when discussing the need for evaluating the inferences made from multilevel measures (i.e., measurement validity) and the validation process of multilevel measurement."}, {"section_title": "MULTILEVEL VALIDATION", "text": "The primary question in multilevel validation concerns theoretical explanations for data variability (see Zumbo, 2007 Zumbo, , 2009 , for an explication of validity from an explanation-focused point of view). In the multilevel measurement context, this translates to addressing what constitutes the level of TESTING AND MEASUREMENT FROM A MULTILEVEL VIEW theory. Clearly defining the level of theory in organizations has often proved to be problematic across many diverse multilevel settings (Dansereau, Cho, & Yammarino, 2006) . In multilevel settings, the level of measurement and/or the level of statistical analysis may not be identical to the level of theory, leading to potentially spurious inferences.\nLevel of theory, which refers to theoretical explanations for data variability (Klein et al., 1994) , has been a challenge to clearly define in many areas of multilevel research (Dansereau et al., 2006) . Inferential fallacies most often occur as a result of lack of clarity in defining the level of theory in inherently multilevel settings such as school systems. However, it is absolutely necessary to strive for a theoretical basis for inferences because when the level of measurement (i.e., data) and/or the level of statistical analysis are not identical to the level of theory, a fallacy of the wrong level (Klein et al., 1994 ) may result. In other words, an incorrect inference may be made in which a phenomenon (e.g., an effect) is attributed to one level (e.g., schools) when it actually exists at another level (e.g., individuals).\nThere are two basic forms of fallacies of the wrong level. The first is the ecological fallacy, in which unjustified inferences are drawn at the individual level on the basis of data from some aggregation of individuals (e.g., classes, schools, states, or even countries). We illustrate by using Diez-Roux's (1998) example: A finding that countries with higher median incomes are associated with higher rates of vehicular mortality does not allow an inference that the same association holds for individuals within each country. It is entirely possible that for individuals, an inverse relationship may hold.\nThe second type of fallacy is the atomistic fallacy, in which unjustified inferences are drawn at the aggregate level on the basis of data from individuals. Bliese and Halverson (1996) , for example, showed that the (negative) correlation between work hours and well-being is much smaller at the individual level than at the workgroup level. Therefore, any inferences made at the group level on the basis of the individual-level results would be incorrect, missing a relationship that emerges only at a higher level.\nThe atomistic fallacy is particularly germane in the context of measures like the EDI and the NAEP, which have been designed for interpretation only at a group level. Indeed, any interventions based on EDI or NAEP results are targeted at groups rather than at individual children. The effectiveness of these interventions should therefore be based on group-level data to avoid making an atomistic fallacy (Bliese, 2000) . To emphasize, to avoid inferential fallacies, multilevel researchers need to match the level of data with the level at which inferences are desired.\nAlthough evidence is needed to support such assertions, it may be argued that with multilevel measures like the EDI or the science and mathematics assessments of the NAEP, the primary dimension being assessed at the individual level remains the same across some levels, but secondary dimensions may arise at higher levels. That is, a secondary dimension of teacher or classroom effect or perhaps neighborhood characteristics, curricular differences, or opportunity-to-learn differences emerge across states. In short, any inferences from the individual level may not hold in the same way at higher (or lower) levels of aggregation.\nAt the very least, systematic and coherent validation evidence needs to be assembled to support the inferences at the various levels. Furthermore, the level of validation evidence needs to be in line with the level of inferences. Therefore, individual-level validity evidence (which is what is traditionally involved in validation research, such as criterion validity at the child level) does not provide sufficient validity evidence for inferences at higher levels in the system and may actually be misleading because it may miss invalidity at the aggregate level.\nIn short, the need for multilevel validation arises when one has a multilevel construct; measurement (or assessment) that occurs at the individual level and individual responses are aggregated to make inferences at a higher level. Historically, multilevel constructs have not been a widespread issue in measurement and validation because traditional views of measurement and assessment have been immersed in and emerged from an individual-differences psychological school of thought, such as Cronbach and Meehl (1955) in psychological measurement. Individual-differences researchers investigate the ways in which individual people differ in, for example, their cognitions, behavior, attitudes, aptitudes, emotions, or even physiologically. The tests and measures used at the individual level are developed for the purpose of investigating ways in which individual people differ. We do not discuss these measures herein because there are many examples and a long history of individual-differences measures of school readiness and of science or mathematics knowledge and achievement.\nTo this point, our central messages and their implications have been that multilevel constructs are different in purpose and scope from individualdifferences constructs, although they still potentially carry high stakes for the individual test taker. Likewise, multilevel constructs necessitate multilevel measures. Multilevel measurement and testing arise when one has a multilevel construct, that is, an individual-level measure (or assessment) that one aggregates to make inferences at a higher level. Historically, multilevel constructs have not been a widespread issue in measurement and validation because testing and measurement have been immersed in and emerged from individual differences. Implied in our views is that applying only traditional individual-differences psychometric methods (e.g., correlation with another TESTING AND MEASUREMENT FROM A MULTILEVEL VIEW 181 child school-readiness measure) and/or most cognitive assessment approaches is insufficient to gather evidence for the support of multilevel validation inferences using assessments like the EDI or the NAEP. In fact, individualdifferences methods are susceptible to the cross-level inferential fallacies such as the ecological fallacy or atomistic fallacy. Given the move to increase the use of assessment results in the formulation of policy and the shift in educational and psychological theorizing toward ecological views of our phenomenon, we fully expect to see more multilevel constructs in the coming years."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORETICAL AND OPERATIONAL WORK", "text": "We now turn to the implications for multilevel constructs and aggregate uses of test data for theoretical and operational (day-to-day research) work. As a starting point, multilevel psychometric research might address a number of fairly generic multilevel research questions. Some of these questions may include: (a) Does the aggregate score reflect differences between measurement units at the aggregate level, such as neighborhood differences in school readiness? (b) To what extent might other important constructs be measured unintentionally at the aggregate level that are not meant to be included in an assessment of school readiness at the aggregate level, such as classroom or teacher effects, neighborhood effects, or regional effects? or (c) When assessment data are considered at the state level, how much of the variation is attributable to state-to-state differences relative to student-to-student differences?\nWe now, however, turn to the fairly traditional measurement issues and questions of reliability, validity, and use of assessment data (as well as the reporting results) to see how they turn out to be influenced by multilevel constructs."}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Measurement", "text": "To begin, it should be noted that even the notion of quantifying measurement error (through reliability of measurement indices) becomes very complex, with several subtle issues, such as defining the unit of reference in terms of the domain scores. Of course, test-retest evidence with the aggregate unit of analysis could be used, but that also makes certain assumptions about the sources of error variance. In terms of multilevel measurement, most of the systematic work done to date involves the reliability of measurement.\nThere already exists a nice motivating context for multilevel reliability of measurement in terms of the work done on the reliability of class means (e.g., teaching evaluation data or student classroom assessment results). When classes are the units of analyses, estimates of the reliability of class means are needed. If one uses classical test theory, it is difficult to treat this problem adequately; however, generalizability theory, which is by design a multilevel measurement model, provides a framework for dealing with the problem. However, if one builds on existing literature from work on generalizability of class means, it becomes apparent that the reliability of student-level assessment can sometimes be greater and other times smaller than the aggregate level. Although summarizing this literature in detail is beyond the scope of this chapter, interested readers should see Brennan, Yin, and Kane (2003) ; Gillmore, Kane, and Naccarato (1978) ; Gillmore, Kane, and Smith (1984) ; Kane and Brennan (1977) ; Kane, Gillmore, and Crooks (1976) ; O'Brien (1990); and Yin and Brennan (2002) for a thorough treatment of the subject.\nClearly, a central issue in multilevel measurement reliability is that individual-level (person-level) reliability data cannot be counted on to make measurement reliability claims at the aggregate level. As is evident from the pioneering work of Kane, Brennan, Gillmore, and others, the level of reliability data must be matched with the level of data interpretation or the wrong conclusion about measurement reliability may result.\nWe now turn to multilevel validity and the process of validation."}, {"section_title": "Validity and the Process of Validation", "text": "The appropriate process of measurement validation for multilevel constructs is a pressing issue and one that has not been explicitly dealt with in the educational measurement literature. As we noted previously, the key is in the interpretation and use of test results at the aggregate level.\nWhat is clear is that several validity theorists and practitioners have talked at the edges of the multilevel validity (and multilevel measurement) issue, but no one seems to have taken it on at the forefront. Of course, the general theories of validity per se are writ so large that one could easily directly apply some of them (e.g., Cronbach & Meehl, 1955; Kane, 2006; Messick, 1989; Zumbo, 2007 Zumbo, , 2009 ). The issue here, however, comes to (a) what is meant by validity and (b) the many cases in which the explanatory power of the historically dominant views of validity in the assessment field is in individual differences, which in a sense diminishes the importance of aggregation and the effect of contextual variables that exist at various levels of the multilevel system. The importance of aggregation and the influence of variables at various levels of the multilevel system are limitations of taking on some of the traditional approaches to guide validity of the multilevel assessment. The interested reader should see Kane (2006) and Zumbo (2007 Zumbo ( , 2009 ) for a review of contemporary thinking in validity as well as Linn (2006 Linn ( , 2008 for a discussion of validating school quality inferences from student assessments.\nOne certainty, though, is that measurement programs need to have an articulated, coherent, and a consistent validation plan that amasses the"}, {"section_title": "TESTING AND MEASUREMENT FROM A MULTILEVEL VIEW 183", "text": "theoretical and empirical evidence that supports the inferences being made with the test or measure at the various levels.\nZumbo's Draper-Lindly-DeFinetti framework (Zumbo, 2007) puts importance on the sampling units (the respondents) and their characteristics, something that is not highlighted enough in the conventional discussions of psychometrics and validity evidence. Most, but not all, validation studies in the research literature give little time to the exchangeability of the sampled and unsampled units. In addition, there is little discussion in the psychometric literature of matters of complex sampling. The complex multilevel assessment data now being collected by many government, health, and social science organizations around the world have increasingly complex structures, precipitating a need for ways of incorporating these complex sampling designs into psychometric models. It is worth noting that the Draper-Lindly-DeFinetti framework framework shines a spotlight on the person-sampling aspect of measurement, which has mostly held a secondary place to item or domain sampling in psychometrics.\nWhenever data are aggregated over one or more levels (e.g., schools, neighborhoods, states), the procedure must be justified in terms of establishing an alignment between the nature of the construct, its measurement, and its analysis vis-\u00e0-vis other constructs of interest. In Table 11 .1, we build on Bliese (2004a, 2004b) for a series of adapted step-by-step procedures for conducting multilevel construct validation.\nThe first step in the Chen et al. (2004a Chen et al. ( , 2004b framework deals with the theoretical issues of construct definition, such as the construct's domain boundaries and dimensionality. The purpose of this step is to establish the Gather evidence appropriate to the psychometric properties across levels and multilevel latent variable (i.e., factor analysis and item response) modeling. 4"}, {"section_title": "ZUMBO AND FORER", "text": "For construct variability within and between units \u2162 Ensure there is sufficient variability within and between units (i.e., at lower and higher levels). \u2162 For some aggregate-level measures, intermember reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients) can provide relevant evidence.\nextent to which the meaning of a construct does or does not differ across levels. The second step in the framework is articulating the nature of the aggregate construct. There are two basic categories of aggregate measures: (a) global measures that describe the group as a whole and (b) measures that summarize a collection of lower level (usually individual) scores (Hofmann & Jones, 2004) . The EDI and the NAEP are examples of an aggregate construct of the latter category. When aggregating scores, there are at least six compositional models from which to choose (see Chen et al., 2004a) . The appropriateness of a particular compositional model depends on both one's multilevel theoretical expectations and observed patterns of within-group and between-groups variation.\nThe first compositional model is the selected-score model, in which the score of one individual characterizes the group-level construct. The second is the summary index model, in which the group construct is based on a statistical summary (typically the mean or sum) of individual scores in a group. This is the compositional model most often used to create aggregate-level EDI or NAEP scores. The third is the consensus model, in which group-level constructs capture within-group agreement based on items that refer to the individual (e.g., individuals asked to rate their own teaching effectiveness). The fourth model is the referent-shift consensus model, which differs from the consensus model only in that it captures within-group agreement based on items that refer to the group (e.g., individuals asked to rate their department's teaching effectiveness). The fifth model is the dispersion model, which focuses on within-group variability and is most often expressed in the aggregate in terms of group diversity (e.g., heterogeneity of teaching styles among department members). Chen et al.'s (2004a) sixth and final model is the aggregate properties model, in which group constructs are directly measured at the group level (e.g., asking a school principal to rate staff effectiveness).\nThe third step in the construct validation process is to gather evidence appropriate to the nature of the construct and the composition model at the aggregate level. Depending on the model, this involves considering withingroup agreement on item scores, factor structure across levels, and reliability of item scores. Within-group agreement, for instance, is particularly relevant for compositional models based on consensus of individuals. With regard to factor structure, the amount of expected similarity across levels should be theory driven (Chen et al., 2004a) . Finally, depending on the compositional model, reliability of the item scores at the group level can be calculated quite differently because of different assumptions about systematic and error variance.\nThe fourth step in the multilevel construct validation process is an analysis of the relative amounts of within-group and between-groups variation, which provides empirical guidance about appropriate levels of aggregation. Bliese (2000) and Chen et al. (2004a) discussed three different measures that can help assess whether data collected from individuals have group-level properties. First, the level of nonindependence in data can be measured using an intraclass correlation coefficient, or ICC(1), which represents the proportion of individual variance that is influenced by or depends on group membership. A second important aspect of potential aggregation is between-groups reliability, or ICC(2), which indexes the reliability of differences between group means by measuring the proportional consistency of variance across groups (Bliese, 2000) . The third measure is within-group reliability, which is the degree to which group means can be reliably estimated even when group size is relatively small. The fourth aspect of group properties is within-group agreement, most commonly measured using the r wg statistic.\nWithin-and-between analysis (Dansereau & Yammarino, 2000) is an alternative multilevel validation technique that compares patterns of within-group and between-groups variability to determine appropriate levels of aggregation. Kim (2004) pointed out that the ICC approach to comparing between-groups and within-group variance suggested by Bliese (2000) and Chen et al. (2004a) works well for constructs based on betweengroups variance (i.e., analysis of variance model) but not as well as the within-and-between analysis approach for constructs based on within-group variance.\nOf particular methodological importance are the multilevel latent variable modeling strategies for specification of both between-groups and within-group latent variable models by Grilli and Rampichini (2007) ; Muth\u00e9n (1994) ; RabeHesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles (2004); and Rijmen, Tuerlinckx, De Boerck, and Kuppens (2003) . In particular, those interested in predictive validity evidence across levels of aggregation (e.g., how student-level data can be used for predictive validity studies when making state-level comparisons) should consult Croon and van Veldhoven (2007) . This research illustrates (a) how regression models that are conducted at the aggregated level (a common practice when conducting criterion validity studies in multilevel measurement settings) result in biased parameter estimates and, hence, for our purposes, incorrect validity conclusions and (b) a latent variable multilevel model to correctly perform these analyses."}, {"section_title": "Use of Multilevel Assessment Data and Reporting Results", "text": "We have only some minor observations on the use of multilevel assessment data and the reporting of results. In particular, we want to highlight how the use of assessment and the reporting of results tie into and highlight the highstakes notion of these multilevel assessments. First, it is important to note that Kane's (2006) review chapter on validity deals with a related and central issue of consequential aspects of validity and how this connects to accountability in, for example, program evaluation. Second, Linn (2008) put the matter of the need for what we would call multilevel construct validity most succinctly; when discussing the validity of school quality inferences from student assessments, he wrote the following:\nThe use of student assessment results to identify schools that need improvement and are therefore subject to various types of corrective actions or sanctions while other schools are identified as making adequate yearly progress rests on an implicit assumption that the observed school-toschool differences in student achievement are due to differences in school quality. . . . The validity of the school quality inference needs to be evaluated. (Linn, 2008, p. 12) From our point of view, Linn (2008) was challenging the field to think about the potential errors in inference that can be made across levels of data, that is, what was previously referred to as ecological or atomistic fallacies of data inferences. In fact, the potential error in inference across levels of data further opens up Messick's as well as Cronbach's notions of the consequential considerations of test use and reporting and how these play into the validity of the measurement inferences. In this light, one needs to think about the cross-level consequences and the eventual trickle-down of the high stakes resulting from the use and reporting of multilevel assessment data."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "In summary, applying traditional individual-differences validation methods (e.g., correlation with another individual-differences measure) is insufficient to gather evidence to support multilevel validation inferences. In fact, individual-differences validation methods are susceptible to the cross-level inferential fallacies, such as the ecological or atomistic fallacies. Multilevel measurement and multilevel construct validation involves steps beyond the validation of single-level constructs. An important point to keep in mind is that even highly isomorphic multilevel constructs can have similar and distinct antecedents, correlates, and outcomes across levels. Assuming that they are only similar can lead to cross-level inferential fallacies from individual-level data. From the vantage point of the successes achieved by the NAEP and the EDI, the move to the increased policy usage of assessment results, and the shift in educational and psychological theorizing toward ecological views of our phenomenon, we fully expect to see more multilevel constructs in the coming years."}, {"section_title": "TESTING AND MEASUREMENT FROM A MULTILEVEL VIEW", "text": ""}]
