[{"section_title": "", "text": "Institutions in the United States have been producing PhDs in mathematics education for more than a century. Teachers College at Columbia University and the University of Chicago produced the first graduates in mathematics education in 1906 and 1912, respectively [1] . In those institutions, doctoral students in mathematics education typically took courses along with doctoral students in mathematics. However, the dissertation research took a different direction as doctorates in mathematics education focused on issues related to mathematics learning, teaching, or curriculum. Over the past fifty years the nature of doctoral programs in mathematics education has taken many different paths [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . While some doctoral programs remain in mathematics departments, today the majority of doctoral programs in mathematics education are in colleges/schools of education. Some doctoral programs in mathematics education continue to require a substantial amount of mathematics, while others require very little graduate-level mathematics.\nThis article highlights the production of doctorates in mathematics education for the past fifty years. Figure 1 shows the annual total number of doctoral graduates in mathematics education from the first Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) in mathematics education in 1962 to the most recent data available from 2014 [6] . Figure 1 shows annual variability, with several valleys and peaks, ranging from a low of 14 doctoral graduates in mathematics education in 1962 to highs of 153 graduates (1972) and 161 graduates (2009). The steady increase in doctoral graduates in mathematics education during the latter 1960s and early 1970s coincided with the \"modern mathematics era\" and can likely be attributed to the number of Summer Institutes for K-12 mathematics teachers supported by the National Science Foundation at institutions of higher education throughout the United States during this period [7] . Many middle and secondary mathematics teachers took advantage of these opportunities to pursue a doctorate in mathematics education."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "About twenty years later another steady increase occurred in the production of doctorates. This increase might be attributed to a surge in recruitment efforts due to an announced shortage of doctorates in mathematics education in institutions of higher education [8], [9] . In 2000 the National Science Foundation began funding several Centers for Learning and Teaching that were designed, among other things, to increase the production of doctorates in mathematics education. This likely contributed to the steady increase of doctoral graduates in mathematics education during the twenty-first century. The increasing number of different institutions awarding doctorates is another pattern shown in Table 1 . During the initial time period (1962-64) there were a total of 81 doctoral graduates, and they completed their degrees from thirty-seven different institutions. The number of different institutions awarding degrees has steadily increased over the years, with over one hundred different institutions graduating doctorates in mathematics education during each of the last four 5-year increments. Table 2 identifies the ten institutions producing the most doctoral graduates for each of the last five decades. An examination of Table 2 shows that Teachers College, Columbia University, has been the highest producer of doctoral graduates in mathematics education, ranking number one in five of the six time periods. Ohio State University has also been among the top ten each period.\nFurther examination of Table 2 shows that some institutions, such as Illinois State University, have developed into large producers of doctoral graduates in mathematics education during the last two decades, whereas some high producers in earlier decades, such as Wayne State University, are no longer present.\nOf further interest is that over one half of the largest producers average less than two doctoral graduates a year, and about one fourth of them average less than one graduate a year over a decade. The SED data reveal that one hundred eighty different institutions graduated at least one doctorate in mathematics education from 2000 to 2014. Further examination showed that about forty-one of these institutions graduated a total of one doctorate in mathematics education, and over one half (55 percent) of the institutions graduated a total of five or fewer doctorates during this 15-year period."}, {"section_title": "Some Takeaway Points for Doctoral Graduates", "text": "\u2022 The number of doctoral graduates in mathematics education has been increasing each decade, with dramatic increases in the last ten years.\n\u2022 The number of doctoral graduates in mathematics education varies annually but has averaged about 120 during each of the last ten years.\n\u2022 The majority-over 60 percent-of doctoral graduates in mathematics education are female.\n\u2022 The percent of minority doctoral graduates in mathematics education has ranged from 5 to 17 percent across the five decades, with African Americans comprising about two-thirds of the minority graduates."}, {"section_title": "Some Takeaway Points for Institutions", "text": "\u2022 The number of different institutions awarding doctorates in mathematics education has been increasing each decade."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Two institutions (Ohio State University and Teachers", "text": "College, Columbia University) have consistently ranked among the top ten producers of doctorates in mathematics education in each decade.\n\u2022 During the last fifteen years (2000-2014) there were one hundred eighty institutions that graduated at least one doctorate in mathematics education. Nearly 40 percent of the institutions graduated just one or two doctorates in mathematics education."}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "text": "This brief history of the production of doctorates in mathematics education documents the changing nature of the doctoral graduates as well as the increasing number of institutions that produce them. Unfortunately, these data do not provide insight into the academic content of the doctoral programs or the nature of the additional experiences that ultimately shape the preparation of doctoral graduates in mathematics education. While it is safe to say that every PhD in mathematics has successfully completed graduate-level courses in advanced calculus and analysis, it is not possible to identify any specific course(s) with certainty that all doctoral graduates in mathematics education have completed. Additional research into the overall nature of doctoral programs in mathematics education across a wide variety of institutions of higher education is sorely needed. Table 2 .
