[{"section_title": "| INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. By 7th January 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia. 1 Cases have now spread to 190 countries. As of 23rd March 2020 there were more than 372 000+ confirmed cases and 16 000+ deaths. 2 Although the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was occurring. 3 The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalized with pneumonia. 4 A global pandemic has erupted due to a high proportion of asymptomatic patients coupled with a high degree of viral shedding, long incubation period, and late clinical manifestations. Prolific testing coupled with case isolation and contact tracing, therefore, remains one of the most effective epidemiological interventions to stop early community spread. Unfortunately, the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 meant that no testing was immediately available, making it difficult for public health officials to get ahead of the pandemic curve.\nAs State public health laboratories became backlogged, Baylor Scott and White Health (BSWH), a large, not-for-profit integrated healthcare delivery system in north and central Texas, collaborated with the Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX) to implement a SARS-CoV-2 realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay using the genetic primers previously used in China to help relieve the bottleneck. The BSWH laboratory was one of the first laboratories in Texas to implement SARS-Co-V2 testing to assist state public health officials in their efforts to isolate patients and track their immediate contacts. As the pandemic continues to spread across the nation, goal of this study was to share the early clinical trends for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in north and central regions of Texas, to encourage other laboratories to consider early implementation of testing during future pandemics. This study also reports the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 on other seasonal respiratory viruses in this region, the spread of which may have been affected by epidemiological interventions introduced in response to SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "| Study design, setting, and participants", "text": "This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients (age >18 years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 collected through BSWH testing sites from 11th March 2020 to 23rd March 2020. BSWH is a large, not-for-profit integrated health care delivery system, with 52 hospitals and more than 1000 care sites, serving patients in 47 counties in north and central Texas. All SARS-CoV-2 tests included in this study were performed at the molecular pathology laboratory located within BSWH, Temple.\nAll ambulatory care patients were prescreened according to World Health Organization and BSWH guidelines to be eligible for SARS-CoV-2 testing via the BSWH web portal, phone app and/or through an e-visit before making an appointment for specimen collection at one of the several designated BSWH locations. Patients were asked about current symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, as well as travel and other exposure history.\nWhen clinically indicated, SARS-CoV-2 testing was ordered by the attending physician or other care providers.\nNo prescreening was done for emergency department (ED)/inpatients. In these settings, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing from all patients showing signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAs BSWH laboratory continues testing, this study included data from the day testing began on 11th March 2020 to 23rd March 2020.\nThese two hospital systems within BSWH represent central and north Texas population and are limited to these regions of Texas due to community outreach. Study includes data for SARS-CoV-2 testing from these two regions and seasonal respiratory virus testing data is limited to central Texas region. The SARS-CoV-2 primers were designed by Luminex to detect RNA targets from the SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from patients, as recommended for testing by public health authority guidelines. Luminex Aries employs primers for amplifying the ORF1 gene and the N gene from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the assay includes extraction and internal controls (Human RNAase P) built into the same cartridge, to verify sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper system and reagent performance. Luminex Aries offers true random-access testing, unlike the Luminex NxTAG platform, an assay for batched testing (offering high throughput capabilities) on which increased demand for testing necessitated validation. The Luminex NxTAG method also includes an additional Envelope (E) gene target for SARS-CoV-2 detection. F I G U R E 1 Baylor Scott and White Memorial hospital initiated testing on 11th March 2020 following an Emergency Use Authorization submission to Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The data shown represents more than 3500 tests were performed between 11th and 23rd March 2020 for the two different regions of Texas State (Central and North)"}, {"section_title": "| Other respiratory virus testing", "text": "The typical turnaround time from specimen collection to verification of test results was less than 15 hours."}, {"section_title": "Luminex received EUAs for its NxTAG and ARIES platform", "text": "Sars-CoV-2 assays on 27th March and 3rd April 2020, respectively."}, {"section_title": "| SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and age distribution", "text": "A total of 3571 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR tests were performed at the BSWH-Temple laboratory, 1912 specimens were received from ambulatory or drive-through collection sites, and 1659 from ED/inpatient settings.

Real-time rRT-PCR is already widely deployed in diagnostic virology laboratories; our experience demonstrates that institutions with molecular testing F I G U R E 3 Data shown are daily positives from 11th March 2020 to 23rd March 2020.

In the race against this pandemic, real-time data empower epidemiologists and public health officials to identify, track, and contain spread as much as possible. Integrating laboratorybased reporting with epidemiologic surveillance registers will only improve public health outcomes.\nThe intent of this study was not to assess the performance characteristics of the rRT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accurate determination of test performance characteristics will require appropriate distribution of cohorts among the general population. This is specifically true in the context of virus shedding, transmission dynamics, asymptomatic carriers, and specimen requirements that are still being debated and investigated. SARS-CoV-2 has exhibited a great degree of plasticity in all of the above properties; hence it may take additional time and understanding to determine the performance characteristics of the assay.\nThe evidence available from the literature at the initiation of the public health emergency was sparse for US healthcare systems. The only country with published data and epidemiological or management studies was China. 7 However, the structure of both the political and the health care system in China is very different from the United States, where healthcare is regional and private for most part, and much of the public health authority is decentralized and vested in state and local governments. While these structures create challenges for the coordinated, authoritarian type of response China implemented to control and mitigate its. SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the substantial autonomy they provide creates opportunities to try to improve and optimize diagnosis, management and partnership with public health officials. In this context, BSWH ramped up efforts in laboratory diagnosis and collegial collaboration with public health officials to support effective epidemiological interventions.\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms range from nonspecific mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress, 4 and because these symptoms are very similar to those of many seasonal viruses, 8 BSWH implemented outpatient screening protocols hosted on the BSWH web portal, phone app, and e-visit sites to ensure appropriate prescreening of individuals for targeted laboratory testing.\nReal-time RT-PCR testing for various other infections is widely deployed in most diagnostic laboratories. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology and infrastructure to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available. In addition to information on reagents, oligonucleotides, and positive controls, laboratories working under quality control programs need to rely on documentation of technical qualification of the assay formulation as well as data from external clinical evaluation tests. 8, 9 Everything listed above can be true for a laboratory-developed test; however, if commercial manufacturers design assays under FDA oversight, all of the above requirements can be mitigated.

We demonstrate that proactive collaboration with assay manufacturers can enable laboratories to be prepared for-or respond rapidly to-emerging diseases like COVID-19. Epidemiological interventions depend on availability of accurate diagnostic tests and high throughput capacity during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2. It is also important to have a well-organized plan to report the test results to public health officials to initiate counter measures to control the infections, and to build a diagnostic algorithm to include testing for other seasonal respiratory viruses, especially most common viruses like influenza and RSV, which may require medical attention."}]
