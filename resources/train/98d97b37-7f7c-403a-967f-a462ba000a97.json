It refers to the diversity in the DNA sequence in human genomes and it may affect how an individual develops a disease or and responds to drugs, vaccines, pathogens, and etc [5, 2] . The most common type of genetic variation is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-i.e., a difference in a single nucleotide in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) [13] . In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWA studies or GWAS), which aim at revealing the relationships between genetic variants such as SNPs and individual traits, have attracted much attention achieved considerable success [14, 25, 28] .\nTraditional GWA studies are based on statistical tests. Genetic risk factors are determined by their statistical significance, where a general procedure is to perform a statistical test between each individual SNP and the phenotype under investigation [29, 8, 7] . For example, via meta-analyses, 11 new susceptibility SNPs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified [15] ; 10 loci that may influence allergic sensitization have been detected [3] . However, such kind of approaches has several limitations. First, it ignores the aggregate effects of multiple SNPs, for example, the epistatic interactions between loci [34, 17] . Second, independent SNP-phenotype testing disregards the SNPs' structural correlations associated with population genetics (i.e., linkage disequilibrium, LD) and biological relations (e.g. functional relationships between genes) [20] .\nLater, increasing attention has been focused on Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [24] ), as an alternative tool for identifying risk SNPs in GWAS [31, 26] . Lasso is a multivariate method that models multiple SNPs simultaneously and highly precarious SNPs (that related to the phenotype under investigation) can be identified through the non-zero components of the model. For example, a previous whole genome association study [31] shows Lasso together with stability selection [19] is promising in detecting risk SNPs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) . However, there are two major drawbacks of Lasso: 1) it tends to arbitrary select only one from a set of highly correlated features [10] ; 2) it considers all features equally without any further structural assumptions. To address the above issues, utilizing structured sparse models together with different biological priors has aroused growing concern in GWAS, as incorporating such assumptions is favorable for model construction and interpretation [32] . There are several attempts, for example, group Lasso [18] , tree Lasso [26] , and absolute fused Lasso [30] .\nIt is worth mentioning that all those aforementioned approaches are based on the nucleotide-level biological assumptions (e.g. LD or the consistency of successive SNPs). However, in real-world, at nucleotidelevel, neither structural associations, nor functional relationships, nor interaction mechanisms, have been well-studied to date. On the other hand, studies of biological mechanisms are more rigorous and legitimate at gene-level. For example, GeneMANIA [27] is a powerful tool for revealing gene-level biological networks. It integrates a large set of functional association data, including protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. As a consequence, it is potentially beneficial to utilize such gene-level priors in nucleotide-level GWAS studies.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel two-level structured sparse model, called Sparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG), which a is promising method for identifying significant SNPphenotype associations. As its name indicates, SGLGG can be considered as a fusion model of a sparse group Lasso [33, 9] and a group-level graph Lasso (a.k.a., graph-guided fused Lasso [6] ). Essentially, our proposed model involves two levels of predictors-i.e., the nucleotide-level predictors and the gene-level predictors. And consequently in a GWA study, SGLGG will penalize the following three respects: 1. the gene-level sparsity; 2. the graph structure among gene-level predictors; 3. the nucleotide-level sparsity.\nAs a result, SGLGG tends to select only a set of causal SNPs within a gene group and limited gene groups among the entire sequence. Meanwhile, it is capable of taking advantages of biological priors (i.e., gene networks) during the gene-level selection. With the graph constraint, highly relevant genes are likely to be chosen simultaneously, and thus SNPs from different gene scopes are potentially able to connect. SGLGG is hard to solve due to its complex sparse-inducing regularizers. To this end, we first transfer the edge constraints among the graph into the matrix form, and then, employ the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers [4] ) algorithm for optimizing. Experiments have been conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) whole genome sequence (WGS) data and neuroimage data, for both regression tasks and variable selection tasks. Preliminary results show that SGLGG is competitive to the state-of-the-arts sparse models in predicting AD-related imaging phenotypes. In addition, stability selection results demonstrate that SGLGG is promising for identifying risk SNPs associated with Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Our Model: SGLGG", "text": "Essentially, we consider a linear prediction model. Given a centered data matrix A \u2208 R n\u00d7p with n observations and p features, and a corresponding response y \u2208 R n . Suppose that p predictors can be divided into K non-overlapping groups, with p k the number of low-level predictors in group k. Accordingly, we denote s \u2208 R p be the low-level predictors and g \u2208 R K be the group-level predictors, respectively. Then, the low-level predictor s can be represented as s = [s 11 . . . s 1p 1 . . . s k1 . . . s kp k ]. We further denote\nwhere \u2022 is the Hadamard product operator, M \u2208 R k\u00d7p is a designed mapping matrix 1 , and g i , i \u2208 [1, k] is the i-th element of g. The group-level graph 2 information is described by G \u2261 (s K , E), where s K = {1, 2, . . . , k} is a set of nodes, and E is the set of edges. In addition, let w g \u2208 R K denote the weight vector corresponding to the group-level predictors, and r ij denote the weight of the edge between node g i and g j . Hence, in this paper, we consider the following optimization problem:\nwhere (\u00b7) is a convex empirical loss function (e.g. the least squares) and the error is calculated based on G s -a combination of predictors g and s via M; \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 \u2265 0; and \u03c4 (r ij ) represent a general monotonically increasing function weight function that enforces a fusion effect between coefficients g i and g j . In Eq. (1), the first constraint can be considered as a group-level sparsity constraint, the second constraint introduces the group-level graph structure via the fused Lasso, and the third constraint penalizes the low-level sparsity. Hereby, we call Problem (1), the Sparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG) problem. More specifically, in a GAW study, s represents the nucleotide-level predictor, and accordingly, g can be considered as the gene-level predictor. Therefore, an ideal solution to Eq. (1) will lead to the following scenarios: 1) only limited gene groups will be selected among the entire sequence; 2) the group selection is guided by the gene-level biological priors-i.e., relevant genes are more likely to be chosen simultaneously; and 3) only a subset of SNPs will be selected within a selected gene. In other words, the gene-level and nucleotide-level constraints ensure that the most relevant gene groups and SNPs within a gene will be chosen by the model. Meanwhile, the group selection will be affected by the gene-level priors-i.e., some inter-gene SNP-SNP connections could be revealed by the graph constraint.\nFurthermore, the grpah constriant in Eq. (1) can be reformualted into a matrix form. Denote T be the sparse matrix constructed from the edge set E, where t ij = t ji = r ij if there is a edge between g i and g j . Furthermore, for discussion convenience, we ignore the weight vectors in Eq. (1), then SGLGG problem can be simplified as the following matrix form:\n3 ADMM for Solving SGLGG"}, {"section_title": "ADMM basic", "text": "Due to the complex sparse-inducing regularizers, unconstrianted optimzation problem like (1) are sometimes hard to solve directly. Instead, it is possbile to reformulate the original unconstrianted problem to an equivalent constrained problem. In the sequel, such a problem can be addressed using constrained optimization methods such as the augmented Lagrangian method. Hereby, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [4, 21] algorithm to solve Problem (1). ADMM is a variant of the augmented Lagrangian method. It utilizes dual decomposition and partial updates for the dual variables. Without loss of generality, we consider the following constraint optimization problem:\nwhere f and g are convex, x \u2208 R p , z \u2208 R q , A \u2208 R n\u00d7p , B \u2208 R n\u00d7q , and c \u2208 R n .

However, most SNPs selected by FL, AFL, and our proposed SGLGG model are clustered in a few small regions. 2. SNPs groups identified by SGLGG are different from FL or AFL, where the proposed method tends to select more SNPs within a gene but fewer number of genes in total. 3.
