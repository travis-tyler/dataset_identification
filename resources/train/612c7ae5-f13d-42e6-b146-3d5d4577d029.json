[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The levees protecting Oakland International Airport (OAK, see Figures 1 and 2) were evaluated for their ability to protect the airport from 100-year flooding due to tides, storm surge, and waves in San Francisco Bay. Historical tidal data, hydrodynamic and wave modeling, and empirical relations were used to determine the levee height and armor type necessary for this level of protection. To determine what level of protection is necessary at OAK, coastal conditions had to be evaluated to determine the 100-year (1% annual chance) still water level (SWL), total water level (TWL), and erosive power. Total water level is equal to the sum of SWL (including both tidal stage and storm surge) and wave runup. Since OAK is located well within shallow San Francisco Bay, ocean swell and tsunami are not items of concern (Borrero et al, 2006). Due to limited computational resources and the limited correlation between observed still water level (including storm surge) and wind velocity, ranking methods were developed to determine which SWL and wind events likely generated the largest annual total water levels, which were then determined accurately via a two-dimensional wave model. These ranking methods were similarly applied to determine the largest annual wave heights, for use in sizing riprap in the levee design."}, {"section_title": "DETERMINING DESIGN STILL WATER LEVEL", "text": "The design SWL was determined through a combination of historical tide data and 2-D hydrodynamic modeling. The NOAA tide gauge at San Francisco's Presidio (23 km northwest of OAK) has recorded hourly data since 1902, while that at the Alameda NOAA gauge (9 km northwest of OAK) has such data available since 1996 (Table 1). In order to estimate the largest SWL events at OAK, a transfer function was developed by using a least squares fit between the maximum daily stages at Presidio and Alameda during Alameda's 13 years of record. Since this analysis is concerned only with flood water levels, only the daily maximum water levels (not hourly water levels) were used for this procedure. The transfer function was then applied to all 107 years of water level data at the Presidio, to generate a 107-year water level record at Alameda. During the period of record for the Presidio gauge, a long-term increase in sea level has occurred due to climactic changes. To provide a consistent record of water level (i.e., related to a common sea level), the data were adjusted to the sea level on December 31, 2008. As expected, this trend equals approximately 2 mm/year, which is near global average sea level rise over the past century (Church & White, 2006). However, since the change in water level due to sea level rise was determined only using maximum daily water levels (and not hourly water levels), it also takes into account the historic change in tidal amplitude that may have accompanied the rise in the mean sea level. Since flood water levels are being simulated, this change in tidal amplitude could be important. After correcting for historic sea level rise (SLR), the Danish Hydraulics Institute (DHI) MIKE-21 two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to generate a transfer function relating SWL at Alameda to SWL at OAK. The model boundary conditions were tidal stage outside the Golden Gate and winds recorded at OAK. To limit model simulations only a single year was used to generate a transfer function from the Alameda gauge to OAK. The 1998 water year was chosen for simulation because this was a wet year, so storm surge effects were present in the boundary conditions. The resulting transfer function allowed maximum daily SWL at OAK to be determined based on the Alameda gauge data. The maximum annual SWL for each of the 107 years of data at OAK were then extracted and fit with a 3-parameter Weibull distribution, allowing the 1% annual chance (100-year) SWL (or any other return period event) to be determined ( Figure 3). For planning purposes, the 100-year event for the year 2100 was also evaluated, by considering SLR of 1.4 m (Rahmstorf, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "METHOD 1 RANKING FOR TOTAL WATER LEVEL", "text": "Determination of 100-year total water level (TWL) at Oakland Airport (OAK) entailed determining the still water level (SWL) plus wave runup. SWL and runup are not independent but are physically correlated, e.g. a strong onshore wind would generate both large waves (affecting runup) and a storm surge (affecting SWL); even the storm surge itself could result in larger waves in shallow areas by increasing the maximum wave height before depth-induced breaking occurs. To analyze TWL using a Monte Carlo method would require that the correlation between SWL and wind be known. Instead, to maintain this correlation, the TWL was calculated using a time-series analysis of concurrently observed winds and water levels. Hourly water level at OAK was determined via the method described above for SWL. That is, the observed 106 year long time series from Presidio, corrected for sea level rise, was transformed to Alameda. Water levels at Alameda were then transformed to OAK using another transfer function. This is the same procedure as above, except that here it's carried out with the full set of hourly data, not just daily maxima. Hourly wind data were obtained for OAK as shown in the wind roses in Figures 4 and 5. OAK water levels were interpolated onto the same time base as the wind data. However, the entire hourly time series, spanning from 1943-2008, was too long to evaluate with the two-dimensional MIKE21 Nearshore Spectral Wave (NSW) model. Therefore, FEMA guidance (FEMA, 2005) was adhered to, in choosing the 20 largest events each year. In order to determine which winds and water levels would likely generate the 20 largest events each year (still water level plus runup), hourly time series were evaluated for two particular winters: 1987-88 and 1997-1998. The latter winter was chosen because it spanned an El Nino event, during which many storms crossed through the area. The other winter was chosen randomly. TWL was calculated using the MIKE21 NSW results, and then ranked. It was found that most of the top 20 events each year were recognizable by the ranking parameter of Equation 1. The dimension of this parameter (m 3 /s) is meaningless, as it is used only for ranking events. The validity of equation 1in predicting the largest TWL events is shown in tables 2 and 3. For both the winter 1997-98 (El Nino) data set and the winter 1987-88 (randomly chosen) data sets, equation 1correctly predicted 8 of the 10 largest TWL events. Each water year (October 1 -September 30), all hourly wind and water level data were ranked via Equation (1). The 20 largest events were then extracted to be analyzed with MIKE21 NSW. In choosing the 20 largest events each water year, only events with wind direction between 130\u00b0 and 310\u00b0 were considered, as these represent winds onshore to the airport. Winds coming from directions less than 130\u00b0 or greater than 310\u00b0 are offshore winds, and do not generate large waves incident on the OAK perimeter dike. In addition, events were required to be spaced at least 12 hours apart; hourly events occurring less than 12 hours apart from each other were considered to be the same event, so only the largest of a group of events occurring within 12 hours of one another was considered. This insured that each storm was counted only once. Each water year's 20 largest estimated events were then used as input files to MIKE21 NSW, which was used to calculate the significant wave height and period along the OAK perimeter dike for each event. Since the MIKE21 NSW model requires the model grid to be rotated such that all waves are propagating with a positive celerity component along the x-axis, four different grids were used. These grids were centered such that the negative x-axis (the direction from which the wind blows) pointed 152.5\u00b0, 197.5\u00b0, 242.5\u00b0, and 287.5\u00b0 clockwise from north. Each grid was then used for winds blowing from within 22.5\u00b0 of its orientation. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show examples of the wave field hindcast by MIKE21 NSW for the case of a south-southwesterly wind (using the grid with the negative x-axis aligned with direction 197.5\u00b0). For each event, the maximum significant wave height and period were used in the calculation of runup. Runup was determined from procedures found in the Coastal Engineering Manual (USACE, 2006). Runup was determined for the 20 biggest storm events each water year, throughout the 58 year period of record of OAK wind data. TWL for each event was then determined as the sum of SWL and runup for that event. In order to determine the 1% annual chance TWL, each year's highest TWL was identified and fit to a 3-paramter Weibull distribution, as shown in Figure 9, from which the 1% annual TWL was identified. The value was 4.13 m NAVD, for the case in which the mean sea surface elevation remains at its 2008 value. Accounting for a 1.4 m sea level rise by 2100 (Rhamsdorf, 2007), the 1% annual TWL becomes 5.56 m NAVD ( Figure 10). The difference between the no-SLR TWL and the 1.4 m SLR TWL is greater than 1.4 m because the higher sea level, in addition to increasing the SWL, also allows waves to grow larger before breaking and to experience less bed friction, resulting in higher runup in addition to the higher SWL. To validate these TWL results, they were compared to one historical incident. In December 1983, OAK was subjected to a storm that caused significant runup-induced overtopping of the perimeter dike. At the time, the crest of the levee was at an elevation of approximately 3.79 m NAVD (after that storm, the crest of the levee was raised, but the comparison with the event uses the crest elevation at that time). The highest runup event in Figure 10 corresponds to this December 1983 event. The runup hindcasted by the model is 3.91 m NAVD (after correcting for the lower mean sea level in 1983 as compared to 2008), which is high enough to have overtopped the 3.79 m NAVD levee. The model thus agrees with historical observations in hindcasting overtopping during the December 1983 storm."}, {"section_title": "METHOD 1 RANKING FOR WAVE EROSIVE POWER", "text": "Armor layer stability is determined via the Coastal Engineering Manual (USACE, 2006, table VI-5-22), which outlines the data of Hudson (1974). The significant wave height needed for this design is the 100-year H s . In order to determine this value, an analysis similar to that above for TWL was conducted. However, instead of predicting the maximum 20 TWL events each year, the events resulting in the largest twenty H s each year were predicted. These were predicted via the relation Ranking Parameter ~ (Wind Speed) Equation (2) was shown to correctly predict the 20 largest wave events during the winters of 1987-88 and 1997-98. Therefore, equation 2was used to predict the 20 largest events during all years of the wind record. After determining the 20 largest H s events each year, the annual largest H s was extracted. Figure 11 shows a histogram of the largest annual H s , along with a Weibull fit to these data. The resulting 100-year significant wave height incident on OAK is 1.47 m. Given this 100-year design significant wave height, Hudson (1974) shows that armor stone with median size D n50 = 0.64 m is necessary in order that the armor experiences only 0-5% damage in the design storm."}, {"section_title": "METHOD 2 RANKING FOR TOTAL WATER LEVEL", "text": "Method 1 for ranking TWL and wave height events (equations 1 and 2) were sufficient for OAK because the airport's geometry (Figures 1 and 2) and storm wind patterns ( Figure 10) result in only southerly to southwesterly winds being of issue. Therefore, most storm winds having significant effect on OAK have similar fetch and incident direction to one another. If winds from many directions (and thus many different fetches) were important, or if ocean swell or other physics needed to be included, then a more sophisticated ranking method would be required. Furthermore, if different locations along the levee were exposed to different waves, or if different sections of the levee had a different geometry (slope or berm width), then runup would be different on these different sections, and again a more sophisticated ranking method would be necessary. This more sophisticated ranking method replaces the ranking parameter of equation 1with an estimated TWL based on USACE (2006). For each hourly wind in the available time series, a representative wind wave height H m0 near the shoreline is given by the minimum of H m0 as determined from USACE (2006) equations (II-2-36), which show how deep-water wave height grows with fetch, and USACE (2006) equations (II-2-37), which show fully-developed deep-water wave height for a given wind speed. For the case of OAK, the representative fetch to the middle of the dike is approximately 10 km for winds incident on the 152.5\u00b0 grid, 15 km for the 197.5\u00b0 grid, 15 km for the 242.5\u00b0 grid, and 12 km for the 197.5\u00b0 grid. These values are rough approximations, but they are only used for ranking events; events chosen for further analysis will be evaluated in greater detail. For each hour of wind data available, USACE (2006) equations (VI-5-2) and (VI-5-3) are then used to calculate an hourly time series of estimated runup, corresponding to each hour of wind data. If ocean swell exists as well, the same runup estimation must be carried out for the ocean swell data. The TWL Ranking Parameter for each hour of wind (and ocean swell, if applicable) data is then determined by equation 3. TWL Ranking Parameter = SWL + Wind Wave Runup + Ocean Swell Runup For each grid octant, the 20 largest ranked events each water year need to be chosen for further analysis. From here on, this method is the same as Method 1. Each chosen event is simulated with MIKE21-NSW. The resulting wave height, period, and direction are then used to calculate accurate runup due to windwaves (and ocean swell, if applicable). A series of the maximum annual TWL is generated for the duration of the wind record. Finally, these events are fit to a Weibull distribution to determine the design frequency TWL."}, {"section_title": "METHOD 2 RANKING FOR WAVE EROSIVE POWER", "text": "Method 2 for ranking erosive power is the same as Method 1, except that the wave height ranking parameter from equation 2is replaced with the estimated wave height from USACE (2006) equations (II-2-36) or (II-2-37). Method 2 is more accurate than Method 1 in conditions where fetch varies significantly with wave direction."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Methods were formulated to determine the design SWL and TWL for the OAK levee. Limited hydrodynamic modeling was used to develop a transfer function, allowing use of a nearby tide gauge in generating a long data record for SWL. Likewise, limited wave modeling was used in developing a ranking system to extract the largest annual TWL events. Further wave modeling was then carried out to determine the TWL resulting from each of these events. Despite limited computational resources, a thorough analysis of coastal conditions was possible. Two methods of ranking TWL were evaluated for their use in capturing the largest annual TWL event. Similarly, two methods of ranking wave height were evaluated for their use in capturing the largest annual wave height event. Method 1, being the simplest, is only applicable where fetch does not vary significantly with wave incidence direction, and where only wind waves are of importance (i.e. ocean swell is not present). Method 1 worked well for the levee on the west side of Oakland International Airport. Method 2, being more rigorous, is applicable to any general situation. Method 2 must be used where fetch varies significantly with wave direction, or where ocean swell and wind waves are both important.  , 1902-May 31, 2008Alameda 37\u00b0 46.3'N, 122\u00b0 17.9'W January1, 1996-May 31, 2008 "}]
