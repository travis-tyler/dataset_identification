[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer3s disease (AD) have three classical pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration, including that of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. However the relationship between A\u03b2 burden and basal forebrain degeneration has not been extensively studied. To investigate this association, basal forebrain volumes were determined from magnetic resonance images of controls, subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients enrolled in the longitudinal Alzheimer3s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies. In the AIBL cohort, these volumes were correlated within groups to neocortical gray matter retention of Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) from positron emission tomography images as a measure of A\u03b2 load. The basal forebrain volumes of AD and aMCI subjects were significantly reduced compared to those of control subjects. Anterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in AD subjects and aMCI subjects with high A\u03b2 burden, whereas posterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in control subjects with high A\u03b2 burden. Therefore this study provides new evidence for a correlation between neocortical A\u03b2 accumulation and basal forebrain degeneration. In addition, cluster analysis showed that subjects with a whole basal forebrain volume below a determined cut-off value had a 7 times higher risk of having a worse diagnosis within~18 months. Crown"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer3s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in widespread brain atrophy of both gray and white matter brain regions. Other hallmarks of the disease include the extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and intracellular accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau. An emerging method of early diagnosis of AD is to assess brain A\u03b2 burden through Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This measure has shown promise in identifying people at risk of developing AD (Villemagne et al., 2011) ; however, reports of correlations between PiB retention and hippocampal atrophy, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measure most widely used together with traditional cognitive assessment for the diagnosis of AD (Frisoni et al., 2010) , have been inconsistent. Therefore it remains unclear what additional factors control the progression to dementia of healthy subjects with high A\u03b2 load.\nCholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, a gray matter region located in the medial and ventral aspects of the brain, provide the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to a variety of different brain regions. Anterior basal forebrain nuclei, including the medial septum and diagonal band send projections to the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and piriform and entorhinal cortices. Posterior basal forebrain nuclei, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert project to the amygdala and frontal, cingulate and parietal cortices, as well as to the orbital and occipital cortices and the temporal lobe (Mesulam et al., 1983; Zaborszky et al., 2008) . Regulation of acetylcholine supply to these brain regions is involved in local activation and modulation of plasticity, and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons can therefore influence critical behaviors such as attention, learning and memory (Mufson, 2003; Schliebs and Arendt, 2011) . Postmortem assessment has revealed that significant degeneration of these neurons as an early pathological feature of AD patients, and their degeneration, which is likely to underpin aspects of cognitive decline associated with the disease (Contestabile, 2011; Mesulam, 2004; Schliebs and Arendt, 2011) , drove the development of the now widely prescribed acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor class of drugs. Consistent with this, recent studies have demonstrated that AD patients, as well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage to AD, show significant basal forebrain volume loss compared to age-matched controls (Grothe et al., 2012b; Hall et al., 2008; Muth et al., 2010) , with atrophy of discrete regions within the basal forebrain being significantly associated with global cognitive decline as well as delayed recall scores in AD subjects (Grothe et al., 2010) . Although the basal forebrain has been shown to degenerate in normal aging, the rate of atrophy is significantly higher in subjects suffering from dementia (Grothe et al., 2012a) , and specific areas within the basal forebrain appear to be particularly vulnerable to AD-associated degeneration (Grothe et al., 2012b ).\nAn association between basal forebrain atrophy and A\u03b2 burden in AD has recently been reported using MRI and AV45-PET data Teipel et al., 2014) acquired from the Alzheimer3s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. In this study we also found a significant association between basal forebrain atrophy, based on a histological mask restricted to AD-specific degeneration, and A\u03b2 load using PiB-PET, including a correlation between these hallmarks that extends to healthy control subjects of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) cohort (Ellis et al., 2009) . Furthermore, we determined that degeneration of the basal forebrain is a significant risk factor for further cognitive decline in control and MCI cohorts, irrespective of A\u03b2 burden."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data analyzed for this report were obtained from the AIBL study (Ellis et al., 2009 ) (http://www.aibl.csiro.au/) and the ADNI study (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu).

(2010) . A skull strip mask was generated from the GM, WM and CSF segmentation. All volume calculations reported are normalized by intracranial volume.\nUsing the AIBL study data, the skull-stripped MPRAGE images of all subjects were normalized to create an average elderly template brain using the open-source deformable registration tool ANTS. ANTS provides functionality for generating optimal templates, given a collection of images, which offers advantages over a priori templates for image normalization (for instance in the hippocampus; Avants et al., 2010) . The population-specific template was generated by iteratively registering images to the current template estimate. A new shape and intensity average were then computed from the results of the registrations and the current template estimate was set as the average. This template generation procedure was repeated iteratively (I = 5). Each registration in this procedure used the greedy symmetric normalization algorithm (SyN, parameters outlined below) and the cross-correlation after subtracting the local mean from the image match metric. A z-score map of the deformation field of the AD subjects with HC subjects from the AIBL cohort was generated.\nThe registration between each subject3s MPRAGE image (AIBL and ADNI) and the population-specific template was performed using the SyN algorithm (GradStep = 0.5, regularization sigma = 2.0).

There was no gender difference between groups. Minimental state examination (MMSE) scores between aMCI/AD and all other groups were significantly different. Years of education were not significantly different between groups. For representation of the healthy population we set clinical dementia rating (CDR) = 0 as the criterion for the HC groups at baseline. Age and MMSE scores are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. image match metric was the cross-correlation between the images. Cross-correlation after subtracting the local mean from the image at each voxel was computed using a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 voxel window. Registration was performed in a multi-resolution scheme, with a maximum of 30 iterations at 4\u00d7 subsampling, 90 iterations at 2\u00d7 subsampling, and 50 iterations at full resolution. To establish basal forebrain masks encompassing only those areas that undergo atrophy in AD patients (Fig. 1) , we compared all control and AD subjects from the AIBL cohort and overlaid the resultant z-score map (set to \u22120.5 and \u22121 standard deviations) on a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain (z-score map, Fig. 1A, B) . Using published probabilistic basal forebrain maps derived from histological data as a guide for the limits of the structure (Zaborszky et al., 2008) , we then manually segmented the regions of atrophy within the standard space corresponding to the basal forebrain area. Using this method we created two types of basal forebrain masks.\nFirst, we used published raw probabilistic maps (Zaborszky et al., 2008) from at least one post-mortem brain as a guide, resulting in a basal forebrain mask covering a large number of basal forebrain voxels (BF raw; size: 3193 voxels; Fig. 1A , B) and a final delineated area of intermediate anatomical specificity. Second, we used maximum probability maps (MPMs; Zaborszky et al., 2008) as guidance, resulting in a basal forebrain mask covering voxels that were identified as lying in the basal forebrain in ten post-mortem brains (BF MPM; size: 1160 voxels; Fig. 1A , B) and a final delineated area of high anatomical specificity. One aim of this study was to assess and compare the sensitivity of both BF raw and MPM masks in detecting volumetric changes as well as identifying associations with global A\u03b2 burden. To study anterior and posterior basal forebrain compartments separately, we further divided the BF MPM map into an anterior BF MPM volume (size: 595 voxels; Fig. 1A ), covering Ch1-3 as well as Ch4 anterior cell groups, and a posterior BF MPM volume (size: 565 voxels; Fig. 1B ), covering Ch4 intermediate and posterior cell groups (nomenclature according to Mesulam et al., 1983) . The final BF raw and BF MPM masks comprised areas throughout the entire extent of the basal forebrain area (Ch1-4 cell groups) and were validated by overlaying the masks onto newly developed raw probabilistic and MPM basal forebrain post-mortem maps (Eickhoff et al., 2005 (Eickhoff et al., , 2006 (Eickhoff et al., , 2007 , respectively. This showed an overlap of 50% for the BF raw mask with the raw probabilistic post-mortem map, an overlap of 85% for the BF MPM map with the raw probabilistic post-mortem map and an overlap of 46% for the BF MPM map with the MPM post-mortem map. Neither the BF raw nor the BF MPM map was specific for cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain, but rather represented the general basal forebrain area. Using the aforementioned registration between the subject and atlas, the basal forebrain masks were propagated into the subjects' space and any voxels labeled as CSF (from CSF segmentation) were removed. The resulting mask was then used to extract the GM volume.\nBecause the basal forebrain masks were created based on atrophy maps derived from comparing AD and control subjects from the AIBL cohort, we tested whether the BF raw mask was able to detect changes in the AIBL cohort as well as in an independent cohort, namely the ADNI cohort ( Fig. 2 ). This analysis revealed similar changes between AD and control subjects as well as AD and aMCI subjects in both cohorts."}, {"section_title": "PET image processing", "text": "The PET images were processed as described by Bourgeat et al.

Two-step cluster analysis automatically identified three existing clusters in the basal forebrain volume data, and both non-hierarchical (K-means) cluster analysis and two-step cluster analysis provided highly similar cluster groups. The two-graph receiver operating characteristic (TG-ROC) was used to determine cut-off values between clusters (Greiner, 1995) .

We confirm the findings recently published using data from the ADNI cohort Teipel et al., 2014) and demonstrate here that whole basal forebrain volume significantly correlates with neocortical A\u03b2 burden, measured through PiB retention, in AD and HC PiB+ groups. In the HC PiB+ group, neocortical A\u03b2 burden correlates with posterior basal forebrain volume, whereas in aMCI PiB+ and AD groups, neocortical A\u03b2 burden correlates with anterior basal forebrain volume. Furthermore, subjects who retrospectively converted from a diagnosis of either HC to aMCI or aMCI to AD were found to have reduced basal forebrain volumes prior to conversion. These findings provide validity to emerging human and animal studies demonstrating a link between cholinergic basal forebrain neuron degeneration and A\u03b2 production and/or deposition (Gil-Bea et al., 2012; Grothe et al., 2014; Ramos-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Teipel et al., 2014) .\nThe interaction between basal forebrain volume and neocortical A\u03b2 burden was studied using whole, anterior or posterior basal forebrain masks created by delimiting those areas found to undergo atrophy in AD subjects (versus age-matched controls) within the basal forebrain area. However the final masks showed only partial overlap with not yet publicly available post-mortem maps, developed by Eickhoff (Heinrich-Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf) and colleagues, being significantly larger; We acknowledge that this may represent areas of atrophy in anatomically close brain regions in some subjects, but nonetheless, we reasoned that this method of estimating basal forebrain volume may provide increased sensitivity to detect change in AD over the purely post-mortem-based segmentations previously used by others. Indeed, the results of our volumetric analysis using the atrophy-based whole basal forebrain mask are consistent with the findings of previous studies in which subnuclei of the basal forebrain or closely located brain regions were analyzed (Grothe et al., 2010 (Grothe et al., , 2012a , with differences in average basal forebrain volume being detected when comparing healthy controls to AD, very mild AD, and MCI groups. The analysis of the ADNI cohort shown here (Fig. 2) further supports data presented previously (George et al., 2011) . Interestingly, there was a significant difference between aMCI and HC PiB+ groups for BF raw but not BF MPM volumes in the AIBL cohort. This might be explained by the fact that the BF raw volume is almost three times the size of the BF MPM volume and may therefore be more sensitive to overall changes. The absence of a significant correlation between basal forebrain volume and either neocortical volume or cerebellar volume (Table 5) further strengthens the specificity of basal forebrain degeneration assessed by our measurements as a feature of AD pathology.\nIn order to investigate whether the correlations between whole basal forebrain volume with neocortical PiB retention observed in this study were driven by interactions with sub-areas of the basal forebrain, we performed correlations of the anterior (Ch1, Ch2, Ch3 and Ch4 anterior nuclei) and posterior (Ch4 intermediate and posterior nuclei) basal forebrain volumes with neocortical PiB retention. In the earliest stages of AD the posterior and intermediate parts of the Ch4 cell group, which are represented by the BF MPM posterior volume in this paper, are the regions predominantly affected by pathological changes (Grothe et al., 2012b) . The posterior basal forebrain nuclei send projections to the temporal lobe, amygdala, occipital and orbital cortices, as well as to brain regions subject to heavy A\u03b2 deposition, such as the frontal, cingulate and parietal cortices (Klunk et al., 2004) . Furthermore, loss of cholinergic innervation to the aforementioned regions was recently found in vivo in MCI patients (Haense et al., 2012) . Thus it is significant that we found a correlation between posterior basal forebrain volume and neocortical PiB retention in the HC PiB+ group, a cohort which represents a control subgroup that might be at high risk of developing AD.\nWe also observed significant correlations of neocortical PiB retention with BF MPM anterior volume in the aMCI PiB+ and AD groups. In this study, even though the BF raw mask was more sensitive than the BF MPM maps in identifying volumetric differences between groups, BF MPM volumes showed higher correlation coefficients and identified additional significant interactions with neocortical PiB retention as compared to the associations with BF raw volume. In addition, raw probabilistic maps have been shown to be at risk of misclassifying voxels, whereas MPM maps should not suffer from this limitation despite showing similar sensitivity (Eickhoff et al., 2006) . Therefore we recommend the use of BF MPM maps, particularly subregional Table 5 Results of neocortical and cerebellar volume analysis in the AIBL cohort. Average volumes, group comparisons and correlation coefficients of each structure to BF raw volumes are shown. There was a significant difference for neocortical volume between the AD and HC PiB+ group (denoted by *), but not between other groups. We did not find differences in the cerebellar volume and no significant correlation of basal forebrain volume to either neocortical or cerebellar volume was found. Volumes are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. anterior/posterior volumes, for the future study of associations between global A\u03b2 burden and basal forebrain volumes. The associations between basal forebrain volumes and amyloid burden presented in this work are consistent with previous reports of a correlation between AV45 retention and basal forebrain volume , and the finding that, as subjects progress to aMCI and AD clinical status, changes in anterior basal forebrain areas, containing nuclei that project to the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and piriform and entorhinal cortices, become much more pronounced (Grothe et al., 2012b) . In line with this are also recent studies demonstrating cholinergic neuronal dysfunction in the cerebral cortex in MCI and AD based on the use of PET to assess the activity of the key cholinergic enzyme acetylcholine esterase. Acetylcholine esterase is primarily membranebound and located on presynaptic cholinergic neurons, and its activity is known to reflect the integrity of the ascending cholinergic system (Garibotto et al., 2013) . Degeneration of the cortical cholinergic projection system arising from posterior basal forebrain nuclei, represented by the posterior mask in this paper, was found to occur at early stages of dementia (Haense et al., 2012; Herholz et al., 2008) . This is consistent with early dysfunction of posterior nucleus basalis of Meynert neurons, and acetylcholine esterase activity in temporal lobe regions has also been correlated to memory impairment in MCI and AD patients (Haense et al., 2012; Marcone et al., 2012) .\nWhile the correlations between basal forebrain volume and neocortical PiB retention reported here may merely reflect the progressive nature of basal forebrain atrophy occurring independently of increasing A\u03b2 load, we hypothesize that this is not the case. Firstly, A\u03b2 burden does not correlate with atrophy of other brain areas, including the hippocampus. Previous work using data from the AIBL study has reported a correlation between hippocampal volume and temporal neocortical PiB retention in the HC PiB+ group and subjective cognitively impaired subjects (Chetelat et al., 2010) . However, no correlations were found for the AD or the MCI groups, and atrophy of the hippocampus did not correlate with hippocampal PiB retention in another AIBL study . Furthermore, similar analyses of AIBL subjects, performed in the present study, failed to reveal any correlation between hippocampal volume and neocortical PiB retention in any subject group (data not shown). Moreover, the correlation in the AD group between BF raw volume and PiB retention increased from r = 0.39 to r = 0.42 when controlling for hippocampal volume. This indicates that the relationship between basal forebrain volume and A\u03b2 deposition is not driven purely by reduced hippocampal volume, even though these volumes are strongly correlated (data not shown).\nFurthermore, in agreement with our findings, a recent study suggested that basal forebrain atrophy can predict cortical amyloid burden, and is more closely associated with cortical amyloid burden than hippocampal atrophy . Secondly, a causal relationship is supported by emerging studies in animal models of AD in which cholinergic basal forebrain neuron shrinkage, synaptic loss and axonal degeneration partly caused by, or causing, A\u03b2 deposition in the brain, have been reported (Gil-Bea et al., 2012; Knowles et al., 2009; RamosRodriguez et al., 2013; Sotthibundhu et al., 2008) . Although our basal forebrain measurements encompass a structure which is heterogeneous in nature, the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain are preferentially lost in AD (Mufson, 2003) and their degeneration could, at least partly, account for the observed reduction in basal forebrain volume. It also remains to be determined what other factors might correlate with or drive basal forebrain volume loss and/or A\u03b2 burden. Of particular relevance is the development of tau pathology that occurs in basal forebrain neurons (Braak et al., 2006; Del Tredici, 2004, 2011) . Tau pathology is more strongly associated with cognitive decline (Braak and Braak, 1991) and is likely to have pronounced effects on basal forebrain volumetric measures.\nRegardless of the cause of the observed basal forebrain volume loss, in support of the assertion that early basal forebrain atrophy is a key disease hallmark, cluster analysis of raw BF volume, including analysis of subjects whose diagnosis converted to more cognitively impaired, revealed that most subjects converting from HC to aMCI or from aMCI to AD had a low basal forebrain volume prior to conversion. All converters in both the AIBL and ADNI studies (with the exception of one aMCI PiB+ subject) fell into the low or reduced basal forebrain volume clusters prior to conversion, which could be considered to be the high/medium risk categories. In the AIBL study the mean basal forebrain volumes of AD subjects fell into the low volume cluster whereas mean basal forebrain volumes of the aMCI, HC PiB+ and HC PiB+ groups fell into the reduced volume cluster. Subjects in the latter groups were found in all 3 vol clusters indicating that the range of basal forebrain volumes is large even in non-demented elderly subjects, which is a limitation of using only basal forebrain volumetric measures for diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless we found that subjects belonging to the high/medium risk categories in the AIBL study were 7.2 times more likely to convert to more cognitively impaired than subjects in the low risk category. Interestingly, 3 of the normal controls in the medium risk category who were cognitively impaired at follow up were PiB\u2212 at the time of baseline diagnosis, again indicating that basal forebrain atrophy might be a preclinical marker of dementia, albeit that these people may not progress to AD. Although the sample size used to assess basal forebrain volumes for risk of conversion was small, and additional longitudinal data are required to verify our findings, the significant cumulative evidence for basal forebrain atrophy being observed in life in AD clinical cohorts provides increasing impetus for including basal forebrain volume in the general \"atrophy signature\" for the diagnosis of patients at risk of, or with, AD. Furthermore, basal forebrain measures used in conjunction with other disease markers, such as A\u03b2 load (Kim et al., 2012; Villemagne et al., 2011) , may further delineate subjects at risk of progressing to AD or those for whom other interventions, including anti-A\u03b2 treatments, may be of most benefit. and the study is coordinated by the Alzheimer3s disease Cooperative Study at the University of California San Diego. ADNI data are disseminated by the Laboratory for Neuro Imaging at the University of California Los Angeles.
