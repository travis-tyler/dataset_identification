Additionally, serum AT1RaAb levels were significantly correlated with higher interleukin-6, blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI), diminished physiologic capacity (weaker grip strength and slower walking speed), and adverse health outcomes (increased falls and mortality) in a study of community dwelling older adults [10] . Angiotensin II (Ang II) binding within the hydrophilic pocket formed by transmembrane domains of AT1R results in transient receptor activation [13] . In contrast, AT1RaAbs bind to the extracellular loop 2 of AT1R chronically activating the receptor [14] . The association of AT1RaAb levels with multiple diseases and negative health outcomes suggest that these exposures may not be causative to disease, but rather facilitate disease progression.\nBased on 2013-2015 data, at some point during their lifetime approximately 11% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCA) [15] . The prostate has a local renin angiotensin system [16] . The presence of Ang II in the basal layer of the epithelium and AT1R on stromal smooth muscle suggest that Ang II may mediate cellular growth and smooth muscle tone in normal human prostate [17] . A role for Ang II in promoting prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness was suggested by studies of Ang II induction of oxidative stress, PAX2 oncogene expression, cellular proliferation and protease secretion in PCA cell lines [18] [19] [20] . Renin angiotensin system components were found to be overexpressed in hormone refractory PCA tissue [21] .

LNCaP cells also exhibited increased maximal growth rates with AT1RpAb (P < 0.0005) and Ang II (P < 0.05) treatments (Fig. 7F ).\nAn assay measuring the activity of cellular dehydrogenases that is directly proportional to the number of living cells was employed to measure the dose response of PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells to AT1RpAb treatment. PC3 and LNCaP cultures exhibited a broad linear response while DU145 cells exhibited a higher basal rate of dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 7G , H and I). The rate of WST-8 reduction over 9 h was used to profile the relative rates of dehydrogenase activity as the change in WST-8 absorbance at 450 nm per hour (Fig. 7J ) in response to AT1RpAb dose. The correlation between dose and dehydrogenase activity was significant (P < 0.0001) for all three cell types with a r 2 value of 0.98 for PC3, 0.96 for DU145 and 0.94 for LNCaP."}, {"section_title": "AT1RpAb effects on cancer cell invasive phenotype", "text": "The prostate cancer cell lines were used to study the effect of AT1RpAb on an invasive phenotype (Fig. 8) . When PC3 cells were treated with control, Ang II, AT1RpAb, or isotype antibody, the relative fluorescence values for PC3 invasion through matrigel were significantly different between Ang II and control as well as between AT1RpAb and isoAb. Relative fluorescence for migration was only significantly different between AT1RaAb and isoAb. Determining the % cell invasion for all three cell types revealed similar results where Ang II and AT1RpAb treatment increased invasion between two-and three-fold relative to control and isotype antibody, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The role of tumor extrinsic factors such as host immune function has become a productive venue for both diagnostics (eg. autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens, TAAs) and therapeutics (eg. engineered drug conjugated TAAs, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy) [31] [32] [33] . The paradigm for TAAs are intracellular or cell-surface cancer cell components which are either overexpressed, expressed in a novel location, or have an altered structure or sequence which yields an immunogenic response. In the current study, autoantibodies that can predate clinical disease, correlate with time to diagnosis and time to death and have receptor agonistic activity were observed. This suggests that AT1RaAbs are distinct from TAAs and may be informative biomarkers.\nAs noted earlier in section 1, serum levels of AT1RaAb have been associated with a number of different diseases. Biomarkers associated with multiple pathologies will have reduced specificity. A potential common thread underlying these diseases is chronic immune activation/inflammation [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . It must be noted that chronic inflammation has been associated with other disease states where correlations with AT1RaAb have not been reported (e.g. -stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease). A common observation from studies measuring AT1RaAbs using different assays has been significant overlap in levels between those with and without a particular disease. For example, see Figs. 2 and 4 in the current results and data in other publications [10] [11] [12] 27, 39, 40] . Biomarkers with a wide distribution and an appreciable overlap between groups will have diminished diagnostic capacity. Thus, AT1RaAbs are not ideal diagnostic markers. They are, however potential candidates for use in risk stratification for disease progression. The most common clinical use of measured AT1RaAbs is as an adjunct to HLA typing in screening to assess risk of allograft dysfunction [41] .\nThe observed associations and actions of AT1RaAbs in this current study are consistent with reports that AT1R, angiotensin II converting enzyme, and angiotensinogen are overexpressed in hormone refractory prostate cancer tissue [21] and that in other cancer types, AT1R has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasiveness [42] [43] [44] [45] . Additional in vitro works has shown that Ang II, the normal ligand for AT1R, stimulates\nLNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell line proliferation and invasiveness [20] and that reducing AT1R expression inhibits cell growth in LNCaP cells [46] . The presence of activating antibodies targeting AT1R may be expected to enhance AT1R effects on cancer. An elevated AT1RaAb titer in serum was associated with ovarian cancer stage and grade and an enriched pool of patient IgGs stimulated cancer cell migration and angiogenesis [47] .\nIn our cross sectional study of samples obtained around the time of diagnosis, higher serum AT1RaAb levels were associated with PSA levels and pathological markers of disease. In our longitudinal study of pre-diagnosis samples, those most proximal to diagnosis samples exhibited significant association between AT1RaAb and PSA. However, adjusting for PSA in the accelerated failure model did not attenuate the association of AT1RaAbs with DFS or OS. The lack of an effect when adjusting for PSA in the accelerated failure estimates could reflect that the information content of AT1RaAbs is distinct from that of PSA. An invasive phenotype, defined by increased cell invasion was observed after AT1RpAb treatment of three PCA cell lines. This is consistent with published stimulatory effects of Ang II on cancer cell invasion [48] [49] [50] .\nThe limitations to the cross sectional sample set study include an imbalance in sample size of different types of NMD as well as different cancer stages. Although all samples were obtained prior to treatment, the time between serum draw and biopsy was variable. Prostate biopsies have been associated with increased local inflammation and infection [51] [52] [53] and this could significantly influence an immune-related biomarker. In the current study there was no significant difference in AT1RaAb levels obtained before or after biopsy. Limitations to the longitudinal sample set study include a relatively modest sample size (n = 109 subjects, 218 samples) where 11 samples were omitted from accelerated failure modeling due to missing PSA values. Ten of those samples were in the most distal to diagnosis group which may have reduced the estimates power to detect associations. 31% of samples from subjects eventually diagnosed with PCA lacked staging data, precluding the inclusion of staging in the accelerated failure modeling. The analysis of a larger longitudinal sample set would enable a number of these concerns to be addressed. Limitations to the in vitro work include the nature of the surrogate markers used. It is possible that AT1RpAb treatment effects the energy metabolism and reductive potential of the cell, complicating the interpretation of the dehydrogenase activity assay as a surogate for proliferation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Serum AT1RaAb levels correlated with prostate cancer status and clinical and pathological measures in a cross sectional study and with DFS and OS in a longitudinal study at proximal and distal timed events. The in vitro presence of AT1RaAbs modified cancer cell behavior.\nThese results are consistent with host agonistic autoantibodies acting as disease modifying agents (exposures) that bind to and chronically activate a specific G protein coupled receptor resulting in conditions that favor cancer expansion, survival and malignancy. Varying exposure to AT1RaAbs may be one of the factors that contribute to disease heterogeneity in progression rates."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. Experimental approach. Three different studies are performed to test whether AT1RaAbs are exposures that can modify disease progression. (A) The association between AT1RaAb levels and prostate health is assessed using a cross-sectional study of serum from subjects diagnosed as being disease-free (NL), having nonmalignant prostate disease (NMD) or prostate cancer (PCA). (B) The association between AT1RaAb exposure and disease progression is explored in a longitudinal study using prediagnosis serum samples and determining disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). (C) The biological effects of AT1RaAbs on prostate cancer cell phenotypes are examined in vitro. AT1R autoantibody ELISA assay. AT1RaAb levels in serum from subjects who at biopsy were determined to be disease-free (NL, n = 50), have nonmalignant prostate disease (NMD, n = 21) or who were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCA, n = 80) were quantified using an antigen capture ELISA. ELISA results were segregated into groups to compare the distribution of AT1RaAb values in (A) NL and PCA, (B) among NMD types, (C) different clinical stages of PCA, and (D) organ confined cancer (OC) and non-organ confined (NOC) cancer. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to profile sensitivity and specificity for discriminating (E) PCA from NL and (F) NOC from OC PCA. The association between ELISA AT1RaAb levels and titer assay values (A450/B 0 ) were assessed by determining Spearman rank order correlations (r S ) values (G).
