[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The demand for rapidly administered, sensitive, and reliable cognitive assessments that are specifically designed for identifying individuals in the earliest stages of cognitive decline (and to measure subtle change over time) has escalated as the emphasis in Alzheimer's disease clinical research has shifted from clinical diagnosis and treatment toward the goal of developing presymptomatic neuroprotective therapies. To meet these changing clinical requirements, cognitive measures or tailored batteries of tests must be validated and determined to be fit-for-use for the discrimination between cognitively healthy individuals and persons who are experiencing very subtle cognitive changes that likely signal the emergence of early mild cognitive impairment. We sought to collect and review data systematically from a wide variety of (mostly computer-administered) cognitive measures, all of which are currently marketed or distributed with the claims that these instruments are sensitive and reliable for the early identification of disease or, if untested for this purpose, are promising tools based on other variables. The survey responses for 16 measures/batteries are presented in brief in this review; full survey responses and summary tables are archived and publicly available on the Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 Web site (http://pad2020.org). A decision tree diagram highlighting critical decision points for selecting measures to meet varying clinical trials requirements has also been provided. Ultimately, the survey questionnaire, framework, and decision guidelines provided in this review should remain as useful aids for the evaluation of any new or updated sets of instruments in the years to come."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The diagnosis of (probable) Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] in the living patient has been based almost entirely on clinical examination, with postmortem neuropathologic confirmation of the disease made only on occasion and typically in the context of research [2] . Clinicians have been largely limited to diagnosing probable AD after ruling out other potential causes for cognitive decline and confirming impairments in function or activities of daily living. With the limitations of currently available and well-validated biomarkers or symptomatic therapies at the turn of the 21st century, patients must still present with observable cognitive decline to meet diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with concomitant functional deficits for a diagnosis of AD, either of which would then lead to consideration for pharmacologic intervention.\nHowever, by the time our patients present to clinic with demonstrable memory and other cognitive dysfunction, they have most probably suffered irreversible brain tissue damage and loss [3, 4] . Although currently marketed medications may improve memory functioning (or slow the rate of deterioration) [5] , they do not offer disease-altering properties or neuroprotective benefits [5] [6] [7] . Although the majority of clinical trials for new therapeutics have relied on the study of patients with mild-to-moderate probable AD, it seems likely that neuroprotective therapies applied during the earliest stages of disease would lead to better clinical outcomes for individuals-before much irreversible damage has occurred [8] . To achieve this goal, cognitive markers are needed that reliably identify individuals who are in the symptomatic predementia phase of AD or are presymptomatic but at high risk for experiencing clinical onset of MCI within several years, as well as markers that have the ability to measure and to track (with high sensitivity) very subtle cognitive changes over time in these same individuals [9] [10] [11] .\nSeveral large prospective studies are attempting to characterize the early disease course in persons who are either classified as healthy elderly, MCI, or early AD, by following these cohorts with regular clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory-based biomarkers of the disease. Using a natural history approach, and following participants longitudinally from middle-to-late adulthood through old age, these studies are contributing much to our understanding of how individual genetic, biological, and physiological mechanisms, combined with social and environmental influences, combine to influence the rate of disease occurrence and progression. For example, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), initially started as a 5-year trial based largely in the United States, emphasizes the study of the relationships between changes in cognition, brain structure and function, and biomarkers (www.adni-info.org). Aiming to cover the progression of the disease, from the earliest symptoms, before noticeable cognitive changes, through autopsy, ADNI-1 had enrolled 229 healthy controls, 405 participants with MCI, and 188 participants with AD as of May 2008 (www.adni-info.org). With extensive emphasis on wet laboratory biomarkers (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid measures of Ab, genetic markers) and neuroimaging (e.g., structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] , positron emission tomography [PET] ), the ADNI protocol has a strong focus on the development and refinement of biological measures or predictors of incipient cognitive impairment. The cognitive tasks chosen for use in this study are largely pencil-andpaper measures that require direct administration and recording by trained personnel. Alternate forms of the tasks were not used. Recent internal reviews of ADNI data have revealed substantial (and yet expected) rates of human errors in the recording and transcription of cognitive data, thus requiring continual quality checking and cleaning of the database. In addition, most of these measures were not designed to specifically assess the earliest signs of cognitive impairment or AD; however, the cognitive functions that they assay are known to change with dementia.\nA second example of a current, large, prospective study, aiming to assess the role of physical and environmental influences on cognitive health, and particularly changes in cognitive health during the aging process, is the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. This study aims to recruit a minimum of 200 participants with AD, as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria [1] , 100 participants with MCI [12] , and 700 participants without cognitive impairment, including participants with at least one APOE 34 allele, participants without a copy of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 34 allele, and participants with subjective memory complaints [13] . Participants are asked to complete a neuropsychological battery consisting of 1 to 2 hours of traditional paper-and-pencil measures (e.g., Boston Naming Test [BNT] , California Verbal Learning Test -II [CVLT-II]), and a subset in each group are administered the basic version of the CogState brief computerized battery. However, although the use of both standard and computerized measures provides for a comprehensive assessment, it also requires additional time and labor, thus making the final assessment burdensome, particularly for such a large study [13] . A specific benefit of using repeated computerized assessment in the AIBL study is the ability to examine rate-of-change (RCh) for a subgroup of the study participants. A recent linear mixed modeling analysis of this AIBL subgroup found a significantly different RCh, over the initial 4-month period of this study, on a measure of visual learning for participants with MCI as compared with cognitively healthy control participants, with patients with MCI showing greater relative decline (P. Maruff, personal communication, 2011) [14] .\nAs the field continues to advance, newer interventions will depend on the assessment of a slowing of cognitive change as evidence of their efficacy. Therefore, we must remain committed to the continued development and refinement of cognitive measures, particularly with respect to their ability to accurately and reliably identify and track very early cognitive change. Evans et al [9] have stated that cognitive change does not begin in old age, but is rather an ongoing developmental process that varies in rate from one individual to another and from one cognitive domain to another. Thus, it is possible that imperceptible change occurs very early in adulthood, beginning an accelerating cascade and requiring that longitudinal studies begin much earlier than is typically the case at present.\nIn addition to their ability to detect change, measures must also be evaluated in terms of their administration limitations, including length of administration, necessary involvement of trained administrators and/or healthcare providers, and the introduction of human error during administration, data entry, and/or data scoring. For example, many of the traditional neuropsychological measures used in research require extensive testing time, which in turn increases the potential for patient fatigue and boredom, necessitates trained administration, and often uses a pencil-and-paper approach, all of which increase both human error and administration time. Consequently, new cognitive measures must look to maximize recent technological advances (e.g., Internet-based administration, automated audit trails, real-time quality controls) while also preserving psychometric rigor. This suggests that it is important to consider a shift toward computeradministered measures in both the clinical and research domains, which may make assessments less time-and energy-intensive, thereby allowing for more frequent and less burdensome assessments to provide better monitoring of change/decline. The use of computerized testing will not replace the neuropsychologist's expertise in translating psychometric findings into practical recommendations for further workup and follow-up, but will instead facilitate the ability to obtain more reliable and less burdensome test results.\nThe Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 (PAD2020) initiative has recently partnered with the Alzheimer's Association in an effort to advance several large projects aimed at enabling more rapid and efficient discovery of treatments for AD, such as a large multinational registry trial of older adults. For any such new, massive, longitudinal registry trial, PAD2020 is focused on identifying individuals at the very earliest stages of disease, ideally before cognitive impairment has been recognized. To support this effort, one of the \"enabling technologies\" is to identify a validated set of brief, reliable, and easily delivered cognitive measures that, together, would be a \"cognitive toolbox\" to be made widely available for point-of-care use (for frequent monitoring) by primary care providers and specialists alike. Although the specific cognitive measures have not yet been selected, those to be included in the PAD2020 toolbox will include measures that are intended for frequent assessment of change over time, in individual subjects, across several facets of cognition that are known to change over the aging process and also with early disease.\nThe PAD2020 Comparative Survey, described in this report, was designed to aid in the identification of measures that will provide the most comprehensive combination of reliable cognitive assessment brevity, demonstrated construct and predictive validity, and ease of use. A relatively recent review of computer-based cognitive measures used in aging began to address this need for a systematic comparison across commercially available assessment batteries [15] . Wild et al focused on a subset of available literature published through 2007, but they did not include measures that were in development or not widely published [15] . The current survey provides a wider compilation of information, including the review of a broader range of marketed products that may be of value to clinical researchers in this rapidly evolving field. In an effort to expand the number of measures relevant to early cognitive change, we have intentionally oversampled the range of marketed cognitive measures and encouraged the scientists associated with each measure to provide information that may or may not be published in the public domain. This led to the inclusion of some measures in the early stages of development that may not yet have published data relevant to aging but are certainly potential contenders in the field. In addition, even for those tests that have solid literature support, this survey and review provided a forum for detailed explanation and synthesis that may be lacking in the previously published data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The comprehensive survey was constructed by one of the present study authors (P.J.S.), in consultation with other content experts. In designing the survey, the focus was on a thorough assessment of the relevant psychometric properties and methodologic considerations, in a standardized manner, with ample opportunity for each test/battery author to provide his/ her best supporting evidence and documentation. The survey thoroughly assessed each measure in terms of general measure conceptualization and development, availability of normative data, specificity of the tool for assessing cognitive decline in older adults, psychometric properties (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, reliability, validity), data collection and storage methods, and convergent validity with other cognitive measures, disease-related biomarkers, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; Appendix)."}, {"section_title": "Collection of survey data", "text": "In an effort to oversample from available cognitive measures that may have utility in identifying early cognitive change associated with MCI or AD, we completed a comprehensive review of published measures, Internet searches, and consultation with experts in the field of aging and dementia to generate a list of potential test authors and/or vendors.

Follow-up e-mails with the survey and cover letter explaining the purpose of the survey were sent in February 2010. Reminder e-mails were sent as the deadline of June 4, 2010 approached, and a follow-up e-mail was sent to individuals who had not responded by June 14, 2010. The primary author or contact for select measures with potential relevance to aging and dementia, as determined by the primary author of this review, was contacted in July 2010 through telephone for additional followup. Subsequent e-mail contact was maintained with those individuals who indicated that they were interested in participating in the survey. Ultimately, we received responses on 16 measures by September 2010."}, {"section_title": "Number of publications: Survey responders versus nonresponders", "text": "Each test or battery was identified as either a \"responder\" indicating that a representative author, vendor or test publisher completed a survey addressing the test's/battery's utility for detecting age-related change and early dementia, or a \"non-responder\" indicating that no survey had been returned.

Likewise, 16 measures were identified as \"non-responders\" (Fig. 1) . A general trend toward fewer publications related specifically to early cognitive decline, MCI, or early AD was identified for nonresponders, with the majority of nonresponder measures having between zero and three publications that were specifically related to aging and dementia (10 of 16 nonresponders had zero relevant publications, based on our search criteria). Notable exceptions to this are the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB), with five identified publications in aging and dementia, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, with 46 identified publications. It should be noted that the primary scientist associated with one measure (Neurobehavioral Evaluation System) identified as a nonresponder is deceased and there were no other scientists in a position to complete this survey on his behalf.

In addition, all returned surveys, summary tables, and the decision tree diagrams were sent, on two separate occasions, to all coauthors who served as an editorial team to ensure fairness and accuracy in reporting as best as possible. Finally, all survey responses have been posted (with only minor stylistic editing to ensure consistent format across documents) in a public archive at the PAD2020 Web site (http://www.pad2020.org) [16] for review.\nAs mentioned previously, survey data were analyzed for several predefined criteria, including sensitivity and specificity of the measure for identifying individuals with MCI, administrative ease of use, and convergence with biomarkers and ADLs/IADLs, among others. In addition, after receiving and reviewing the responses, other general information, such as previous use in a drug trial, and information specific to the measure were also included in the final report. The reported sensitivity (the proportion of the participant population with cognitive impairment or dementia who were correctly identified by the measure) and specificity (the proportion of healthy participants correctly identified as such) of each test/battery, with respect to its ability to discriminate healthy elderly from those with MCI, were reviewed for all instruments for which sufficient supporting literature was available (for companies/products without such data, we asked for information on sensitivity/specificity with respect to discriminating healthy elderly individuals from those with diagnosed AD)."}, {"section_title": "Decision tree diagram", "text": "To facilitate future reviews of cognitive assessment measures specific to cognitive decline associated with aging, Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (Baker) NTB (Harrison) NeurocogFX ( MCI, and AD, we have summarized our findings in a decision tree diagram.

The first decision we faced was: under what circumstances did the computer need to be used to consider a measure to be \"computer-based?\" Although some measures allowed for or even required computer scoring (in the case of the MCI Screen [MCIS]), we felt that the nature of \"computerbased\" was more accurately captured by those measures that required computer administration. Consequently, if a measure was not administered on the computer, it was not considered \"computer-based.\" However, to apply the label \"web-based,\" we were most interested in whether the data collected, either on the computer or through a human rater, could be uploaded onto a database (e.g., for automated scoring) through the Internet.

Normative data exist for college students, predeployment military personnel, high school athletes, college athletes, and a group of healthy individuals ranging in age from young adulthood to late life. Some ANAM tests are available in Spanish, German, and Russian. ANAM has several ongoing projects related to aging, cognitive impairment, and dementia. However, the use of this measure in the aging/dementia field is relatively new and, although it shows great promise, there is a relative paucity of published research.\nDespite the limited number of published results using the ANAM with older adults experiencing cognitive decline, MCI, or AD, the extensive history of this measure and its long focus on computerized assessment are certainly strengths.

This battery is available in more than 50 languages and, although it does not have matched alternate forms, the battery presentation is randomized across all tests, a feature that the authors claim allows for serial administration. A study including 37 patients with MCI, 54 patients with mild dementia, and 89 healthy controls examined the sensitivity and specificity of the CNS Vital Signs Brief Clinical Evaluation Battery [17] . When artificially setting the sensitivity for discriminating patients with MCI from healthy controls to 90%, specificity for identifying the healthy participants ranged between 65% (Complex Attention domain score and Verbal Memory) and 85% (Shifting Attention Test, number correct) [17] . When assessing the measure's sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between healthy controls and demented patients, and again holding sensitivity at 90%, specificity ranged between 50% (Visual Memory) and 81% (Symbol Digit Coding) [17] . A separate study examined the sensitivity and specificity of this battery in a group of 322 patients between the ages of 55 and 94 years at one site and 102 participants at a second site [25] . This study reported sensitivity for the Memory domain for differentiating patients with MCI patients from those with dementia ranging between 54% and 90%, depending on the cutoff standard score.

Finally, for the Visual Memory task, sensitivity ranged between 39% and 76%, with specificity between 79% and 96% [25] . The data from the study by Gualtieri and Johnson [17] suggest that the CNS Vital Signs battery is relatively successful at distinguishing between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with dementia, whereas the data reported by Gualtieri and Boyd [25] indicate that this measure lacks the predictive power to discriminate between those with mild impairment (MCI) and those with more advanced cognitive decline (early AD). Although the CNS Vital Signs Brief Clinical Evaluation Battery has been used in clinical practice and research with a variety of clinical disorders, the extent to which it has been used in studies on dementia is relatively restricted. Certainly, the ease of use, minimal need for human administrators, and potential for Internet-based remote administration offer several strengths, particularly with regard to its utility in a large clinical trial.

Each of the subtests is timed and participants are instructed to work as quickly as possible; this information is used as a proxy for processing speed and may be used for comparison with control samples and for statistical comparison. Of note, many of these tasks do not require that the participant generate the full response by himself/herself. Rather, participants are either given multiple-choice options or the computer automatically generates the response after the participant enters in a minimum amount of information (e.g., after typing the first three letters of a word, the remainder of the word is automatically completed).\nInformation regarding other available test languages was not provided; however, a review of the literature suggests that this measure is only available in English. To date, the CST has only been tested with patients with memory impairment associated with dementia. The CST has demonstrated a sensitivity of 96% for patients with cognitive impairment (collapsing across the range of early-to-severe AD) and was capable of correctly classifying 91% of patients into one of six experimental groups (control, MCI, early AD, mild-moderate AD, moderate-severe AD, and severe AD) [21] .

The battery also assesses verbal memory, using the immediate and delayed recall of passages and designs from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS, using the Mayo Older Americans Normative Studies [MOANS] normative data tables), and verbal fluency using the category fluency (animals and vegetables) and letter fluency tasks. Visuospatial functioning is assessed using Block design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -III (WAIS-III), and attention and executive functioning are evaluated using the Stroop Color Word Test and Trail Making Test (parts A and B). On occasion, the BNT, the Conner's CPT-2, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task are also used to assess language, attention, and executive functioning, respectively.\nThe Florida Brief Memory Screen has been used in the longitudinal assessment of older adults living in the community as well as of patients recruited from an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center [22] . The authors for the FBMS did not provide responses to all of the questions included in the survey, including time for completion of the measure, sensitivity and specificity for the identification of MCI, and alternative test languages. Therefore, without much of these data, it is difficult to fully assess the utility of the FBMS as a cognitive measure appropriate for use in a large clinical trial. However, considering the psychometric properties and administration demands of many of the measures included in the FBMS, such as the WMS, WAIS-III, BNT, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, we can assume that, as a battery, the FBMS lacks the potential for frequent repeated use."}, {"section_title": "GrayMatters Assessment System", "text": "The GrayMatters Assessment System (Dementia Screening, Inc., Abilene, TX) was designed for use in outpatient medical practices.

On test completion, data are encrypted and automatically entered into a multivariate prediction equation, with the report providing a score reflective of the patient's probability of MCI and associated recommendations.\nThe GrayMatters assessment includes a Delayed Alternation Task, to assess executive functioning, and a Visual Delayed Recognition Task (VDR), to assess visual memory. The Delayed Alternation Task utilizes a set-switching paradigm, requiring participants to deduce the \"rules\" of the task based on the feedback that they receive. The VDR includes an initial presentation of pictures of objects. Patients are then required to correctly identify which pictures they have previously seen.\nIn a sample of 419 participants, the GrayMatters Assessment System correctly identified 91% of patients with early AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score, ,25) and 80% of unimpaired participants (unpublished). Administration requires approximately 20 minutes, although some patients may take more than 30 minutes. Currently, one alternate form for the VDR is available; however, other alternate forms are presently being standardized. The GrayMatters Assessment System is available in Spanish, although this version of the system is not presently standardized. The GrayMatters Assessment System has been tested and normed using older adults determined to be cognitively \"healthy\" based on normal performance on the WMS-III, Trail Making Tests A and B, and Boston Verbal Fluency Test.

Considerable research has also examined the correlation between performance on the IntegNeuro/WebNeuro system and measures of brain function (e.g., electroencephalography, eventrelated potentials, and MRI). Overall, the IntegNeuro/WebNeuro system has several benefits, including assessment of numerous domains, availability of parallel forms for repeated assessment, and clinical applicability in the identification of individuals with cognitive decline related to dementia.

The MCIS aims to increase the utility of this well-known measure of episodic memory by standardizing administration using a computer interface, creating nine parallel versions of the word list, using a static instead of shuffled word presentation order, adjusting for test anxiety using a distracter task, and adjusting for covariates such as age, education, and gender. The MCIS is essentially a basic wordlist learning task (three immediate recall trials, one delayed recall trial, and one recognition trial) assessing attention and working memory. The MCIS is administered by a human rater and scored using an online interface that guides the administrator through testing. It also includes statistical analysis of the data and provides an automatic report summarizing the participant's performance for three domains: (1) overall impression (normal, impaired, borderline), (2) Memory Performance Index (map of the participant's scores from the overall impressions domain on a scale of range 0-100), and (3) longitudinal report (table summarizing performance in attention, working memory, meta-memory, delayed free recall, delayed recognition, and unrehearsed delayed free recall).\nThe MCIS requires approximately 10 minutes for completion and is available in English, Spanish, and Japanese, although the Spanish translation has not yet been fully validated. Because the MCIS is a list-learning task, patients with hearing or speech impairments may not be well suited for this measure, although there is evidence that patients with hearing loss can be assessed using flash cards to aid in the learning process [37] . The MCIS has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity for identifying MCI as compared with healthy controls is 95% and specificity 88%. Sensitivity for identifying MCI/mild dementia as compared with healthy controls was 97% and specificity was 88%. Finally, sensitivity for mild dementia as compared with healthy controls was 96% and specificity was 99% [38] .\nThe MCIS is a useful tool for identifying early cognitive change associated with dementia, benefiting from the extensive validation of the word-list learning task for this population. The administrative standardization, capability for either in-person or telephone administration, automatic data scoring and report generation, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the Food and Drug Administration compliance are additional strengths for this measure.

The Mindstreams MCI Battery includes these same measures, with the omission of the problem solving, finger tapping, and staged information processing speed tasks. The report that accompanies Mindstream test completion includes detailed scores, graphs, and summaries highlighting test performance. Study data are also provided in an Excel export, simplifying the data preparation phase for research and clinical trial use.\nThe Mindstreams Global Assessment Battery is approximately 45 to 60 minutes in length, whereas the MCI Battery requires approximately 30 minutes to administer. There are three alternate forms of the Mindstreams tests and these are available in English, Spanish, Russian, and Hebrew. Mindstreams has been used with several populations outside of aging and dementia, including, but not limited to, ADHD, people with high cardiovascular risk, postmenopausal women, and persons with schizophrenia.\nThe verbal and nonverbal memory tests from the Mindstreams battery discriminate between healthy elderly and MCI, with an AUC of 0.7 to 0.9 [23] . The verbal memory test best distinguished healthy elderly from MCI (Cohen's d 5 1.23) and from mild dementia (Cohen's d 5 0.60). However, the nonverbal memory test best discriminated MCI converters to dementia from nonconverters (Cohen's d 5 0.54).

The dependence of this battery on paper-and-pencil measures, the need for a trained clinical psychologist or psychometrician, as well as an administration time of 50 to 75 minutes, all serve to make this battery somewhat cumbersome to incorporate into large clinical trials. The lack of alternate parallel forms also complicates repeated assessment. The NTB has been translated into 18 languages and has been used successfully in several clinical trials. Ultimately, despite the extensive normative data and recent history of use in clinical trials, as well as some measure of acceptance by regulatory authorities, the administration requirements of this battery and lack of specific utility in the identification of early cognitive decline do not support its use in very large epidemiologic or registry trials."}, {"section_title": "National Institutes of Health Toolbox", "text": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (with cognitive, emotion, sensory, and motor components) is currently under development, sponsored by the NIH, and there are no published normative data on this battery specifically for older or cognitively impaired populations.

It is based on a structured survey returned by 16 of the 32 authors/publishers contacted and a thorough review of the existing literature on these tests and batteries. The survey was driven by the goal of identifying measures capable of assessing cognitive changes before noticeable decline suggestive of MCI or early AD. A strength of this survey is the use of self-report by the scientists associated with the development of these measures; using this approach allowed them to provide a thorough review of their measures (including the provision of information that may not be published but is certainly relevant to assessing the utility of a given instrument). In addition, the survey's focus on detailed properties of each measure, normative data, psychometric properties, and administrative information yielded practical information that influences test selection for individual study purposes. This unique approach involving self-report data collection, combined with the careful review process that accompanied each survey response and the full transparency of all source documents from each author/vendor, distinguishes this effort from other similar previous attempts to survey this content area [15, 41] .\nThere are several limitations to the scope of this review. First, some measures were not included because of a nonresponse to the survey. Second, this survey focused exclusively on measures of cognition and not on measures of IADLs or other aspects of functioning (e.g., psychological symptoms, occupational function) that typically undergo concomitant changes in the preclinical and early stages of AD. In addition, the measures included in this review were limited to performance-based tasks and did not include self-reported or other reported subjective rating scales or questionnaires. Although not included in this review, measures such as the informant-dependent questionnaire Everyday Cognition [42] offer important information for predicting cognitive impairment and certainly complement the data provided by the tests included in this review. Finally, there are additional considerations related to selecting any battery that have not been extensively covered in this review, mostly with regard to the proprietary nature of these instruments. For example, proprietary tests currently present a challenge to the research community for several reasons, including license fees and other related costs, inability to modify test paradigms for specific research questions because of unavailability of source code, and nontransparent scoring algorithms that may lead to difficulty in replicating previous findings. One surprising finding, evident to the authors as we compiled the information obtained for this review, is the real paucity of cross-sectional and/or longitudinal studies to directly compare performance on a given cognitive test/battery with changes in known disease-related biomarkers (e.g., structural MRI, amyloid imaging PET, cerebrospinal fluid measures of Ab). However, several survey responders indicated interest in future research with such biomarkers, and this would certainly be highly warranted, considering the rapidly growing roles that these markers will have in the diagnosis and tracking of AD progression for individual patients [43] .\nOverall, the measures available for early detection of cognitive decline may vary on several critical points, such as computer versus paper-and-pencil administration, the need for specialized training for test administration, general ease of administration, the number of tests and/or aspects of cognition assessed, and the speed with which data are quality checked and made available to the investigator or clinician. However, for each of these fundamental differences, there are several similarities among measures, particularly for those measures designed for, and most often used in, large research studies and clinical trials. Hence, there is no single recommended \"gold standard\" battery but, rather, a subset of very good products to choose from, based on individual study needs (Figs. 2 and 3) .\nUltimately, the information provided in this review is rather time-limited, in that these measures and the literature accompanying them will most definitely change in the coming years. Furthermore, new cognitive measures that are less multimodal and more tightly bound to the underlying disease-related functional neuropathology of AD are already being developed [44] and may lead to more precise tracking of very early cognitive changes in the initial stages of the disease. However, the actual questions included in this survey, and provided in Appendix, will remain germane even when the current information contained in this review becomes outdated. Thus, the benefit of this review, and the associated decision tree diagrams, is that new measures can be benchmarked and compared on the basis of the very same criteria (provided in Appendix) with those tests included in this review as decisions are made for future clinical research and practice.
