[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid b (Ab) 1-42 is an important Alzheimer's disease biomarker. However, it is inconclusive on how T2DM is related to CSF Ab1-42. Methods: Participants with T2DM were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative by searching keywords from the medical history database. A two-way analysis of covariance model was used to analyze how T2DM associates with CSF Ab1-42 or cerebral cortical Ab.\nResults: CSF Ab1-42 was higher in the T2DM group than the nondiabetic group. The inverse relation between CSF Ab1-42 and cerebral cortical Ab was independent of T2DM status. Participants with T2DM had a lower cerebral cortical Ab in anterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal lobe than controls. Discussion: T2DM is positively associated with CSF Ab1-42 but negatively with cerebral cortical Ab. The decreased cerebral cortical Ab associated with T2DM is preferentially located in certain brain regions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In 1999, the Rotterdam Study found that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could double the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] . In 2011, another study reported that AD risk increased 60% in patients with T2DM over the nondiabetics [2] . Further, a high prevalence of T2DM in patients with AD is congruent with T2DM as an AD risk factor [3] . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid b (Ab) 1-42 has been shown as a sensitive biomarker for diagnosing AD [4] and On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest. 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

However, a recent study did not find the association between T2DM and CSF Ab1-42 [6] . Using data from participants enrolled in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we investigated the relationship between CSF Ab1-42 with T2DM and baseline cognition diagnosis. Ab load in cerebral cortex as well as its subregions was also compared between participants with and without T2DM. Our findings provide important insight into CSF Ab1-42 as an AD biomarker and its relation to the cerebral cortical Ab, especially for patients with T2DM."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Demographic and imaging data were downloaded from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

CSFAb1-42 in the T2DM group was 204.35 6 9.40 pg/mL (95% CI: 185.89-222.80 pg/mL, n 5 76), which is higher than its level in the nondiabetic group of 168.59 6 4.49 pg/mL (95% CI: 159.76-177.40 pg/mL, n 5 731, P 5 .001) (Fig. 1) . It is worthy to note that T2DM did not interact with baseline diagnosis significantly for its effects on CSF Ab1-42 (P 5 .053).\nThen cerebral cortical Ab was analyzed to examine its correlation to the CSF Ab1-42 for participants with and without T2DM, respectively. For participants with T2DM, the correlation coefficient was 20.669 (n 5 77, P , .005). By contrast, the correlation coefficient was 20.705 (n 5 735, P , .005) for participants without T2DM. For participants with T2DM, cerebral cortical Ab (indicated by the florbetapir AV45 standardized uptakevalue ratio) was1.456 0.04(95% CI:1.38-1.52,n5 74), which is significantly lower than the counterpart measure in participants without T2DM of 1.53 6 0.02 (95% CI: 1.50-1.57, n 5 724, P 5 .045) (Fig. 2) .\nSubsequently, cerebral cortical Ab load was compared in different brain regions (anterior cingulate, frontal lobe, limbic lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal lobe) to examine if the differences between participants with and without T2DM were preferentially distributed in some regions than others (Table 2) . A lower load of Ab was seen in participants with T2DM than in those without T2DM from all examined brain regions (Table 2 ). However, significant differences were only observed in brain regions of anterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal lobe between participants with and without T2DM."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Amyloid plaque is one of the classical pathological biomarkers for AD. Ab, the major protein component of amyloid plaque, is generated from a sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by b-and g-secretase [15] . The amyloid deposited in neuritic plaques exists predominantly as the Ab1-42 form, which is less soluble and more likely to aggregate than the Ab1-40 form. More importantly, CSF Ab1-42 has been shown as a useful pathological biomarker for AD [16, 17] .\nCSF Ab1-42 is higher in participants with T2DM than those without T2DM. However, the increased concentration of CSF Ab1-42 is not due to CSF volume changes, as the CSF volume is comparable between participants with T2DM and nondiabetic controls (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It is noteworthy that CSF Ab1-42 has also been reported to be higher in type 1 diabetes mellitus [18] . Therefore, increased CSF Ab1-42 level is more likely associated with diabetes-related pathological changes (e.g. hyperglycemia) common in both types of diabetes.\nIt is known that microvascular lesions associated with T2DM can contribute to an increased blood-brain barrier permeability [19, 20] , which can change the distribution of biomarkers including Ab1-42 as well as the cognitive functions. At the same time, subjects with cognitive impairments caused by the vascular defects might be misdiagnosed as early stage AD [19] . For the ADNI participants with T2DM, the prevalence of AD is low, but they still have a higher AD risk than the same measure from the nondiabetic participants. Mean CSF Ab1-42 level was previously shown to be significantly lower in the mild AD group or amnestic MCI group than the control group [21] . Not surprisingly, a higher CSF Ab1-42 was observed in the HC group than the MCI group and the AD group in the present study ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ). However, CSF Ab1-42 was comparable between the MCI and AD groups, and the data suggest that measuring CSF Ab1-42 is more useful for detecting a cognitive deterioration from HC to MCI than differentiating MCI from AD.\nAlthough a lower CSF Ab1-42 was seen in participants with either MCI or AD than in the HC group, comorbid T2DM is related to a reversion of CSF Ab1-42 in those with cognitive impairments (MCI or AD). However, a similar relation between T2DM and cerebral cortical Ab was not observed. More interestingly, CSF Ab1-42 is inversely correlated with cerebral cortical Ab, and the relationship is independent of T2DM status.\nOur results showed that T2DM is associated with a unique pattern of changes in CSF Ab1-42 as well as a preferential distribution of decreased cerebral cortical Ab in certain brain regions. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, immune function might play an important role in leading to these changes as the Ab autoantibody increases for more than 45% in patients with T2DM in comparison with controls [22] .\nThe present study is limited by its cross-sectional design. A longitudinal study design may be more powerful for evaluating CSF Ab1-42 as a biomarker of early cognitive impairment in people with or without T2DM. In addition, data on CSF Ab1-42 and type 1 diabetes mellitus will also be useful for defining CSF Ab1-42 as an AD biomarker.\nIn conclusion, CSF Ab1-42 is positively associated with a T2DM status. The pattern of CSF Ab1-42 and cerebral cortical Ab changes in people with T2DM suggests that T2DM may increase AD risk through a disease-associated pathological mechanism. However, the underlying pathological mechanism for CSF Ab1-42 and cerebral cortical Ab warrants investigation in subjects with and without T2DM in the future.

Systematic review: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, it is controversial on how T2DM relates to Alzheimer's disease biomarker cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid b (Ab) 1-42. The authors reviewed available scarce evidence on how T2DM is associated with CSF Ab1-42 using PubMed as the main literature source. The relevant citations are appropriately cited.\n2. Interpretation: T2DM is positively associated with the CSF Ab1-42 but negatively associated with the cortical Ab. The decreased cortical Ab associated with T2DM is preferentially located in anterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal lobe.\n3. Future directions: The underlying pathological mechanism for CSF Ab1-42 and cortical Ab changes is to be investigated in patients with and without T2DM in the future. "}]
