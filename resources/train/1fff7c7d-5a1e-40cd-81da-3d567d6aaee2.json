Objective: To explore the association between organizational factors and EOL treatment intensity in Pennsylvania (PA) hospitals. Research Design: Cross-sectional mixed-mode survey of Chief Nursing Officers of PA hospitals linked to hospital-level measures of EOL treatment intensity calculated from PA Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) hospital discharge data. Hospitals: One hundred sixty-four hospitals, of which 124 (76%) responded to the survey. Measures: The dependent variable was an index of hospital EOL treatment intensity; the independent variables included administrative data-derived structural and market characteristics and 29 survey-derived hospital or ICU programs, policies, or practices. Results: In models restricted to independent variables drawn from administrative sources (available for all 164 hospitals), bed size (P \u03fd 0.001), proportion of admissions among black patients (P \u03fd 0.001), and county-wide hospital market competitiveness (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) (P \u03ed 0.001) were independently associated with greater EOL treatment intensity (adjusted R 2 \u03ed 0.5136). In models that additionally included hospital programs, policies, and practices (available for 124 hospitals), only an ICU long length of stay review committee (P \u03ed 0.03) was independently associated with greater EOL treatment intensity (adjusted R 2 \u03ed 0.5357). Conclusions: Information about hospital and ICU programs, policies, and practices believed relevant to the treatment of patients near the end of life offers little additional explanatory power in understanding hospital-level variation in EOL treatment intensity than administratively-derived variables alone. Future studies should explore the contribution of more difficult to measure social norms in shaping hospital practice patterns."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "N early 40% of all deaths nationwide occur in the acute care setting and 20% involve the use of intensive care services. 1 The use of acute care hospital and intensive care services for patients in their last 12 months of life consumes one-quarter of total Medicare spending for inpatient care. 2 Wide variation in expenditures and in the use of intensive care and specific life-sustaining procedures at the end of life between hospital referral regions raises concerns about efficiency. 3, 4 Regional variation in end-of-life inpatient service use and expenditures have been attributed in part to physician, hospital, and ICU bed supply, 3 which may translate into different local provider practice norms 5 but are not necessarily reflective of local patient preferences. 6 Less is known about the factors that influence variation in treatment intensity between hospitals, although bed supply and local practice norms 7 undoubtedly play a role. Hospitals are perhaps more attractive than hospital referral regions for study because they are potentially accountable organizations with a more proximate locus of control over decisions to use intensive treatments.\nThe purpose of the current study was to explore organizational determinants of hospital-level variation in end-of-life treatment intensity. We used a newly developed index of hospital end-of-life treatment intensity that quantifies the use of ICU and life-sustaining treatments among patients at a high probability of death, rather than among those retrospectively identified as decedents, 4 to address biases introduced by the decedent follow-back method. 8 Further, we augmented traditional hospital characteristics-such as size, teaching status, and case mix or illness severity-with information about the hospital programs, policies, and practices that may have direct and indirect impacts on rates of ICU and life-sustaining treatment use. A better understanding of the organizational factors associated with endof-life treatment intensity could be used to better align patient preferences with end-of-life treatment. 9, 10 "}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital treatment patterns among patients admitted to Pennsylvania acute care hospitals, using Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) hospital discharge data between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2005 .

These variables explained just over half of the total variation in end-oflife treatment intensity (adjusted R 2 0.5357)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study of the organizational predictors of hospital end-of-life treatment intensity in 164 acute care Pennsylvania hospitals, we found that administratively-derived structural and market characteristics, including larger bed size, greater proportion of admissions among black patients, and higher area-level hospital market competition, were more powerful predictors of end-of-life treatment intensity than specific hospital programs, policies, or practices, with the exception of an ICU long length of stay review committee. Despite our effort to capture a comprehensive set of explanatory vari-ables, almost half of hospital-level variation in end-of-life treatment intensity remained unexplained.\nWe found that hospitals with most of the studied programs, policies, and practices had higher mean hospital end-of-life treatment intensity indices than hospitals without such organizational initiatives, although most of these did not reach statistical significance. This paradoxical relationship between organizational initiatives that we hypothesized would be inversely related to intensity may reflect \"reverse causation\" in our cross-sectional analysis. Specifically, these initiatives may have been implemented in response to perceptions of higher than average use of ICU and life-sustaining treatments among patients at the end of life. Indeed, a longitudinal-not cross-sectional-design that could assess utilization changes associated with policy implementation would have been optimal. The finding that most programs, policies, and practices significantly associated with intensity in univariable tests were no longer significant in the multivariable model that included structural and market characteristics suggests that our study could have been underpowered or the associations could simply have been spurious due to confounding by structural characteristics. However, a recent national study demonstrated an inverse cross-sectional relationship between state-level penetration of one kind of program-hospital-based palliative care-and total end-of-life Medicare spending 14 ; national hospital-level analyses are lacking.\nThe association between the concentration of black patients in a region, 15 hospital, 16, 17 or nursing home 18 and greater end-of-life treatment intensity is not new. It is not entirely clear whether this observation reflects black patients' preferences for these life-sustaining treatments 19 -23 or some other phenomenon. For example, the higher observed end-oflife ICU use among blacks is attributable to black patients' disproportionate use of hospitals with greater end-of-life ICU use for both black and white patients. 16, 17 Our study also revealed a significant positive relationship between larger hospitals and end-of-life treatment intensity. This relationship was not attributable independently to tertiary care status (measured by transfers) or to teaching status (measured by the resident-to-bed ratio). It is possible that local practice norms play a significant role in this relationship, in addition to the ease of access to beds and other technologies in larger facilities. Area-level bed supply, as distinct from institution-specific supply, has a well-documented association with utilization and spending. 24 -28 Variation in hospice use, on the other hand, is not explained by area-level market characteristics. 29 This may be because hospice use is more dependent on patient preferences, demographics, and local social norms, and may have very low levels of penetration in certain counties.\nIn our study, higher market competition was associated with higher end-of-life intensity. This relationship existed even after controlling for bed size, a proxy for technological resources. It is possible that more competitive environments lead to higher intensity treatments because of the incentive to acquire and offer more technology and resources to compete for highly remunerated cases-such as transplant and coronaryartery bypass grafting. This may, in turn, result in greater use of those resources for patients at a high risk for dying.\nThere are several limitations to our study. The validity and reliability of the survey responses provided by a single informant, the CNO, was not assessed and is likely imperfect. Although the CNO is likely the single best informant, she/he may not have been knowledgeable about all aspects of hospital and ICU policy. Reassuringly, 84% reported that they felt \"confident\" or \"very confident\" in their answers to the survey questions.\nOur study is unable to establish cause-effect relationships between organizational initiatives and end-of-life treatment intensity in this cross-sectional study. We did attempt to ascertain the direction of the relationship by asking CNOs in our survey when each initiative was implemented. However, many of the responses to timing of implementation were \"don't know\" (on average 50%-75% of responses), leading to inadequate sample sizes for analysis.\nLikewise, the timing of the survey did not coincide exactly with the timing of the selected PHC4 discharge data. The dates of the hospital discharge data used to develop estimates of each hospital's treatment intensity (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) abutted, but did not overlap, the dates of the survey (2005) (2006) . Each hospital's practice pattern was stable over the 4 years of available data, but we are nonetheless unable to attribute temporal associations or direction of effect.\nAlthough it was a strength to compare hospitals in 1 state with a uniform regulatory, legal, and financing environment, our study may have been underpowered and is not generalizable to other states. The response rate to our survey was impressive at 76%, but nonetheless reflects only 124 hospitals. And, based on the comparison of observable characteristics, survey nonrespondent hospitals were more likely to be in higher competition markets, confirming a likely response bias.\nUnlike outcomes such as end-of-life treatment costs, our end-of-life treatment intensity index itself does not have a natural metric, given that it is a factor score based on 6 underlying standardized utilization ratios. It is not strictly possible to explain that a difference in the index of, for example, 1 point is directly related to X% fewer intubations or ICU admissions. Thus, it cannot be used to compare utilization of individual life-sustaining treatments across hospitals.\nAnother potential weakness is that our end-of-life treatment intensity index was calculated for all admissions, rather than just among ICU admissions, which may have diluted the \"true\" contribution of ICU-specific practices on intensity. However, because the treatments included in the index were ICU use (admission and length of stay) and those commonly delivered only in the ICU (mechanical ventilation), we believe that our hospital-specific measure is closely tied to ICU-specific treatments. However, among respondent hospitals with more than 1 ICU (N \u03ed 105), we asked the CNO to give us information about programs, policies, and practices implemented in the ICU that takes care of the \"majority of chronically ill elders\" in their hospitals (typically the MICU or a mixed medical-surgical ICU). We did not ask about the Table 2 : multivariable results for significant and non-significant structural/market characteristics).\nAmong hospital/ICU organizational characteristics, variables included in modeling here included: training program in palliative, critical, or pastoral care; ethics consult service; a designated private conference room for family meetings in the ICU; an ICU long length of stay review committee; regularly scheduled family meetings with an attending in the ICU; a clinical protocol to withdraw/withhold life-sustaining treatment; and dichotomized (0,1) physician in-house overnight ICU coverage (univariable P \u03fd 0.1). Only the ICU long length of stay review committee remained significant in multivariable modeling and was kept in the final model, shown here.\nMedical Care \u2022 Volume 47, Number 5, May 2009 End-of-Life Treatment Intensity programs, policies, and practices in the other ICUs. For these 105 hospitals, there may be some misspecification-the hospital's overall intensity index is affected by practice in an ICU that we have no information about and which may have different practices than the \"sampled\" ICU. Finally, it is always possible that unmeasured case-mix variation contributes to the higher end-of-life treatment intensity seen at larger hospitals. However, we did account for as much case-mix variation as possible by including the mean \"predicted risk of death on admission\" among the elderly (mean illness severity)-derived from key clinical factors on admission-as an independent variable. We did not find a relationship between the hospital's mean predicted risk of death and intensity in univariable analysis. In addition to this variable, each hospital's transfer-in rates and resident-to-bed ratio were eligible for model inclusion-both of which may measure staffing/equipment/capacity for taking care of sick patients. Although each variable was significantly associated with intensity in univariable analyses, neither was retained in the parsimonious multivariable model. However, hospital bed size and share of black patients may be capturing some of this \"resource\" construct.\nIn summary, the presence of the 29 hospital programs, policies, and practices that we assessed provide only minimal additional explanation of the large variation in hospital endof-life treatment intensity in Pennsylvania acute care hospitals. Although several structural and market characteristics were associated with end-of-life treatment intensity, the mechanism of these effects remains opaque, and almost half of the variation remains unexplained. Future studies should explore the contribution of more difficult-to-measure social norms in shaping hospital practice patterns."}]
