However, not all states report dropout data in strict agreement with the CCD definition, with the result that data from these nonconforming states have been withheld from publication. This situation has led NCES to explore the feasibility of adjusting nonstandard dropout reports to make them comparable with those from states using the standard CCD definition. The desire for comparable dropout statistics has been accompanied by considerable interest in developing a standard high school completion statistic based upon data available from the CCD. Between 1997 and 1999, staff from NCES and state education agencies worked with analysts from Westat to develop a methodology for adjusting nonconforming dropout data and to test a proposed high school completion rate. The analyses presented in this report found that the major types of nonstandard dropout reporting practices have statistically significant, but different, effects on the size of state dropout rates. The most common variant practice uses a reporting calendar that effectively takes a \"snapshot\" count of dropouts at the conclusion of the school year rather than at the beginning of the next year. This typically leads to a small net increase in the number of dropouts reported, when compared with the CCD reporting guidelines. The effects of how summer dropouts (those who complete one school year but fail to enroll for the next) are reported, and whether students moving to adult education GED classes are considered dropouts (as required by the CCD) were stronger. As a result, the report recommends that data from states using an alternative reporting calendar be published, without adjustment, with data from the states that conform to the CCD reporting calendar, and a footnote be used to identify states using an alternative reporting calendar. This would add 12 states to the number whose CCD dropout data are reported by NCES. Because the effects of the other two variations are stronger and more variable than the first, it is recommended that NCES continue to withhold publication of data from the states that follow these variations. There were 10 such states in 1995. It appears from the analysis of dropout and completion data that the CCD can support a useful high school completion rate. This rate is the proportion of students who leave high school (grades 9 through 12) with a diploma or other credential to the total number of students who leave as completers or dropouts. High school equivalency recipients are excluded from the completer group because these data are not reported at the school district level, as are dropout and other high school graduation and completion counts. The report recommends that a method using multiple years of dropout data be used in preference to a synthetic, or reconstructive, rate based on a single year of information.

The CCD is a national database of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts. State Education Agencies (SEAs) complete CCD surveys each year, and a dropout component has been included in the CCD beginning with the 1991 dropout counts' reported on the 1992 CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey. A state's reporting of dropout statistics to the CCD is voluntary. While most states report dropout data to the CCD, some states do not conform to the CCD dropout definition. The variations in reporting practices affect the quality and comparability of the dropout data in the CCD. As a result, NCES publishes only the dropout rates from states that follow the CCD definition, and suppresses the dropout data from states that use nonconforming practices. The two goals of this study are: Evaluate the quality of dropout data in the CCD to determine whether it is feasible to compensate for inconsistencies in states' reporting practices, thereby providing a comparable CCD dropout rate for more states then is now possible, and Explore two methods of calculating a high school completion rate using the CCD, and provide an annual completion rate by state. This study used the CCD data to provide high school dropout and completion rates for 1993, 1994, and 1995. For states that did not conform to the dropout definition, an adjustment method was used to compensate for the effects of nonconformity and adjusted rates were estimated for these states to facilitate cross-state comparisons. Completion rates for each year were computed using a synthetic method (see Section 2.2). As dropout data collection continues in the CCD, the calculation of a longitudinal completion rate that emulates a true cohort rate is becoming possible.

Through the National Cooperative Education Statistics System, NCES worked with states and school districts to develop a dropout data collection and encourage the growth of the CCD as a national database for public school dropout information. Standardizing dropout data collection through the CCD required a common dropout definition for uniform reporting by all states. The development of the CCD dropout definition was a collaborative effort. NCES worked with state representatives, CCD coordinators, educational researchers, and the academic community to agree upon a common dropout definition. The statistical analysis report National Dropout Statistics Field Test Evaluation (NCES, 1992) describes the development and fieldtesting of an initial definition. The methodology report, State Dropout Data Collection Practices: 1991-92 School Year (Hoffman, 1995) follows with the outcome and adjustments that were made after the first year of implementation. NCES's annual reports on Dropout Rates in the United States (e.g., McMillen et al., 1997;McMillen and Kaufman, 1998;and Kaufman et al., 1999) provide statistics on high school dropout rates by academic year. These reports summarize the national dropout situation by analyzing data from several sources, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), the High School and Beyond Study (HS&B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the CCD. However, while the CPS data provide national and regional information about dropouts, the sample is not large enough for reliable analysis at the state or school district levels. The CCD, as an annual universe collection, can provide a 15 count of all public school dropouts. (Appendix A provides the CCD standard definition for classifying students as dropouts or not as dropouts.) NCES reports only dropout data that meet the quality and comparability standards necessary to support valid cross-state comparisons. The CCD annual event dropout rate is defined as the percentage of students classified as high school dropouts for a given school year and grade among all high school student members enrolled in that grade on October 1 of the same school year (including, of course, those who will drop out). Note that a composite grade 9-12 rate is based on the sum of dropouts and enrollments across these four grades. is the reported student membership for grades 9 to 12 in district i; and where ns, is the number of districts in state s. 2 Ungraded students are those students who are in classes or programs to which students are assigned without standard grade designations. The CCD is an alternative data source that can provide annual completion rates for public schools by state. Bose and Hoffman (1997) presented eight potential rates through which the CCD data can be used to give an estimate of high school completion. They compared each of these rates against a cohort rate (one obtained by following a group of students across four years of high school) and, with state support, suggested a completion rate based on counts of high school completers and dropouts. This is deliberately termed a \"completion\" rate. It is the proportion of students who leave high school with some completion credential compared to all students who leave school (completers and dropouts). Section 2.2.1 presents the longitudinal method of calculating this rate, and Section 2.2.2 shows the synthetic method. This report shows the results of using the two rates as well as discussing the pros and cons of each method."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Completion Rate", "text": "The longitudinal method of calculating a CCD completion rate, while not a true cohort approach in which students are followed through four years of high school, does emulate one. It accomplishes this by using data from grade 9 in year 1, grade 10 in year 2, and so on. For simplicity, the following expression shows the method of calculation using composite data at the state level.  is the number of graduates at year I; is the number of grade 12 dropouts at year t; s ' (1-1) is the number of grade 11 dropouts at year t-1; is the number of grade 10 dropouts at year t-2; and is the number of grade 9 dropouts at year t-3. (2) The number of graduates is taken from the district level data in the CCD Local Education Given the data available in the CCD, this method provides an estimate of completions that is close to the true cohort rate. Using four years of data allows the state or district rate to be less affected by one-year changes than a synthetic rate (based on a single year's data) would allow. One constraint of this method is that it requires dropout data for four consecutive years. Another constraint is that new district or school programs must be in place for several years to have a visible impact on this rate. Also, those districts that have a sizable net loss in students over time due to migration out of the district may be at a slight disadvantage since their dropouts from four years ago were drawn from a larger student body than that providing the number of completers in the current year. Instead of following something like a cohort of students over four years, this method uses the students of the current year as the synthetic cohort. For example, to compute the 1995 synthetic completion rate, the 1995 grade 9, 10, and 11 dropouts are used to reconstruct the 1994 grade 11 dropouts, the 1993 grade 10 6 18 dropouts, and the 1992 grade 9 dropouts. Using this reconstructed cohort, the calculation of a synthetic completion rate requires only one year of dropout data. The expression in equation 2  The synthetic completion rate is easier to compute than the longitudinal rate because it is not necessary to cumulate dropout data over four years. When the dropout situation and the student population are fairly consistent across the four years, the synthetic rate will provide a reasonable approximation to the longitudinal rate. However, when there are policy interventions and large  1993, 1994, and 1995. Since the calculations of both dropout and completion rates depend on dropout counts, improvements in the quality of dropout data in the CCD affect both statistics. 3.1  "}, {"section_title": "Extent of Nonconformance", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Types of Nonconforming Practices", "text": "Staff from NCES or the Bureau of the Census, which collects and edits the CCD data, contact the state CCD coordinator each year to verify the reporting practices for dropout data and to record the ways in which state practices differ from the CCD definition. Table 3-2 summarizes the differences between the CCD definition and the nonconforming practices. Alternative reporting calendar. The most common nonconforming practice is associated with the use of an alternative reporting calendar. The CCD dropout definition is based on an October-September reporting cycle with the summer months considered part of the school year preceding them. This approach is based on the cross-sectional perspective of taking a snapshot on October 1 of each year. It counts as dropouts those students who were enrolled in school at some time during the previous school year but are not enrolled by October 1 of the current school year. Students who return to school after October 1 (the snapshot day) are counted as dropouts for the previous school year. Students who left school during the previous school year but are re-enrolled on or before October 1 are not counted as dropouts. In contrast, some states use a July-June calendar cycle, in which the snapshot is taken on the last day of school, defined for convenience as June 30. Summer dropout. The second difference occurs with students who drop out between school years. The CCD definition classifies students who completed the previous school year but fail to enroll by October 1 as the dropouts from the grade and school year for which they fail to return. Some states, in contrast, count these students as dropouts from the grade and school year that they just completed. Table 3-3 shows the assignment of summer dropouts based on the CCD definition and the nonconforming practices. For example, students who completed grade 8 in 1994 but failed to enroll in grade 9 in October 1, 1995, are counted as grade 9 dropouts in 1995 under the CCD definition. In contrast, the nonconforming practice counts these students as grade 8 dropouts in 1994. Adult GED. The third difference concerns students in adult education programs preparing for the General Educational Development (GED) test. The CCD definition reports all students who transfer to adult GED programs as dropouts unless the school district tracks these students and reports them as dropouts should they leave the adult GED program. Students enrolled in secondary school programs preparing for GED are not dropouts. The nonconforming practice does not report any adult education GED students as dropouts; in other words, a student enrolled in any GED program is treated as a transfer."}, {"section_title": "3.3", "text": "Reporting Practices by State  1993, 1994, and 1995. Michigan, New Hampshire, and Washington did not report any dropout data for these years and are not included in this analysis. Texas reported in these years, but since it had a unique variation from the CCD procedures (dropouts who re-enrolled were never counted as dropouts again), the state's data were excluded from this research in order to make the adjustment model as robust as possible. Beginning with 1996, Texas is reporting in conformance with the CCD definition. Louisiana changed its dropout data collection system for 1995; for reasons of comparability, the 1993 and 1994 data for Louisiana were excluded from this research. Alaska, the District of Columbia, and Montana only reported dropout data for some of the years. Most states that differ from the CCD definition do so because of one nonconforming practice. For example, in 1995, 16 states followed an alternative reporting calendar'; five states (Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia) differed from the CCD standard in the way in which they reported summer dropouts; and six states (California, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico, Oregon, and South Carolina) did not conform in their reporting of adult GED. Florida, Oregon, and South Carolina were different because of both alternative reporting calendar and adult GED discrepancies. Virginia was nonconforming because of alternative reporting calendar and summer dropout differences; and Indiana was nonconforming because of summer dropout and adult GED differences. These states were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Section 4.3 summarizes the estimation of the model parameters and the results of applying the estimation model to three years of dropout data: 1993, 1994, and 1995.

Let y, denote the reported dropout count in the CCD agency file for district i. Since the reporting of yi is not standardized, it can be expressed as an arithmetic sum of components affected by reporting practices. An expression for y, is the following: is the dropout count by using the CCD definition; Ay,i is the deviation due to the nonconforming practice j; and j=1,2,3 for the practices: alternative reporting calendar, summer dropout, and adult GED. For districts in states that follow the CCD definition, the reported dropout counts are the CCD-definition counts; that is, yi = yFc\u00b0For districts that reported nonconforming data, the reported counts are not the CCD-definition count; that is, yi yFCD The counts of these districts deviate from the CCD-definition count, and the extent of deviation depends on the type of nonconforming practice. For example, for districts that reported using the alternative reporting calendar practice, the deviation is denoted as Ayii , and yccD + Ay,i . For districts that reported using the summer dropout practice, the deviation is denoted as Ayi2 , and Y, =yCCD +4,2. Likewise, for districts that reported using the adult GED practice, the deviation is denoted as Ay,3, and yi = +4,3. For districts that are different because of more that one variant practice, the effect of each practice is assumed to be independent and additive. For example, for districts that use all three nonconforming practices, yi = y, CCD + Ayil + Ay + Ayi3 . This formulation assumes no interaction effects between the nonconforming practices. This assumption is reasonable since each practice refers to a separate subset of dropout students, and the use of one practice does not presuppose the concurrent use of another practice. For districts reporting with nonconformance, the CCD-definition dropout count, .3/CCD is Unknown. One way to provide an estimate, j',FD , for these districts is to begin by first estimating the deviation components A.j.,y . Then, an adjusted 5/7 can be computed from equation 4as follows: In this equation, the Ojai are unknown and need to be estimated. xy = 0 if district reports with the CCD definition; is the intercept parameter for the regression line; are the coefficients associated with the three indicators of nonconformity; are the coefficients associated with the other explanatory covariates; are the other explanatory covariates, with k---1,2,..., 23 covariates in the model; and is the error parameter, assumed to have an independent AT(0,a 2) distribution. The dependent variable is specified as the logit (It) dropout rate. This transformation is selected to conform with the model assumption that the dependent variable follows an approximately normal distribution. (The actual dropout rate is constrained between 0 and 1 and unlikely to follow a normal distribution.) The dropout rate, ri , is computed as the percentage of dropouts for a given school year among student members enrolled as of October 1 of that school year. A limitation of the modeling approach is that the model outcomes depend on the data available to include in the estimation, and all models are subject to errors. To clearly present dropout estimates derived through modeling, this study derived approximate estimates of standard errors (see  "}, {"section_title": "Data for Modeling", "text": "This study used the dropout data from the CCD, Public Elementary/Secondary Agency Universe Survey unpublished internal working files that included data from both standard and nonconforming states. Table 4-1 shows the number of districts with high school dropout data for 1993, 1994, and 1995. These are districts that reported high school students (students in any one of grades 9 to 12) and dropout counts (value could be zero, but not missing)4. The choice of which data to include as explanatory variables in the adjustment model depends on extant state and district level data sources. The sources used in this study included the 1990 School District Databook, the 1991-92 F-33 fiscal information file, The Digest of Education Statistics for 1993 through 1995, and other auxiliary sources that provide information about state policies. Analysts familiar with these databases reviewed the content and suggested an initial list of variables for investigation. Table 4-2 shows the explanatory variables included in the final models. These variables were based on the results of the feasibility study by Winglee et al. (1997). In addition, several enhancements were added based on the suggestions of SEA representatives and other reviewers. For example, new variables were added to reflect the influence of state educational policies on the age of compulsory school attendance and the requirement for exit examinations before graduation. The current model specification offers several improvements over the initial research by Winglee et al. With better understanding of the types of nonconforming practices, the original model was respecified to avoid collinearities and redundancies in the estimation parameters. -1 For 1993, the dropout data come from the 1994 CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey, and the membership data are from the 1993 Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey, aggregated to district level. (The situation is similar for the following two years.)   The data distributions for continuous variables (such as income) were examined to identify outlying values that may have a large influence on the estimation. Extreme outlying values were either suppressed or set to a maximum value. The distributions of the data were tested for normality, and those distributions that failed the test were considered for transformation or recoding. For example, the median household income variable was normalized using the natural logarithm transformation. The variables on the percentage of students who are black, Hispanic, and American Indian were coded as indicator variables, to indicate high or low percentages of such students. These variables were recoded because there was no suitable transformation to attain normality. An initial set of explanatory variables was entered in the estimation equation and a method of backward elimination was used to delete variables that had no significant contribution to the variation in the predicted variable."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimation and Results", "text": "This section summarizes the method used to estimate the model parameters and the results.

The sizes of the differences, however, vary to some extent by year and by grade. The effects associated with the alternative reporting calendar practice are small but consistently positive, suggesting that this practice is associated with a slight overreporting of dropouts relative to the CCD definition. The effects of summer dropouts are less consistent and the magnitude of the effect is not always significant by grade. The effects due to adult GED are consistently statistically significant and negative in all three years. Districts that are nonconforming because of the adult GED practice are reporting dropout rates lower than districts that conform with the CCD definition. The estimated effects associated with the nonconforming practices are fairly consistent for 1994 and 1995. The slight variation in the size of the estimates by year may be a function of the change in reporting status for some states. Another possibility is that the explanatory variables based on Census information of the average family income and percentage of families receiving public assistance may be dated as the model ages. Further research may use a modeling approach that combines these two years of data to derive a more stable estimate.

The variance of the adjusted state dropout rates, ignoring the covariance of districts within states, is approximated as follows: The modeling error of the adjusted state dropout rate is the square root of this variance and it reflects the error associated with the model estimation.

For consistency, all rates are shown with two significant digits, and their standard errors with one significant 26 digit. These tables show both a reported rate and an adjusted rate for each statistic. The adjusted rate is an estimate of the CCD-definition rate derived using the method described in Section 5.1. For states that conform to the CCD definition, the reported and the adjusted rate are the same because no adjustment is necessary. For states that did not conform, the reported rates are affected by the reporting practices. The adjusted rates for these states are estimates of the CCD definition rate, and approximate estimates of the modeling error are shown in parentheses to indicate the errors associated with model estimation. For example, in 1993 West Virginia reported an annual dropout rate at 3.8 percent; when adjusted for nonconformity this became 4.8 percent. In 1995, West Virginia again reported a 3.8 percent dropout rate; this was not adjusted since the state was now in agreement with the CCD definition.

To test whether each of these adjustments are significantly different from the reported rates, it is necessary to control for the effect of multiple comparisons. Using the conservative Bonferroni procedure, differences were required to exceed 2.8 times the estimated standard error to be considered statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level. Comparisons that are significantly different are indicated with an asterisk. With the exception of a few states, the adjusted estimates are not significantly different from those reported. In fact, a closer examination shows that the differences are not significant for the states that are nonconforming simply because of an alternative reporting year or summer dropout. The significant differences are in states that do not follow the CCD procedures for adult GED. In general, the percentage change in the dropout rate due to adjustment is small for the alternative reporting calendar practice, but more substantial for the summer dropout and the adult GED practices. Depending on the variant practice, the percentage difference between the adjusted and the reported dropout rates ranges from -23 to 72 percent. The relative change associated with the adjustments on the completion rates is smaller; here, the percentage change ranges from about -19 to 12 percent. Since relatively few states use the summer dropout or the adult GED practice, which account for the larger adjustments, the overall effect of adjustment nationally across all reporting states is small. It ranges from between 7 and 10 percent for the dropout rate, and between -2 and -3 percent for the completion rate. Completion rates for 1995. The synthetic completion rates for 1995 (shown in Table 5-3) are shown along with the longitudinal rate in Table 5-4. For most states, the two rates are very similar. The longitudinal rate is theoretically more precise because it uses a pseudo-cohort approach, and it takes into account the reporting practice of dropout data each year. The synthetic rate, however, is a close approximation for most states even though it relies on a single year of data."}, {"section_title": "39", "text": "Longitudinal completion rates are computed only for 1995 because of data limitations. This rate requires dropout data for four consecutive years. However, unpublished internal working files with dropout data from both standard and nonconforming states were available for 1993 through 1995 only. Therefore, the 1995 longitudinal rate shown here used the dropout counts from grade 12 for 1995, grade 11 for 1994, and both grades 9 and 10 for 1993. (The grade 9 dropout count should have been that from 1992.) As dropout data collection continues in the CCD, the calculation of a longitudinal completion rate becomes more feasible.

Figures 5-1 through 5-3 display the data shown in the corresponding tables 5-1 through 5-3. The statistics shown include the adjusted synthetic high school completion rate, the adjusted dropout rate, and the reported dropout rate by states for 1993, 1994, and 1995. Likewise, figure 5-4 shows the data in table 5-4 on the adjusted longitudinal completion rate, the adjusted synthetic completion rate, and the reported longitudinal rates for 1995. The longitudinal method is preferred as dropout data become available in the CCD. The states are shown in order, sorted by the statistics in the first column. That is, states with higher completion rates are shown on top and ranked in descending order. The completion rate was used to determine the sort sequence because this statistic is less affected by the quality of the dropout data. In each data panel, the dotted line shows the average for all reporting states. and the type of nonconforming practices were known, and data were available to support the modeling. The advantage of modeling is that it is possible to test for systematic differences between data reported with the CCD definition and the nonconforming practices, and to estimate the magnitude of these differences. Processes of model development. The processes of model development require careful model specification, data management, and iterative steps of testing, refinement, and evaluation to improve the model. To prepare the data for modeling was not a trivial process. The process began with, a review of extant data sources to select data suitable to include in the model; this was followed by exploratory data analyses to look at the data properties, presence of outliers, missing data, and the relationships between related data fields. Tests were then conducted to examine the distributions of the data, and the normality of the data distributions. For data items that failed this test, mathematical transformations were used to normalize the data such that the input data fit with the model requirements and underlying assumptions. Preliminary models were fitted and refitted successively. At each fitting, a backwards elimination procedure was used to delete, one at a time, those variables that failed to meet the threshold for statistically significant contribution to explaining the variation in the reported dropout data. The final set of explanatory variables was reviewed and further enhanced based on the recommendations of reviewers and SEA representatives. Estimation. The overall results of estimation show systematic statistically significant differences between the CCD definition data and the nonconforming practices. The difference associated with the alternative reporting calendar practice is relatively small. For state estimates, the adjustment for this difference results in percentage changes of about 10 percent in the high school dropout rates by states, and less than 5 percent change in completion rates. The differences associated with reporting variations for summer dropout and adult GED are larger. The adjustment for summer dropout results in percentage changes that range from 0 to 19 percent. The adjustment for adult GED results in a percentage change ranging from 33 to 72 percent. Since there are relatively few states that use either the summer dropout or the adult GED practice, very few states had large adjustments. More years of data and repeated tests of these estimates would be needed before recommending their use. Calculating completion rates with CCD data. Through a cooperative process with states, NCES developed a CCD completion rate calculation. This rate uses grades 9 through 12 dropout and 39 51 completion data to produce an average completion rate; that is, of those students who leave school, what percentage of them graduated. This rate excludes those students who are still enrolled in school from that . year's rate since they are neither dropouts nor completers. Longitudinal Versus Synthetic Completion Rates. This study explored two methods to 'calculate high school completion rates using CCD data. The preferred way is a longitudinal rate that uses four years of dropout data. The intent is to mimic a true cohort approach by following consecutive grades through four years. A simpler method is a synthetic or a \"reconstructive\" cohort approach. This approach uses the current year data to reconstruct the past. The results from the two methods were similar in most states. 6.2"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Reporting dropout rates of nonconforming states. One of the major purposes of this report was to discuss possible approaches to adjusting dropout rates. The results of the analysis support NCES using state dropout data of nonconforming states and calculating a state-level high school completion rate. There are a few possible approaches to how NCES could report dropout data. The Status Quo. NCES could continue to report only those state dropout rates that conform with the original NCES definition. This would require no manipulation of the reported numbers. However, when verifying states' dropout reports, the majority of the states that do not conform reported no future plans to do so. This approach would mean that NCES could report only approximately 23 state dropout rates. Use the regression model to report nonconforming states. The model used in this analysis can be used to adjust the dropout data of the non-conforming states so that their data can be reported with the other states. That procedure would allow NCES to publish data for all but those states that do not report any dropout data. On the other hand, the model development was difficult, the GED and Summer effects were large, and the model's explanatory power was moderate. Also, using a regression model to adjust reported figures can be difficult to explain to data users. Report dropout data from states that use an alternative reporting calendar. The final option is to use unadjusted data from states that use the July-June reporting calendar as their only area of nonconformance. This would add 12 more states' dropout data to public files and reports. The difference associated with the alternative reporting calendar practice was found to have small impact on state-level comparisons. Hence for simplicity, no adjustment would be made to the reported data. Further, those states who collect their data on the alternative reporting calendar might have the most difficulty in adjusting their systems to conform with the current definition since this would require modifying the state's entire reporting model as opposed to reclassifying some smaller group of students (e.g. adult GED participants) within an existing system. The major argument against accepting these nonstandard data would be that they would add a small amount of noncomparability to the NCES file. Reporting state-level completion rates. The second purpose of this report was to develop a high school completion rate that could be used for state-level reports. Using available CCD data, the proposed completion rate seems a reasonable measure of how many students leave high school successfully. The synthetic version of this rate requires only one year of dropout and completion data to calculate. However, the longitudinal rate reflects changes in dropout rates from year to year and more accurately presents a state's completions."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "Three factors were considered in reviewing the findings of this study: data quality, the feasibility of obtaining data, and the usefulness of resulting information. On the whole, accepting dropout data from states that use the July-June calendar appears the best compromise among all three. The effect of this variation is small. It tends to produce dropout rates that are slightly higher than those produced under the standard definition, which should encourage nonconforming states to change their reporting. Adding 12 states to the dropout file would greatly increase the data's usefulness. While developing and testing the dropout adjustment model proved beneficial to the basic understanding of state reporting, the estimations were not stable enough over time, nor did the model account for enough of the variance to strongly support its use in adjusting reported data. These models should be tested again when more years of CCD dropout data are available. The dropout data are highstakes statistics, and reporting potentially complicated \"calculated\" dropout numbers does not seem feasible at this time. Finally, it appears feasible to produce a high school completion rate using CCD dropout and graduation data. The longitudinal rate is recommended because it is less affected by single-year or onetime changes in dropout rates within a district and thus would likely be more useful in assessing the need for, or success of, intervention programs."}, {"section_title": "41", "text": "6.4"}, {"section_title": "Caveats", "text": "This analysis used the Local Education Agency Survey (school district) count of high school completers in calculating the completion rate because the dropout counts, which are also used in the completion rate, are reported on this survey. The sum of school district high school completers for a state may not match the numbers reported on the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education. This is because high school equivalency recipients are reported only on the state-level survey and because there may be other legitimate differences such as the granting of diplomas independent of any local school district between the district and state surveys. As a result, variables found only in the state level survey cannot be readily used in analyses of the proposed completion rate. Data users should also be cautious in applying either the dropout or completion rates to very small school districts. The fewer students a district enrolls, the more impact a single dropout or graduate can have on the total rate. Under these conditions, differences of one or two students can give the impression of considerable change. 54"}]
