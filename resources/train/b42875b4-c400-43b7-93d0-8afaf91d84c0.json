This statement has been the driving force for those advocating constructivist teaching methods. Constructivist learning theory suggests that people construct personal understanding by modifying their existing concepts (or schema) when new evidence and an experience is presented. This implies that students do not simply accept what has been taught, but rather shift their understanding in response to what has been taught.\nIf teachers are to embody the constructivist learning theory, than they need to discard their na\u043fve conceptions of scientific phenomena and relearn the currently accepted explanations of scientific phenomena so they can teach their students accordingly. Teachers need to know and accept content, evaluate student ideas and understandings, and provide learning experiences to align students' conceptions with scientific explanations. This is particularly true in the domain of earth science as more states are requiring earth science in their curricula with less formally trained earth science teachers (Dickerson, 2002; Veal, 2002) . Many agencies and organizations have set benchmarks for tackling this problem."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the study", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the basic content knowledge of preservice middle and secondary science teachers on 3 broad stratifications of science (life, physical and earth science) and how their existing knowledge aligned with INTASC Standard I and the NSTA Core Knowledge Standards. Preservice teachers are operationally defined as those students who do not yet have license to teach. This group of students consists of undergraduates (freshmansenior) and alternative licensure students (students with an earned bachelors degree returning to earn licensure). In North Carolina for example, teacher education programs are graduating students with the fulfilled requirements for a comprehensive science teacher license. However, the lack of emphasis on earth science during their training can pose a problem if preservice teachers are to someday instruct students on the basics of earth science and ultimately meet the standards set forth by federal and state agencies. It has been assumed that those with a richer background in specific science content domains would know and teach that content more effectively (Borko, 1996) . The research question thus became: Do alternative licensure students possess greater earth science content knowledge according to INTASC standard I and the NSTA core knowledge standards than undergraduate preservice students?"}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Since the 1980's, secondary school preservice teacher education has focused on pedagogy with the assumption students already possess strong content knowledge. However, with teacher shortages in critical areas such as science and mathematics, preservice teacher graduates are often hired by school systems to teach subjects in which they are not domain experts. Recent legislation in the form of No Child Left Behind is requiring teachers to be highly qualified and therefore teacher educators must prepare preservice teachers to be just that. Teachers cannot effectively educate students on subjects they themselves aren't comfortable with or confident in (Ball, 1990) . Borko (1996) reported that most teachers' content knowledge comes from what they absorbed from their disciplinary fields, while their pedagogy and understanding of communication comes from the field of education. This only emphasizes the literature that science educators approach problems differently than pure scientists due in part to the science educators pedagogical knowledge and understanding of the implications of learning science (Borko, 1996) . If future teachers are misinformed or have poor understanding of specific concepts, it is quite likely they will perpetuate these naiive conceptions to their students (Boyes, 1995) ."}, {"section_title": "INTASC Standard I and the NSTA Core Knowledge Standards", "text": "Licensing teachers to instruct students in basic science content has been a challenge for colleges and schools of education. There is never-ending discussion about the depth of content knowledge students should learn across the content areas and how this should be balanced with pedagogy. What do teachers need to know in terms of content knowledge and pedagogy is often debatable. The Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) and the National Science Teachers Association have set out to make these objectives clear for teachers of all grade levels and with all types of certification. What follows is an overview of the vision of these two agencies.\nThe Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) is a collaboration of state and national educational organizations dedicated to reform the preparation, licensing, and professional development of teachers. The first INTASC principle focuses on teacher content knowledge and describes this knowledge as \"\u2026the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline\u2026\" (p. 1). The principle is separated into knowledge, dispositions, and performances the teachers should be able to demonstrate. While the contentbased standards are still under development, teachers should know the most important concepts and the methods used to generate these ideas. Additionally, teachers should understand that students' prior knowledge and their schema could influence their learning. Ultimately, this principle relates students' schema to the potential misconceptions they hold regarding the content.\nWith regard to dispositions, the first INTASC principle requires that teachers view knowledge as complex and ever evolving. This implies that teachers must evolve with new ideas and findings within their teaching discipline. Furthermore, teachers must appreciate multiple perspectives and can explain to their students how these perspectives are developed from the point of view of the knower. The teacher will also regularly demonstrate an enthusiasm for the subject matter and must be committed to continually learn about subject matter and the most effective ways for students to learn that subject.\nFinally, the first INTASC principle outlines teachers' effective performances as including multiple representations and explanations that activate and build on students' schema. Teachers must also evaluate resources and materials according to their accuracy and completeness. They have to engage students in inquiry-style activities that require students to test hypotheses according to the acceptable scientific standards.\nThe NSTA Core Knowledge Standards are based on a review of the professional science education literature and on the goals set forth in the National Science Education Standards. These standards outline the knowledge that teachers ought to have about specific content in four areas of scientific study: biology, chemistry, earth sciences, and physics. Within each of these domains, numerous objectives describe the most important ideas teachers ought to understand and demonstrate throughout their preservice experiences."}, {"section_title": "A call for strong science content knowledge", "text": "Since the science education movement began in the 1960's, the study of student misconceptions about scientific phenomena have been prolific in the literature. Students develop these misconceptions as a result of either personal experience, from other people, or through the media (Ausubel, 1968; Driver, 1985) . Driver (1985) reported that different people have different misconceptions in different areas of science.\nIn teacher education, it is critical to evaluate the conceptions of preservice teachers. If they have misconceptions, it is likely they will pass the incorrect content on to their future students. The result of persistent wrong conceptions about scientific phenomena is an illinformed citizenry and a reduced possibility of appropriate preventive actions by these citizens against future problems (Boyes, 1995) . This is a cascading effect that has not been widely addressed. For example, an analysis of survey data indicated that the many pre-service high school teachers possess an array of misconceptions about the causes and effects of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, and acid rain (Khalid, 2003) . The problem grows more complex due to mismatched concept and student developmental levels. Inaccuracies in textbooks, incorrect information provided by instructors, and student memorization of prior concepts without meaningful understanding of the basic concepts compounds the problem and ultimately creates a lineage of confused science concepts (Westbrook, 1992) .\nIn earth science education, it is not well documented as to what preservice teachers know or what they are learning to prepare them to be effective teachers. Much of the literature on earth science has focused on what K-12 students know about earth science phenomena. There are a few exceptions to this as (Barba, 1992 (Barba, , 1993 Schoon, 1995; Stofflett, 1993; Trend, 2000 Trend, , 2001 attempted to look into preservice teacher earth science knowledge. Gruber (1999 Gruber ( -2000 reported that 79% of earth science teachers were not earth science majors. Furthermore, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (2000) reported that 19% of grade 8 teachers were earth science majors. Grade 8 is the level where earth science has traditionally been taught until recently integrated into the high school curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Science Teacher Development", "text": "What teachers know and do is the most important influence on what students learn (The National Commission on Teaching and America 's Future, 1996) . If we are to challenge students to deeper understanding and high order thinking, teachers need to have a thorough conceptual and pedagogical understanding of content (Enfield, 2000) . This has become to be known as Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). Shulman (1986) defined PCK as the understanding of what makes the learning of specific topics easy or difficult. Shulman (1987) elaborated on this definition as, PCK encompasses knowledge of students' preconceptions, understanding and alternative conceptions of specific topics in the subject, knowledge of curriculum and standards, and finally instructional strategies and representations for teaching specific subject matter. Veal (1999) suggested that PCK is a hierarchy that encompasses General PCK, Domainspecific PCK and Topic-specific PCK. General PCK refers to the different content disciplines (math, science, history, etc.). Domain-specific PCK is a branch of these disciplines. For example science domains are: chemistry, physics, biology, etc. Finally, Topic-specific PCK refers to the specific topics within each domain. For example in earth science, Topic-specific PCK would entail seismology, rocks and mineral properties, topography, etc. Teachers with knowledge in the Topic-specific PCK would most likely have an array of techniques and skills in the General and Domain-specific area.\nExpert teachers are said to possess Topic-specific PCK (Reynolds, 1995; Shulman, 1987) . Preservice teachers, and subsequently teachers in their early years of practice (who are not considered expert), have an expectation that there is a straightforward process for science teaching, not unlike the scientific method, and if they follow this process they will be effective science teachers (Smith, 2000) . However, teaching is not straightforward, and neither is learning. Student learning ultimately results from a conglomerate of teacher traits, skills and practices, which when well developed lead to effectively teaching Topic-specific pedagogical content (Shymansky, 2000) . It is at this juncture of teaching experience and PCK where teachers must be able to diagnose student misunderstandings and later prescribe strategies to combat such misunderstandings (Butler, 2003) . When teachers learn to focus on student understanding, they recognize the need to modify their teaching practices. They become motivated to engage in the change process, and they begin to use student responses to assess whether they are teaching effectively (Harcombe, 2001) . It is only at this point when teachers can be considered expert.\nArguably the most important component of PCK is science content knowledge. If a teacher is strong in pedagogy but lacks the science core knowledge to facilitate students beyond their misconceptions, then learning will most likely not occur. In licensing science teachers, it is critical we are preparing them to be highly qualified, helping them develop strong teaching methods and properly juxtapose their content knowledge to their pedagogy to elicit meaningful learning."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "A case study designed was used with twenty-four students enrolled in an introduction to science teaching course at a large, southeastern United States university were the sample of the study. The course design was 2-pronged: An introduction to teaching for science majors who are considering the teaching field as a profession; and an introduction to how the science students learn science content. The sample consisted of 19 undergraduates (1 freshman, 6 sophomores, 8 juniors and 4 seniors) and 5 alternative licensure students. Alternative licensure students are defined in this study as those students with a documented bachelors degree in a science domain and who have returned for teaching licensure."}, {"section_title": "Instrument and data collection", "text": "The students in this course were challenged on their basic content knowledge in 3 critical areas of science taught in the middle and secondary schools (physical, life and earth science). Students were assessed as to what, if any, misconceptions they thought their future students had within these broad content areas prior to the administration of the instrument. Using 15 released grade 8 items from the 1995 and 2000 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) test; an instrument was designed to garner the knowledge these students possess in these domains and to challenge what they thought they already knew about these domains. Five items were used to gain insight into student knowledge of life science, 6 from physical science and 4 from earth science. These items were chosen due to their alignment with the NSTA core knowledge standards (Appendix A) and because they are used as the benchmarks for domain specific knowledge of grade 8 students nationally and internationally. Table 1 illustrates a matrix of the NSTA Core competencies and how they align with the items within the instrument.\nLife science items aligned with 7 of 12 core knowledge standards for biology. The physical science items aligned with 11 of 12 physics core knowledge standards and 2 of the 13 chemistry standards. Finally, the earth science items aligned with 8 of 12 core knowledge standards. Appendix A illustrates specific standards addressed by each question in the instrument.\nStudents were given this instrument in class and the results were used to inform future instruction. The multiple choice items were selected based on the responses students provided as to their belief of their knowledge in these areas. Anecdotal evidence prior to administering the test suggested students did not feel as confident with their knowledge of earth science as opposed to their knowledge in life and physical science. As earth science is becoming a required and tested course in middle and high schools, the results of the instrument would shed light on the areas where preservice science instruction needs to be redirected so future teachers are better prepared to teach a wide variety of science topics; most specifically earth science."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "Student responses to the instrument were collapsed into life, physical and earth science based on the content description provided by the NAEP and TIMSS test.

Frequency of responses based on academic year (grouped as freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and alternative licensure) was calculated and a KruskalWallis test was conducted. Differences in mean rankings were analyzed to gain insight as to which, if any, academic subgroup had more knowledge of these 3 areas of science content than another. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the academic subgroups and the results of the instrumental responses. From this table it is interesting to note that the percent of questions in the physical science domain that all students answered correctly is the lowest (0.725) of the 3 content domains. However, the standard deviation in responses is considerably higher for earth science (2.395). A mean rank was calculated for each content domain based on the academic year of the respondents (see table 3). Sophomores had a higher rank on life science (15.25) and juniors had the highest rank in physical (15.0) and earth science (16.0) respectively. Although Chi square results show life (4.514), physical (3.938) and earth (7.686) sciences are considerably different in terms of responses from this sample, the Kruskal-Wallis test suggest no differences in student scores for any of the 3 domains tested (see table 4). "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The null hypothesis of no differences in accurate knowledge of earth science phenomena between preservice science teachers and alternative licensure students is not accepted. It is important to note that only 1 freshman was a participant of the study and thus does not provide a true reading of content knowledge differences between these groups. The university in which the study took place has recently made accommodations to the science teacher licensure program to encompass more required earth science courses to better prepare the graduates with a broader knowledge base in the sciences. However, what is intriguing are the mean ranks illustrated in table 2. These students take most of the biological sciences in the freshman year and physical sciences in the sophomore and early junior years. Most of the participants take the required earth science content courses during the junior year and juniors performed better on earth science questions than the other academic levels. The basic knowledge of earth science is more than likely fresher to these students and thus it might explain why they performed better on the earth science items in the instrument.\nThese results suggest the potential impact of graduating teachers with lacking Domainspecific knowledge; specifically in earth science. In North Carolina for example, the majority of first year teachers with a comprehensive teaching license are generally asked to teach earth science. With recent science education reform movements advocating for a greater development of PCK for preservice teachers (Doster, 1997) it is crucial teacher educators develop an understanding of what their prospective teachers have assimilated in their science content courses.\nThe National Science Education Standards call for teachers to acknowledge and redirect student preconceptions about incorrect scientific phenomena (National Research Council, 1996) . It can be argued that teachers who themselves have misconceptions about basic scientific phenomena will not likely be able to redirect students with naive conceptions. As Standard 1 of the National Science Teachers Association (1998, section 1. Moreover, INTASC I calls for teachers to be able to articulate the major concepts within the science domain in which they teach. Certainly, one could argue that grade 8 test items are not complex enough to be considered anything other then \"Big Ideas\" in that domain. These standards need to be taken seriously and teacher educators need to acquire information that assures their students are prepared to teach a wide variety of science topics. Hewson and Hewson (1983) defined conceptual change as allowing learners to examine their own experiences and confront naive conceptions. It is critical that teacher educators challenge presevice teachers to confront expert views and to reflect upon their current views and how that might impact teaching and learning; specifically in earth science (Dahl et. al., 2004) . As Lynch (2003) suggested, with increased understanding of content, teachers may change their beliefs on how science should be taught. \"Unless we make some effort to explore students personal theories we will continue to graduate college students with their childhood misconceptions virtually untouched\" (Woods, 1994) . In science education if this phenomenon is perpetuated, the NSTA Core Knowledge Standards and INTASC Standard I will likely never be met. 1, 7, 11 "}]
