METHODS AND MATERIALS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Aerial Photograph Acquisition", "text": "Aerial photographs were ordered by NBEP with specifications from NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP): Guidance for Regional Implementation (Dobson et. al, 1995) for obtaining optimal SAV visibility. Two overflights were used: 1:12,000 scale (1:12K) true color transparencies for SAV photo interpretation, and 1:40,000 scale (1:40K) true color transparencies for photo interpreting estuarine and marine habitats. The 1:12K overflight was obtained to maximize detection of SAV, primarily Z.marina, under conditions approaching peak biomass, low haze, low wind speed, minimal to no cloud cover, low tide and low turbidity. The 1:40K overflight used for coastal habitat mapping allowed reasonably accurate mapping with respect to production costs, efficiency of transfer, and targeted minimum mapping units for GIS map production and display. Research personnel from the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography (URI-GSO) provided information to the NBEP on the peak biomass of eelgrass and water clarity in the coastal ponds. Their information assisted with instruction to the air photo contractors regarding optimal time of overflight for eelgrass detection. Both overflights were taken on June 5, 1999 by the James W. Sewell Company, Old town, Maine. Photography was reviewed by NRAG and determined suitable quality for purposes of the project."}, {"section_title": "Data Preparation", "text": "NRAG prepared aerial photos for photo delineation in the following manner: a. Each model was mounted with a Grafix Wet Media Dura-Lar .004 gauge 9 inch by 9 inch Mylar, affixed with drafting tape at each corner. b. Each work area Mylar was pin-registered to each photo model at four corners. c. Identifying notations in permanent black ink were made on each work area Mylar (photo number, adjoining photo number and edge lines). d. Labels identifying photo number, date, scale and project were affixed on the upper edge of the photos. e. Work area photo edge lines allowed for distortion at outer edges of the photos while accommodating tie area overlap. f. Photography was indexed and organized into separate folders by flight lines and quadrangles."}, {"section_title": "Determining Project Limits and System Breaks", "text": "Landward limits of the project area were determined both in the field and during photo interpretation as the limits of estuarine brackish vegetation or brackish deepwater habitat, with respect to the following definitions in Cowardin et al., 1979: The estuarine system extends (1) upstream and landward to where ocean-derived salts measure less than 0.5 parts per thousand during the period of average annual flow; (2) an imaginary line closing the mouth of a river, bay or sound; and (3) to the seaward limits of wetland emergents, shrubs or trees where they are not included in (2). Seaward project limits were established by defining the mouth of Little Narragansett Bay in Watch Hill, the openings of breachways or inlets of coastal lagoons (Winnapaug, Quonochontaug, Ninigret, Green Hill, Point Judith and Great Salt Ponds). Where coastal lagoons are not breached, estuarine conditions were determined from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program, As Amended and/or from personal references. The system breaks between the Estuarine and Marine environments were established with respect to Cowardin et al., 1979: The Marine System extends from the outer edge of the continental shelf shoreward to one of three lines: (1) the landward limit of tidal inundation (extreme high water of spring tides), including the splash zone from breaking waves; (2) the seaward limit of wetland emergents, trees, or shrubs; or (3) the seaward limits of the Estuarine System, where this limits is determined by factors other than vegetation. It is noted that freshwater wetlands and deepwater habitats, including those classified in Cowardin et al. (1979) as \"tidally-influenced\" are not included in the inventory. Users are referred to Cowardin for further definition of the tidally-influenced freshwater system. Some wetland areas observed during photointerpretation appear to be former estuarine wetlands, altered by restriction, ditching or other activities which changed classification from estuarine to tidally-influenced freshwater, and are therefore not mapped with this inventory. Such areas, however, may be subject to future analysis as potential estuarine wetland restoration sites."}, {"section_title": "Minimum Mapping Units", "text": "Minimum polygonal mapping units (MMU) targeted for this project are 0.5 acre for Z. marina beds and .25 acre for isolated polygonal coastal wetlands and deepwater habitats. The internal targeted MMU (wetland types within other wetland types) was contracted to be 3.0-to-5.0 acres; however, smaller internal polygons of around 1.0 acre in size were mapped where types of particular ecological significance are found (e.g., pools within high marshes). Inclusion of small significant habitat types was based on photo quality, photointerpreter judgment and field site information. It is noted that excessive internal mapping can create difficulties for project production costs and GIS map display. The level of mapping detail is dictated by the scope of the project, photo quality, the scale of photography used and photointerpreter judgment. The MMU for linear estuarine and marine habitats was pen width or approximately 35 feet on the ground using 1:40K scale photography. Collateral use of the 1:12K photography for verification of fringe marsh and beaches resulted in linear features slightly less than pen width, except where shadowed on either source photography. Therefore, an estimated average width of 27.5 feet was used to calculate acreage statistics. The linear foot (LF) MMU for line segments was 1/8 inch or about 250 LF at 1:24K base map scale. In contrast to the bay inventory all aquatic beds were mapped as polygonal data for the South Shore provided they were photointerpretable."}, {"section_title": "Field Work", "text": "Prior to photointerpretation, NRAG staff previewed aerial photos, selected field sites, and noted them on USGS 1:24K topographic maps for in-field orientation. Field data was collected for two purposes: 1) to discriminate photosignatures unique to various habitat types as workable with the type and scale of source photography, and 2) to provide an ecological profile of habitat types representative of the project area. Site selection criteria included the following: a) areas representative of project area ecology; b) areas disturbed and potentially requiring NWI modifiers in classification; c) areas used to establish system and sub-system classification breaks; d) areas affected by haze, shadow, emulsion or other photography quality concerns; e) areas accessible with respect to trespassing and time constraints. The NBEP coordinated the SAV field work in the coastal ponds, Little Narragansett Bay, and Great Salt Pond in Block Island. The RIDEM Office of Water Resources-Shellfish Program, Division of Enforcement, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, New Shoreham Harbor Patrol, and Brown University provided personnel and boats to the NRAG to perform fieldwork in August and September 1999. A total of 80 SAV field sites were inspected and documented by boat observation and sampling. No dives were undertaken. A total of 37 estuarine and marine habitat sites were inspected and documented by vehicle and by foot, primarily coastal wetlands, lagoons, and beach habitats. Field data sheets were developed by NRAG specifically for the project."}, {"section_title": "Aerial Photointerpretation and Quality Control", "text": "Photodelineation utilized Cartographic Engineering mirrored stereoscopes and rapidographs at 4x0 line weight with permanent black India ink. For mapping SAV, use of Cowardin et al. (1979) permits description of the beds to life form and water regime (see Tables 2 and 3). Z. marina was differentiated from other SAV species by the subclass \"3,\" rooted vascular; however, there was one field verified bed of Ruppia which is classified the same as Zostera (Ninigret Pond). Map classification and delineation techniques for the SAV, coastal wetlands and deepwater habitats were based on Cowardin et al. (1979) and the accompanying Photointerpretation Conventions for the National Wetlands Inventory (National Wetlands Inventory, 1995). The coastal wetland data presented with this project as a mapping product is not intended to substitute for on-site determinations or delineations in permitting. The mapped delineations of coastal wetlands are not to be transferred or represented for regulatory purposes. Coastal features included in the inventory are dunes and coastal banks. Photointerpretation of these features was as best determined on the 1:40K photography and with reference to definitions in the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program, As Amended, (RICRMP) Sections 210. These features are mapped using photointerpretation techniques, and are not to be transferred or represented for regulatory purpose, and cannot substitute for on-site regulatory determinations or delineations in state or other permitting. Additionally, mapping of coastal bank and dune polygons assists with display of the data, in that these features are distinguished from upland islands and inclusions in the coastal zone. The shoreline delineation is calculated from the landward limits of mapped linework (polygon and linear). The shoreline representation is a product of a mapping effort, and is not intended for regulatory purpose. For quality control of the photointerpretation, each completed annotated mylar was examined by a photointerpreter other than the one producing the original photodelineations and classifications. Corrections were made as needed to maintain accuracy and consistency throughout the map product.

Data were transferred from the aerial photograph overlays to USGS 1:24K stable base mylars affixed with registered frosted mylar overlays. Frosted mylars containing the rectified data were fist quality controlled by NRAG staff, rectified data was then scanned by FWS and sent to URI/EDC. Quality control of rectified data addressed alignment, labeling and linework completions prior to delivery for digitizing.

Summary", "text": "A total of 118,583.2 acres of coastal wetlands, deepwater habitats and coastal features were inventoried with this project. Of the total, 570.3 acres of eelgrass; 1,903 acres of coastal marshes; 117 acres of tide pools; 1,628 acres of tidal flats and streambeds; 856 acres of beaches; 191 acres of rocky shore; 244 acres of dune; 85 acres of coastal bank; 4 acres of oyster reef; and 19 acres of jetties ad breakwaters were inventoried. Using the 1:12K imagery provided for this project, a reasonably conclusive photosignature unique to Z. marina was established for interpretation. Various field-to-photo signature correlations from other kinds of algal beds further defined photosignature characteristics of Z. marina. Field verification of eelgrass by boat sampling and observation was conducted, supported by various collateral information for sites not accessed during field work. Beds were either purely Z. marina or dominated by the species. Numerous small sized Z. marina beds are not likely mapped with this inventory. This may be attributed to lack of reflectance contrast in the ponds. It is suggested that point locations of small Z. marina beds be added to the data base using field personnel and location aids such as GPS. Outer limits of Z. marina beds were not able to be accurately represented. As beds drop off with depth, reflectance contrast between the vegetation and the open water is reduced. Turbidity may further confound accurate interpretation of outer boundaries. Z. marina was inventoried in estuarine (about 553 acres) and in marine (18 acres) environments. Highest areas and densities of eelgrass occur in Ninigret and Potter Ponds. The locations, extent, and acreages of estuarine and marine habitats may be used to perform analysis of potential wetland restoration sites; for example, tidally-restricted wetlands, filled wetlands, and wetlands colonized by Phragmites australis. A trends analysis may be helpful to determine acreages and possible causes of coastal habitat loss and degradation over selected time intervals. Increased map detail on the extent and locations of Phragmites australis, or other plant communities of special interest, is possible using larger scale imagery and transferring the information to the data base, as was performed for the Narragansett Bay Coastal Wetland Restoration Project. Data on tidally restricted marshes may locate opportunities for salt marsh restoration."}]
