[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In 1999, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry for misleading the general public on the dangers of tobacco use, thereby violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 1 In proceedings that followed this suit, US District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the tobacco industry to make \"corrective statements\" about the hazards of tobacco use. 1 To this end, corrective advertising campaigns were executed via newspapers (from November 2017 to May 2018) and television (from November 2017 to November 2018); court-ordered corrective messaging placement on tobacco company corporate websites (beginning June 2018) and as onserts on cigarette packages (beginning November 2018) are currently ongoing. 2,3 Antismoking advertisement placement at retail points of sale are currently the subject of ongoing litigation. 4 Antismoking mass media campaigns are a key component of tobacco control strategies recommended by the World Health Organization. [5][6][7] Exposure to antismoking advertising has been shown to be associated with decreased smoking prevalence, as well as increased likelihood of smoking cessation intentions and attempts. [8][9][10][11][12][13] Studies suggest that media channel type 11 ; source (government, pharmaceutical, and tobacco industry) 9,14 ; content, tone, and intensity [15][16][17][18] ; and dose, frequency, and duration 17,19 of antismoking campaigns are significantly associated with smokingrelated outcomes. Furthermore, cumulative exposure to antismoking messages via multiple channels increases the likelihood of a subsequent attempt to quit smoking. 10 The original corrective antismoking messages were preambled by the statement, \"A federal court has ruled that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, Philip Morris USA, Altria and Lorillard deliberately deceived the American public about the health effects of smoking and has ordered those companies to make this statement. Here is the truth: [topic/theme of corrective statement],\" 2,20(p570) which conveyed the industry's guilt. However, the tobacco industry successfully appealed to have key components of this message modified. These modifications may have weakened the corrective potency of the final version of the corrective statements. 2,20 A study of the coverage of the television and newspaper portions of the advertising campaign revealed that only 40% of the US adult population saw the antismoking advertisements and that coverage was even lower among groups known to be at risk of tobacco use, such as youths and socioethnic minority groups. 21 However, since the completion of the newspaper and television components of the court-ordered advertising campaign and the onset of the implementation of a corrective statement placement on tobacco company websites and cigarette packages, no assessment has been conducted on the population-level reach of the overall antismoking advertising campaigns, to our knowledge. In addition, previous data did not allow for individual-level assessment of the outcome of this advertising campaign, such as its association with smoking cessation intentions or attempts. This study aims to examine the reach of the fully completed television and newspaper antismoking advertisements, as well as the ongoing placement of antismoking messages on tobacco company websites and cigarette packages. Furthermore, we examine the association between exposure to corrective antismoking messages and predecessors of smoking cessation among a representative sample of adult cigarette smokers in the United States. Specifically, this study examines the association between cumulative exposure to corrective antismoking messages and intentions to quit cigarette smoking in the next 6 months.

We hypothesize that cumulative exposure to corrective antismoking messages will be significantly associated with greater odds of both past attempts to quit smoking and intentions to quit smoking in the next 6 months. Secondarily, we sought to estimate the potential real-world effect of being exposed to multiple antitobacco messages concurrently. This is critical because, while specific antismoking campaigns may only measure and evaluate the outcome of their own intervention, the reality is that the public is exposed to multiple advertisements from different sources.\nAssociation of Tobacco Industry Antismoking Advertisements With Intentions and Attempts to Quit \"single message seen.\" Respondents who selected more than 1 type of corrective message were categorized to \"multiple messages seen.\"\nAssociation of Tobacco Industry Antismoking Advertisements With Intentions and Attempts to Quit cessation intentions or attempts.

To model the potential real-world effect of adults being exposed to multiple messages, we calculated the adjusted odds ratios associated with being exposed to multiple corrective statements (assuming homogeneity in treatment effects between these messages and any other messages). To calculate the excess numbers of individuals who would have a quit intention assocated with exposure to multiple advertisements, we multiplied the estimated excess risk by the numbers of US adults who had a quit intention (number of US cigarette smokers, 34.2 million, 27 multiplied by the probability of having a quit intention, estimated from the current data).

The sample frame for HINTS 5 cycle 3 was derived from a database of US residential addresses provided by Marketing Systems Group. In this sampling frame, addresses were grouped into low-minority and high-minority strata. The highminority strata were oversampled to enhance accuracy of estimates for this population. The sampling strategy for HINTS 5 cycle 3 had 2 phases. First, an equal-probability method was used to select addresses within each stratum, and, second, an adult was selected per sampled household.

Further details on the weighting methods is described in the survey methodology report. 26 The HINTS 5 cycle 3 data release provided final sample weights for the calculation of estimates as well as replicate weights for the calculation of the SE of estimates. We used the final weights in the weight option and replicated weights in the repweight option of the PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC Statement (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) as recommended by HINTS.

We also conducted prevalence estimates of advertisement exposure among a subpopulation of current smokers. Prevalence and associated 95% CIs of current smokers with smoking cessation intentions and attempts were also estimated by advertisement exposure status (no message seen, single message seen, or multiple messages seen), by mean number of corrective message types seen, and by the sociodemographic characteristics outlined. Survey-weighted logistic regressions were used to study the association between exposure to court-ordered industry antismoking messages and intentions and attempts to quit among US adult smokers.

Although the coverage among smokers improved, population-level coverage represents only a small increment from a study that was conducted prior to the completion of the television advertisements and the onset of antismoking message placement on tobacco company websites and cigarette packages. 21 This study found a significant association between exposure to corrective antismoking messages and intentions to quit cigarette smoking among a nationally representative sample of adult smokers in the United States. The findings build on previous research that found that exposure to antitobacco messaging is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking cessation intentions. 8,9,13 However, prior research has focused largely on federally or state-sponsored and federally or state-executed antismoking advertising campaigns. 8,15,16,28 Per the Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change), [29][30][31] behavioral intentions are the antecedent to behavioral change. As such, the observed association between exposure to antismoking advertisements and increased intentions to quit is an encouraging finding. Specifically, our study suggests that adult cigarette smokers who were exposed to antismoking advertisements were further along the continuum of behavior change toward cigarette smoking cessation (ie, contemplation and preparation) than those who were not exposed to these messages. This finding suggests that court-ordered industry-sponsored antismoking advertisements may be an effective component of comprehensive tobacco control measures 32 by increasing intentions to quit among adult cigarette smokers. However, this campaign was not sufficient for behavior change, as evidenced by the lack of association with actual attempts to quit. Our findings are consistent with those of a 2012 study that showed that exposure to tobacco industry-sponsored campaigns was not associated with increased attempts to quit. 9 The content of messages used in antismoking advertisements play a crucial role in stimulating behavioral outcomes. 15,18,28 Our findings underscore the need to make corrective statements more emphatic than they currently are. The prosaic, unremarkable, and heavily scripted nature of the industry-sponsored antitobacco advertisements contrast quite sharply with their own pro-tobacco advertisements that are full of color, vibrancy, and designed to elicit strong emotional responses. Messages used in future industry-sponsored corrective advertising campaigns should undergo more rigorous pretesting, similar to other antitobacco advertisements, to ensure those messages resonate with the target audience. 33 Furthermore, enhancing the present corrective statements with industry deception statements and firsthand emotional narrative testimonials from former smokers (where possible; eg, on tobacco company websites) may improve the effectiveness of industry-sponsored antismoking advertisement campaigns. 20 These components have been shown to resonate highly among smokers, yield greater recall rates, and bring about changes in smoking behaviors. 15,19,20,33 In addition, a comprehensive approach that combines this type of population-level strategy with individual-level interventions (eg, smoking cessation counseling by a health professional) may provide further benefits. Clinicians are advised to use effective counseling and medication in treating tobacco dependence, guided under approaches such as the 5As model. 34 Population-level interventions can be potentiated such that individuals who have been exposed to corrective antismoking messages and are considering quitting (step 3 of the 5As model) can be referred to a nicotine dependence treatment program to receive assistance with quitting (step 4) and commence follow-up care (step 5). Although interventions such as corrective statements, when combined with other robust tobacco control measures, have the potential to lower the overall prevalence of smoking, there is also potential for the interventions to have a negative equity outcome. In our study, we observed that exposure to these advertisements were significantly lower among ethnic/racial minority groups as well as those with a low educational level and low income. Equity approaches to public health interventions call for enhanced and sustained efforts to ensure that hard-to-reach populations receive culturally sensitive messages delivered in a medium and form that they can access, understand, and use."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study has several limitations. First, HINTS data are cross-sectional; hence, causal inferences cannot be made. Second, HINTS data are self-reported, and several covariates, as well as the outcome variable used to assess attempts to quit, rely on respondents' ability to recall past events; as such, this factor may have rendered our study prone to recall bias. Owing to the framing of the exposure question in the survey, we could not determine to which specific advertisement medium respondents were exposed (ie, television, newspapers, tobacco company corporate websites, or cigarette packages); as such, we could not assess exposure by individual advertising medium because these data were pooled. In addition, the primary outcomes of this study were examined only among current cigarette smokers, and thus we could not explore the outcome of antismoking advertisements among those who had recently quit smoking."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The reach of court-ordered industry advertisements has increased among smokers; however, the reach of this advertisement campaign within the general population remains suboptimal, and disparities in its penetration persists among disadvantaged groups. Industry antismoking advertising campaigns may help improve intentions to quit smoking among adult cigarette smokers; however, they have not been effective in stimulating behavioral change among smokers. Strategies to improve the effectiveness of the industry-sponsored antismoking advertisement campaigns outlined in this study should be considered to achieve maximal tobacco control benefits. "}]
