Specifically, researchers have shown that women's established verbal memory advantage over men [9] [10] [11] [12] functions as a form of sex-specific cognitive reserve, affording women equal or better memory performances when compared to men despite positive neuroimaging biomarkers for AD, including mild to moderate levels of hippocampal atrophy [9] , hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positive emission tomography (PET) [10] , and brain amyloid burden as measured by a positive florbetapir PET (A+) [11, 12] .\nBeyond cognitive reserve, recent research by our group suggests women may have neural reserve in the face of early AD pathology as indicated by biomarkers. Specifically, we have demonstrated that women-and not men-with A+ and normal cognition (NC) show right hippocampal volumes comparable to women with NC and a negative florbetapir PET study (A-); however, this sex-specific advantage is lost in early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) [12] .

In particular, Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and subiculum show pathology related to AD first, and changes in these regions also predict conversion to symptomatic AD [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In addition, subiculum changes have been correlated with cortical amyloid burden [26] , and CA1 changes have been linked to memory encoding and retrieval deficits [20, [26] [27] [28] . Recent comprehensive reviews show CA1 as most consistently implicated in AD, and CA1 and subiculum in eMCI and individuals at risk for AD; however, findings are not fully consistent across methodologies, and other regions, including CA2, 3, 4, and dentate gyrus, have also been implicated in early disease [29] .\nThe current study extends our previous work with whole hippocampal volumes [12] . In addition to replicating prior whole hippocampus findings with advanced segmentation technology and methods for controlling confounding factors [30] [31] [32] , we examined whether sex and diagnosis moderate the effects of A+ on hippocampal SV. Specifically, we hypothesized that NC women with A+ would show CA1 and subiculum volumes comparable to NC women with A-. Although the literature has shown more tenuous support for AD-related changes in CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus, such findings are nonetheless present, and as such we hypothesized that NC women with A+ would also show volumes in these regions comparable to NC women with A-.

See Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The current study examined whether sex and diagnosis moderate impact of amyloid positivity on hippocampal subfield volume. We hypothesized NC women with A+ would show hippocampal subfield volumes comparable to those in NC women with A-in right CA1, subiculum, CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus, implying resistance to early impact of disease, but that A+ status would be associated with smaller right SV across sexes in eMCI. This prediction was partially supported; sex and diagnosis significantly moderated amyloid and diagnosis effects on right subiculum, and trends were observed for right CA1, CA4, and dentate gyrus. Specifically, NC men with A+ showed significantly smaller subiculum volume than their A-counterparts, while this effect was not seen in NC women. At the eMCI stage, A+ was associated with smaller subiculum volume regardless of sex. Trend level results for the CA1, CA4, and dentate gyrus followed a similar pattern (i.e., NC men with A+ showed SV that were smaller than NC men with A-, but this effect was not observed in NC women; individuals with eMCI and A+ showed smaller SV than individuals with eMCI and A-, regardless of sex). Effects were observed while accounting for effects of baseline cognitive status, age, education, APOE4 carrier status, and total brain volume.\nThe present findings suggest women have neural reserve at the level of the subiculum, a hippocampal subfield impacted very early in the progression of AD pathology. Specifically, we demonstrated that subiculum volume in women appears to resist effects of, or be maintained despite presence of, A+ at the NC stage. In other words, women with NC, but high likelihood of developing AD (i.e., A+), have subiculum volumes that are consistent with those of healthy women. On the other hand, men with NC and increased likelihood for AD (i.e., A+) show smaller subiculum volumes than healthy men, even before impairments are noted on formal memory measures. Combined with recent research supporting memory reserve for women with fewer prodromal AD traits [9] [10] [11] [12] , the present results suggest that examining memory and hippocampal volume may more sensitively identify men than women at risk for future decline, though recent research additionally suggests that looking at changes in hippocampal volume over time may assist with prediction of AD in women [53] . This has important implications for both clinical decision making and selection and outcome measures in clinical trials. The mechanism for sex effects on rates of hippocampal atrophy remains unclear and is an area for Fig. 2 . Alternate presentation of sex moderation of diagnosis and amyloid status effects (breakdown by amyloid status). Sex moderates effects of diagnosis and Florbetapir PET amyloid positivity (A+) on right whole hippocampal volume (A), and right subiculum (B). Specifically, normal control (NC) women with A+ show whole and subfield volumes more comparable to NC women with a negative amyloid PET (A-), while NC men do not. At the early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) stage, effects of A+ on total and subfield volume did not differ by sex, but generally related to smaller volumes across participants. Although not directly tested in this analysis, as shown, this figure also suggests that for A+ individuals, receiving an eMCI diagnosis is related to smaller volumes, specifically in women.

One avenue to consider is that while estrogen loss at menopause and certain hormone therapy approaches have been examined as a risk factor for cognitive decline (for a review, see [54] ), it has been more difficult to consider the earlier protective effects of estrogen and how those may play out, or interact with sexually dimorphic inflammatory [16] and metabolic factors [17] . In addition, much recent research has suggested the importance of both creating higher-level risk categories combining across biomarkers and controlling for comorbid risks, such as APOE4 carrier status, [15] age [55, 56] , education, and lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, smoking, and alcohol use). As many of these factors differ by sex, the present results emphasize that sex should be considered in these types of analyses. Recent research also suggests that examining the hippocampus from an anterior-to-posterior perspective combined with anatomical labeling may yield additional information [57] .\nStrengths of the present study include a relatively large, well-characterized study sample, use of the latest hippocampal segmentation technology [30] , and rigorous control of potential confound variables according to recent field recommendations [15, 31, 32, 54, 56] . At the same time, all methods of segmentation are vulnerable to errors, particularly with single anatomical images without very high resolution (i.e., greater than 3T as employed here). Future studies should replicate these findings with multiple images and at higher field strength, and with complementary methods for examining hippocampal structure, such as shape and radial distance analyses. In addition, the ADNI sample includes highly educated individuals with a restricted range of education; replication in other, more representative samples will be important. It also will be essential to examine sex differences in AD biomarkers longitudinally, to facilitate understanding of when exactly-or how much-pathology leads to cognitive, atrophic, and clinical symptom expression. Moreover, while the current investigation found significant three-way interactions representing an important preliminary finding, replication in larger samples will be necessary to ascertain that effects observed here are stable, truly sex-specific, and lateralized outside of the present sample, as well as to explore whether other subfields might reach significance. Additional investigation of the effects of estrogen levels and hormone replacement therapy will also be important in the future.\nIn sum, the present study provides additional evidence that in the face of AD, women have early neural reserve at the level of the hippocampus, and subiculum in particular. Findings were seen in a large sample, with the latest segmentation technology, and field-standard methods for controlling for potential confounds. If replicated in other samples and with other methods, early reserve for women in memory and hippocampal integrity could suggest need for changes in how and when women are screened for early signs of AD and how their progress is measured in clinical trials."}]
