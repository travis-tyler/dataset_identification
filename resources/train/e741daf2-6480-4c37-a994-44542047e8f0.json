[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Jeb Bush campaigned for Governor on a clear and bracing set of education reforms in 1998. Having won offi ce, he immediately pursued a dual track strategy of education reform: standards and accountability for public schools, choice options for dissatisfi ed parents. Florida lawmakers followed these reforms with additional measures, including instructional based reforms, curtailing social promotion, merit pay for teachers, and additional choice measures. 1 Governor Bush met fi erce resistance. Ten years after his election, this study lays out the evidence on the cumulative impact of his reforms. The National Assessment of Education Progress tests representative samples of students in every state on a variety of subjects and is the nation's most reliable and respected source of comparable K-12 testing data across states. In 1998, 47 percent of Florida fourth-graders scored \"below basic\" on the NAEP reading test, meaning they couldn't read. By 2007, 70 percent of Florida's fourth graders scored basic or above-a remarkable improvement. After a decade of strong improvement, Florida's Hispanic students now have the second-highest reading scores in the nation; and African-Americans score fourth-highest when compared to their peers. The average Florida Hispanic student scored higher than the overall average score for all students in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. Florida's African Americans went from being far behind their peers in Indiana to be signifi cantly ahead of them. Hispanic students in Florida score approximately a grade level above Indiana Hispanics, and have moved to within striking distance of the statewide average for all students in Indiana. The pages that follow lay out the Florida reforms, and suggest how they could be emulated and/or exceeded in Indiana. In education reform, no state has been a more aggressive \"laboratory of democracy\" during the past decade than Florida. Florida has implemented reforms designed to foster accountability and improvement, including: establishing high academic standards, implementing innovative student-centered testing policies, ending social promotion and increasing early intervention, creating new pathways for hiring and compensating quality teachers, and offering parents greater school choice options. A revolution is defi ned as a large change occurring in a relatively short period of time. Progress in Florida's public schools certainly qualifi es. After ten years of reforms, higher test scores demonstrate that these reforms are collectively having a large positive impact. The gains of Florida's 4th and 8th grade students on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) examination far exceed the progress of students across the nation. Importantly, the so-called \"achievement gap\" is narrowing in Florida, since African-American and Hispanic children are making even greater progress than their white peers on the NAEP examination. Policymakers across the country should look to Florida's experience as a model demonstrating that education reforms can lead to positive outcomes such as improved student learning. Given the strong gains seen, especially among disadvantaged students, policymakers have a duty to examine the success of Florida's reforms. This paper examines the evidence of academic achievement gains and reviews a decade of education reforms in Florida. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for policymakers in other states who wish to learn from Florida's experience."}, {"section_title": "Indiana's Lost Decade on Education Reform", "text": "National and state test results show that Florida students are making considerable progress in reading and mathematics exams."}, {"section_title": "This progress is demonstrated on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).", "text": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress-the so-called \"Nation's Report Card\"-is the best instrument for comparing academic achievement trends of students in different states. The NAEP is regularly administered to a representative sample of students in each state. Education experts widely regard NAEP as the nation's most credible source of education data. Schools and/ or districts do not have their performance evaluated or their schools labeled based upon NAEP. Unlike many state exams, it is not possible to \"teach to the test items\" on NAEP, as the items are not exposed. In short, the incentive or ability to cheat on NAEP are both very low, and NAEP's standards are high, leading to widespread respect. Florida has made substantial NAEP progress across subject and grade levels. This paper focuses on 4th grade reading scores. The development of early literacy skills proves crucial to the overall academic success of students. Many students failing to learn reading in the early grades fall further and further behind grade level with each passing year. Unable to read their textbooks, they often become frustrated, bored and/or disruptive. Such students drop out of schools in disproportionate numbers beginning in late middle school. Reformers have therefore long recognized early reading skills as a linchpin measure of academic success or failure. Improving early literacy skills is necessary, though not suffi cient, to improving education outcomes overall. The reader should bear in mind that while NAEP tests are on a 0-500 point scale, a change of 10 points roughly approximates a grade level worth of learning.   1992, Indiana's African Americans on average were performing about a grade and a half higher than Florida's African Americans. In 2007, however, Indiana's African American students scored only one point higher than their 1992 peers.

It is reasonable to conclude that the education reforms undertaken by the state over the past decade are in part responsible to the improvement. Given the impressive progress in students' academic achievement, policymakers in other states should study Florida's education reforms. In his fi rst state of the state speech, Governor Bush outlined broad categories of reforms. 4 First, Florida would implement annual testing in grades 3 through 10 and rank schools based on achievement. Second, they would end social promotion: the practice of promoting students to higher grades even if they had not completed the academic requirements of the previous grade. Third, funding would be tied to performance-rewarding successful schools with additional funding and autonomy. Fourth, the state would provide additional funding for struggling schools while allowing parents the option of transferring their child to a better school. Over the next eight years, Governor Bush's administration oversaw the implementation of aggressive education reforms that largely focused on these areas. The following is an overview of the education reform initiatives undertaken in Florida over the past decade. This analysis is informed by a comprehensive study of Florida's education reforms undertaken by the Hoover Institution's Koret Task Force. 5 Academic Testing and Accountability: Academic Testing and Accountability: In 1999, Florida enacted the \"A+ Accountability Plan\" that became the foundation of school reform efforts in the state. The A+ Plan required that students in grades 3 through 10 be tested annually in reading and mathematics on the state FCAT assessment system. The FCAT incorporated both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced measures. Together, these measures evaluate a students' performance against peers across the nation and against state content standards. Importantly, this system was developed to enable the tracking of students' progress each year. The state also created a new accountability system based on the FCAT. Both schools and students were held accountable for their performance. Annual state report cards ranked public schools on scale-from A to F-based on students' performance each year. Schools that earned high marks received funding bonuses and greater autonomy. Schools receiving an \"F\" over time were required to implement state-sanctioned reforms. In addition, students were also held accountable for their performance. The A+ Plan ended social promotion. Students were required to meet a level of academic achievement to proceed to the next grade. By 2003, students were required to pass the FCAT exam to graduate from high school. Remedial instruction was provided to students who were denied promotion."}, {"section_title": "School Choice Options: School Choice Options:", "text": "The A+ Plan also established new school choice options for families. Specifi cally, the A+ Plan offered students in schools rated as \"F\" on the state accountability system for multiple years the opportunity to use a publicly-funded scholarship to transfer to an alternative public school or private school of their parents' choice. This policy helped hundreds of children attend a school of their parents' choice. In addition to the A+ Plan, Florida policymakers implemented policies offering families a range of public and private school choice options. The following is an overview of school choice policies offered in Florida: "}, {"section_title": "Charter Schools: Charter Schools: \u2022 \u2022", "text": "Florida has one of the strongest charter school laws in the country. 10 Charter schools are publicly funded schools that agree to meet certain performance standards set by government, but are otherwise free from the bureaucratic rules and regulations governing traditional public schools. Thus, charter schools offer families a choice within the public school system. In all, there are 379 public charter schools in Florida educating more than 100,000 students. 11"}, {"section_title": "Virtual Education: Virtual Education: \u2022 \u2022", "text": "Florida offers students the ability to learn online through virtual education. In 2006-07, 52,000 students received instruction from the Florida Virtual School. 12 The state also offers students online preparatory classes for the FCAT examination. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the private school choice option in the A+ Plan-offering students in persistently low performing public schools a scholarship to attend a private school-violated the state's constitution. 13 This decision eliminated one of a family's school choice options and removed one of the incentives for students to make progress on the FCAT exam.

Improving Teacher Quality: Improving Teacher Quality: Teacher quality is a leading factor affecting how students perform in the classroom. All public school systems face the challenge of both attracting and retaining high quality school teachers. Florida's challenge was exacerbated by a ballot initiative that passed in 2002 creating a state constitutional law establishing maximum class sizes in the state's public schools. 16 At the time, the amendment was seen as requiring the hiring of approximately 31,000 new public school teachers. 17 Traditionally, most public school systems have tried to ensure the quality of its teachers by establishing certifi cation requirements and licensing regimes. But this strategy has had questionable results. 18 Over the past decade, Florida enacted new policies for attracting and rewarding high quality teachers. First, Florida enacted policies to allow for alternative paths to teacher certifi cation. The purpose of these policies is to attract high quality teachers to the classroom who otherwise would not consider teaching as a profession given the barrier to entry created by the traditional teacher certifi cation requirements. For example, people who wish to become school teachers in Florida can attend \"Educator Preparation Institutes,\" which facilitate career transitions for qualifi ed professionals who wish to become teachers. 19 Districts are also required to offer their forms of alternative certifi cation. In addition, Florida also offers performance pay for teachers. Traditionally, most pubic school systems have compensated public school teachers based on the tenure of their service. However, Florida implemented reforms to provide bonuses to highly effective teachers. In 2007, Florida's performance pay system offered a total of $147 million annually in state aid to school districts to pay performance bonuses to teachers. 20 Through this program, schools are awarded funds to provide bonuses to personnel who contribute to measurable improvement in students' academic achievement. Early Education: Early Education: In 2002, Florida voters approved a ballot initiative requiring that state-funded Pre-Kindergarten be offered to all 4-year-olds in the state by 2005. 21 In 2005, the program was launched with more than 100,000 children participating. The program is universal and voluntary. Importantly, the program offers families a wide range of choices. Families can choose to enroll their children in Pre-K programs offered by for-profi t and faith-based providers, as well as public schools, through a voucher mechanism. During 2006-07, private centers comprised 79 percent of Pre-K providers, while public schools were only 19 percent. 22 In all, each child receives a Pre-K scholarship worth approximately $2,600. To be eligible, providers must meet certain state requirements, including hiring licensed teachers (teachers must earn a Child Development Associate certifi cate) and implement content standards which focus on literacy readiness. 23 In 2008, 121,000 children are enrolled in the program. In 2007, approximately 55 percent of all four-year-olds participated. 24 Education Funding and Fiscal Management: Education Funding and Fiscal Management: Florida's improved academic performance has come during a decade when the state has not been dramatically increasing public funding for education, at least compared to national averages. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that (infl ation-adjusted) per pupil expenditures in Florida's public schools increased by 7 percent between 1998 and 2004. 25 The U.S. average grew by 14.7 percent during that period. 26 Since 2004, government spending on Florida's public schools has increased, likely at a faster rate than in the previous six years. 27 For example, the class size reduction initiative alone was projected to cost between $22 billion and $26.5 billion, with costs increasing as full implementation occurs in 2010-11. 28 "}, {"section_title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Reforms", "text": "Florida's progress improving all students' academic achievement and reducing the achievement gap between ethnic minority and white children warrants greater academic research to judge which reforms have had the greatest positive impact of students and classrooms. In all likelihood, the tapestry of reforms implemented over the past decade is responsible for the state's improvement. The following is an overview of the initial research evidence evaluating specifi c reforms. Ending Social Promotion-Ending Social Promotion-The focus of the policy to end social promotion is ensuring that 3rd grade students are able to pass the FCAT reading exam to pass on to 4th grade. In 2001, only 6,500 students were retained in third grade. In 2002, more than 27,000 3rd grade students were retained. 29 In 2006, approximately 29,000 3rd grade students failed and were at risk of being retained. 30 Evidence suggests that ending social promotion has had a positive impact on students' performance. Dr. Jay Greene and Marcus Winters of the University of Arkansas evaluated the results of the social promotion policy after two years. They reported that: \"retained Florida students made signifi cant reading gains relative to the control group of socially promoted students.\" 31 They found that the academic benefi t increased after the second year: \"That is, students lacking in basic skills who are socially promoted September 2009 appear to fall farther behind over time, whereas retained students appear to be able to catch up on the skills they are lacking.\" 32 Beyond the likely benefi t of increased remediation, the threat of being retained also creates a strong incentive for children to improve their studies to proceed to the next grade with their peers. This policy of ending social promotion warrants further research and analysis to determine the full impact on students' academic achievement. Accountability and Expanding School Choice-Accountability and Expanding School Choice-Growing evidence suggests that the combination of Florida's accountability and expanded school choice policies is contributing to the improved performance in the state's public schools. A 2003 study published by the Manhattan Institute evaluated the effect of competition caused by school choice on the public education system under the A+ program. The study found that competition was leading to signifi cant improvement in public schools: \"Public schools currently facing voucher competition or the prospect of competition made exceptional gains on both the FCAT and the Stanford-9 test compared to all other Florida public schools and the other subgroups in our analysis.\" 33 In 2007, the Urban Institute published the results of a similar analysis of the effect of the A+ accountability and choice reforms on Florida's public schools. The authors found that student achievement improved in schools labeled an \"F\" in subsequent years. 34 Importantly, the authors found that reforms undertaken by the low-performing public schools contributed to the improvement: \"when faced with increased accountability pressure, schools appear to focus on low-performing students, lengthen the amount of time devoted to instruction, adopt different ways of organizing the day and learning environment of the students and teachers, increase resources available to teachers, and decrease principal control.\" 35 In 2008, the Dr. Greg Forster of the Friedman Foundation published a new study evaluating the effect of the A+ program on public schools threatened by the possibility of losing children to other schools through the school voucher option. 36 Forster evaluated the performance of public schools from the 2001-02 school year through 2006-07 school year. Importantly, the extended time period analyzed in the study allowed Forster to evaluate how the elimination of the voucher option impacted public school performance after 2006, when the voucher options was deemed unconstitutional and, thus, removed from the program. Forster reports that before vouchers were made available, the A+ program spurred modest improvement in public schools. But the program produced dramatic gains in threatened public schools once vouchers were incorporated: \"In 2002-03,\" Forster writes, \"public schools whose students were offered vouchers outperformed other Florida public schools by 69 points.\" 37 In the years that followed, as voucher participation rates dropped due to procedural obstacles, the positive effect of competition was less signifi cant. Importantly, Forster's analysis found that: \"The removal of vouchers caused the positive impact on public schools to drop well below what it had been even in 2001-02, before vouchers were widely available.\" 38 To date, no academic study has evaluated the academic achievement of students participating in the state's private school choice programs. Multiple testing experiments evaluating the impact of private school voucher programs in other communities have shown that students receiving vouchers improve academically. 39 Moreover, additional evaluations have found that increasing competition through school choice options (both private school choice and charter schools) leads to improvement in traditional public schools threatened by competition. 40 One recent study reported this effect occurring in Florida. A 2008 study by Dr Students with Disabilities on threatened public schools. 41 They report that: \"public school students with relatively mild disabilities made statistically signifi cant test score improvements in both math and reading as more nearby private schools began participating in the McKay program.\" 42 Importantly, the authors found that the greatest gains were made by the children who were diagnosed as having the mildest learning disabilities, a group that includes the vast majority of Florida's special education students.  in the voluntary Pre-K program performed better on kindergarten screening than children who did not participate. 43 Evaluations of similar early education programs have found that early education programs often result in improvements during a student's early school years, but these gains have been found to fade away over time. 44 This program should be evaluated in the future to determine its effectiveness. Given that this program began in 2005, we do not as yet have any testing data that can evaluate whether it seems to have had any lasting impact in elementary scores. None of the progress shown above, however, can be attributed to this program, as all of the 4th or 8th grade students were too old to have participated.

Importantly, children from minority populations are making the greatest improvements demonstrating that Florida is making progress reducing the achievement gap. The aggressive education reforms implemented by Florida policymakers over the past decade appear to be having a positive impact. Specifi cally, initial evidence suggest that ending social promotion, increasing school accountability, and expanding parental choice in education are contributing to improved academic achievement and public school performance. Policymakers across the country should study Florida's model and implement similar systemic reforms. More broadly, the Florida experience shows that the proper mix of education reforms can lead to levels of academic achievement for disadvantaged students that many have argued are impossible without massive increases in spending. Powerful interests, most notably the education unions, fought Governor Bush's education reforms almost every step of the way. Florida fashioned an enviable education legacy after 1998: one that proves that demography is not destiny. An old saying holds that the difference between a condition and a problem lies in whether or not you have given up. A problem is something you are still trying to solve. A condition is something that one has grown to accept as unalterable. Florida's improvement in minority and economically disadvantaged student academic achievement prove once and for all that this widespread reality constitutes a problem to be solved, not a condition to be accepted. Other states should follow Florida's lead in combining incentive and instructional based reforms, and in fact, take them further. America's disadvantaged children await these tragically overdue reforms. Florida's success should inspire replication in other states, but in the end, Florida's reforms should be viewed as a fl oor, not a ceiling. Florida's reforms have greatly improved education in that state, but they are still some ways off from achieving true international competitiveness when compared to our Asian and European competitors. Reformers must go much farther, not simply extracting greater effi ciency out of an antiquated system, but over time reformatting our basic model of schooling completely. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored an in-depth fi ve year study of public school fi nance. Paul T. Hill and Marguerite Roza, the project's lead researchers, wrote in the May 4 edition of Education Week that \"people from outside the school fi nance community\" noticed that when public-schools received large infusions of new money, higher levels of student test scores seldom followed the windfall. Hill and Roza reported that their collection of studies \"has confi rmed that money is used so loosely in public education -in ways that few understand and that lack plausible connections to student learning-that no one can say how much money, if used optimally, would be enough\u2026 Districts can't choose the most cost-effective programs because they lack evidence on costs and results.\" 45 We offer a concrete example. Many elementary students across the country take courses in art, music, and science. For a child at grade level in the basics, these can be entirely appropriate. One cannot help but to pose the question however: is this the best use of resources for elementary students who have not learned to read? Nationwide, the NAEP shows that 34 percent of 4th graders in public school score \"below basic\" in reading. Should a third-grader who hasn't mastered basic literacy skills, and whose entire academic career hangs in the balance, be spending their days studying music? We know if children don't learn to read in the early grades, their chances of dropping out go up exponentially, whether they took music classes or not. Similarly, all sorts of spending that have nothing whatsoever to do with teaching children anything goes on in the public schools. Central offi ce bureaucrats presumably do something, but they do not teach children how to read or prevent them from dropping out of school. If they did, we wouldn't have a problem with either illiteracy or high-school completion. In short, public schooling has become profoundly ineffi cient and ineffective. The Florida reforms helped to focus the mind with pressure from the state and from parents, but there are many miles to go in this race. Most states, however, haven't so much as crossed the starting line of the race. Florida's reforms prove that effective education reform is not about the kids. The kids can learn. Effective education reform is ultimately about adults. Do the adults in Indiana have the fortitude to deliver the needed improvements for the children? Show me, don't tell me."}]
