We aimed to assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and CAL, taking into account confounding factors. 18,606 participants (49% male, 21% smokers, mean age: 55.8 + 11.2 years, mean BMI: 26.7 + 5.5 kg/m 2 ) of the BOLD initiative from 26 sites in 23 countries were included. CAL was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second/forced vital capacity < lower limit of normal. Low and obese BMI were defined as <21 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2 , respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis controlled for confounders age, sex and smoking, and meta-analysis of between-site heterogeneity and clustering. Prevalence of low and obese BMI, smoking history and prevalence of CAL were highly variable between sites. After adjustment for confounders, the meta-analysis of all sites showed that compared to subjects without CAL, low BMI was more frequent, (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.23 (95% confidence interval: 1.75, 2.85)) and conversely, obesity was less frequent in subjects with CAL (adjusted OR: 0.78 (0.65, 0.94)). In a worldwide population sample, CAL was associated with lower BMI, even after adjusting for confounding factors age, gender, smoking and between-site heterogeneity. These results indicate a CAL-specific association with body composition.\nChronic airflow limitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body mass index, burden of obstructive lung disease (BOLD)"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Low body weight has been observed in 10-20% of outpatients with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 1,2 and in 37% of patients with severe disease referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. 3 Moreover, low body mass index (BMI) is related to increased mortality in these patients, [4] [5] [6] [7] independent of disease severity. 6 Also, in the general population, increased mortality in subjects with low to normal BMI is mainly due to respiratory diseases. 8 This inverse association is much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers. 8 Nevertheless, the association between low body weight and chronic airflow limitation (CAL) remains incompletely understood as it has only been studied in selected patient populations. 1, 7 Earlier studies did not account for the impact of smoking, 9 gender 10 and age 11 on body weight.\nOn the other hand, obesity is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for respiratory symptoms 12 and functional limitation 13 in COPD. Furthermore, while obesity may be associated with low mortality in patients with severe airflow obstruction, a higher mortality rate was seen in mild-to-moderate COPD patients with obesity. 3, 6 Epidemiologic data on obesity in subjects with CAL in general population samples are scarce and conflicting. 14, 15 The burden of obstructive lung disease (BOLD) initiative is an international population-based study implementing rigorous standardized methods for estimating CAL prevalence (high-quality postbronchodilator spirometry) and its risk factors.

Secondly, overall a lower adjusted OR was found for the presence of obesity in CAL subjects. Here, the association seems consistent across sites (I 2 : 15%). Differences in mean BMI between subjects with and without CAL for each site are shown in supplemental Table S1 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study is the first to evaluate BMI in subjects with and without CAL as defined by rigorously standardized post-bronchodilator spirometry in a worldwide population-based sample of adults, taking into account the possible impact of age, gender, smoking status, and geography. The results of our study indicate a positive association between the presence of CAL and low BMI and a negative association between CAL and obesity. Given the cross sectional nature of our data, the direction of this relationship remains unclear.\nEvaluating data from the BOLD cohort, Lamprecht et al. 16 showed that low BMI was a risk factor for the presence of CAL in never smokers. Hooper et al. 17 showed that subjects with obese BMI, compared to those with normal body weight, had lower likelihood to have CAL. The current manuscript extends this knowledge by studying the association between both low and obese BMI and the presence of airflow limitation evaluating the impact of gender, smoking status, age, and siteto-site heterogeneity.\nOnly two other population-based studies have reported on BMI in relation to CAL and compared results to control subjects. In elderly subjects from the general population participating in the ''health ABC'' study, no difference in mean BMI was observed between those with pre-bronchodilatordefined airflow limitation and smokers without airflow limitation. 11 Secondly, the South-American population-based PLATINO study reported a 7% prevalence of spirometrically defined CAL in subjects with BMI <20 kg/m 2 , which was significantly higher compared to non-CAL subjects, but no adjustments or stratification for smoking or other confounding factors were done. 15 Hence, although low body weight is commonly observed in COPD or CAL, the relationship between airflow limitation and BMI per se has not been well studied and the impact of confounding factors has remained unclear.\nThe presence of a low body weight in patients with COPD is commonly recognized. A great variation of the reported prevalence of low BMI in COPD was seen in previous studies, depending on the setting and population studied. In an outpatient population of moderately severe COPD patients, low BMI was seen in 10% of males and 18% of females. 1 Similarly, 15% of patients at first diagnosis of COPD had a low BMI. 2 In the National Institutes of Health-Intermittent Positive Breathing trial, 25% of 779 male patients with stable but severe COPD had a body weight <90% of their ideal body weight and body weight was positively associated with FEV 1 . 4 For 255 COPD patients entering an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program, Schols et al. showed that the prevalence of underweight was 37% and increased in parallel with the severity of airflow obstruction and the presence of hypoxia. 3 These studies showed that underweight is occurring frequently in subjects with COPD and that it is related to the severity of the disease. However, these studies were uncontrolled for the effects of age, gender, and smoking, and data were not compared to subjects without airflow limitation. More recently, in a sub-analysis on body composition of the ECLIPSE study, the prevalence of a low BMI was 14% in COPD, compared to 7% in controls. 22 However, the control group was significantly younger, had smoked fewer pack-years, and consisted of significantly more current smokers compared to the COPD subjects (61% vs. 36%, p < 0.001). The present study identified subjects with and without CAL using guideline-based post-bronchodilator spirometry. In addition, the standardized assessment of smoking status by interviewed questionnaires allowed for stratification. Smoking is not only an important risk factor in the development of COPD but also may adversely affect body composition. 9 Nicotine has appetite suppressant effects in the brain resulting in lower nutrient intake in smokers. 23 Also, one of the acute systemic effects of smoking is an increase in resting energy metabolism. 24 It is well known that quitting is frequently followed by a rapid weight gain. 25, 26 Also in the present study, smokers had a lower BMI compared to ex-and never smokers. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that smoking does only partly account for the high prevalence of low BMI in subjects with CAL.\nCAL is importantly associated with older age as years of exposure to tobacco smoke precede the development of CAL. 27 Older people tend to weigh less than younger adults and old age is also associated with a tendency to lose weight. 11, 28 However, the present study showed that even after stratification for age, subjects with CAL had a higher prevalence of low BMI compared to subjects with normal lung function. Neither gender nor site-related BMI differences influenced these results. Hence, we conclude that the relationship between the presence of CAL and the presence of low BMI is independent of age, gender, and smoking. Having excluded smoking and age as possible reasons for subjects with CAL being more frequently underweight, two possibilities remain: either (at least some) subjects with CAL lose weight or thin subjects are at higher risk of developing CAL.\nWeight loss occurs when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake and this balance can be disturbed on both sides in patients with CAL. A decreased appetite and low dietary intake have been associated with aggravation of disease symptoms related to exacerbations of COPD. 29 On the other hand, an elevated resting energy expenditure has been reported in patients with COPD and has been associated with weight loss. 30 Also, increased energy expenditure related to physical activities has been reported in COPD. This is likely due to a decreased oxidative capacity of the peripheral muscle, as a consequence of a shift from type 1 to type 2 fibres, which likely results in decreased mechanical efficiency when performing activity. 31 Also, the increased oxygen cost of breathing might contribute to the elevated energy expenditure during activities in subjects with COPD. 32 A low BMI in COPD is commonly associated with low fat-free mass. 3 A loss of muscle bulk is a common complication in patients with COPD, among other things related to physical inactivity.\nIn the present cross-sectional study, data on weight loss, energy balance, exacerbations, and physical inactivity were not collected. Therefore, it is not possible to attribute the increased prevalence of underweight in subjects with CAL to any of these factors. However, since the present study sample is population-based and not a selected patient population, the frequency of 'disease exacerbations' is low.\nIt has been suggested that subjects with a thin phenotype are at higher risk of developing CAL. A large general population study showed that increased mortality in people with low BMI was mainly associated with respiratory diseases. 8 Although this observed association might be attributable to reverse causation. 33 More specifically, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging showed that, at least in men, a low BMI was an independent risk factor for developing CAL. 34 Also in a previous report of the BOLD study, low BMI was associated with the presence of CAL in never smokers. 16 In addition, studies have suggested that malnutrition and starvation may contribute to the development of emphysema. Autopsies undertaken on starved patients during World War II revealed signs of emphysema in relatively young individuals. 35 In addition, early levels of emphysema have been detected in patients with anorexia nervosa. 36 Due to the cross-sectional nature of the present data we cannot determine whether the low BMI preceded the CAL or was a consequence of the disease.\nIn the present study, on average, only one in five subjects with CAL had low body weight. Together with the worldwide obesity pandemic, also obesity in COPD is increasingly recognized and importantly contributes to the disease expression of patients with COPD. 37 Referring to the historical description of the pink puffer (emphysematous type with underweight) and the blue bloater (chronic bronchitis type with overweight) body weight might discriminate different phenotypes within the umbrella disease COPD. 38 More recently, low and obese body weight also showed to differentiate different clusters of comorbidities in COPD. 39 However, data on the prevalence of obesity in COPD or CAL compared to subjects without COPD or CAL are scarce and have been conflicting, probably as a result of differences in CAL-specific and global risk factors for obesity between studied populations. In the population-based Canadian National Health Survey, the prevalence of obesity was increased in subjects with self-reported COPD (24.6%) compared to non-COPD subjects (17.1%), 40 while the South-American population-based PLA-TINO study reported a lower prevalence of obesity in subjects with CAL, compared to subjects without CAL (23% vs. 30%). 15 In the patient cohort ECLIPSE, obesity prevalence was not different in COPD subjects compared to smoking/former smoking controls (respectively 22% vs. 20%). 22 The present study showed that the prevalence of obesity is lower in subjects with CAL compared to subjects without CAL, also when adjusted for gender, smoking status, and age. The present study showed that the influence of smoking history is greater than the influence of CAL on the presence of obesity.\nNext to the overall mean effect in this study, the international comparisons in baseline characteristics and forest plots are intriguing. There is clearly quite a lot of variation between countries. For example, in Asian countries, overweight and obesity were only present in a minority. In China and India, no OR could be calculated for obesity because no obese subjects were identified. At the same time, almost half of the subjects in the US site was obese. Also regarding smoking prevalence, important differences were noted. For example, only 2.5% were current smokers in Nigeria, and almost half of subjects were current smokers in South Africa. Given the differences in the forest plots, it is also reasonable to anticipate that cultural and socio-economic effects in smoking and non-smoking populations are important.\nIn conclusion, this study was the first to demonstrate that in a worldwide general population, the presence of objectively assessed CAL was associated with increased risk of low BMI and a reduced risk of obese BMI, independent of age, gender, smoking history and geography.\nThese findings suggest a direct association between CAL and low BMI, although the direction of this association cannot be established from the present cross-sectional data. Both low BMI as a risk factor for development and progression of CAL as well as (mechanisms of) weight loss in CAL need exploration in future studies. In the meantime, clinicians and dieticians should stay aware of what is already known, in fact that low BMI is related to poor outcome in subjects with COPD or CAL and should be appropriately managed."}]
