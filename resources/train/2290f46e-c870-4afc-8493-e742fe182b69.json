[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives-To determine whether genotypes at CLU, PICALM, and CR1 confer risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and whether risk for AD associated with these genes is influenced by APOE genotypes.\nDesign-Association study of AD and CLU, PICALM, CR1 and APOE genotypes.\nSetting-Academic research institutions in the United States, Canada, and Israel.\nParticipants-7,070 AD cases, 3,055 with autopsies, and 8,169 elderly cognitively normal controls, 1,092 with autopsies from 12 different studies, including Caucasians, African Americans, Israeli-Arabs, and Caribbean Hispanics.\nResults-Unadjusted, CLU [odds ratio (OR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.85 -0.96 for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11136000], CR1 (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.07 -1.22, SNP rs3818361), and PICALM (OR = 0.89, CI = 0.84 -0.94, SNP rs3851179) were associated with AD in Caucasians. None were significantly associated with AD in the other ethnic groups. APOE \u03b54 was significantly associated with AD (ORs from 1.80 to 9.05) in all but one small Caucasian cohort and in the Arab cohort. Adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least one APOE \u03b54 allele greatly reduced evidence for association with PICALM but not CR1 or CLU. Models with the main SNP effect, APOE \u03b54 (+/\u2212), and an interaction term showed significant interaction between APOE \u03b54 (+/\u2212) and PICALM.\nConclusions-We confirm in a completely independent dataset that CR1, CLU, and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in European ancestry populations. Genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly in APOE \u03b54-positive subject. Thus, APOE and PICALM synergistically interact."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting 5% of the population over 65 years and 30-50% over 80 years. Substantial progress was made identifying genes for rare forms of early-onset AD [1] [2] [3] [4] and this early success significantly contributed to biologic study on AD mechanisms and more recently multiple drug discovery approaches. Late-onset AD, the common form of the disease, has been more difficult to solve with apolipoprotein E (APOE) being the only confirmed susceptibility locus 5 . The combination of high-density genotyping methods, large well-characterized AD and control populations, and statistical methods to evaluate population stratification now provide the tools to identify additional genes contributing to AD risk.\nOregon Health and Science University (OHSU) were recruited from aging research cohorts at 10 NIA-funded ADCs and do not overlap with other ADGC samples. The TGEN dataset is a publicly available sample of AD cases and controls (http://www.tgen.org/research/index.cfm?pageid=1065 17 . The University of Miami/ Vanderbilt University/Mt. Sinai School of Medicine (UM/VU/MSSM) were new and previously published [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] subjects ascertained at the University of Miami, Vanderbilt University and Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. The Wadi Ara dataset are from an inbred Arab community in northern Israel [23] [24] [25] [26] ."}, {"section_title": "GENOTYPING", "text": "The cohorts used were genotyped either on Illumina or Affymetrix SNP arrays (Table 2) . We selected 17 SNPs from CR1, CLU, and PICALM that were recently reported to be significantly associated with AD in two large GWA studies [6] [7] (Table 3) . Additional genotypes were obtained using an Applied Biosystems' (ABI) TaqMan Assays including genotypes for rs7982. Genotyping for the APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54 alleles was performed as described in the supplementary material provided online."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS", "text": "The analysis included only individuals with a censoring age of 60 years or older. The age used for cases was that most closely approximating the age of disease onset. For some cohorts, age-at-onset was ascertained while for others, only age-at-ascertainment was available. For some autopsied subjects, only age-at-death was available and was used as the censoring age. For all studies, the age used for controls was the age of last exam or death. (see also supplementary material provided online).\nImputation procedure-We imputed genotypes for all SNPs within 10Kb of the three genes using the Markov Chain haplotyping (MaCH) software 27 to obtain a common set of SNPs across all datasets. We imputed SNPs from both HapMap releases II and III and retained those with pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD; r 2 > 0.50) for further analysis (see also the supplementary material online for more detail and for data cleaning protocols).\nPopulation Substructure-To determine if population substructure existed in the different datasets, we used 30,000 -100,000 SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.25 and minimal between-SNP linkage disequilibrium (r 2 < 0.20) sampled at random from the autosomes, and analyzed with the STRUCTURE software package [28] [29] . To account for population substructure in association analyses, EIGENSTRAT 30 was used on each cohort to generate loadings from principal components analysis on the sampled SNPs sampled (see also supplementary material online).\nStatistical Analysis-Genotyped and imputed SNPs were tested for association with AD using a logistic generalized linear model (GLM) in case-control datasets and a logistic generalized estimating equation (GEE) in family-based datasets. Genotyped SNPs were coded as 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of minor alleles under the additive genetic model, whereas APOE was coded as 0 or 1 according to the presence or absence of the \u03b54 allele. For imputed SNPs, a quantitative estimate between 0 and 2 for the dose of the minor allele were used to incorporate the uncertainty of the imputation estimates. Regression models for each SNP without covariates were evaluated for comparison with results from the original reports [6] [7] Additional models containing all permutations of covariates for age, gender and APOE \u03b54 status were also tested. Formal tests of interaction between the SNPs and APOE were assessed by including the main effects and an interaction term. Regression models were evaluated using the R package 31 . Heterogeneity among odds ratios was assessed using Cochran's Q, which was calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects and the pooled effect across studies, with the weights being those used in the pooling method. Q is distributed as a \u03c7 2 with k (number of studies) minus 1 degrees of freedom. The I 2 statistic 32-33 describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance and is calculated as follows: I 2 = 100% \u00d7 (Q\u2212df)/Q. I 2 is an intuitive and simple expression of the inconsistency of studies' results. Unlike Q it does not inherently depend upon the number of studies considered. SNP association results obtained from individual datasets were combined by meta-analysis using the inverse variance method implemented in the software package METAL (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal/index.html). An additive model was assumed and the association results across datasets were combined by summing the regression coefficients weighted by the inverse variance of the coefficients. The metaanalysis P-value of the association was estimated by the summarized test statistic."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "To analyze the role CR1, CLU, and PICALM in AD risk, the ADGC performed a metaanalysis using phenotypes and GWAS data from 12 different cohorts ( Table 1 ). The ADGC is a collaborative network in the United States that includes the 29 NIA-funded ADCs and numerous AD genetics investigators who are working to identify genes responsible for AD. Of 7,070 AD cases examined, 3,055 of had autopsy documentation of AD. Of the 8,169 cognitively normal elderly subjects (age >60) examined, 1,155 had autopsies documenting absence of significant AD neuropathology. The cohorts used included unrelated Caucasian cases and controls from the following sources: the NIA-funded ADCs, ADNI 8, 34 , UM/VU/ MSSM [18] [19] [20] [21] , TGEN 17 , and OHSU 35 . Caucasian cases and controls from the following family-based studies were also included: the MIRAGE Study 15 , FHS 13-14 , 36 , NIA-LOAD, and CAMP [9] [10] . Populations not of Caucasian descent included African American subjects from several ADCs, a community-based (Detroit) study of AD, and the MIRAGE study 15 ; Caribbean Hispanics from Manhattan, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico; and members of a genetically isolated Arab community in Wadi Ara, Israel [23] [24] [25] [26] .\nIn each dataset, we evaluated association of AD with SNPs in or near CR1, CLU, and PICALM that were genotyped on various platforms or imputed (Table 2) . Results were combined across datasets using a meta-analysis approach (Table 3) . We analyzed each racial/ethnic group separately. In Caucasians, the largest group (n = 5,935 cases, 7,034 controls), we found significant evidence of association with multiple SNPs at each locus. In the unadjusted analyses, we obtained an odds ratio (OR) of 0.91 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.85 -0.96) for CLU SNP rs11136000, which is comparable to the effectsize reported previously for the same SNP (ORs = 0.86 7 and 0.91 6 ). For the CR1 SNP rs3818361, we obtained an OR of 1.14 (CI = 1.07 -1.22) compared to the previous report of 1.19 7 . PICALM SNP rs3851179 had an OR of 0.89 (CI = 0.84 -0.94) compared to 0.86 observed previously 6 . None of the SNPs were significantly associated with AD in any of the other ethnic groups analyzed together or separately, possibly due to small sizes of these groups (1,135 cases and 1,135 controls, Supplementary eTable 1).\nWe also examined the influence of APOE on the associations of the three genes with AD, since APOE is a known AD susceptibility locus in most ethnic groups 5, 37 and several APOE genotypes have been reported to modify disease expression in persons with rare mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) 38 , presenilin 2 (PSEN2) 39 , and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) [39] [40] genes. For the 13 cohorts where APOE genotype data were available, presence of one or more APOE \u03b54 alleles was significantly associated with AD (ORs ranging from 1.80 to 9.05) in all groups except the Amish and Israeli-Arabs (Table 4) . We next re-evaluated the association of AD with the CR1, CLU and PICALM SNPs in the Caucasian cohorts adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least one APOE \u03b54 allele and found greatly reduced evidence for association with PICALM after adjustment ( Table 3 , Supplementary eTable 2), an effect that is attributable primarily to APOE (eTable 2). To explore this effect further, we analyzed the association of CR1, CLU, and PICALM SNPs with AD in subgroups stratified by the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of the APOE \u03b54 allele. This analysis revealed that the association with CLU is evident only among \u03b54 (\u2212) subjects, whereas the association with PICALM is evident only among \u03b54 (+) subjects (Table 5) . Analysis of models containing terms for the main effects of each SNP and APOE \u03b54 (+/\u2212), and an interaction term showed significant evidence of interaction for APOE \u03b54 (+/\u2212) and seven of the nine PICALM SNPs with indications of a synergistic effect of these two genes on AD risk (Table 5 and Supplementary eTable 3). Interactions of CR1 and CLU SNPs with APOE \u03b54 (+/\u2212) were not statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "COMMENTS", "text": "Using a large multi-center dataset of AD cases and controls, we confirm that CR1, CLU and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in European ancestry populations. The ORs we get for each is similar to those obtained in the original discovery cohort, suggesting that these estimates of risk are quite accurate for the Caucasian AD population, reflecting in part the large size of the cohorts used [6] [7] . Clearly a large dataset is required to replicate these smalleffect loci. We were unable to replicate the association of these 3 genes in the AfricanAmerican, Arab, and Hispanic populations. However, further analysis is merited in these racial/ethnic groups using larger cohorts.\nWhile this manuscript was being prepared for publication, a GWAS on AD was reported by Seshadri et al. 41 . There was some overlap in that study and ours in that the TGEN and Framingham cohorts are used in both studies. However, whereas Seshadri et al. used only prospectively diagnosed AD cases (n=52) and unrelated controls (n=2,091) from the Framingham Study, we included these subjects as well as prevalent and newly diagnosed cases and related controls yielding a total sample of 197 AD cases and 2,392 controls. Both studies independently confirm that CLU and PICALM are AD susceptibility genes. A primary difference between the 2 studies is that here we confirm CR1 as an AD locus while Seshadri et al. 41 obtained only nominal support for CR1.\nThe cohorts used here have several features worth mentioning in the context of GWAS for AD. First, the cohorts have a large number of autopsies in the cases (3, 055) . Because the gold standard for diagnosis is neuropathologic confirmation of AD pathology, using autopsied cases reduces etiologic heterogeneity. Second, the controls used here were elderly, of comparable age to case onset ages, and were cognitively normal. Since these subjects lived to a comparable age to cases without developing AD, the case-control contrast should be more robust than if young controls are used. In addition, cases and controls will be comparably censored at other non-AD loci responsible for common diseases of the elderly that are unrelated to AD. Third, the cohorts used here were not involved in the initial discovery of CLU, CR1 and PICALM and thus represent a completely independent replication dataset. This is critical in terms of evaluating evidence that these genes are truly AD risk loci. The ideal controls for an AD GWAS would be subjects who were cognitively normal at death, had autopsy documentation that plaque load and tangle distribution did not reach criteria for AD pathology, and who were elderly. In autopsy series of older cognitively normal subjects, most have some NFTs and some non-neuritic, and possibly spare neuritic amyloid deposits, but do not reach the accepted threshold for AD, although about a third of these normal subjects do meet neuropathologic criteria for AD [42] [43] [44] [45] . In autopsy series of MCI subjects, up to two thirds of subjects have AD-level neuropathology 46 . These findings give rise to the hypothesis that amyloid deposition and tangle formation begin before cognitive decline becomes detectable, an idea strengthened by recent biomarker and amyloid imaging work 47 . Thus in persons without dementia, a fraction, mostly those with MCI, will develop AD within a few years and this conversion rate increases with the age of the population, decreasing the contrast between cases and controls and reducing power. To minimize the potential confounding effect of MCI, we excluded them from these analyses and emphasized 1,155 controls with autopsy information (Table 1) .\nWhen we examined the interaction CR1, CLU and PICALM, and APOE genotypes, we detected synergy between APOE and PICALM but not with CR1 or CLU. Our results show that the PICALM association is predominantly in subjects carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele. Consistent with conclusions from previous studies showing interaction of APOE with PSEN1 38 , PSEN2 39 , and APP [39] [40] , our results suggest that the APOE and PICALM gene products participate in a common pathogenic pathway leading to AD. Since PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP are all involved in A\u03b2 production, PICALM may also participate in this process though a more indirect involvement cannot be ruled out and the biology of these interactions remains to be detemined. We did not detect an interaction of APOE with CR1 or CLU, though this could be due to sample size, which was not large enough to detect very weak interactions. Also, since the APOE effect on AD risk is much stronger in young case populations 37 , the age structure of our study and of others may not be optimal for detecting these interactions.\nOur study and those from other consortia 6,7 , 56 show that AD susceptibility loci can be identified by GWAS. Initial AD GWAS had samples sizes that, in comparison to those from the large consortia, were modest and inadequately powered to detect the small effect loci replicated here 19, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . As sample sizes increase, as in other complex disorders, we expect additional loci to be identified."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
