[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Researchers in the U"}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "When Coleman (1987 Coleman ( , 1988 Coleman ( , 1990 articulated the idea that \"social capital\" shapes educational outcomes, he was drawing on classic sociological traditions: Durkheim (1951) had discussed the negative effects social isolation can have on individuals and their behavior. And Coleman's own mentor, Robert Merton (1957) , subsequently explored how choosing specific reference groups can influence social mobility. In turn, Coleman used the term \"social capital\" to describe the interpersonal relationships that help people become or remain embedded in society. 1\nBy popularizing this concept Coleman enabled educational researchers to further distinguish how different types of family resources shape children's educational experiences. Socioeconomic resources refer to \"what you have.\" Going back to the Weberian definition of status and Marxian concept of class, this typically includes personal (and, in the case of children, their parents') income, occupation, and possibly educational background. Cultural capital signifies \"what you know,\" especially as it pertains to socially valued knowledge (e.g., about history, literature, fine arts). Finally, social capital helps us ascertain the degree to which networks-or \"whom you know\"-can shape students' educational trajectories. Adding it to the family's socioeconomic resources and to parental human and cultural capital, the interpersonal dimension of social capital provides a direct link between individuals, their families, and the community or social institutions at large. Consequently, analyses of social capital examine how structural opportunities influence interpersonal networks, social relationships within and outside of the family, and access to information.\nColeman distinguished between different kinds of interpersonal ties: intra-vs. extra-familial and inter-vs. intra-generational relationships. Focusing on the need for parent-child communication, he considered this type of parental social capital a major determinant of children' educational outcomes, and most researchers have focused on this type of social capital. But this raises the empirically important question whether parents' extrafamilial networks are just as crucial for children's educational success as is parents' involvement in their children's education.\nJust as we know little about whether access to social capital among adults has the same effects on children's educational outcomes, few researchers have examined whether parental social capital effects are universal-that is, while we know quite a bit about how social capital shapes educational outcomes in the U.S., we know little about the role it plays in other countries. Moreover, few researchers have examined the degree to which such effects may be ethnically specific. In this paper, I examine how parental social capital affects the track placement of native and immigrant students in Germany. This article centers around two questions: Does a relationship exist between parents' access to social capital-i.e., the degree to which they use family networks or connections to the community-and children's track placement? If so, does parental social capital differentially affect the tracking experiences of German and non-German children? To address these questions, I examine track placement patterns among ten-to-sixteen-year-old children of German and non-German backgrounds, using sample data from the 1995 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP)."}, {"section_title": "II. Contextual Information", "text": "In most industrialized countries, track placement serves as a key determinant of educational and occupational attainment. Social scientists have long examined the role tracking plays in the reproduction of social inequalities (Baker, Esmer, Lenhardt, and Meyer 1985; Blossfeld and Shavit 1993; Gamoran 1989; Lucas 1999; M\u00fcller and Haun 1994; M\u00fcller et al. 1989; Yogev 1981) . As industrialized countries are becoming increasingly ethnically diverse, tracking also tends to reinforce inequalities along ethnic lines-Germany is a perfect example.\nLike other industrialized nations, Germany has a long history of mass secondary education (Ramirez and Boli 1987) . Moreover, Germany has absorbed more immigrants than any other European country since the end of World War II, and it continues to do so. This makes a study of ethnic tracking patterns particularly timely. Similar to the U.S., Germany relies on influx from poorer countries, especially from Turkey and Southern Europe, for low-wage workers, also called \"guestworkers.\" Turks constitute the largest and most visible immigrant group and hold a social position comparable to that of Hispanics (especially Mexicans) in the U.S.: in both countries, children of such immigrants are underrepresented in the academic track and instead placed in vocational tracks (Alba, Handl, and M\u00fcller 1994; Baker et al. 1985; B\u00fcchel and Wagner 1995; Garet and DeLany 1988; Hallinan 1992; Oakes 1985; Oakes and Guiton 1995) . Thus, despite striking differences in the organization of schooling, occupational outcomes and long-term mobility trends appear similar for ethnic minorities in Germany and the U.S. Even in the second and third generation, German Turks are more likely than other immigrants (or the ethnic majority) to experience teenage unemployment and pursue low-level and unskilled occupations with little income potential (England et al. 1988; Faist 1993 ; also see Portes and Truelove 1987 on Hispanics in the U.S.)."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Parameters: Tracks in the German Educational System", "text": "Turner (1960) first pointed to the different institutional and organizational contexts that shape educational opportunities. He used the term \"internal tracking\" to describe the within-school, coursebased practices typical of U.S. high schools (Allmendinger 1989; Brint 1998; Shavit and M\u00fcller 1998 2 ) . But the pervasiveness of differentiation between tracks differs, as does the method of assigning students. This makes the U.S. track placement process murky (Arum and Hout 1998; Garet and DeLany 1988; Gamoran and Mare 1989; NCES 1994) and has led some observers to view the U.S. system as more meritocratic than European systems. Others have focused on how the organizational and institutional characteristics shaping track placement contribute to the reproduction of social inequalities (Gamoran 1992; Hallinan 1991 Hallinan , 1994 Jones et al. 1995; Lucas 1998; Oswald et al. 1988) .\n\"External tracking\" refers to the between-school differentiation common in European educational systems. National differences exist in how and when secondary students are externally tracked, but Germany's system is generally representative of Europe. Germany's rigid external tracking practices lead to students' attending different schools starting with the fifth grade (\"Hauptschule\" [vocational] , \"Realschule\" [general] , or \"Gymnasium\" [academic] ). Only recently has a comprehensive high school emerged, but it remains unusual. 3 Although it is technically possible to switch tracks in Germany, few students actually do so (Henz 1997) . This makes the initial track in which students are placed at age ten or eleven ever more important. The Hauptschule is increasingly being viewed as a dead end, because it de facto limits students' exposure to subjects such as a second foreign language, chemistry, and physics. Yet mastery in these areas facilitates changing into the Realschule after the ninth grade and remains a prerequisite for switching to the Gymnasium. There, one can earn the \"Abitur,\" which regulates access to postsecondary academic education.\nBoth the Realschule and the Gymnasium diplomas have served as a screening device or credential to obtain desirable apprenticeships in the dual system, especially in well-paid white-collar occupations (banking, insurance, accounting). As competition for apprenticeships increases, students who only have a Hauptschule diploma are being squeezed out of the dual system, unable to enter the primary labor market via regular apprenticeships (Faist 1993; M\u00fcller and Haun 1994) . Not surprisingly, children of foreign \"guestworkers\" are predominantly found among those attending the Hauptschule and are least likely to obtain apprenticeships (Baker et al. 1985; Bommes and Radke 1993; Esser 1990; Kornmann and Schnattinger 1989; Nauck and \u00d6zel 1986) .\nAlthough parents are well aware of the three-tiered tracking system, decisions about where to place children are typically based on a more simplified typology. In other words, for teachers and parents the question asked is whether to send children to the Gymnasium or not or whether to send them to the 2 In addition to stressing the difference between both education systems as \"organizational spaces\" (U.S.) vs. \"qualificational spaces\" (Germany), they discuss the importance of internal vs. external tracking, differences in the extent/form of tracking, and the standardization of provisions (curriculum standards/exit exams).\n3 For a detailed discussion of the German educational system, see Oswald et al. 1988 or Shavit and . The \"Gesamtschule\" is modeled after U.S. high schools. But even students in these schools are encouraged to consistently take the same level of courses in order to receive high school accreditation oriented after the three traditional tracks. Only those students who consistently take college-preparatory classes and stay thirteen years qualify for entrance into the university system. This type of school only exists in a few German states and is absent from the East German secondary school system. The vast majority of pupils in Germany continue to attend one of the three traditional, externally tracked types of schools. Oswald et al. (1988) point out that large regional fluctuation exists in the number of high school students attending such comprehensive schools, varying between 2% in southern states and 25% in West-Berlin. My analyses include a total of n=55 Gesamtschule students (roughly 9% of the sample; see Table 1 ).\nHauptschule or not. If the decision is made not to send the children to the Gymnasium, the Realschule (NOT the Hauptschule) becomes the next logical choice. Similarly, if the Hauptschule is deemed inappropriate, the Realschule usually becomes the top choice. Roughly one-fourth of all secondary students attend this mid-level track, a figure also borne out by GSOEP sample statistics. Together with empirical considerations, the decision process described above led me to dichotomize track placement as the dependent variable (see methods section). Table 1 contains further details about the distribution of students across tracks in the 1995 GSOEP wave. "}, {"section_title": "Evidence of Track Placement Patterns", "text": "Researchers have partly relied on institutional arguments to explain ethnically specific tracking patterns. Key findings indicate that, insofar as class-based inequality in access to specific tracks has decreased since World War II, it has largely affected increased access to the Realschule rather than the purely academic track called Gymnasium. In particular, federal policy changes regarding mandatory school attendance through the ninth grade have facilitated an expansion in the Realschul-sector (M\u00fcller and Haun 1994) . Moreover, as the proportion of foreigners increases, so does the tendency to send German children to higher tracks. Some argue that this leads to the inclusion of foreigners in the regular school system, albeit in a way that benefits children of German background. Others maintain that it leads to the overrepresentation of foreigners in the Hauptschule and in schools aimed at the learning disabled (Baker et al. 1985; Baker and Lenhardt 1988; Kornmann and Schnattinger 1989) . Most importantly, parental involvement in their children's education-a classic aspect of social capital-is itself conditioned by the kind of school a child attends (Ho and Willms 1996; Oswald et al. 1988) .\nApart from these institutional dimensions, micro-level factors are also known to affect track placement and other educational outcomes: One the one hand, family background and prior academic performance shape educational achievement and educational attainment (e.g., Alexander and Cook 1982; Alexander, Pallas, and Cook 1981; Bankston and Zhou 1995; Entwisle and Alexander 1993; Garet and Delany 1988) . Moreover, demographic determinants-such as age at arrival, or generational and legal status-can affect track placement of immigrants (Germany: Alba et al. 1994; Baker et al. 1985; Baker and Lenhardt 1988; Kornmann and Schnattinger 1989; U.S.: Baca et al. 1989; Pong 1998; Portes and MacLeod 1996) . Status attainment and mobility studies, which often focus on such individual-level factors, are also known for illustrating cross-national (Blossfeld and Shavit 1993; McClendon 1980; M\u00fcller et al. 1989; and longitudinal trends (e.g., Baker et al. 1985; Blau and Duncan 1967; Boss-N\u00fcnning 1990; Bowles and Gintis 1976; Faist 1993; Grusky and Hauser 1984; M\u00fcller and Haun 1994) .\nOn the other hand, relevant research on educational stratification in Germany still follows the classic \"Wisconsin model\" and thus examines class-based intergenerational attainment patterns at the expense of ethnic patterns. Moreover, less than a handful of German studies have examined explicitly whether cultural or social capital have ethnically specific effects on track placement patterns. My study seeks to address this specific shortcoming. In the process, I draw on a theoretical framework linked to Coleman (1988) and others, who argue that social capital shapes educational opportunities and outcomes independently of socioeconomic background."}, {"section_title": "How Social Capital Relates to Educational Outcomes", "text": "As outlined above, researchers have tried to make sense of ethnic track placement patterns by relying on institutional or individual-level explanations. But it is my contention that information about social integration, including intra-and extra-familial networks, also provides important insights into how families of different ethnic backgrounds \"navigate\" educational institutions with which they may or may not be familiar (see Bankston and Zhou 1995; Kalmijn and Kraaykamp 1986; Teachman et al. 1997) . Due to the scarcity of literature on Germany (especially as it concerns ethnic/immigrant experiences), I draw on research conducted by German and U.S. scientists who have examined how social capital affects educational outcomes separately from social class or status-related factors.\nResearchers in the U.S. have demonstrated that networks play a crucial role in determining educational outcomes. Most have focused on peer networks among children or on direct parental involvement in their children's education, for instance through participation in PTA-related activities or meetings with a child's teachers (Coleman 1987; George and Kaplan 1998; Ho and Willms 1996; Lareau 1987 Lareau , 1989 Lareau and Horvat 1999; Pong 1998) . Apart from extrafamilial peer networks among children and intra-familial networks, we know that network ties across generations influence educational aspirations, trajectories (dropping out, track placement), and achievement (grades, GPA, test scores) (see Baca, Bryan, McLean-Bardwell, and Gomez 1989; Carbonaro 1998; Downey 1995; George and Kaplan 1998; Lareau 1987 Lareau , 1989 Lee and Croninger 1996; Pong 1996) . In particular, intergenerational dynamics related to family/peer socialization and general cultural practices have been held responsible for immigrant school performance in Germany (Alamdar-Niemann et al. 1991; B\u00fcchel and Wagner 1995; Leenen et al. 1990; Malhotra 1985) and the U.S. (Hallinan and Sorensen 1985; Useem 1992) .\nAlthough social capital is usually regarded in a positive light, specific types of networks are known to produce negative effects. For example, extensive peer group ties among children may have a negative impact on student achievement (Portes and Sensenbrenner 1993; Rumberger 1987 ). Yet few researchers have examined the degree to which parental networks may influence children's trajectories in a positive or negative manner. From the point of social capital theory, intra-and extra-familial networks may serve fundamentally different purposes. And, as is the case for children's peer networks, parental extrafamilial ties may also have a positive or a negative impact. In this study, I try to disentangle which specific parental ties affect track placement and whether their impact differs just across or also within ethnic groups. Lareau's (1987 Lareau's ( , 1989 work, among others, has shown that parental ties to teachers or schools shape their children's academic achievement. But whether the degree of parental integration into the family and community at large shapes their children's educational trajectories has remained largely unexamined. Nauck et al. (1997) argue that intrafamilial ties are crucial for first-generation immigrants, whereas extrafamilial ties play a more important role for the second generation. While the GSOEP does not identify immigrants in terms of their \"generation,\" I attempt to address this issue by including both types of networks. In addition, B\u00fcchel and Duncan (1998) explore how family background and parental social capital affect track placement, noting that parents engage in some activities together with each other (socializing, helping family), while other activities appear complementary and occur in gender-specific ways (e.g., participating in sports, volunteer, and, to some degree, political work). B\u00fcchel and Duncan's main emphasis lies with the gender-specific impact parental activities have on track placement. They do not examine ethnically specific impacts, nor do they disaggregate different forms of socializing.\nEspecially with regard to immigrants, the extensiveness of parental assimilation, acquisition of mainstream cultural capital, and language skills influences opportunities of children and their academic achievement (Bankston and Zhou 1995; B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998; B\u00fcchel and Wagner 1995; DeJong 1988; Kalmijn and Kraaykamp 1996; Rumberger and Larson 1998; Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995; Warren 1996) . To add to the complexity of these issues, Korte (1990) observes that, in Germany, immigrants' active social integration paired with intentions to return to the home country are not mutually exclusive. What remains missing is an explicit comparison of how different kinds of parental networks affect tracking outcomes for immigrant and indigenous majority students. Building on the small but growing literature in this field (B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998; B\u00fcchel et al. 1997) , my analysis will show that social integration and types of interpersonal networks available to parents do affect track placement in Germany. This effect exists within and across ethnic groups, independently from factors related to class and social status. Most importantly, among foreign parents the presence of interethnic ties with Germans is associated with benefits for their children's educational trajectory, making the children less likely to attend the Hauptschule."}, {"section_title": "III. Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The GSOEP was originally designed with mobility researchers in mind. Its main focus lies with documenting the educational and occupational experiences of a stratified random sample of the adult population in Germany. To date, it remains one of the best panel data sets available for a European country. Immigrants were purposely oversampled in order to facilitate quantitative analyses like the one presented here. For detailed information concerning sampling procedures, please see Wagner et al. (1993 Wagner et al. ( , 1994 .\nBecause of its primary focus on adult mobility, the GSOEP cannot be easily compared to U.S.-based data sets like the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS). For example, the GSOEP does not contain any indicators of children's (prior) academic achievement. But for the purposes of this study, the GSOEP remains the only data set available that enables us to test whether intra-and extra-familial social capital shape educational outcomes in Germany. More importantly, the GSOEP also contains several critical measures of immigrant social integration akin to those used in NELS (e.g., language skills, interethnic ties).\nMy analyses focus on the link between parental social capital and ethnically specific track placement patterns in Germany. My sample is limited to West Germany because the minuscule proportion of immigrants in the former East Germany would skew comparisons. Similar to B\u00fcchel and Duncan (1998) , I extracted information on all children attending secondary school (the GSOEP defines children as members of the household age sixteen or younger) and matched relevant household information and information on their parents' background, family, and community ties.\nUnlike B\u00fcchel and Wagner (1995) , who have conducted crucial analyses on ethnic tracking patterns based on a longitudinal sample of fourteen-year-old children selected from ten different GSOEP waves , my analyses are based on a cross-sectional sample of all ten-to-sixteen-year-old students attending a secondary school in 1995. I decided to create a cross-sectional, age-heterogeneous subsample rather than a longitudinal one for three reasons: (1) Recent changes in immigration law and the influx of Eastern Europeans into Germany warranted limiting the sample to postunification West Germany. (2) 1995 was the most recent year available in which the GSOEP survey obtained information about parental social capital. (3) By expanding the age range to include all ten-to-sixteen-year-old secondary students I maximized the number of observations on German and, more importantly, non-German students. But an age-heterogeneous sample has the disadvantage that students may change tracks after the sixth grade (age twelve). 4 In analyses not reported here I restricted the sample to include only twelve-tosixteen-year-old students, an age group essentially \"locked\" into a particular track, but obtained very similar empirical results. Those analyses are available upon request.\nThe 1995 wave contains 600 secondary students between the ages of ten and sixteen, of whom 417 are ethnically German and 183 are considered foreigners. Missing data on some parental social capital measures further reduces the extended analyses. 5 Table 1 contains further details. 6"}, {"section_title": "Mode of Analysis and Modelling Issues", "text": "Building on B\u00fcchel and Duncan's (1998) and B\u00fcchel and Wagner's (1995) work, I conducted analyses in two stages. The first stage includes a general model in which ethnic background serves as one of the explanatory variables, thus duplicating models used in prior research. The second set of analyses employs reduced samples comparing how parental access to social capital affects ethnically German students as opposed to children from non-German backgrounds. This helps draw out differences in educational outcomes within groups.\nMy baseline model (Model 1) contains control variables regarding the student's gender, ethnicity, family size, the family's socioeconomic background, and child care arrangements. 7 Model 2 contains additional variables related to the parents' and the family's social status-i.e., information about parental 4 Although not a common practice, this might produce biased results. However, Henz (1997) demonstrates that only about ten percent of secondary students in Germany change tracks and that among these, an equal proportion moves on to higher and lower tracks. This reduces the risk of bias.\n5 In analyses not reported here I retained the full number of observations by using means substitution for missing values in key independent variables and further controlling for this method by introducing dummy variables into the model. The results obtained were very similar to those reported here, indicating that the missing cases are randomly distributed and do not influence the empirical effects discussed. 6 In general, missing information is more likely to exist in parental variables linked to the students' fathers rather than their mothers. This provided the main reason for identifying the children's nationality via their mothers' nationality. However, because mothers' social capital measures usually failed to achieve statistical significance (despite the larger number of observations; also see B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998), I repeatedly decided to rely on information concerning the fathers' network ties. In analyses not reported here I used other means of assigning children's ethnic identity (e.g., by classifying all children with at least one foreign parents as non-German). Only a small number of children were affected by this change in measurement, and results were overall consistent with those reported here. 7 Analyses not reported here also controlled for the child's age and for family structure (marital status). Neither measure had an empirical effect on the findings presented here. I exclude them from Tables 4 and 5 solely to simplify the regression tables.\neducational background and access to communication and media-based resources. Model 3 adds a series of parental social capital measures available for German and non-German families. This includes intrafamilial ties and extrafamilial networks, which can be subdivided into community-based vs. socializing activities. Model 4 adds crucial information about the degree of social integration among nonGermans, notably German language ability, intentions to stay in Germany, and personal ties to Germans. The final analysis (Model 5), also limited to the subsample of foreigners, combines all background, social capital, and integration-related variables. Please see Table 2 for descriptive information about each variable. Track placement is the dependent variable. To repeat, the German school system technically consists of three tracks: Hauptschule, Realschule, and Gymnasium. While some U.S. and German researchers have constructed multinomial logit/probit models, most have employed simple logits by collapsing three tracks into two and separating the Gymnasium students from all others. As Table 1 shows, collapsing tracks in this manner works well for the German students, who are tracked into three roughly equal groups. But only a very small number of non-Germans are placed in the academic track/Gymnasium or even the alternative school form akin to a U.S. comprehensive high school. This makes it more feasible to create a dichotomous dependent variable that separates the Hauptschule/vocational students from all others. 8 Following Alba et al. (1994) , I have coded this variable \"0\" if the student attends the Hauptschule and \"1\" otherwise (those attending Realschule, Gymnasium, or Gesamtschule).\nThe control variables in the baseline model (Model 1) are measured as follows: to account for the family's SES, all models include information about the household's monthly net income in DM. Like other household and parental variables, this information was pasted onto the children. To measure the student's nationality, I employ a dichotomous variable, where 0=German and 1=non-German. The GSOEP does not record the children's national background but instead asks the adults in the household about their nationality. Because information about the mother's nationality was more easily available (and less plagued by missing values), I linked the mother's national background to each child in the household. 9 The analyses also control for the gender of the student (1=female, 0=male).\nFinally, many researchers argue that parental resources (financial and otherwise) become diluted as the size of the household increases, making it more difficult for large families to send some or all of their children to the higher academic tracks. To account for this possibility, I include household size (# of people) and mothers' involvement in child care (# hours spent on childcare). Unfortunately the GSOEP does not provide detailed information linking mothers' child care duties to the specific child in question. I discuss empirical expectations regarding these standard control measures in footnote 10. 10 8 In addition to this empirical reason, choosing a dichotomous dependent variable also makes sense from more methodological and theoretical points of view: multinomial logits/probits are based on the assumption that the categories of the dependent variable are scaled in a nominal fashion. The three tracks are, in fact, ordinal (Hauptschule=lowest, Gymnasium=highest), but not equidistant in terms of years of education or the social status associated with particular tracks. Moreover, parents and teachers usually do not consider all three tracks as equally viable options and typically assign students based on dichotomies (see discussion above). 9 This variable is based on two variables called NATION95 and MOTHER, which are asked of every adult in the sample. To identify the fathers and determine their ethnicity, we created a proxy labeling those adult males as \"fathers\" who were identified as heads of households. While this proxy may be considered problematic, it is still customary in Germany to identify fathers or, in their absence, the oldest male relative living with the family as head of the household. In cases where male adults existed but were not identified as heads of households we assumed them to be regular family members (oldest sons, grandfathers, etc.). In analyses not reported here I exchanged this dummy with a dichotomous variable indicating whether the child was of Turkish descent. The empirical results were identical to those reported; i.e., ethnicity as such failed to achieve statistical significance. 10 As income increases, we should expect a decrease in the likelihood of being placed in the Hauptschule. While these socioeconomic effects have been documented across and within ethnic groups, I also expect class effects to diminish as I expand the model to include information about the parents' social status and social capital measures. Similarly, we know foreigners to be less likely to attend one of the higher tracks, and we should therefore expect a negative coefficient. The question is whether ethnicity itself plays a role in track placement or whether intermediary mechanisms tied to SES, status, or social capital produce the ethnic patterns at hand. I include gender because of the continuing debate among U.S. researchers about gender differences in children's track placement and other forms of educational achievement/attainment (e.g., Alexander et al. 1981; Garet and Delany 1988; Gamoran and Mare 1989; Grant 1984; Hirschman and Wong 1986; LePore and Warren 1997; Rosenbaum 1980; Rumbaut 1997) . Moreover, international researchers have also examined the role gender plays in access to education (Alamdar-Niemann et al. 1991; Faist 1993; Katsillis and Rubinson 1990; Yogev 1981) . Historically speaking, we should expect a gender gap favoring The first extended model (Model 2) includes two measures of parental educational background (years of education) and other resources tied to the family's social status. We know that parents' education remains one of the best predictors of children's educational attainment. Thus, I expect both mother's and father's educational background to have a positive impact on the likelihood that their child attends a higher track. In addition, the GSOEP asks three dichotomous questions about whether there is a phone, a TV, and a PC in the household (1=yes). Not surprisingly for the mid-1990s, most households had a TV (97%), but only one third of the households included in this study owned a PC. Because all three measures are correlated, I created an index, in which values can range from zero (own none of the above) to three (own all of the above). Analyses not reported here showed this combination measure to be more effective at capturing ethnic-group differences than the PC measure by itself. 11 Prior research by DiMaggio (1982) , which stresses the importance of a family's cultural resources for children's educational outcomes, leads me to expect that children with access to such media resources are more likely to attend the higher tracks (also see Downey 1995; Kao 1995) . In fact, access to such economicallybased resources may play an even bigger role in shaping non-German children's track placement.\nboys' access to more academically oriented tracks, regardless of gender differences in aspirations. But M\u00fcller and Haun (1994) have shown that gender inequities in access to secondary school types have decreased in post-World War II Germany. And Alba et al. (1994) and others have shown that nowadays, boys in Germany are actually more likely to be placed in the Hauptschule, the lowest track. This leads me to expect an overall positive relationship between gender (1=female) and the likelihood of being sent to a higher track. For the subsample of foreigners, traditional gender norms may limit girls' access to education (see AlamdarNiemann et al. 1991) , thus increasing girls' chance of being placed in the lowest track. Alternatively, non-German girls may less likely be placed in the lowest track, possibly because their parents view access to academic training as an asset for girls, regardless of whether they are expected to become gainfully employed as adult women. While evidence concerning the \"dilution hypothesis\" in the U.S. is mixed (see Blake 1989; Downey 1995; Powell and Steelman 1993) , I expect a negative impact of household size on track placement for the overall and the ethnically specific analyses. I also expect this effect to wane as the expanded models account for the impact of specific resources rooted in the family's social status and parents' use of networks.\n11 Analyses not reported here show that statistically significant ethnic-group differences exist regarding the presence of phones and PCs in the household. Interestingly, foreigners in Germany are just as likely to own TVs as are Germans; they are less likely than Germans to have access to phones or personal computers. This explains why the composite measure produces the strongest empirical results. In Model 3, which serves as the full model for the whole sample and the German subsample, I add a series of social capital variables. Unfortunately, the GSOEP questions regarding parental activities do not provide any indication whether the parents engage in these activities with or without their children. Nonetheless, the gender-specific information about fathers' and mothers' activities allows significant insights into the parents' involvement in intra-and extra-familial activities and serves as the basis for answering my main empirical question. The GSOEP questions ask about the frequency of parental activities on a scale from 1 (daily) to 5 (never). Based on B\u00fcchel and Duncan (1998) , I have constructed two extrafamilial parental social capital measures by adding the mothers' and father's scores (going out to eat and drink, playing card and board games), one parental measure concerning family visits, and two gender-specific measures for parental involvement in the community: fathers' participation in sports and mothers' volunteer/political activities. Based on prior research, we should expect children's likelihood of attending the Hauptschule to decrease if their parents spend little time socializing but are involved in their family and the community at large. To reiterate, my interest lies primarily in teasing out the ethnically specific effects of parents' intra-and extra-familial ties on track placement. 12\nIn Model 4, I test a set of crucial social capital and integration measures available for the subsample of foreigners. Specifically, I include two classic measures of social integration: father's German language ability (based on a composite measure regarding speaking and writing skills) and the father's plans to stay in Germany. Quite contrary to U.S.-based analyses but based on prior research on Germany (B\u00fcchel and 12 B\u00fcchel and Duncan (1998) used modified scales. Having estimated all models using both their and the original GSOEP scalings, I found no substantive differences but superior diagnostic statistics (_ 2 ) when using the original 1-5 scales. I also logged all social capital and integration measures to correct for skewness but obtained very similar empirical results. I present the unlogged results to ease interpretation. In other analyses not reported here I tested alternative measures concerning parental participation in voluntary associations (sports, church) and ties to neighbors, but none reached statistical significance within or across ethnic groups.\nWagner 1995), we should expect German language ability to remain nonsignificant and the father's plans to stay in Germany to have a positive impact on the children's likelihood of attending a higher track. 13\nMost importantly, no one has examined the degree to which parental interethnic networks, i.e., ties between foreigners and Germans, affect children's educational trajectory. This variable is based on an index created by summing the dichotomous responses of non-German fathers and mothers to two questions about whether they visited Germans and received visits from Germans during the previous year (range 0 to 4). Interestingly, the GSOEP does not ask Germans whether they have had contact with nonGermans, making it impossible to examine interethnic networks from both angles. Just as we expect family ties to provide an important support network, we should view foreigners' ties to Germans-i.e., visiting Germans or receiving visits from them-as a crucial way of building social capital. Research on Mexican immigrants in the U.S. reveals that parents are \"generally unaware of their rights and obligations as parents in the U.S. school system\" (Baca et al. 1989) . Similarly, German acquaintances might be able to help parents and children navigate the German school system by serving either as sources of information or as mediators between parents and teachers. This leads me to expect a positive relationship between interethnic ties among adults and the likelihood that immigrant children attend one of the higher tracks."}, {"section_title": "IV. Results", "text": "Models 1 through 3 produce few surprises. As expected, children from households with higher incomes are more likely to attend a higher track (in general and among Germans), just as children from non-German backgrounds are more likely to attend the lowest track, but both effects weaken or evaporate once we take the family's educational resources into account. Similarly, the resource dilution proxies (household size and mother's time spent doing child care) are negatively associated with children's likelihood of attending the higher tracks, especially among Germans. Again, these effects fade once we focus on within-group differences (Table 5 ) and expand the model to include parental social capital. No statistically significant gender difference exists regarding track placement. At first glance, the student's gender appears to shape track placement for non-Germans, suggesting that non-German girls are less likely to attend the Hauptschule. But diagnostic tests show that the two subgroup coefficients are not statistically different from each other. 14 Models 2 and 3 in both tables show that parental educational background remains the strongest predictor of track placement: as parents' educational attainment rises, their children's chances of attending one of the higher tracks increase. This applies to the overall analyses (Table 4) as well as the German subsample (Table 5) . It parallels findings of other researchers who have studied status-attainment processes and intergenerational mobility, noting that fathers' and mothers' education serves as an 13 In analyses not reported here I also tests mothers' German language ability as well as a composite parental German language ability measure. Although Leenen et al. (1990) note that Turkish fathers in Germany are rarely involved in their children's education, the fathers' language measure produced the strongest and most consistent empirical results in my analyses. Similarly, in analyses not reported here, the mother's plans to stay in Germany/return to her home country remained unrelated to track placement.\n14 In models not reported here I estimated all regressions with interaction terms for control and independent variables, rather than estimating the models for each ethnic subsample. None of the interaction terms involving control variables reached statistical significance, but the media resources measure (\"access to media*mother's nationality\") and the two \"socializing measures\" discussed below (\"going out*mother's nationality\" and \"playing board games*mother's nationality\") did reveal statistically significant group effects.\nimportant determinant of children's educational attainment (e.g., Blossfeld and Shavit 1993; B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998; M\u00fcller and Haun 1994; . However, the coefficient for mothers' education fails statistical significance tests for the non-German subsample, suggesting that fathers' educational backgrounds play a more important role for the intergenerational mobility of immigrants. Within-group comparisons also highlight one difference in the track placement of German and nonGerman children: Access to media-based resources such as phones and a PC reduces the likelihood of attending the Hauptschule among non-Germans. These subgroup coefficients differ in a statistically significant way. Now I turn to the effects of social capital on track placement. Please remember the GSOEP's counterintutitive coding for social activities, where 1=daily and 5=never. At first, Table 4 seems to indicate that when parents go out or socialize with friends frequently, it hampers their children's educational chances. That is, not socializing with other adults by going out or playing games seems to increase everyone's children's chances of attending a higher track (also shown by B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998) . But Table 5 reveals the ethnically specific nature of these associations: Adding such parental social capital measures dramatically increases model fit for the non-German analyses (see jump in _ 2 and drop in log-likelihood ratio), but it appears to do little to improve track placement predictions among Germans.\nThe within-group analyses in Table 5 reveal that parental \"socializing\" activities, to use B\u00fcchel and Duncan's (1998) terminology, only affect the track placement of non-German children. The counterintutitive coding means: the less frequently parents engage in socializing activities, the more likely their children are to attend a higher track. Though they point in the same direction, the coefficients in the German sample fail to reach statistical significance. Let me emphasize again that these ethnically specific coefficients are statistically significantly different from each other. Moreover, family ties or parents' community involvement through sports or through volunteer or political work does not seem to affect track placement within or across groups. While these findings seem to contradict B\u00fcchel and Duncan (1998) and related work on parental social capital in the U.S., the coefficients do point in the predicted direction. Model 4 serves as a prelude to Model 5 and produces the same results.\nTherefore, my discussion now focuses on the final model in Table 5 , in which I add interethnic social capital and key measures of social integration among non-Germans. Essentially, the final model confirms the social capital effects discussed above: in addition to father's educational background and access to media-based technology, some forms of parental social capital influence children's track placement. On the one hand, parental socializing measures increase the chance of their children's attending the Hauptschule. On the other hand, parents' interethnic, extrafamilial networks have a positive impact on children's educational trajectories. Children whose parents visited Germans and/or received visits from Germans during the previous year are less likely to attend the Hauptschule.\nAs expected, fathers' German language ability had no statistically significant impact on their children's track placement. Also as expected, the father's intentions to stay in Germany appear to increase the chance that a child attends one of the advanced tracks (Alba et al. 1994; B\u00fcchel and Wagner 1995) , but the coefficient does not reach statistical significance in my analyses. 15 Though other research shows that length of residency and return intentions affect children's track placement, my findings suggest that availability of social ties with Germans overshadows those effects."}, {"section_title": "V. Discussion", "text": "The purpose of this article is to examine the degree to which parental social capital affects the track placement of adolescents in Germany. Specifically, I explore whether parental social capital operates in similar ways within and across ethnic groups. Comparing the determinants of track placement for Germans and non-Germans provides some answers, but the analyses also raise important new questions, which call for additional quantitative and ethnographic data collection.\nThe main findings from Table 5 indicate that access to educational resources and social capital have ethnically specific effects on track placement. Taking into account standard family background characteristics, access to media-based technology (phone, PC) does reduce the likelihood that a child attends the lowest track in the German system, the Hauptschule. Remarkably, access to such technology primarily helps explain differences in track placement among non-Germans and has no measurable influence on how Germans are tracked. This indicates that technology has little impact on track placement as long as it is generally available-and quite possibly little impact on educational outcomes at large. But it continues to influence educational trajectories in populations where access to such resources remains scarce.\nThe most striking findings revolve around the social capital effects on track placement. Teachman et al. (1997) raise the question whether social capital can have a compensatory effect among immigrant groups, i.e., whether it helps overcome disadvantages related to parents' lower educational attainment and other socioeconomic factors. 16 Their study does not provide a direct answer. But the analyses presented here suggest that, at least for immigrants in Germany, extrafamilial social capital has mixed effects on children's educational trajectories: Parental socializing activities outside of the family are inversely related to their children's educational trajectory, while parental ties to Germans appear to improve immigrant children's chances of attending one of the higher tracks.\nAlthough my findings are robust and confirm results of several prior studies involving the GSOEP (e.g., B\u00fcchel and Duncan 1998; B\u00fcchel et al. 1997; B\u00fcchel and Wagner 1995) , they also raise a set of important empirical questions: at this point, it remains unclear why the frequency with which nonGerman parents visit restaurants or engage in fundamentally social activities like playing board games seems to have a negative impact on their children's trajectory. Let me state clearly that, while the mean scores for Germans and non-Germans are similar, in fact Germans engage in socializing activities more frequently than non-Germans (see Table 2 ). Additional data collection is required to examine whether ethnic differences exist in the context and the quality of such interactions among adults.\nFor example, although the GSOEP lacks detailed information, it is possible that immigrant parents and children engage in these socializing activities together. While this may strengthen family ties, it may also impede their children's ability to form extrafamilial friendships within and outside of their own ethnic group. Nauck et al. (1997:491) , who examine how \"guestworkers\" become integrated into German society, argue that such extrafamilial contacts play a particularly crucial role for second-generation immigrants in Germany. Unfortunately, their study does not explore the impact of such extrafamilial ties on children's educational outcomes. Leenen et al. (1990) do examine school performance among Turkish children in German but do not focus on track placement as such. They argue that Turkish adolescents in Germany face a catch-22: the more independent from their families they become, especially regarding traditional cultural norms, the better they perform in German schools. But in doing so, they risk fundamental intergenerational conflicts, which many find difficult to manage.\nAlternatively, it is possible that immigrant parents engage in such activities without their children. On the one hand, this could indicate that lack of supervision at home adversely affects children's educational trajectory. On the other hand, parents of these ten-to-sixteen-year-old children may feel more at ease leaving adolescents alone precisely because the key educational choice has already been made. This would suggest a reverse causal relationship between track placement and parental social activities that requires further examination.\nInterestingly, strong parental ties to extended family members do not seem to influence track placement for either group (no statistical difference exists between the nonsignificant coefficient for Germans and the marginally significant one for non-Germans in Model 3). Instead, extrafamilial interethnic ties provide benefits for non-German children, who are less likely to attend the lowest track if their parents report maintaining personal contact with Germans. How do we interpret this finding? It stands to reason that non-German parents' personal ties to Germans generally benefit their children. Interethnic ties among German and non-German adults may provide an important source of information about the German educational system and the long-term implications of attending specific tracks. 17 We would benefit from understanding more about the basis of these relationships, whether they involve German coworkers, parents of their children's peers, teachers or other \"institutional agents\" (Lareau and Horvat 1999; Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch 1995) . For example, Baca et al. (1989) show that immigrant parents are often unfamiliar with the structure of educational systems in the host country. This may cause immigrant parents to rely heavily on teacher recommendations (Leenen et al. 1990 ). Moreover, Carbonaro (1998) suggests that \"intergenerational closure,\" i.e., parents' ties to their children's friends' parents, affects a series of educational outcomes in the U.S. However, these findings remain tentative and require further empirical corroboration (also see Morgan and Sorensen 1999) .\nFinally, while my analyses point to the crucial impact of adult interethnic friendships on the educational trajectories of immigrant children in Germany, future data collection efforts should assess whether interethnic ties also benefit the educational trajectories of German children. Do inter-and intraethnic friendships have universal benefits, or does their impact on school outcomes remain contextual and group-specific? The answer has far-reaching implications, as it can influence whether families and communities try to integrate immigrants into the respective host culture or actively foster intercultural exchange and network formation. While the former represents a unidirectional process reminiscent of classic assimilation approaches, the latter necessitates a multidirectional strategy bound to change immigrants and the host culture alike."}, {"section_title": "Selective Bibliography", "text": "Aguirre, Adalberto, and Ruben Martinez.
