A discussion of resilience efforts that are underway since Hurricane Katrina (2005) in collaboration with local community agencies, such as the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, to prepare for and mitigate future hazard impacts is also presented here. Finally, the issue of resilience of the homeless populations residing in the coastal counties of three Gulf Coast states, i.e. Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, is discussed to justify the need for this study, which is followed by the research questions and objectives of this study.\nA significant amount of research has examined hazard vulnerability and resilience, but very few of this research have in fact focused on homeless populations. Because the majority of the world's population lives within close proximity to oceans, it can be assumed that most of the homeless population lives in densely populated coastal communities as well. The Gulf Coast region is susceptible to and has been heavily affected by disasters, such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes, and these will likely increase in frequency and severity due to climate change. Although Gulf Coast communities recognize the hazards they face, they very often prioritize economic development opportunities over mitigation activities (Smith and Deyle 1998). Local administrations have formulated little or no policy regarding the evacuation and safety of the homeless population. This chapter provides a definition of homelessness in context of this study, which is followed by a comprehensive review of the concept of vulnerability and resilience. A discussion of social and physical capital that influences the resilience of a community is also presented, following which a summary of the literature is presented to justify the need for this study.\nA mixed methods approach using primary data collected by questionnaire survey and secondary spatial data sets was used to answer the research questions. In the following sections, an introduction to the study site where this research was undertaken, and a discussion of the data sets used, their sources, and the data processing steps are presented. Finally, the spatial and statistical analyses that were implemented to answer the questions discussed.\nChapter Five summarizes the availability of social and physical capital to homeless populations and their social and physical networks. This chapter also discusses the significant variables that determine the resilience of homeless individuals to help with policy preparation to provide some of these capital to increase resilience of these individuals. Finally, a discussion of the implication of this study's findings along with future directions for this research is presented."}, {"section_title": "Hazard Trends in the Gulf Coast Region and Their Potential Impacts", "text": "Whether natural or anthropogenic, hazards are an inherent part of human society. In particular, hydro-meteorological hazards are responsible for significant societal impacts (Kar 2014). The National Climate Assessment report (2014) has indicated that the United States will likely experience an increase in flooding and tropical cyclones due to climate change. The Gulf Coast is expected to experience more adverse impacts from tropical cyclones than any other region in the United States (Emanuel 2005;Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction 2005;Webster et al., 2005;Donnelly and Woodruff 2007). In fact, the ten costliest hurricanes that were presidentially declared disasters between 2004 and 2010 made landfall in this region and caused billions of dollars of damage (NOAA 2011). Since 1956, 9,088 disasters (Table 1) have been declared in the Gulf Coast States: Alabama (1,207), Florida (1,440), Louisiana (1,366), Mississippi (1,274), and Texas (3,801).  The oil and gas industry in the Gulf Coast region is highly developed and produces almost 52 percent of the oil and gas of the entire United States (NOAA 2011). Approximately 50 percent of leased acreage for oil and gas production in this region is located in deep water (below 1000 feet). This makes oil production susceptible to tropical cyclones, as was seen during hurricanes Ivan and Katrina when a number of platforms were destroyed, leading to reduced production and widespread economic impacts among coastal communities (NOAA 2011). Episodic events, such as the failure of Deepwater Horizon and other oil rigs have also been seen to impact the economic and environmental systems of the Gulf Coast region (Colten et al., 2012). While natural and anthropogenic hazards are not new to the Gulf Coast, the resilience of its residents is of concern, specifically, that of the homeless populations who are paid little attention by emergency management agencies and are not accounted for in disaster mitigation policies."}, {"section_title": "Resilience Efforts along the Gulf Coast", "text": "Although there are many groups focusing on increasing the resilience of the Gulf Coast, the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) is a frontrunner. GOMA (Cutter, et al. 2008). CARRI, originally created at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, identifies a list of improvements needed to make a community more resilient to disasters (Gulf of Mexico Alliance 2016). CARRI is currently headquartered in Gulfport, Memphis, and Charleston, and is to be initiated in several other Gulf Coast communities. This process has already been started in Gulfport, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana (Gulf of Mexico Alliance 2016)."}, {"section_title": "The Problem", "text": "An extensive amount of research has been conducted on hazard vulnerability and resilience, but little of it has focused on people experiencing homelessness. The Gulf Coast region, because of its location, is susceptible to both natural and anthropogenic hazards (e.g. tropical storms, oil spill, tornadoes) (Carter et al., 2014). With climate change, the Gulf Coast is at a higher risk of experiencing an increased number of disasters in the future, especially hydro-meteorological events (Moser, et al. 2014). Unfortunately, local governments have almost no policy regarding the evacuation and safety of homeless residents (i.e., literal and chronic sheltered and unsheltered homeless). The majority of counties and parishes in the study area has no policy, but inform those that are at-risk to make alternate arrangements for evacuation (Jackson County Public the most innovative in the study area, and uses a system called \"Evacuspots,\" that has pickup locations spread throughout the parish, as well as a home pickup service if individuals cannot move to the designated pickup locations (City of New Orleans Health Department 2016, Evacuspots 2015). This is important because the homeless are particularly vulnerable due to their lack of access to technical resources (i.e., televisions, radios, cell phones, landline telephones, and computers), which also limits their access to alerts and warnings and other information about disasters."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The purpose of this study is to determine the resilience of the homeless populations residing in Mobile County, Alabama; Jefferson and Orleans Parish, Louisiana; and Harrison and Jackson County, Mississippi, to disasters based on their social and physical capital. The following research questions were examined in this study to assess resilience of homeless populations: (i) What is the social capital (e.g., immediate family, extended family, friends, acquaintances, and other relationships that will provide assistance during a disaster) of homeless individuals and how does it contribute to their resilience to disasters? and (ii) What is the physical capital (e.g., access to disaster information, financial capital to evacuate, automobiles, and technology) of homeless individuals and to what extent it contributes to their resilience to disasters? The 6 social and physical capital criteria were combined together using Multi-Criteria Evaluation technique (MCEdiscussed in the methodology chapter) to determine final resilience index for each study county that is home to homeless populations."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER II -REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Homelessness", "text": "Defining who is \"homeless\" is essential to this study. This includes \"literal homelessness,\" meaning an individual is temporarily homeless, and \"chronic homelessness,\" meaning the person has been homeless repeatedly or for long periods of time (Jencks 1995;Virginia Commonwealth University 2015). Also, relevant are the subcategories of homelessness, which include: \"sheltered and unsheltered homeless\" and emergency or transitional housing (Jencks 1995;Virginia Commonwealth University 2015). Emergency and transitional shelters are places where the homeless population can reside overnight (United States Census Bureau 2012). Unsheltered homeless refers to the people living on the streets or other places that are unsafe and uninhabitable for human residence (Jencks 1995; Virginia Commonwealth University 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Disaster Resilience and Vulnerability", "text": "Although a great deal of research has been undertaken to determine the vulnerability and resilience of communities to disasters, most studies have failed to incorporate homeless populations. Likewise, very little research has focused on examining the vulnerability and resilience of the homeless populations with specific regard to disasters. It is apparent from what research exists, however, that social capital and physical accessibility are essential to determining the resilience of homeless communities to disasters (Ahern et al., 2002;Borgatti, Everett and Johnson 2013;Colussi 1998;Cutter, et al. 2008;Davis 2004;Foster n.d.;Heijmans 2004;Johnson and Griffith 2010;Kawachi et al. 1997;Lin 2001;Nowell, et al. 2013;Peacock, et al. 2010;Portes 1998;Putnam 2000;Stablein 2011;Varda et al., 2009;Wisner, Blaikie, et al. 2007;Yuko et al., 2004). Before assessing the disaster resilience of homeless populations on the Gulf Coast, it is important to understand what vulnerability and resilience mean in the context of this research. Vulnerability is a dynamic condition and a multi-disciplinary concept. However, in the social science disciplines, vulnerability is considered to be impacted by socioeconomic and environmental factors of a community, and changes with time, location and among social groups (Cutter 1996;Cutter et al. 2000;UN 2004). Also, a number of definitions exist for vulnerability within the social science literature. In this study, vulnerability is defined as \"the potential and degree of susceptibility of an individual group or community to experience adverse impacts of hazards due to social-cultural, physical, economic, and environmental conditions,\" while disaster resilience is defined as the ability of a community to return to pre-disaster condition depending upon its socioeconomic, cultural, and physical variables (Burton et al. 1993;Blaikie et al. 1994;Cannon 1994;Kasperson et al. 1995;Cutter 1996;Mileti 1999;McCubin 2001;Rose 2004). This definition of vulnerability argues that disasters do not just happen, but are the outcomes of a variety of different factors (Oliver-Smith 1994). This definition also argues that not all people are affected equally during a disaster (Allen 1994), because vulnerability and resilience of culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse populations differ during a disaster depending upon their social and physical capital. A number of models and indices have been developed to determine vulnerability and resilience of communities with regard to hazards (Colussi 1998;Cutter, et al. 2008;Foster n.d.;Peacock, et al. 2010;Wisner, Blaikie, et al. 2007). For instance, the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) model uses the following twelve, equally-weighted variables: income equality, economic diversification, regional affordability, business environment, educational attainment, population without disability, population out of poverty, population with health insurance, civic infrastructure, metropolitan stability, homeownership, and voter participation (Foster n.d.). The Pressure and Release Model is one of the main models used to represent vulnerability as a function of risk and hazard such that risk is considered to be a product of vulnerability and hazard (Risk = Vulnerability x Hazard) (Wisner, Blaikie, et al. 2007). However, this model is considered to be too simplistic. The Access Model developed by Wisner, Blaikie, et al. (2007), not only expands the Pressure and Release Model, but also attempts to measure risk at the household and individual level. The Access Model includes more detailed socioeconomic information, a temporal component (time of year, length of hazardous event, length of event build-up), and helps determine which populations are vulnerable, predicts potential outcomes of a hazard event, analyzes policy implications, and determines how to cope with a disaster (Wisner, Blaikie, et al. 2007). The newest vulnerability framework is the RAND framework, created by the RAND Corporation, which is used to assess risk associated with terrorism: Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Consequence (Center for Technology and National Security Policy 2010). According to this framework, threat is defined as \"the probability that a specific target is attacked in a specific way during a specific time period,\" vulnerability is defined as \"the probability that damage occurs given a specific attack type, at a specific time, on a given target,\" and consequence is defined as \"the expected magnitude of damage given that a specific attack type, at a specific time, on a given target, results in damage\" (Center for Technology and National Security Policy 2010). Like vulnerability, resilience is a multi-disciplinary concept with a variety of definitions (Holling 1973;Hamel and V\u00e4likangas 2003). Resilience as a concept is inversely related to vulnerability and is dynamic in nature. In social science research, resilience is considered to be a result of internal and external stimuli, and of private and public policy decisions (Mileti 1999;Rose 2004), and a product of socio-economic, cultural, and political variables (Tinch 1998;Mileti 1999;Rose 2004 (Peacock, et al. 2010). Cutter et al. (2010) conducted a study in which 36 variables were derived from publicly available data and from a number of resilience studies. These indices despite their success fail to monitor the resilience of homeless populations. From the studies conducted on resilience, it is evident that community resilience is dependent on both social and physical capital, which was determined in this study to assess resilience of the homeless populations."}, {"section_title": "Social Capital and Networks", "text": "Social capital refers to one's voluntary inclusion in social groups and individual relationships that are trustworthy and are mutually beneficial, and in this case, the benefits (i.e., shelter, money, food, clothing, and transportation) of being in a group during a disaster (Davis 2004;Heijmans 2004;Kawachi et al. 1997;Lin 2001;Portes 1998;Putnam 2000;Yuko et al., 2004). Social networks are relationships among people that describe and form a social system (Borgatti, Everett and Johnson 2013). Ahearn et al., (2002), in their study of the effects of the 2002 Sniper Attacks in Washington D.C., discovered that the homeless community had become more \"fearful, sad, and angry,\" and adjusted their behaviors to become more cautious, just as those that were not homeless. This study revealed that communities with strong emotional and social networks, whether they are homeless or not, are more likely to be healthier and less likely to suffer depression after a disaster than others (Ahern et al., 2002). Stablein (2011) in his study of social capital of homeless youth discovered that the homeless are much more likely to go to their peers for support as opposed to institutional or community support, such as shelters and soup kitchens. Varda et al., (2009) researched the effects of social networks during Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina using variables, such as socioeconomic status, employment, disabilities, age, housing status, and the quality and availability of transportation. They found that those with extensive personal and group networks are much more likely to adjust and recover after a disaster event. Kawachi et al., (1997) found that populations belonging to lower income groups do not invest as much as those with a higher income into their social networks, which ultimately leads to a higher mortality rate. In addition, those with higher social capital recover more quickly (Kawachi et al. 1997). Despite availability of social capital, this research indicates that the homeless population is much less likely to be as resilient as the rest of the population.

In terms of resilience, physical capital refers to built infrastructures (e.g., residential, commercial and industrial buildings; lifelines-power lines, sewer systems, water, telecommunication, and transportation; and critical facilities-hospitals, schools, fire stations, police stations), and items (i.e., health coverage, finances, access to cellular/smart phones, television, weather radio, and transportation) that influence resilience of an individual and his/her ability to mitigate disaster impacts (Colussi 1998;Cutter, et al. 2008;Foster n.d.;Peacock, et al. 2010;Wisner, Blaikie, et al. 2007). From the perspective of mitigation actions, a major component of physical capital is to conduct proximity analysis to determine the closest facilities that can be used for shelter and evacuation, and also the assessment of space availability to provide shelter. Like gravity model, road network analysis is used to determine the best path to travel from one location to another, to define service areas, to find the closest facility to a location, and to show where additional facilities can be located in order to better serve a population, depending upon the impedance being used (e.g., time and distance) (ESRI 2013 Given the lack of policies and programs in place for the homeless population along the Gulf Coast counties to help that are susceptible to both natural and anthropogenic hazards, in this study an attempt was made to identify factors that impact social and physical capital of the homeless populations, and to determine resilience of the homeless populations to future coastal hazard events.

This approach also ensured the safety of the surveyors. A sample size of 100 homeless people was originally chosen because it would be a sufficient size to accurately describe the population and would be possible to complete in a timely manner.

Hard copy surveys were also mailed to certain shelters that prohibited face-to-face interaction with the homeless population. Due to lack of access of the homeless population to internet, online survey administration, which was originally intended to increase survey responses, was not implemented.

The survey for shelter personnel also included questions regarding the local disaster policies and its usefulness and relevance to the homeless population. Because the number of survey responses obtained from the shelters' personnel was insufficient to conduct statistical analyses, these responses were coded and analyzed using qualitative approach. Information about how the government agencies and non-governmental organizations might better assist the homeless population during disasters was obtained from the homeless people and the shelters' staff through observations and casual conversations.

Immediate family relationships are the most willing to provide assistance financially, emotionally, with evacuation and clothing, with food and shelter, and with technology as well, and this relationship is tied with friends in terms of aiding with evacuation ( Figure 6).

Survey results also indicated that those who have experienced a disaster have a higher rate of having disaster social capital with all relationships and all assistance types (Figure 9). Independent samples t-test results showed that there is a significant difference between those who have experienced a disaster and those who have not, with regard to friendship, social capital, and assistance ( Figure 10).

They also have friends who will assist them financially (t (38.000) = -4.613, p = 0.000), 0.000).

This situation could be due to the association of the homeless individuals with other homeless people within the shelter or with veterans. It is also important to note that individuals who responded 'yes' to having social capital that will provide food and shelter often meant that they would only be provided food rather than shelter because of their relationships with other homeless individuals."}, {"section_title": "Social Networks among the Homeless", "text": "Social network analysis revealed that 32.7 percent of the homeless population has social capital located within the same community, 34.6 percent has social capital located within the state, and 55.8 percent has social capital located out-of-state.

First, PCA was used to determine which socioeconomic variables (Table 10)   PCA was then conducted to determine the social capital variables with significant impact on disaster resilience of the homeless (Table 11). The results indicate that (based on cumulative component loadings) those individuals with access to friends and acquaintances who are in a position to provide financial and technological support as well 69 as food and shelter will be more resilience. These individuals will be able to adapt and recover from a disaster as opposed to the individuals lacking any connection with friends and acquaintances. The eight social capital variables explain about 90% of the variance in the data, and hence were used as independent variables to determine resilience. Lastly, PCA was conducted to determine which physical capital variables contribute most to the resilience of the homeless to disasters (Table 12). Again, only nine variables were able to explain almost 73% of variance in data. These variables include access to disaster information using modern technologies (social media, telephones, cell phones), financial affordability, access to an automobile, which inherently influence resilience of an individual, and hence were used in the analysis as independent variables. "}, {"section_title": "Impact of Social and Physical Capital on Resilience", "text": "A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) ( Table A6)  A MLR (Table A7) was also implemented to determine the relationship between resilience (dependent variable ranging in score from -8 to 8) of the homeless and their social capital (independent variables determined by PCA). The regression equation (F(8, 71 41) = 2.485, p = 0.027) resulted in a coefficient of multiple determination (R 2 ) of 0.327, which again indicated that social capital is also able to explain only 32.7% of resilience. In other words, social capital also contributes to one third of the homeless individuals' resilience. Having friend assistance located out-of-state (p = 0.01) and acquaintance assistance with technology (p = 0.4) were significant. A MLR (Table A8)  To predict the relationship between resilience (dependent variable) and both physical and social capital variables, a MLR (Table A9) was conducted, which resulted in a regression equation (F(17, 27) = 1.988, p = 0.054), with an R 2 of 0.556. Both social and physical capital were able to explain 55.6% of resilience of the homeless population. Finally, combining all the socioeconomic, physical and social capital variables as independent variables, a MLR was conducted (Table A10), which resulted in an equation F(19, 0) with an R 2 of 1.000. Overall, the resilience of homeless individuals is influenced by their socioeconomic, social capital and physical capital variables. Using MCE (discussed in methodology), mean of each socioeconomic, social capital and physical capital variable was multiplied with its corresponding standardized coefficient value resulted from its respective MLR. Finally, the product results were summed to determine predicted disaster resilience index based on available social capital (Table 13) and physical capital (Table 14) for each of the three states. The results (Table   13) show that in terms of social capital, Alabama ranks highest (0.206), followed closely behind by Louisiana (-0.045), and then Mississippi (-0.065). Lower values are consistent with lower resilience.  (Table 14) shows that in terms of physical capital, Louisiana ranks highest (1.455), followed closely behind by Alabama (1.313), and Mississippi (0.255). When Social Capital and Physical Capital variables were combined, the results (Table 15) show that homeless individuals are more resilient in Alabama (2.831) because of their access to social and physical capital as opposed to Louisiana. In Mississippi (resilience index = -0.566), these individuals are more vulnerable due to lack of many of these capital."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER V -CONCLUSIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Homeless Social Capital and Networks", "text": "Strong social capital and networks can have a dramatic impact on the resilience of the homeless. This study found that immediate family members and friends are essential to the homeless population's disaster social capital. While homeless individuals rely heavily upon these relationships, they are aware that their immediate family and friends may not be able to assist them given their own financial situation. This study shows that Black people are more likely to have immediate family, extended family, and friends willing to help them than White people; however, Whites are more likely than Blacks to have acquaintances and other relationships who are willing to help them in the event of a disaster. These results are consistent with other studies that report that Blacks are more likely to have smaller networks than Whites (Ajrouch, Antonucci and Janevic 2001), but overall are more likely to keep in close contact with their relatives (Ajrouch, Antonucci and Janevic 2001, Cantor, Brennan and Sainz 1994, Johnson and Barer 1990. Males overall are more likely to have immediate family, extended family, friends, and acquaintances who are willing to assist them during a disaster than females, consistent with findings that report that males are more likely to have larger social networks (Benenson 1990). This is important because women prefer dyadic relationships (Benenson 1990), and exclude others during competitions when they feel threatened (Benenson 2011), which ultimately lowers their resilience. The results of this study also show that those who have experienced a disaster have a higher rate of having disaster social capital with all relationships and assistance types. Those that have experienced a disaster were also more confident in answering social capital and network questions. In addition, counties where drug rehabilitation locations were sampled, social capital and social networks increased, as well as survey response confidence. When analyzed together, this suggests that those that have experienced dire situations are more likely to have a better understanding of the social capital and resources available to them. Further analysis of social networks suggests that those that live in larger cities, especially New Orleans, are more likely to have relationships within close-proximity. Social network analysis also revealed that those currently residing in drug rehabilitation centers have little to no social capital within their communities. The situation is particularly true of the women located at Mission of Hope in Mount Vernon, a small remote town in Alabama. Although strong social capital and networks are critical to disaster resilience, only a small portion has local social capital, and 1 in 4 homeless persons have no social 76 capital. The homeless tend to stay physically close to their family members, or often move to a close larger metropolitan area where there tend to be more available social services. Shelter personnel views of homeless disaster social capital is varied; however, they do feel that if the homeless do have disaster social capital, it is only for emotional assistance. Disaster social capital of the homeless varies upon: financial assistance from friends and acquaintances; technology assistance from friends and acquaintances; assistance from friends and acquaintances that reside out-of-state; and food/shelter and evacuation assistance from friends. Disaster social capital resilience is highest in Alabama, followed by Louisiana and Mississippi. Alabama is rated the highest because they have the highest average amount of acquaintances willing to assist them financially and with technology. Louisiana is rated the second highest because they have the highest average amount of friends willing to assist them from out-of-state, which is the most significant variable in predicting resilience. Mississippi's mean values for each of these variables are normally less than half that of Alabama and Louisiana, resulting in Mississippi being the least resilient among the three states."}, {"section_title": "Homeless Physical Capital and Networks", "text": "Physical capital is fundamental to disaster resilience. Unfortunately, a small portion of the homeless population has enough money to evacuate, own an automobile, or have access to public transportation which increases their vulnerability. While the homeless generally have access to technologies that provide disaster information, majority of the time these technologies are part of the shelter rather than being with the individuals to be able to provide access to any information if a disaster occurs during day time. Thus, the lack of access to technologies makes the homeless overall more vulnerable to future disasters. Mississippi. No significant differences were found with these categories in Alabama, as Alabama's is more resilient than Mississippi, but less resilient than Louisiana. The homeless are also more likely to have access to a cell phone and use public transportation in Louisiana than Alabama, and no significant differences with Mississippi; however, Alabama participants did state that public transportation is much more widely available \"in the city.\" This may explain why homeless individuals are more likely to have automobiles in Alabama than Mississippi. These results show how much less resilient the homeless in Mississippi are when compared to other coastal states. The most prevalent source of disaster information the homeless receive is through television, followed by family and/or friends, radio, shelter personnel, internet, text messages, telephone, social media, face-to-face visits from police officers or fire fighters, weather radio, cell phone companies, sirens, emergency management, and posters. The Additionally, across the entire study area, only 61.9 percent of the homeless population's locations are less-than or equal-to one kilometer away, or 11.1-minute walk for the average person, from receiving emergency assistance (Daamen and Hoogendoorn 2003). However, it would take an average person 5.6 minutes to walk to assistance in Alabama is ranked second highest because it scores higher in ethnicity, and has individuals that are more likely to be homeless for the first time, have been homeless fewer times overall, and are more likely to have acquaintances willing to assist them that reside out-of-state, have automobile access, and receive disaster information through text messages and cell phone companies. Alabama probably ranks higher with regard to social capital because the shelters interviewed in Alabama were both drug rehabilitation centers; so, the participants probably have a better support system and are more likely to be temporarily homeless than those interviewed in Louisiana and Mississippi, most of which were not from a rehabilitation facility. Mississippi ranked the lowest in nearly every category, and the homeless there are more likely to be chronically homeless and lack in social and physical capital than both of the other states. Physical capital has the most effect on predicting the disaster resilience of the homeless, followed by their socioeconomic characteristics and social capital. In order to increase the resilience of the homeless, more evacuation programs should be implemented, following New Orleans's Evacuspot program; however, additional locations should be placed in more rural areas and the homeless should be informed of where all these pickup points are located and the pickup schedule. In addition, the government should provide cell phones for the homeless in order to notify the homeless about disasters through push notifications. This will also allow the homeless to call and request a pickup if they are physically unable to reach the pickup locations themselves. Social workers and medical professions should also be more involved in assisting the homeless to evacuate, as shelter personnel believe that homeless individuals have health issues that would make it difficult to evacuate and homeless individuals tend to trust health professionals."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "If this survey is implemented in the future, a larger sample size should be used, and the surveys should be taken through a computer in order to more accurately assess the social capital of homeless individuals without overwhelming them. The current survey tool has five possible locations for homeless individual's social capital that can be used for each relationship type in order to not overwhelm the participant; however, if a participant has more than five relationships that will help them during a disaster, they were not included. If a survey program was used, it would allow for individuals to state the number of relationships they have in each location and would only add additional social capital assistance locations when the previous question was answered. It would also be helpful to include a checklist of other locations where the homeless could identify where they have received additional assistance. Lastly, questions regarding the health and financial status of homeless individuals would be very informative in understanding evacuation needs. This research will contribute to the field of geography, especially hazards research. This research is of utmost importance to the underserved population of the homeless community. Research has been conducted extensively on populations affected by disasters, but little has been conducted on the homeless, and even less on the socioeconomic and physical conditions that contribute to their disaster resilience. It will also create a new model for analyzing the resilience of the homeless and other special-needs groups through GIS to disasters. Information discovered in this research can potentially help lower the death rate of the homeless when a disaster occurs. The research findings will be crucial for governing officials, homeless shelter personnel, and other community organizations to create policies that are in the best interests of the homeless community. This research will also allow for a marginalized group's voice to be heard and potentially help create bottom-up policy to better support their needs.
