[{"section_title": "", "text": "On August 28, 2012 it was discovered that the USDA ERS had issued a revised 2011 annual milk cost and return estimate. The revision was due to a discovery of an error in the purchased feed cost estimates. As a result, the 2011 milk COP estimate was revised down to $32.61/cwt for Vermont and $37.45/cwt for Maine. This report has also been updated to reflect the corrected USDA ERS 2011 annual milk cost and return estimates. The quarter 2 total cost of production in Vermont is $2.03/cwt lower, on average than the previously released estimates. The Maine cost of production is $4.09/cwt lower, on average. This results in a smaller sustainable cost shortfall than previously published. "}, {"section_title": "Milk Cost of Production", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "This report is a follow up on previous reports for 2011 quarters two, three, and four and 2012 quarter one that use the current USDA methodology and continues the Vermont and Maine milk COP estimates previously calculated by the USDA's ERS. $37.45/cwt. Following the USDA methodology, we estimate the monthly COP for quarter two of 2012 for both states."}, {"section_title": "II. Monthly Milk Cost of Production and Price for Quarter 2, 2012", "text": "The estimates for the April, May, and June 2012 milk COP for Vermont and Maine are shown in Table 1. Total operating costs in Vermont for April, May, and June 2012 are $21.37, $22.17, and $22.16/cwt., respectively, with an average for the quarter of $21.90. The quarter two average operating cost in Vermont represents an increase of $1.34/cwt from the quarter one average of $20.55. The major component of the total operating cost is the total feed costs that increased on average $1.39/cwt from quarter one to quarter two. In quarter two total feed costs are $16.57, $17.43, and $17.46/cwt. for April, May, and June, respectively. With the exception of the feed cost categories, there is very little variation within cost categories from month to month. Including total allocated overhead, the total milk COP in Vermont is estimated at $33.71 for April, $34.55 for May, and $34.62/cwt. for June, with an average total COP for quarter two estimated at $34.30/cwt, $1.33/cwt higher than the quarter one estimate. The total milk COP in Maine is estimated at $38.67 for April, $40.81 for May, and $39.50/cwt. for June, with an average at $39.66/cwt for quarter two. This represents an increase in the Maine COP of $1.03/cwt. from quarter one to quarter two. Public Act 09-229 specifies the minimum sustainable monthly COP as 82% of the monthly average cost of production. In Table 2, 82% of the Vermont milk COP is $27.65 for April, $28.33 for May, and $28.39/cwt for June. This yields an average minimum sustainable COP for Vermont of $28.12/cwt for quarter two, 2012, an increase of $1.09/cwt. from quarter one. Farm milk prices in Vermont, Maine and elsewhere in the United States, have been sagging since August 2011 and the downward price trend continues while COP continues to increase at historically high levels. Table 2 also shows the statistical uniform prices (i.e., the blend price) for Hartford, CT for the second quarter of 2012. These are $17.10 for April, $16.69 for May, and $16.48/cwt for June. The average statistical uniform price for quarter two is $16.76/cwt, $1.51/cwt lower than the quarter one average. The prices farmers are receiving for their raw milk are all significantly lower than the minimum sustainable monthly COP calculated Using Maine's COPs, the minimum sustainable COP are $31.71 for April, $33.46 for May, and $32.39/cwt for June, with an average of $32.52/cwt. for quarter two, an increase of $0.84/cwt. from quarter one. using Vermont or Maine data. Using Vermont estimates, the minimum sustainable milk COP exceeded the Hartford-based farm price by $10.55 in April, $11.64 in May, and $11.91/cwt in June. This represents an average statistical uniform price that is $13.03/cwt below the minimum sustainable monthly COP estimate for Vermont. 1/ Estimates may be adjusted based on revisions in monthly agricultural price indices and milk production estimates as provided by the USDA.
