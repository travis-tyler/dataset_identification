In 1993-94, fulltime public school teachers' average base salary was $34,200 (table A6.4).

Less than onehalf (46 percent) of teachers, however, reported that their principals frequently talked with them about their instructional practices. a In public schools, teachers in larger districts, larger schools, and schools with higher proportions of low-income students were less likely than teachers in other schools to report that necessary materials were available (table 7.3). 0 Based on a number of measures of teacher satisfaction, teachers were more satisfied with their work in 1993-94 than they had been in 1987-88.

Although at present the issue of teacher quality is being discussed less in terms of teacher talent and more in terms of the need to enhance all teachers' skills, policymakers and educators are once again turning their attention to the issue of teachers' qualifications. Third, the proportion of teachers who are of minority backgrounds has declined as the proportion of students who are of minority backgrounds has increased (Adair 1984;Graham 1987;King 1993;Stewart, Meier, LaFollette, and England 1989), and the gap between the proportions of minority teachers and students has widened as the proportion of minority students increased between the late 1980s and early 1990s (Henke, Choy, Geis, and Broughman 1996). Combined, these three issuesthe potential for a general teacher shortage, desires for more minority teachers, and concerns about teacher qualityhave prompted many to call for new strategies to recruit talented college graduates, particularly of minority racialethnic backgrounds, into the teaching force to ensure that the quality of instruction does not decline as administrators struggle to staff classrooms (Evans 1996;NCTAF 1996). EquityBeyond general concerns of teacher quality, many have also raised concerns about equity with respect to the quality of instruction. Some schools clearly face more problems than others (for example, higher proportions of students who have limited proficiency in English or who live in poverty, family/social problems, crime/violence in school). To meet the challenges in these schools 9 teachers must be at least as qualified as their peers in other schools. However, recent reports suggest that teachers in these schools are often not as qualified as those in affluent or suburban schools (Ingersoll and Gruber 1996;NCTAF 1996). Such claims raise the question of whether schools with especially challenging student populations will be more likely than others to hire less well-qualified teachers should a teacher shortage occur. Undergraduate preparationThe content of collegiate teacher preparation programs, which was raised as a serious problem in the 1980s, continues to be seen as insufficiently rigorous. Researchers and educators contend that college students who are preparing to teach spend too much time in education courses with little academic content and not enough time in demanding liberal arts and science courses (Association of Teacher Educators 1996;Carnegie Forum 1986;Holmes Group 1986;NCTAF 1996). Many regard this situation as particularly serious for secondary specialist teachers in mathematics and the sciences. Early years in the professionIn some professions, such as medicine or law, graduate-level professional training is supplemented by extended internships or apprenticeships that allow novice practitioners to work under the supervision of experts. In contrast, new teachers have traditionally been expected to fulfill the same responsibilities as teachers with many years of experience without the support or guidance of expert practitioners. Moreover, some reports indicate that because new teachers have no seniority they often receive the most challenging teaching assignments, exacerbating the stress of the already difficult first years of teaching. Given the complexity of teaching, a number of reform reports call the wisdom of these policies into question and propose that new teachers begin their careers with internships or residencies of one or two years' duration in which they receive the support of a mentor teacher and perhaps receive a reduced teaching load (Carnegie Forum 1986;Darling-Hammond 1995;Hall 1995;Holmes Group 1986). Career pathsThere was a flip side to treating novice teachers like experts, however. Because expert teachers were not distinguished from their less experienced or less proficient peers, the occupational structure of teaching offered little reward in status or responsibility for expert teachers. When this was first observed, it was discussed as an impediment to retaining expert teachers in the profession. Because they received little recognition for high-quality performance in terms of either financial reward or organizational status, talented teachers had little incentive to remain in the profession (Carnegie Forum 1986;Holmes Group 1986). More recently, as teacher professional development has received greater attention among policymakers, expert teachers are being seen as untapped resources available for enhancing the performance of their less experienced or less effective colleagues (Hart 1994;Maier' 1987). Professional growthTraditional \"staff development\" programs in which teachers attend a workshop for a few hours or a day and are then expected to return to their classrooms to implement a new teaching strategy appear to effect little long-term change in teachers' practice (Little 1993). Researchers believe these staff development programs are unlikely to be effective for a number of reasons: they tend to focus on changing the practice of individual teachers rather than building the capacity of a school's entire faculty; they tend to take a passive rather than active approach to training teachers; they rarely provide teachers with opportunities to try new strategies in their own classrooms along with ongoing feedback from experts; and they rarely provide teachers with enough time away from students to learn new theories or teaching strategies (Corcoran 1995). CompensationTeaching is widely recognized as paying less, especially to its most experienced practitioners, than other occupations that require a college degree. Unlike the compensation patterns of college graduates in other occupations, teachers' pay scales are relatively flat: the ratio of novice to experienced teachers' salaries is relatively high. Again, reformers noted that teachers have relatively little incentive to remain in the profession over the long term when they can earn higher incomes in other occupations (Carnegie Forum 1986;Holmes Group 1986;Rumberger 1987). Because the issues are important to the future of the nation and so many resources are being invested to address them, both these organizations and the general public need information regarding the state of teaching during these times of reform. To address this need, this book assembles data from several national studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and other sources to provide information relevant to these crucial issues concerning teachers and their work. The remainder of this chapter briefly describes these data sets and how this report is organized."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Although a number of NCES data sets can inform policymakers, educators, and the general public as they consider policy alternatives related to teachers and teaching in elementary and secondary schools, the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) provide the most significant source of nationallevel data on teachers and teaching. This report draws heavily on these two data sets. Three other NCES studies, all of which were conducted at some point during 1993-94, were analyzed for this report: the 1994 followup of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94), the 1994 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP:94), and the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). Each of these studies includes information collected from a different segment of the population and therefore offers a slightly different perspective on the state of teaching in the early 1990s. Although each study is briefly described below, details regarding the methodology of each can be found in the technical appendix. The 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey  provides most of the data reported in this publication. SASS:93-94 is the third administration of the survey, a coordinated set of questionnaires that collect data from schools, principals, teachers, and school districts regarding school and district enrollments, programs, and staffing policies; teacher supply and demand; principals' and teachers' demographic characteristics, education, and professional qualifications; and teachers' workloads and working conditions. SASS'S sample design allows estimations to be made not only by state but also by private school affiliation. Combined with SASS:93-94, the 1994-95 Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS:94-95) supplements teacher supply and demand information as well as provides for the first time detailed, national-level estimates of teachers' instructional practices at all grade levels and in all subject areas. The TFS is a one-year follow-up of all teachers who were sampled in the previous SASS who left the teaching profession, all who moved, and a subsample of those who continued to teach in their 1993-94 schools. In , the TFS included an extensive set of questions regarding the frequency with which teachers used a wide variety of instructional practices."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94) provides information regarding new college graduates' early forays into teacher preparation and teaching. This longitudinal study follows the undergraduate class of 1992-93: the 1994 data collection is the first in a series of follow-up data collections designed to provide information about the career choices, entry, and paths of college graduates. Unlike most of the data presented in this book, because respondents were sampled from all college graduates, these data permit comparisons between teachers and nonteaching college graduates in the U.S. Because the 1994 interview was conducted so soon after graduates had completed their degrees, it provides an incomplete picture of the individuals in this college class who will become teachers, but is most informative regarding the undergraduate academic achievement of those who prepared to teach as undergraduates or who taught in the year following graduation. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP:94) was primarily an assessment of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade students' achievement in reading, U.S. history, and geography but also included a survey of the teachers of sampled students in each of these subjects. For the purposes of this publication, the reading teacher data were used to examine the instructional practices of fourth-grade reading teachers in light of their teaching experience, the instructional support their schools provided, and the professional development they received. The 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93) collected data from faculty in public and private postsecondary institutions, including both lessthan-4-year institutions and 4-year colleges and universities. These data supply information regarding the characteristics and work lives of postsecondary faculty who instruct potential elementary and secondary school teachers as undergraduate and graduate students. This report also includes previously published data from the Common Core of Data (CCD), the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), and the 1995 and 1996 editions of Education at a Glance, a publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). CCD is an annual data collection of state and local education agencies administered by NCES. NALS, conducted by NCES in 1992, measured the verbal and quantitative literacy of U.S. adults aged 16 and older. With financial and material assistance from NCES and agencies of other member states, the OECD Directorate for Education, Employment, Labour, and Social Affairs gathers data from OECD member countries on elementary and secondary education, among other topics. These data can be used to make international comparisons on education institutions and staff as well as students."}, {"section_title": "Organization of This Report", "text": "Data from these sources have been gathered and analyzed to address the issues discussed above. These discussions are organized within the remaining eight chapters of this report as follows: Chapter 2 describes teachers' demographic characteristics and the contexts within which teachers work: the students whom they teach and the schools within which that instruction occurs. It includes information regarding teachers' gender, age, racialethnic backgrounds; their students' racialethnic backgrounds, economic status, and proficiency in English; and teachers' perceptions of the problems they and their students face as they attempt to teach and learn. Chapter 3 discusses a wide variety of indicators of teachers' qualifications to teach. Although some aspects of teachers' qualifications cannot easily be captured with quantitative data, the chapter examines teachers' professional qualifications from a variety of perspectives. This chapter pays particular attention to how teachers with various qualifications are allocated among schools with varying proportions of disadvantaged or minority students. Chapter 4 answers basic questions about teachers' work, such as how many hours they work at school and how many hours they spend on school-related work outside the school day, what proportions work at various grade levels and in various subject area assignments, how many classes they teach, and how many students they teach per class and per semester. The chapter closes with a discussion of teachers' perceptions of both their control over various aspects of classroom life and their influence over schoolwide policies and decisions. Chapter 5 presents information regarding the strategies teachers use as they instruct students. The chapter surveys five dimensions of classroom instructiongrouping practices, the use of various educational technologies, the degree to which teachers ask their students to do tasks of varying cognitive complexity both in the classroom and at home, and the degree to which teachers use portfolios to assess their students' learningamong teachers ranging from kindergarten through the 12th grade and across subject areas. The chapter then turns to a closer examination of reading instruction in the fourth grade. Chapter 6 addresses the issue of teachers' compensation from a number of perspectives. It discusses public school district and private school schedules for teacher salaries, teachers' base salaries and trends in teacher salaries, the proportion of teachers who earn supplemental income of various types and the amount of such income they earn, and the benefits they receive. To put teachers' compensation levels in some context, the chapter also presents data comparing teachers' salaries to those of other professionals, taking into account educational achievement, and also compares U.S. teachers' salaries to those of teachers in other countries. Chapter 7 discusses teachers' perceptions of their working environments and satisfaction with their work. It includes teachers' reports regarding the support they received from administrators and colleagues in their schools, their satisfaction with their salaries, and the degree to which they would be willing to reenter the profession if they could make the choice to teach all over again. As in Chapter 6, this chapter also attempts to present these data in some context by comparing teachers' satisfaction with their teaching jobs to the satisfaction of former teachers with their nonteaching occupations. Chapter 8 addresses the issue of teacher supply and demand by presenting information regarding the supply of teachers as well as teacher turnover and attrition from the profession and by examining a number of indicators of teacher shortage. The chapter includes a discussion of why teachers move between schools and why they choose to leave teaching altogether. Chapter 9 concludes the report."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2 TEACHERS AND THEIR WORKPLACE", "text": "To provide a context for later discussions of issues regarding teachers and their work, this chapter describes important characteristics of the teaching work force and their workplace. The chapter begins with a description of the size of the work force and teachers' basic demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and race ethnicity.

Schools differ widely in terms of the quality of the workplace they provide for their teachers, and those that are able to provide a stimulating, safe, and pleasant working environment are in the best position to attract, retain, and motivate teachers and to provide students with a supportive learning environment. The data on the school workplace presented in this chapter provide only a partial view of teachers' overall work environment. Other important aspects of their working conditions, such as workload, work schedules, control and autonomy in decision making, compensation, and teachers' perceptions of their workplace are discussed in chapter 4 (Teachers at Work), chapter 6 (Compensation), and chapter 7 (Teachers' Perceptions of Their Work Environments and Job Satisfaction)."}, {"section_title": "Number of Teachers", "text": "In the fall of 1996, there were about 3.1 million full-timeequivalent (FTE) teachers in the nation's schools, about 2.7 million of them in public schools and another 390,000 in private schools (table A2.1).

The proportion of female teachers, for example, might serve as an indicator of alternative opportunities for women in the labor force, which, in turn, may affect the ability of the teaching profession to attract talented women over time. Similarly, the racialethnic diversity of the teaching work force can serve as a measure of progress toward the frequently articulated goal of increasing the number of minority teachers. Finally, the age distribution of the teaching force can provide a basis for projecting the number of teachers who will retire at various points in the future."}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "Teaching has traditionally been a female-dominated profession and continues to be so. In 1993-94, 73 percent of public school teachers and 75 percent of private school teachers were female (tables 2.1 and A2.6). However, the degree to which teaching is female-dominated varies substantially by teaching assignment. For example, among public school teachers in 1993-94, the vast majority of teachers with kindergarten or general elementary, English, special education, and bilingual/ESL assignments were female. Moreover, the predominance of female teachers is not limited to the United States. In 1994, the percentage of primary-level teachers who were female ranged from 27 percent to 83 percent in 19 countries (mostly European), with an average across countries of 65 percent (table A2.7). Although some educators believe that increasing the number of male teachers, particularly at the elementary level, would provide important role models for children (Hill 1996), data presented in chapter 4 indicate that the proportion of men and women who chose to teach kindergarten and general elementary classes has not changed since the late 1980s. 3 years older than in 1987-88 (table 2.2).

However, beginning teachers in 1993-94 (those who had taught 3 years or less) were more likely than teachers with 10 or more years of experience to be minority. Most noticeable is the larger representation of Hispanic teachers among beginning teachers than among more experienced teachers. The pattern for black, non-Hispanic teachers was the reverse, however: black, non-Hispanic teachers were better represented among teachers with 20 or more years of experience than among those with less experience. The proportion of minority teachers lags far behind that of minority students. For example, 16 percent of all public school students were black, non-Hispanic in 1993-94, but only 9 percent of their teachers were black, non-Hispanic (figure 2.4 and table A2.13). About three times as many students as teachers were Hispanic (12 percent versus 4 percent). 4 See table A2.13 for the percentage distribution of both students and teachers according to race-ethnicity for selected school characteristics and tables A2.14 and A2.15 for the same information for public schools by state and private schools by affiliation. The proportions of teachers who were Hispanic and black, non-Hispanic as reported in table 2.3 differs from those reported in figure 2.4 because the estimates in table 2.3 were computed from the SASS Teacher Questionnaire and those reported in figure 2.4 were computed from the SASS School Questionnaire.  If an important goal is to have all students exposed to minority teachers, it is necessary to monitor where minority teachers work. In public schools, minority teachers are heavily concentrated in schools where more than one-half of the students belong to minority groups. Approximately two-thirds of minority teachers worked in such schools in 1993-94 (tables 2.4 and A2.16). While this pattern may be beneficial for minority students, it also reduces the exposure of students in schools with low minority enrollments to minority teachers. Schools with a minority enrollment of 10 percent or less had almost no minority teachers (only 1 or 2 percent) in 1993-94 (tables 2.5 and A2.13)."}, {"section_title": "Teachers Among New College Graduates", "text": "The Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) data provide an opportunity to compare the demographic characteristics of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had taught by 1994 with the characteristics of other graduates.

Teachers and nonteachers were about equally likely to be black, non-Hispanic, but teachers were more likely than nonteachers to be white, non-Hispanic and, conversely, nonteachers were more likely than teachers to belong to an \"other\" minority group (that is, to be Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian /Alaskan Native)."}, {"section_title": "School Characteristics", "text": "The school is the teacher's workplace, and there is tremendous variety in that workplace. In many of the discussions of teachers and teaching that follow later, important differences by sector, community type, level, and size are noted.

Today's teachers are working with a diverse student population: the vast majority of schools have at least some racial-ethnic minority students, and central city schools are especially likely to have large minority enrollments. However, the teaching force continues to be primarily female and white, non-Hispanic. The proportion of minority teachers lags far behind the proportion of minority students, and in the public sector, minority teachers are heavily concentrated in schools where more than one-half of the students belong to a minority group. More than one-third of all teachers have students with limited English proficiency in their classes, but only about one-quarter of the teachers with these students have received training in teaching them. Teachers' responses to questions on safety in their schools and their perceptions of the seriousness of various problems related to students and their parents show wide variation in school climate. These types of problems can seriously interfere with both teaching and learning. Problems consistently appear more serious in public than private schools. Within the public sector, they are generally more serious at the secondary than elementary level and in central cities than in other community types. Furthermore, they tend to increase with the percentage of low-income students.\nTeaching is a multifaceted occupation requiring a variety of skills. On a daily basis teachers may work with many students and with multiple subjects as they Several general strategies for improving instruction have been recommended by both subject matter specialists and researchers who study learning processes more generally, and two NCES data sets permit study of teachers' use of these and other instructional strategies. The Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) was administered to teachers who worked in teaching situations that varied widely in terms of the grade level, subject area, and type of students taught. Therefore, survey items measuring teachers' instructional practices were designed to be detailed enough to provide useful information yet not so detailed as to be applicable to only small subsets of teachers. In contrast, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Teacher Questionnaires were administered only to teachers in selected fields, and therefore could ask more specific questions about instruction in those fields. \nTeachers' use of various instructional practices varied not only with their subject areas but also with the degree to which they had participated in relevant professional development programs. However, the SASS data do not indicate whether the particular professional development programs in which teachers participat-ed were mandatory or voluntary. Therefore, one cannot conclude that attending professional development is the cause of the differences observed between the practices used by teachers who attended and teachers who did not. It may be, for example, that teachers who voluntarily attended professional development on assessment strategies were already more inclined than other teachers to use portfolios or other alternative assessments. Thus the effectiveness of professional development programs in helping teachers alter their teaching practices remains to be researched by others.\nThe SASS and TFS data indicate that teachers' perceptions of their working conditions and their satisfaction with a number of aspects oftheir work have improved since the late 1980s. Both public and private school teachers were slightly more likely in 1993-94 than in 1987-88 to report that they were satisfied with their salaries. In addition, 1993-94 teachers who were still teaching in 1994-95 were more likely than their counterparts six years earlier to report that they were satisfied with the intellectual challenge of their work and the opportunity for advancement it afforded. The data presented in this chapter also contribute to the empirical evidence linking teachers' working conditions and their longevity in the profession. Teachers' perceptions of their working conditions were, in fact, related to their plans to remain in teaching. As part of its discussion of teacher supply and demand, the next chapter pursues this issue by exploring the relationship between teachers' plans to remain in teaching and their longevity in the profession.\nIs the supply of teachers in the U.S. adequate to the demand? The SASS:93-94 data examined in this chapter do not indicate national shortages of teachers in general or within specific teaching fields. However, teacher supply and demand is a complex issue and this chapter by no means exhausts the analyses that could provide relevant information. Widespread out-of-field teaching, for example, could indicate that administrators are having difficulty filling classrooms with qualified teachers in specific fields. As discussed in chapter 3, 91 percent of public school teachers whose main assignments were in academic subject areas were fully certified to teach those fields, with the remainder about evenly divided between those had no certification to teach in their main assignment fields and those who had some lesser form of certification. However, only 57 percent of public school teachers whose other assignment fields were in academic subject areas were fully certified to teach those fields, and 40 percent had no certification to teach in their other assignment field. Thus using certification alone, regardless of the match between teachers' fields of undergraduate and graduate study, a substantial portion of teachers did some amount of out-of-field teaching.  However, these data do indicate that schools serving larger proportions of low-income students experienced somewhat greater difficulty finding qualified teachers to fill vacancies. Few districts used pay incentives to attract teachers to fields or locations of shortages, but districts with relatively more low-income students were more likely to do so than districts with fewer such stu-dents. Moreover, public schools with larger proportions of low-income students were more likely to report both that they had hired a less than fully qualified teacher and that they had used long-term substitutes to fill teaching vacancies. Finally, public school teachers in schools with higher proportions of low-income students were less likely than their peers in more affluent schools to be fully certified to teach in their main assignment fields. As enrollments increase in the coming decade, some policymakers fear that schools will find it increasingly difficult to hire fully qualified teachers to fill teaching vacancies as they arise.

It is important to keep in mind that the data presented in this chapter provide only a partial picture of teachers' education and qualifications. Much of the debate regarding teacher education programs has centered not simply on the numbers and types of courses taken, but on their content, which is not addressed by any of the national data sets. Similarly, there is nothing in these data that measures the ability of teachers to work effectively with students. State certification provides no guarantee that teachers can inspire their students or communicate complex concepts, for example."}, {"section_title": "initial Preparation of Teachers", "text": "The first formal step toward becoming a teacher has traditionally been an undergraduate degree in education, although some states require an additional year of postbaccalaureate study before certification. While it is generally accepted that teachers need a basic college education, a thorough grounding in the subjects they plan to teach, and training in teaching skills, beliefs about when and how this should happen and the relative emphasis on each aspect of teacher education have been shifting. A debate over the past decade has considered whether teachers should be allowed to major in education as undergraduates or should be required to major in a subject area and obtain their teacher training in graduate programs. Both the Carnegie Forum and Holmes Group reports recommended that prospective teachers use their undergraduate years to learn about the subjects they will teach and delay their professional education until graduate school."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Majors", "text": "The majority of today's teachers majored in education as undergraduates.

The rest majored in a particular subject area or the teaching of it (for example, mathematics or mathematics education  table 3.12, below). Among the newest teachers, there does appear to be some movement away from majoring in general education. For example, in 1993-94, public school teachers with 0-3 years of experience were less likely than those with more experience to have majored in general education as undergraduates (table 3.1). Among private school teachers, a similar proportion of those with 0-3 years of experience majored in general education, and the trend away from majoring in education also extended to those with 4-9 years of experience. This trend is also evident when one compares the majors of beginning teachers in 1987-88 and 1993-94.

Analyses of earlier SASS data found that many teachers were assigned to classes in fields that did not match their educational backgrounds (see Bobbitt and McMillen (1995), Ingersoll and Gruber (1996), and Ingersoll and Han (1995)). Although some teachers may choose not to teach the subject in which they are most knowledgeable, it is probably fair to say that most incongruence between assignment and preparation is related to mismatches between supply and demand. Sometimes schools have difficulty filling vacancies and principals are forced to choose between hiring or assigning a less than fully qualified teacher or canceling the course altogether. In 1993-94, 8 percent of schools with teaching vacancies covered at least one of those vacancies by hiring a less than fully qualified teacher (Henke, Choy, Geis, and Broughman 1996). Also, as Ingersoll and Han (1995) point out, some degree of mismatch is attributable to the fact that school administrators charged with staffing programs in a range of required and elective subjects have to work with the teachers who are already on staff. The percentages of teachers with undergraduate majors or minors (or neither) in their main and other teaching assignments and the percentage with graduate degrees in these fields provide an overview of teacher qualifications (table A3.2).

In English, foreign languages, and mathematics, private school teachers who taught these subjects were more likely than public school teachers to have neither majored nor minored in them (figure 3.2).

At the secondary level, the educational levels of public and private school teachers were more comparable. Teachers have a strong financial incentive to continue their education, since the structure of the typical salary schedule rewards those who have accumulated additional education credits (see chapter 6).

Nevertheless, across states certification status indicates the degree to which teachers meet the minimum teaching standards and qualifications set by their state. Because of this wide variation in certification among states, it is not surprising that national data indicate not all teachers who taught in elementary and secondary schools were fully certified in the field they taught most often. It is also something of a challenge to determine the degree to which the incidence of teaching without full certification is a problem. In 1993-94, approximately 4 percent of teachers who taught in public elementary or secondary schools were not certified at all in the subject area they taught most often (the main assignment field). Others had some, but not full, certification in the main assignment field: about 2 percent held probationary certification (they had completed all the requirements except for the completion of a probationary teaching period); about 4 percent held provisional or temporary certification (they still had requirements for certification to meet); and less than 1 percent held emergency certification (they still had to complete a certification program) (figure 3.4).8 Moreover, teachers' certification status varied greatly between the main assignment field and the field they taught next most frequently (the other assignment field). Teachers were more likely to be certified in the main assignment field than in the other assignment field (figure 3.5 and tables A3.14a-b). &Table A3.13 presents the proportions of public school teachers with various types of certification in their main assignment fields by state. Variation among states is largely attributable to the types of certification offered in each state as well as varying supply and demand for teachers across states. Primarily because private schools are not bound by state regulations for teacher licensure, public school teachers are more likely than private school teachers to be certified in both their main and other assignment fields. Among public school teachers, 91 percent reported that they had advanced, regular, or alternative certification in the main field.

Among teachers with main assignments in an academic field (English, foreign languages, mathematics, science, or social studies), 56 percent had either an undergraduate major or graduate degree and a license in their main field, and another 8 percent had an undergraduate minor and a license in this field (table   3.11).9 For the remaining teachers in these subject areas, the fields they studied as undergraduates or graduate students, the field in which they were licensed, and the field they taught most in school were not congruent. Teachers in public schools with larger proportions of disadvantaged or minority students were less likely than teachers in other schools to have both a license to teach and a degree in their main assignment field. As the proportion of low-income students in their schools increased, the proportion of public school teachers who had both a degree and an advanced, regular, or alternative certificate in their main assignment field decreased (table A3.15a).

Another 45 percent taught departmentalized classes, that is, taught one or two subjects to different groups of students throughout the day. The self-contained classroom organization is common among elementary school teachers, but is not the exclusive mode in which they work. For example, although 62 percent of public school elementary teachers taught such classes, 9 percent team taught, that is, co-taught a class of students for all or most of the day in multiple subjects (figure 4.1). Another 11 percent of public elementary level teachers taught enrichment classes, which means they worked with elementary classes who were otherwise in a selfcontained classroom in order to supplement their learning in particular subject area (e.g., art, music, or physical education). Finally, 11 percent taught pull-out classes, in which individual students are removed from several self-contained classrooms and work with another teacher for part of the day.

Furthermore, the workload of secondary departmentalized teachers was associated with the size of their schools: teachers in larger schools taught more students and fewer subjects overall than did teachers in smaller schools. 2To compare this intensity of work to that of other professions, the number of hours worked by 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were teachers in April 1994 was compared with the number of hours worked by their peers who had other occupations. Bachelor's degree recipients who were full-time teachers in April 1994 worked about 44 hours per week on average, slightly more than those in administrative support positions (42 hours), and slightly less than those in managerial positions (46 hours), but no more or less than professionals, sales or service workers, or those in other jobs (    Primary level teachers' teaching time ranged between 624 and 1,085 hours per year, for an average of 829 hours per year. The United States was among the six countries in which teachers worked at least 10 percent more than the average. Finally, teachers' workload included paperwork not directly related to instruction. Case studies of teachers' work provide anecdotal evidence that noninstructional duties such as keeping attendance records or collecting lunch money absorb much of teachers' time that might be better spent in instruction (Johnson 1990;Kidder 1990). Consistent with this evidence, in 1993-94 nearly one in two public school teachers and about one in three private school teachers reported that routine paperwork duties interfered with their teaching responsibilities (table A4.11)."}, {"section_title": "Class Size", "text": "Class size is an important aspect of school organization for students, teachers, and policymakers. Although small classes may enhance student achievement and teacher satisfaction, providing small classes for all students is an expensive undertaking. Recent research suggests that students in the lower grades, at least, benefit from smaller classes (e.g., 15 or fewer students) in terms of reading and mathematics achievement, and that these benefits may persist as students progress into the upper grades (Achilles 1996;Blatchford and Mortimore 1994;Mosteller, Light, and Sachs 1996;Slavin 1990). Other researchers have found that the benefits of smaller classes accrue, in particular, to elementary school students who come from racialethnic minority backgrounds (Bingham 1994), students with lower academic ability when they enter the class (Goettler-Sopko 1990), and students in inner cities (Finn, Achilles, Bain, and Folger 1990). Students may 78 benefit from smaller classes because teachers can be more flexible about their instructional practices, give more attention to individual students, and diagnose their students' needs more accurately (Hiestand 1994). In   Given research showing that minority students particularly benefit from smaller classes, it is important to note that as the percentage of minority students in a public school increased, so did teachers' class size. This may be an artifact of minority students' concentration in central city and urban fringe areas, however (see table BEST COPY AVAILABLE tightened their control over schoolwide policies and classroom practices, including graduation requirements, curriculum content (such as textbooks used), standards for student achievement, and prescribed teaching methodologies (Medrich, Brown, Henke, Ross, and McArthur 1992;Rowan 1990). Some of the calls for reform of the mid 1980s noted that teachers had little control over school-level policies that had important implications for their professional lives, such as the school schedule or class size (Goodlad 1984;Holmes Group 1986). School restructuring and site-based management reforms have been recommended, in part, to give teachers and principals more control over many aspects of their schools (Firestone and Pennell 1993;Shedd and Bachrach 1991), and states and districts have devolved authority to school sites in varying degrees and over varying aspects of school management. Among the decision-making powers that have been granted to some schools are budgeting choices, including staff allocation; faculty hiring; scheduling; and curricula (Weiss 1993). In addition, within schools some principals are turning over more authority regarding these and other administrative matters to faculty and staff (see, for example, Johnson and Pajares, 1996). Furthermore, in the 1990s, parents and teachers seeking to restore their control of the school environment have energized a new movement toward charter schools. In the last 5 to 10 years, researchers have examined the effects of state, district, and school control over policy on the effectiveness of teachers. Some have found that teachers are more committed and satisfied with their work when they can contribute to decision making outside of the classroom and retain autonomy within it (Rowan 1990). Others have found, however, that greater curricular control at the district level was not necessarily associated with greater teacher dissatisfaction (Archbald and Porter 1994). This section addresses this debate by providing data on the extent to which teachers participated in decision making both inside and outside of the classroom. 4 Private school teachers were more likely than public school teachers to feel they had a lot of contkpl over each of the areas except for deciding how much homework to assign, where a large majority of teachers in both sectors (87 percent) felt they had a lot of control. Although elementary level teachers were more likely than secondary level teachers to feel they had a lot of control over discipline in the classroom, in all the other areas secondary teachers were more likely than elementary teachers to feel they had a lot of control over classroom policy. The extent to which public school teachers felt they had control in their classrooms was inversely related to the size of the school district in which they taught. As district size increased, the proportion of teachers who felt they had a lot of control over each of the six areas in the survey fell. In contrast to their perceptions of control within the classroom, teachers were relatively unlikely to report that they had a lot of influence over the following six Private school teachers were more likely than public school teachers to think they had a lot of influence over a number of school policy areas, including setting disciplinary policy, determining the content of inservice 4Teachers were asked to rate on a scale of 0 (\"No control\") to 5 (\"Complete control\") how much influence they felt they had in their classrooms over several areas.

The SASS results indicate that in about one-half of the schools with these boards, teachers who participated did so by volunteering. In about 53 percent of schools, teachers had to be elected to the board, and in one-fourth of schools teachers were picked by the principal."}, {"section_title": "Grouping Practices", "text": "Although the conventional picture of classroom instruction is of one teacher instructing an entire class of students, both individual and small group 1Because the SASS did not ask teachers about professional development related to the other two categories of instructional practices addressed in this reportuse of higher order thinking tasks and types of homework tasksthis chapter does not examine the relationship between professional development and these instructional strategies. instruction have been promoted as effective alternatives for some time (Johnson and Johnson 1994;Slavin 1987Slavin , 1996. For example, when an entire class includes students of widely varying levels of skill in a particular area, teachers may divide the class into smaller groups of students with similar levels of skill. This enables the teacher to focus instruction at the skill level most appropriate to each subgroup of students within the class. In 1994-95, a majority of teachers reported using three grouping strategieswhole group, small group, and individual instructionat least once per week. Consistent with the conventional image of teaching, nearly 100 percent of public and private school teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels reported using whole group instruction (tables 5.1 and A5.1). Their instruction was not limited to whole group activities, however. In both sectors, more than 90 percent of teachers also reported working with individual students at least once a week and at least 80 percent of teachers reported working with small groups of students this often. The TFS also asked teachers about several specific groupwork strategies, including having students work on group projects, either for a group grade or for an individual grade, and having the class as a whole discuss the work that students do in groups. Previous research indicates that teachers are often reluctant to grade students as a group out of concerns for fairness (Brookhart 1993;Stiggins and Conklin 1992), and the TFS data are consistent with these earlier findings: whereas about one-third of teachers had students do group projects for individual grades at least once per week, 18 percent had students do group projects for group grades that often (figure 5.1). Thirty-one percent of teachers reported that they had their students discuss as a class the work they did in small groups.

In particular, those who taught kindergarten or general elementary classes were more likely than most core academic subject (English/language arts, mathematics, science, or social studies) teachers to use small group instruction (table 5.1).2 In addition, as previous research has indicated, teachers in different core academic subjects used these practices at different rates. In public schools, mathematics teachers were more likely than English/language arts or social studies teachers to use small group instruction. Furthermore, public school social studies teachers were less likely than public school teachers in other academic subject areas to use alternatives to whole class instruction: along with the differences noted above, they were also less likely than English/language arts or mathematics teachers to work with individual students.\nPortfolios were more common among general elementary and English teachers than among teachers in other academic fields. In public schools, kindergarten or general elementary and English/language arts teachers were more likely to use portfolios than were teachers in mathematics, science, or social studies (about threequarters of the former versus one-half or less of the latter).

In cooperative learning tasks, students work in small groups to achieve a single goal and they depend on each other to achieve that goal. The goal may involve competition with other groups, producing a product, or completing a project, and often involves division of labor among group members. Group members work independent of the teacher for the most part, and students take responsibility for each others' learning. Learning tasks of this type appear to support goals for higher order thinking among students and to work particularly well with students of minority cultural 2Teachers who taught multiple subjects to the same class over the course of the day, as elementary teachers are likely to do, were instructed to answer the instructional practice items in terms of the whole day. Teachers who taught different classes of students throughout the day were asked to answer the items in terms of their first instructional period of the day. Consequently, teachers whose classes were kindergarten or general elementary are likely to have answered these items in terms of a significantly longer period of time per week than are subject area specialists (five full days as opposed to about five hours in a given week). This difference makes it difficult to interpret differences between kindergarten/general elementary teachers and specific subject area teachers.\nAs with grouping practices, teachers' participation in professional development on technology use was associated with their use of technology For example, teachers who had participated in at least one formal professional development experience on the use of educational technology in the last 2 years were more likely than others to report that they used computers, video equipment, or other electronic technologies; calculators; and computers for writing.\nBoth public and private school teachers who had attended a professional development program on student assessment since the end of the 1992-93 school year were more likely than other teachers to use portfo- lios. Professional development in assessment made little consistent difference, however, in the types of student work that teachers included in the portfolios. The only exception was that public school teachers who participated in professional development on assessment were more likely to include interdisciplinary problems and tests and assessments in students' portfolios than their counterparts who had not participated.

Given the promise of this strategy for achieving higher order learning goals and engaging students of diverse backgrounds, many teachers, schools, and districts are interested in learning and applying it in their classrooms and cooperative learning is frequently the topic of professional development activities (see chapter 3). The TFS data indicate that teachers who had participated in any professional development program on cooperative learning in the last two years were more likely than those who had not to report that they used small group instruction at least once a week (91 percent versus 83 percent among public school teachers and 87 percent versus 77 percent among private school teachers) (table 5.1).3 Similarly, teachers who had participat-ed in a professional development program on cooperative learning were more likely than others to use all three of the specific small group practices presented."}, {"section_title": "Educational Technology", "text": "\"Technology\" is becoming a widely used word among education reformers (Means et al. 1993).

Emerging standards for teaching practice advocate teachers' flexible use of a wide range of strategies depending on their students, the content, and the context of their instruction (National Board for Professional Teaching Standards 1989). The TFS data indicate that teachers used various technologies at significantly different rates in 1994-95.

At least four of the student tasks about which teachers were asked in the TFS required students to use higher order thinking skills: explaining the connections between what they were learning in school and the real world; working on problems that had several solutions or that could be solved with a variety of methods; and putting events or things in order and explaining why they organized them in that way.

Researchers, on the other hand, disagree over whether homework makes a difference in student achievement (Barber 1986;Walberg, Pascal, and Weinstein 1986), and if so, what kinds of homework are more effective than others (Palardy 1988). The TFS data indicate that teachers assign homework involving routine practice of skills somewhat more frequently than they assign homework involving creative production or problem-solving. At least 60 percent of teachers assigned students textbook reading and routine exercises as homework (figure 5.3). In contrast, less than one-half of teachers asked students to read supplementary materials or apply concepts to different or unfamiliar situations. Furthermore, of the five types of homework tasks included in figure 5.3, teachers were least likely to have students work on projects, gather data, or conduct experiments. Differences between public and private school teachers tended to be small; however, where they existed, private school teachers tended to be more likely to assign a homework task than public school teachers (table A5.4). There were quite dramatic, if not always surprising, differences in the types of homework assigned by teachers of different subject areas.

Borrowing an idea from the  fine arts, some elementary and secondary school teachers have begun to use portfolios-collections of students' work that are used to evaluate student growth over a given period of time-to supplement or replace traditional modes of assessment. The potential advantages of portfolio assessment are at least two-fold: they invite students and teachers to review progress over time and look for the next steps in an individual's learning; and they are designed for, and may well encourage the use of, complex, multidimensional learning tasks (Arter, Spandel, and Culham 1996). The TFS asked teachers whether they used portfolios in their classes, and if so, what kinds of student work were included in them. Slightly more than one-half of all teachers (56 percent) reported using portfolios during the last semester (tables 5.5 and A5.5). Although portfolios have been touted as tools for encouraging the use of complex learning tasks, the majority of teachers who used portfolios (57 to 62 percent) reported that they included students' worksheets, tests, and assessments in them.

Considerably fewer teachers had their students read children's newspapers in school (29 percent) or use reading kits or computer software (21 to 22 percent).

Over the years, policymakers have struggled with issues related to levels of compensation and criteria for awarding salary increases. Their decisions affect who goes into teaching, who stays, and how teachers move from district to district and school to school (Odden and Kelley 1997). Starting salaries and potential increases over time are important considerations for college graduates considering possible careers. When asked whether various factors were important to them in determining the type of work they planned to do in the future, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients responded affirmatively to \"income potential over career\" and \"intellectually challenging work\" (45 percent in each case) more often than to any of the other factors mentioned (Choy and Geis forthcoming).' While no one would deny that teaching provides intellectually challenging work, many have long been concerned that teachers are inadequately paid and that the low income potential over the course of a teaching career compared with other occupations requiring similar preparation may discourage college students from entering the profession. Compensation can also be a very important consideration for current teachers weighing the tangible and intangible costs and benefits of remaining in the teaching field or in a particular district or school.

In most cases, the steps on the salary schedules are determined by a combination of educational attainment and years of teaching experience and are not affected by grade level or subject taught. Teachers with a bachelor's degree and no experience typically start at the bottom of the schedule and move up to a specified maximum as they accumulate credit for experience and additional education. 'Other factors students were asked about and the percentages who reported that they were very important to them in determining the type of work they planned to do in the future included a good starting income (35 percent), job security (36 percent), interesting work (42 percent), and interaction with others (33 percent)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "For more detailed, multivariate analyses of teacher compensation using the 1990-91 SASS data, see Chambers and Bobbin (1996) and McLaughlin This structure provides teachers with a strong incentive to continue their formal education beyond a bachelor's degree, which many do (see chapter 3). The vast majority of teachers (87 percent) were employed by public school districts in 1993-94 (chapter 2). On average, scheduled salaries were substantially higher in public school districts than in private schools at major points on the schedules (figure 6.1 and table A6.1).3 For example, public school districts paid about 35 percent more than private schools, on average, for a teacher with a bachelor's degree but no experience in 1993-94 ($21,900 versus $16,200) and almost 50 percent more for a teacher at the top of the schedule ($40,500 versus $27,300). Some of this publicprivate variation may be due to differences in teacher characteristics such as education and experience (see chapter 3 for the nature of these differences), but not all (Chambers and Bobbitt 1996;McLaughlin 1997). Within the public sector, regional differences were quite striking, with scheduled salaries highest in the Northeast and generally lowest in the South in 1993-94 (table 6.1). In districts in the Northeast, the average salary at the top of the schedule was $51,300, and in the South, $33,800. To some extent, regional differences reflect cost-of-living differences. However, the cost of living was similar in the Midwest and South, but the scheduled salary for the highest step was considerably higher in the Midwest. 3 See tables A6.2 and A6.3 for additional detail on scheduled salaries by state for public districts and years of experience for private schools by affiliation.

Average salaries increased with experience in both sectors, reflecting the typical salary schedule structure. In both sectors, but particularly in private schools, secondary school teachers who were employed full time tended to earn more than their elementary school counterparts, despite the fact that salary schedules typically do not consider teaching level (figure 6.3). This difference reflects, at least in part, differences in educational attainment. In private schools, for example, secondary school teachers were almost twice as likely as elementary school teachers to have a master's degree (40 percent versus 22 percent) (see table A3.5)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Teacher Salaries", "text": "According to data collected by the American Federation of Teachers, the average annual salary for public school teachers increased steadily (in constant 1995 dollars) from 1960 until 1972.

Average salaries (in constant 1995-96 dollars) have remained relatively constant since the late 1980s (figure 6.4 and table A6.5). Because changes in average salaries over time are affected by changes in the age and educational attainment of the teaching work force, it is useful to look at changes in scheduled salaries over time as well. Data from SASS show that in constant 1993-94 dollars, average salaries for a teacher with a bachelor's degree and no experience declined by about 4 percent in public schools and increased by about 2 percent in private schools between 1987-88 and 1993-94 (Henke, Choy, Geis, and Broughman 1996). The American Federation of Teachers reports that teacher salaries now account for a smaller proportion of states' educational expenditures than they did 30 years ago, having dropped from 53 percent in 1964-65 to 38 percent in 1994-95 (Nelson and Schneider 1995). This pattern of decline is found in every state."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Income", "text": "The base salary paid to teachers as compensation for meeting their teaching responsibilities may not represent their total school-related earnings. In 1993-94, about one-half of all full-time teachers (51 percent) (such as coaching, sponsoring a student activity, or teaching evening classes). For those with additional school-related earnings, the average was about $2,500. Earning additional compensation during the school year was much more common than either type of summer employment (42 percent earned money during the school year versus 13 percent for teaching summer school and 6 percent for summer nonteaching responsibilities). Some teachers supplement their school salaries by holding nonschool jobs. In 1993-94, 26 percent of all fulltime teachers had a nonschool job either during the summer or during the school year (tables 6.2 and A6.7). The average amount earned from such jobs was about $5,000. l 73 In the full-time teaching force, public school teachers were more likely than private school teachers to earn supplemental income from their own or another school. On the other hand, outside jobs were more common for private school full-time teachers than their public school counterparts in 1993-94. Private school teachers may have a greater need to supplement their income because their salaries tend to be lower, but they might also turn more frequently to nonschool employment because their schools provide fewer opportunities for them to supplement their income. For both public and private school teachers, characteristics associated with greater supplemental school income and nonschool employment include teaching at the secondary rather than elementary level, being male, being under 30 years of age rather than over 40 years, and not being married (tables A6.6 and A6.7). These differences reflect variation in factors such as the availability of employment opportunities, the teachers' need for additional income, the amount of time they have available to work, and whether or not they want to work. For example, secondary schools tend to have more extracurricular activities than elementary schools and therefore more opportunities for their teachers to earn additional school-related income, and married teachers may not need the additional income if they have spouses who work."}, {"section_title": "Benefits", "text": "Benefits constitute an important part of a teacher's compensation package. Most employees consider medical insurance a critical benefit, and in the aggregate teachers are well covered in this regard. In 1993-94, 88 percent of all full-time teachers in public schools received medical insurance paid for entirely or in part by their school or district (tables 6.3 and A6.8). Other key benefits they received included dental insurance (66 percent), group life insurance (62 percent), and pension contributions (63 percent). A majority of parttime public school teachers received each of these benefits, but they were less likely than full-time teachers to receive them: 78 percent had health insurance, 60 percent had dental insurance, 55 percent had group life insurance, and 59 percent received pension contributions (figure 6.5). As with salaries, private school teachers lag behind public school teachers with respect to benefits. Both fulland part-time private school teachers were less likely   Teachers in small public school districts or private schools are at a disadvantage-in terms of the benefits they receive. Full-time teachers in public school districts with enrollments of fewer than 1,000 students were less likely than those in larger districts to receive each type of benefit in 1993-94 (table 6.3). In private schools, the percentage of teachers receiving each type of benefit increased with school size. One concern public school teachers often have when they move (or consider moving) to a new district is whether they can get credit in the new retirement system for past service (99.8 percent of public school teachers had district retirement plans). Lack of transferability could decrease.overall teacher mobility, but in reality, virtually all (99 percent) public school teachers in districts with retirement plans could get credit for previous in-state service (although 8 percent of those who could get credit had to put money into the plan to receive it) (table A6.9). Sixty-two percent could receive credit for out-of-state teaching experience, but 87 percent had to buy it. Thus, retirement system rules are more likely to discourage inter-than intrastate mobility. Private school teachers were less likely to have a retirement plan (71 percent), but when they did, 69 percent could get credit under some circumstances (such as when they transferred from a school within the same organization or body, rolled over funds from another retirement plan, or purchased credit in the school's retirement plan) (table A6.10). In addition to the major types of insurance and pension benefits just described, teachers may receive various other types of benefits, such as reimbursement of tuition, fees, or transportation expenses, meals, housing, and child care. Among public school teachers, the most common benefit for full-time teachers and one of the most common for part-time teachers was reim- Reimbursement of tuition and fees provides a double benefit for teachers by making it easier for them to earn additional education credits and thus raise their salaries.

Among bachelor's degree recipients who were employed full time, teachers' average prose literacy skills were similar to those of many other professionals in 1992 (table 6.4). Only scientists had measurably higher scores. Teachers' average earnings, however, were often considerably lower than those of other bachelor's degree recipients (figure 6.6). Some of these differences disappear when the number of weeks worked are taken into account, but even so, teachers' weekly earnings were lower than the average earnings for all bachelor's degree recipients. The Teacher Follow-up Survey shows that 1993-94 teachers who left teaching for another occupation in 1994-95 did not immediately earn more than they had made in teaching (tables 6.5 and A6.12). For teachers who left public or private schools, their average total income was about the same in their new occupation as it had been in teaching. The only leavers with apparent increases were those who left teaching for a nonteaching job within elementary/secondary education (to become a principal, for example). However, these differences were not statistically significant. Although they may not have been earning more immediately, teachers who left teaching may have done so with the expectation that they would earn more in the long run. After all, their 1993-94 teaching salary reflects their number of years of experience in teaching, which was sometimes substantial, while .their 1994-95 salary is what they were paid in the first year in their new occupation. As a final caution with respect to comparing leavers' new income with their previous income as teachers, it should be noted that they may have had a change in employment status (from full-to part-time or vice versa). A retired teacher who took a part-time job, for example, could easily earn less than he or she did as a teacher, even if the new salary rate were higher.

This theme persists in contemporary discussions of how best to reform the structure of the occupation (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF) 1996). Some aspects of teachers' work environments that reformers and researchers have examined are the degrees to which administrators support teachers in interactions with parents and students, provide instructional leadership and clear expectations for student and teacher performance, and recognize teachers' accomplishments (Mitchell, Ortiz, and Mitchell 1987;Rosenholtz 1991); teachers participate in school-wide decisions and have control over policies that affect instruction (Goodlad 1984;Rosenholtz 1991);1 the faculty of a school cooperate in instruction and in enforcement of disciplinary policy (Rosenholtz 1991); and teachers have access to the materials and equipment they need (Goodlad 1984;Johnson 1990). These and other studies have found some empirical evidence that these aspects of teachers' work environments affect both their ability to work effectively with children and also the length of time they remain in the profession. Inadequate instructional leadership from the principal, for example, may limit the coordination of instruction among teachers and grade levels, making individual teachers' jobs all the more difficult (Mitchell, Ortiz, and Mitchell 1987). Similarly, when teachers inconsistently enforce school rules for student behavior, student misbehavior may interfere with instruction. In addition to their direct impact on teachers' effectiveness with their students, teachers' working environments affect the profession in other ways. Working conditions that limit their effectiveness with students may also affect their decisions about changing schools or professions. Teachers who are frustrated in their work are more likely to move to another school or leave the profession altogether, as data in this chapter and the next illustrate. This chapter uses data from the 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and the 1994-95 Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) to examine several aspects of teachers' work environments and their satisfaction with them. The chapter begins by discussing teachers' perceptions of their administrators' leadership and support for teachers and their opinions about their colleagues: whether teachers in their school enforced rules consistently, shared beliefs, had a common mission, and cooperated with each other. The chapter next addresses teachers' job satisfaction from multiple viewpoints, and concludes by connecting teachers' perceptions of and satisfaction with various aspects of their work with their plans to remain in the profession."}, {"section_title": "Administrative Leadership and Support", "text": "In the 1993-94 SASS, teachers indicated how much they agreed with statements about various aspects of their principals' performance, generally giving their principals high marks.

Although still a majority, somewhat fewer (70 percent) felt that teachers in their schools were recognized for a job well done. Finally, less than one-half of teachers reported that their principal talked with them frequently about their instructional practices. Teachers' perceptions of principal support and leadership varied with a number of school characteristics. Public school teachers were consistently less likely than their peers in private schools to agree with these statements about the leadership in their schools (tables 7.1 and A7.1). In both sectors, elementary-level teachers were more likely than secondary school teachers to believe that their principals were doing a good job in these areas, but in large high schools, department heads may assume some of these responsibilities. Finally, as the proportion of low-income students in their schools increased, public school teachers became more likely to report that their principals frequently talked with them about their instruction. Recommendations for reform include serious discussions about the support that teachers receive in the early stages of their careers (Darling-Hammond 1995;NCTAF 1996). Therefore, the degree to which principals talked with new teachers about their instruction is    Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey: 1993-94 (School and Teacher Questionnaires). of particular interest. Teachers in the first three years of their careers were generally more likely than their more experienced colleagues to report receiving support from their principal on instructional matters (figure 7.2)."}, {"section_title": "Cooperation Among Colleagues", "text": "Some research indicates that school culture has a profound effect on teachers' commitment to their school and career (Darling-Hammond and Sclan 1996; Mitchell, Ortiz, and Mitchell 1987;Rosenholtz 1991). One component of a school culture that is conducive to teacher commitment is a common set of values and goals among teachers and other staff (Rosenholtz 1991). In 1993-94, a large majority of teachers agreed that their colleagues shared their beliefs and had a similar mission for the school (85 percent) and that staff worked cooperatively (79 percent) (figure 7.3 and tables 7.2 and A7.2). For both of these factors, agreement was stronger among teachers in private schools than in public schools and among elementary than secondary teachers (table 7.2) About two-thirds of teachers, somewhat fewer than those recognizing a shared mission, thought that student conduct rules were consistently enforced by teachers in their schools (figure 7.3). In particular, as the proportion of low-income students in their schools increased, public school teachers were more likely to report that teachers in their schools enforced the rules (table 7.2). However, confidence in staff solidarity on enforcing rules was weaker among public secondary teachers, where fewer than one-half agreed that rules were consistently enforced, than among public elementary teachers and private school teachers at either level. 20 or more  "}, {"section_title": "Availability of Resources", "text": "About three-quarters of all teachers-73 percent in public schools and 86 percent in private schools agreed that necessary materials (such as textbooks, supplies, and a copy machine) were available to the staff as needed (tables 7.3 and A7.2). However, the proportion of teachers who agreed with this statement varied among different types of schools. In the public sector, for example, teachers in larger schools and districts were less likely than those in smaller schools or districts to report that necessary materials were available. Similarly, teachers in schools with larger proportions of low-income students were less likely than their counterparts in schools with relatively fewer low-income students to report that necessary materials were available as needed.2 In the public sector, the type of community in which teachers taught was also related to the relative frequency with which they reported they had access to necessary materials. Whereas about two-thirds of central city teachers reported that necessary materials were avail-able, about three-quarters of their peers in other types of communities did so. Among private school teachers, no such differences were observed. Relatively few teachers in either sector-16 percent among public school teachers and 10 percent among privatereported that their principals were poor at getting resources for their schools (tables 7.3 and A7.1). Moreover, teachers in different types of public schools did not vary much with respect to their perceptions of principals' resource acquisition."}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction With Salary", "text": "Teachers earn less than other professionals with comparable levels of education (see chapter 6; Salmon 1988), and the divergence in salaries grows with professional work experience. As a result, people do not choose to teach with the goal of earning a high income; rather, they are attracted to the profession because they like working with children, they want to help improve the lives of young people or contribute to the community, or they want to work in a given subject area (Andrew 1983;Book, Freeman, and Brousseau 1985;Lortie 1975). Nevertheless, when teachers' pay diminishes sharply relative to that of other professionals, as occurred during the 1970s, teachers are likely to be dissatisfied with their pay and perhaps to consider changing occupations. Lower salaries may also reduce the supply of new entrants into the profession. Measuring teachers' satisfaction with their salaries, however, is no simple task. Teachers, as well as other employees, may assess the adequacy of their salaries in different ways. Some may compare their salary with what they think they could earn in other professions (or what they know other teachers earn); some may look at the increase since they started teaching; and others may consider their salary in relation to their job's rewards, workload, responsibilities, and stress. Different question wording may also produce disparate responses from teachers on their satisfaction with their salaries. For example, one 1996 national survey of teachers indicated that only 17 percent thought they were paid enough, with 78 percent saying they were not paid enough, given \"the amount and quality of  salaries differed from those of other racialethnic groups. Differences in satisfaction among racialethnic groups may be related to differences in the schools or communities in which teachers with different racialethnic backgrounds taught. Nevertheless, racialethnic differences in teachers' satisfaction with their salaries may contribute to the discrepancy between the proportion of minority students and teachers if they affect the rate at which minority teachers enter or leave the profession. Teachers in public central city schools and in schools in the largest districts were less likely than teachers in other types of communities or smaller districts, respectively, to be satisfied with their salaries. This may be related, at least in part, to cost of living differences or perceived differences in the difficulty of the job in different types of schools. Finally, teachers' satisfaction with their salaries has improved since the late 1980s. In 1987-88, 8 percent of public school teachers strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their salaries, and by 1993-94 that figure had increased to 12 percent (figure 7.5). A small increase in the percentage of private school teachers who strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their salaries also occurred over these six years, from 12 to 14 percent (table 7.4). 115 87 Table 7.4 Percentage distribution of teachers according to their level of agreement with the statement I am satisfied with my teaching salary, teachers' average base salary, and teachers' average total school income, by selected school and teacher characteristics: 1993-94  "}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction With Other Aspects of Work", "text": "Recognizing that teachers are not drawn to their profession with extensive financial rewards in mind, their work must satisfy them in other ways that are important to them. One aspect of work that has received much attention among educators and reformers is professional status (Carnegie Forum 1986;Holmes Group 1986;NCTAF 1996). These commissions noted that if all students are to meet the high standards required by a competitive global economy, then teachers must undergo additional training and take on additional roles and responsibilities. These reformers also argue that if the public expects teachers to meet these new demands, then they must also expect to reward teachers with greater respect, higher pay, and greater professional recognition and advancement opportunities. Furthermore, in addition to professional status, a number of other aspects of their work have historically been particularly important to teachers. Previous studies have found that the people who enter teaching find job security, the opportunity to work in an academic field in which they are interested, and autonomy on the job to be important features of work, and because teaching as an occupation tends to have these characteristics these people are attracted to it (Lortie 1975). On the other hand, teaching is also noted for unmanageable work loads, requiring teachers to juggle preparation for class, evaluation of student work, supervision of students outside school hours both on-and off-site, parent conferences, curriculum development, and participation in school committees in addition to classroom teaching (Johnson 1990;Lortie 1975). The TFS data allow comparisons between the satisfaction of teachers who remained in the classroom and that of their peers who left teaching and were employed elsewhere in 1994-95, as well as examination of teachers' satisfaction with their work over time. Teachers expressed fairly high rates of overall satisfaction with their jobs in 1994-95: 78 percent reported that they were satisfied with their working conditions in general, and 82 percent reported that they were satisfied overall. About 88 percent of teachers were satisfied with their job security, the intellectual challenge their jobs provided, and their autonomy over their work (tables 7.5a and 7.5b). Although a majority of teachers were satisfied with all aspects of work included in the table, lower proportions were satisfied with a number of frequently cited obstacles to teacher satisfaction, including the manageability of their work (63 percent), the resources available to do their work (60 percent), the professional prestige of teaching (58 percent), and their salaries (58 percent).3"}, {"section_title": "Comparisons With Other Professions", "text": "Those 1993-94 teachers who left teaching for other occupations were more likely than those who stayed to report that they were satisfied with most aspects of work. For example, 81 percent to 83 percent of former teachers who had become managers or professionals, salespeople or clerks, or entered some other occupation outside elementary/secondary education were satisfied 3Although this estimate of the proportion of teachers who were satisfied with their salaries appears to be significantly greater than that derived from the 1993-94 SASS data, these estimates cannot be directly compared because of differences between the items in the two surveys. As noted above, responses can be quite sensitive to item wording.

Among former teachers who continued to work in elementary or secondary education in some nonteaching capacity, 93 percent reported that they were satisfied with the professional prestige of their new jobs. Similar differences were observed in 1993-94 teachers' satisfaction with other aspects of their 1994-95 jobs."}, {"section_title": "Comparisons Over Time", "text": "It is interesting to note that with respect to two important job characteristics, teachers in 1994-95 were satisfied more often than teachers in 1988-89 had been. In 1988-89, 80 percent of public school teachers and 87 percent of private school teachers reported that they were satisfied with the intellectual challenges posed by their work (table 7.6). By 1994-95, these proportions had risen to 87 percent in the public sector and 91 percent in the private sector. Perhaps more striking, given the attention to career ladders and differentiation of work and status among teachers during the 1980s,-is the rising proportion of teachers who were satisfied with the opportunity for advancement in their work. In 1988-89, 57 percent of public school teachers and 61 percent of private school teachers reported that they were satisfied with the opportunity to advance in their Would They Choose Teaching Again? In addition to their answers to direct questions about their satisfaction with various aspects of their work, the SASS Teacher Questionnaire asked teachers whether they would become teachers again if they were starting over. As with the direct measures of teachers' satisfaction discussed above, this measure also indicates that a majority of 1993-94 teachers were satisfied with their occupational choice. Forty percent of teachers reported that they certainly would become teachers again were they to start over, and another 26 percent said they probably would become teachers again. Only 5 percent of teachers reported that they certainly would not become teachers again (tables 7.7 and A7.5). As with previous measures of teacher satisfaction, private school and elementary level teachers appear to have been more satisfied than their public school and secondary school colleagues. Also, in both sectors, elementary level teachers were somewhat more likely than secondary level teachers to say they certainly would become a teacher again. 4 In addition, public school teachers in schools with larger proportions of lowincome children were more likely than their colleagues in more affluent schools to report that they probably or certainly would not become teachers again. Furthermore, as other measures of teacher satisfaction discussed in this chapter have indicated, teachers were more satisfied with their work in 1993-94 than in 1987-88. Whereas about one-third of 1987-88 teachers reported that they would certainly be willing to become teachers again, 40 percent of 1993-94 teachers reported so (figure 7.6).

Individual states and localities are experiencing some teacher scarcity, and national NCES projections indicate that by 2006, schools in the United States will enroll 54.6 million children, a 10 percent increase from 1994 (Hussar and Gerald 1996). To handle this increase, NCES estimates that the elementary and secondary teacher work force will need to grow by between 325,000 and 600,000 teachers, depending upon demographic shifts and economic conditions. "}, {"section_title": "The Supply of Teachers", "text": "The vast majority of the nation's teachers are experienced teachers who continue to teach from year to year. In 1993-94, 93 percent of teachers had taught during the previous year and were continuing to teach, either in the same school or in a different school (figure 8.1 and table A8.1). About 5 percent of teachers were new to the profession. In discussions of how to cope with anticipated teacher shortages, researchers and policymakers have suggested that teachers who have left the professionone component of what is sometimes termed \"the reserve poor may be a potential source of new hires.

For additional discussion of SASS:93-94 data concerning the supply and demand of teachers, see Henke, Choy, Geis, and Broughman (1996). Traditionally, women have favored teaching as an occupation precisely because it allowed easy exit and reentry, facilitating long absences from the labor force to care for young children (Lortie 1975), and about onefifth of 1993-94 returning teachers had most recently spent time homemaking or child rearing (figure 8.2 and table A8.1). However, returning teachers had done a number of other things as well: another one-fifth had been working in jobs outside elementary/secondary education before returning; 16 percent had been students themselves; and another 39 percent had been substitute teaching, teaching at the preschool or postsecondary level, working in some other position in elementary/secondary education, in the military, or "}, {"section_title": "Teaching and Preparation to Teach Among New College Graduates", "text": "In the last decade a number of states have developed alternative certification programs to allow college graduates who did not prepare to teach as undergraduates to obtain full certification to teach without returning to college for extensive course taking (Feistritzer 1993). These programs certify relatively few teachers in the U.S., however, and as has traditionally been the case, new college graduates continue to be one of the major sources of new entrants into the profession. Some of these new entrants prepared to teach during their college years, either as education majors or as liberal arts majors who also completed the education coursework and practicum experience required for state licensure. Others teach soon after completing their bachelor's degrees without undergoing formal teacher preparation. These new teachers often work in private schools, teaching in order to earn a living while pursuing graduate studies part time, or to find out whether they want to make the investment in teacher training, or pursue other graduate studies or career options. In B&B:93/94, 1992-93 college graduates were asked a number of questions regarding their preparation for teaching and experience as teachers in the year following their graduation from college.2 In addition, the B&B:93/94 data collection included graduates' transcripts from the institution through which they were sampled for the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). For the purposes of this analysis, graduates were defined as having prepared to teach if their NPSAS transcripts indicated they had completed student teaching or if in the B&B:93/94 interview they reported that they became certified to teach in the year following graduation. Among 1,146,000 bachelor's degree recipients, 8 percent had prepared to teach and actually became teachers by 1994, 3 percent taught without having prepared to teach, and another 4 percent had prepared to teach as undergraduates but did not teach in the year following graduation (table 8.1 and A8.2).3 Not surprisingly, graduates who had majored in education were more likely than graduates with other college majors to prepare to teach and then teach in the year following graduation. Another component of the reserve pool includes college graduates who prepare to teach and do not enter teaching but could at a later date. By 1994, many 1992-93 graduates who had completed student teaching or had been certified to teach had not yet entered the profession. Among graduates who majored in education, 22 percent prepared to, but did not, teach in the year following graduation. Moreover, 51 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who had prepared to teach did not apply for teaching jobs (table A8.3a). Graduates who had prepared to teach or were considering teaching but had not applied were asked why they did not apply and their responses were coded by telephone interviewers. Most of the reasons they gave fell into two broad categories. Among the most commonly chosen reasons were those indicating that graduates were not fully prepared or needed to complete some additional steps before teaching, perhaps reflecting the fact that in some states teacher certification requires some graduate study. For example, 33 percent said they had not taken or passed necessary tests, 24 percent 3Because students may have earned credits at other institutions, some of a graduate's credits may not appear on the NPSAS transcript. Therefore, it is possible that some graduates had completed student teaching, and therefore were prepared to teach, although their transcripts did not so indicate. To the extent this occurred, the estimates of graduates who did not prepare would be biased upward and the estimates of those who did prepare would be biased downward. wanted to obtain more education, and 2 percent felt they were not yet ready to apply for a teaching job (figure 8.3 and tables A8.3ab). Several other reasons that were expressed less frequently indicated that some graduates were ambivalent about teaching, either on its own or in comparison with other options, or were in fact not inclined to teach. For example, 15 percent reported that they had no interest in teaching, 10 percent wanted to pursue other occupations, and 5 percent were offered jobs with larger salaries. Only 3 percent of these graduates were discouraged from teaching by low pay and only 1 percent cited poor teaching conditions as the reason for not applying for a teaching position. About one-half of bachelor's degree recipients who had taught or were considering teaching did apply for a teaching position after graduation, however, and this proportion varied considerably by college major (figure 8.4 and table A8.4). Among college graduates who had taught or were considering teaching, those who majored in education were considerably more likely than those who had majored in other fields to apply for a teaching position. Nearly three-quarters of graduates who applied for teaching positions received offers, and nine out of ten of those who received offers accepted them (table A8.4).4 The  the teaching work force within a year of completing their degrees.

For example, although the number of vacant teaching positions at both the school and district levels offers relevant information, it is not conclusive because schools and districts have several ways of filling teaching vacancies even when shortages occur. Moreover, it is impor-127 tant to determine how schools and districts fill vacancies not only because the use of alternative means might indicate shortages that would otherwise be hidden but also because some methods of filling vacancies may affect the quality of instruction. This section presents a number of indicators of teacher shortage from public school districts and both public and private schools that participated in SASS:93-94. In total, these indicators do not suggest that there was a general shortage of teachers in the early 1990s. However, during this period it was more difficult for schools to find fully qualified teachers in some fields than in others, indicating that teachers in these fields may have been in shorter supply. 99 100 AMERICA'S TEACHERS: PROFILE OF A PROFESSION, 1993-94"}, {"section_title": "District-Level Indicators", "text": "Filling teaching positions Virtually all of the teaching positions approved by public school districts were filled in 1993-94. On average, less than 1 percent of teaching positions were vacant or temporarily filled by a substitute teacher because suitable candidates could not be found, and virtually no position was withdrawn because suitable candidates could not be found (figure 8.5 and table A8.7). Moreover, this lack of shortage does not appear to be a function of budget tightening: only 0.4 percent of teaching positions in public school districts were withdrawn because of budget cuts."}, {"section_title": "Use of incentives to attract teachers", "text": "When public school districts include schools in less desirable locations or when positions in some teaching fields are particularly difficult to fill, they sometimes  offer potential teachers pay incentives to attract them to these locations or teaching fields. Therefore, if many districts offer such incentives, it may indicate that teachers for these locations or fields are in short sup-pl5 y. In 1993-94, only a small proportion of school districts reported offering any of three specific financial incentives to attract teachers to less desirable locations. For example, 5 percent of public school districts offered an increase on the salary schedule to attract teachers to less desirable locations, 4 percent offered some other salary increase, and 2 percent offered a cash bonus (table 8.2). Furthermore, none of these pay incentives was used extensively to attract teachers to teaching fields. Perhaps because they were less likely to have collective bargaining agreements that regulate teacher salary schedules (see chapter 6), private schools were more likely than public school districts to offer teachers incentives to teach in fields of shortage. Districts in which larger proportions of students received free or reduced-price lunches, an indicator of low income, were more likely than districts with fewer low-income students to report that they offered cash bonuses or other salary increases, but not increases on the salary schedule, to attract teachers to both locations and fields of shortage. Although relatively few districts used pay incentives to attract teachers to less desirable locations or teaching fields with shortages in 1993-94, even fewer had done so in 1987-88. For example, 1 percent of districts offered cash bonuses to attract teachers to either less desirable locations or fields of shortage in 1987-88, compared with about 2 percent in 1993-94 (figure 8.6 and table A8.8). Considering all types of pay incentives, 10 percent of public school districts and 19 percent of private schools reported offering some type of financial incentive to 5However, the opposite is not true. Collective bargaining agreements or financial constraints may prohibit districts from using pay incentives to attract teachers, so that even when shortages occur public school districts may have to use other means to fill teaching vacancies. This is another reason for using multiple indicators to determine whether teachers are in short supply. On the other hand, public school districts and private schools appeared to be more likely to offer free training to prepare staff members to teach in fields of shortage than to offer pay incentives to attract potential candidates. About one in five public school districts offered free training to prepare staff members to teach in at least one field of shortage (tables 8.3 and A8.10a-b). In addition, among districts where more than 40 percent of the students received free or reduced-price lunches, one in four public school districts offered training in at least one teaching field to cope with teacher shortages in that field (table A8.10a).6"}, {"section_title": "School-Level Indicators", "text": "Although the data just examined indicate that public school districts and private schools had few unfilled vacancies, schools could still experience teacher shortages that these data would not reveal. Schools may find it more difficult to fill positions in some fields than others, for example, or may fill vacancies by hiring teachers who are not fully qualified to teach in a particular field or cancel classes for lack of a qualified teacher to teach them. This section examines not only whether such phenomena were occurring in 1993-94, but also the degree to which schools with relatively more disadvantaged students experienced greater difficulty than other schools in finding fully qualified teachers."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Because of a change in question wording in the 1993-94 SASS questionnaires, these proportions cannot be compared over time. "}, {"section_title": "Schools' reports of teaching vacancies", "text": "This section discusses the rates at which schools reported vacancies in various fields, and the difficulty they had filling those vacancies. When examining the rates at which schools reported vacancies across fields, it is important to note that schools vary in the fields for which they have teaching positions to begin with. For example, elementary schools are unlikely to have teaching positions in vocational education and high schools are unlikely to have general elementary positions. The SASS allowed schools to indicate whether the items on a given field were applicable to their school. Therefore, for each field this analysis excludes schools that did not have vacancies in a given field because there were no positions in that field. reported vacancies in business and marketing, and 6 percent in agriculture (figure 8.7). High proportions of schools with vacancies in a given field, however, do not necessarily indicate a shortage of teachers in that field. First, the probability of having a vacancy in a given field varies with the number of positions the school has in that field. Because schools are likely to have multiple teaching positions in some fields, such as general elementary positions, the proportion of schools with vacancies in these fields is likely to be higher merely because there are more of these teaching positions available to be vacant in a given school. Second, high proportions of schools with vacancies alone do not indicate teacher shortages: if those vacancies are easily filled, teachers are not in short supply, but rather are highly mobile among schools. Therefore, the proportion of schools with vacancies must be examined along with the degree of difficulty that administrators have in filling the vacancies. To demonstrate the need to take multiple statistics into Of schools that could have had teaching vacancies in various fields, percentage that reported at least one vacancy, by field:  Elementary education Of those schools, one-quarter (about 8,000) indicated that they did in fact have a vacant ESL or bilingual education position. Of the approximately 8,000 schools with vacancies, one-third (about 2,700) reported that those vacancies were somewhat difficult to fill, nearly one-quarter (about 1,900) reported that they were very difficult to fill, and 3 percent (about 240) reported that they could not be filled. Thus, about 7 percent of schools with ESL or bilingual teaching positions experienced significant difficulty in filling those positions and only about 1 percent could not find qualified teachers to fill them. The proportion of low-income students that schools served was related to their difficulty in filling ESL or bilingual education teaching vacancies. Compared with public schools that enrolled relatively fewer lowincome students, public schools with larger proportions of such students were more likely to report that they both had ESL or bilingual education teaching vacancies and that they could not fill them. Combined, these proportions indicate that among schools that had vacant ESL or bilingual positions and where more than 40 percent of students received free or reduced-price lunches 2 percent of schools could not fill those positions because they could not find qualified teachers. 7Tables A8.11a-g present these same data by a number of school characteristics for ESL/bilingual education and 13 additional fields. 8The proportion of schools that could have had ESL/bilingual vacancies and found it very difficult or impossible to fill them is computed by multiplying the 25 percent of schools with vacancies by the 26 percent that reported those vacancies were very difficult or imposiible to fill. The proportion that found it impossible to fill them is computed by multiplying 25 percent by 3 percent, yielding .75 percent. However, when schools were unable to find a fully qualified teacher, public and private schools used different strategies to staff their classes. 'Whereas public schools were more likely than private schools to hire long-or short-term substitute teachers, private schools were more likely than public schools to assign an administrator or counselor to teach classes for which fully qualified teachers could not be hired. Other methods were used in both sectors. Eight percent of public schools and 9 percent of private schools hired less than fully qualified teachers, and no more than 5 percent of schools in either sector canceled planned course offerings, expanded some class sizes, added sections to others' teaching loads, or assigned a teacher of another subject or grade level or an administrator to teach those classes. Finally, the methods that public schools used to fill vacancies varied with the student populations they served. Public schools in which more than 40 percent of the students were low income were less likely than schools with lower proportions of low-income students to fill vacancies by hiring a fully qualified teacher (although 91 percent of the former did hire a fully qualified teacher). Schools in which more than 40 percent of the students were low income were also more likely than other schools to hire a less than fully qualified teacher."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Attrition", "text": "To deliver high-quality education, schools must not only attract talented individuals as teachers but also keep them in the classroom. As noted in chapter 3, teaching experience and expertise are valuable components of teachers' overall qualifications. Therefore, losing experienced teachers can significantly affect the quality of instruction. Understanding how many teach- The 1994-95 TFS data indicate that teachers continued teaching in their schools, moved to new schools, and left teaching at about the rates they predicted. Eighty-six percent of 1993-94 teachers were still teaching in the same schools in 1994-95, 7 percent had changed schools, and another 7 percent had left teaching. Moreover, the proportions who stayed, moved, and left between 1993-94 and 1994-95 were comparable to those of six years earlier (figure 8.8 and table A8.14). In general, the attrition rate among private school teachers was greater than that among public school teachers: an average of 12 percent of teachers in the private sector left teaching, compared with 7 percent of public school teachers (table 8.6). Leavers ' 1994-95 Occupations Among school leavers, most retired (25 percent), found jobs outside of education (23 percent), or switched to nonteaching jobs in elementary and secondary schools (19 percent) (tables 8.6 and A8.14). About one-fifth had left teaching to care for family members (16 percent) or attend college (4 percent). Compared with public school' teachers, private school teachers are younger and less likely to receive benefits, including participation in retirement programs. In addition, there are fewer nonteaching ositions available in private than in public schools. These differences between public and private schools and teachers are consistent with differences between public and private school leavers in the activities they pursued after teaching. For example, public school leavers were about equally likely to take a nonteaching job outside or within elementary/secondary education, with about one-fifth of leavers pursuing each of these alternatives. In contrast, about one-third of private school leavers 9See chapter 2 for data regarding teachers' age and chapter 6 for a discussion of public and private school teachers' benefits. including counselors, librarians, and support personnel for other teachers; 27 percent became school administrators; and 10 percent became other school employees. In the public sector, male leavers were much more likely than female leavers to become administrators: 60 percent of male leavers became school administrators, compared with only 16 percent of female leavers. Teachers who took jobs outside education entered a variety of occupations. About one-half became man-agers or professionals, 13 percent became salespeople, 11 percent became clerical workers or administrative support personnel, 9 percent became service workers, 7 percent became postsecondary instructors, and 3 percent became engineers, scientists, or technicians (tables 8.8 and A8.16). Interestingly, women who left public school teaching were more likely than men who had taught in public schools to become managers or professionals (61 percent of female leavers became managers or professionals versus only 39 percent of male leavers). Why Do They Leave? Although some have suggested that teachers leave teaching for better pay or other career opportunities, this belief is not strongly supported by the 1994-95 TFS data. Seven percent of leavers reported leaving to obtain better pay or benefits and 14 percent left to pursue another career, proportions similar to those observed six years earlier (figure 8.9 and table A8.17). Substantial proportions of leavers gave reasons that appeared to be unrelated to teaching. For instance, Table 8.7 Percentage of 1993-94 teachers who left teaching for other elementary or secondary school occupations by 1994-95; and percentage distribution of those leavers according to non-teaching occupation, by sector and public school teacher gender: 1993-94    "}, {"section_title": "137", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE approximately 37 percent of leavers reported they left primarily because of family or personal moves, and another 27 percent left to retire or take a sabbatical or other break. However, some teachers (5 percent) did cite dissatisfaction with teaching as their primary reason for leaving. Leavers who left because they were dissatisfied with teaching indicated that they were dissatisfied with the recognition and support that they received from administrators, student discipline problems, and poor student motivation in particular: 32, 17, and 16 percent of dissatisfied school leavers, respectively, chose these as their main areas of dissatisfaction with teaching (figure 8.10 and tables A8.18ab). Another 10 percent of leavers left because they were more or less dissatisfied with their salaries."}, {"section_title": "Overall Supply and Demand", "text": "In the fall of 1996, elementary schools were bursting at the seams, and projections of increasing enrollments, especially among children of minority racialethnic backgrounds (Riley 1996), indicated that the need for teachers will only increase in the coming decades. The data reviewed in this report indicate that earlier predictions regarding an increased demand for teachers overall had not materialized in the early 1990s: teachers left the profession at similar rates in 1987-89 and in 1993-95 (chapter 8), and neither district-nor schoollevel data indicated that teacher shortages were widespread problems. Nevertheless, demand is likely to increase as the turn of the century approaches. The teacher work force is aging (chapter 2) and many teachers may begin to retire in the coming decade, adding to the need for teachers posed by increasing enrollments."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Qualifications", "text": "Should the demand for teachers rise substantially, the goal of ensuring a talented and dedicated teacher in every classroom may become an even greater challenge than it would otherwise be. In the early 1980s, researchers reported that college graduates who became teachers were less likely to be at the top of their classes than those who entered other professions, and that the teachers with higher educational achievement were also more likely than others to leave the profession. However, the data examined in chapter 3 indicate that the undergraduate achievement of 1992-93 college graduates who entered teaching by 1994 did not differ much from that of other graduates. Although new teachers were more likely than other graduates to have taken remedial English and precollegiate mathematics, relatively few of them had taken these courses, and overall their GPAs were higher than those of other graduates. Moreover, in 1993-94, teachers were no less qualified than they had been in the late 1980s. Teachers continued to be highly educated relative to the population as a whole, since virtually all had bachelor's degrees and about one-half had at least a master's degree. Some have suggested that teachers are better prepared to teach if they major in an academic discipline rather than in education and obtain teacher training later, and in fact relatively more teachers had done so in 1993-94 than in 1987-88. In addition, an analysis that combined teachers' certification status with their formal education (both undergraduate and graduate degrees) indicated that 1 percent of teachers had only an undergraduate minor in their main assignment field and 7 percent had no certification or degree in that field. However, some classrooms were systematically less likely than others to have such qualified teachers. Teachers in public schools serving large proportions of lowincome students tended to be less qualified to teach in their assignment fields than teachers in other schools, regardless of the measure of qualifications being used, whether it be formal education, certification status, years of teaching experience, or teachers' self-assessments of their qualifications."}, {"section_title": "Diversify", "text": "In addition to teachers' professional training, some researchers and educators believe that teachers' racialethnic backgrounds figure prominently in their ability to serve diverse student populations. In 1993-94, the proportion of minority teachers remained lower than the proportion of minority students (chapter 2), which many believe makes the goal of serving diverse student populations well more difficult. Although the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data indicate a slighi increase in the proportion of minority teachers since the late 1980s, minority enrollments have grown and are expected to grow even more in the coming years. Moreover, the data do not suggest that the proportion of minority teachers is likely to catch up soon. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study First Followup (B&B:93/94) data, for example, indicate that 1992-93 college graduates who entered teaching in the year following graduation were more likely than other graduates to be white, non-Hispanic (chapter 2)."}, {"section_title": "Professional Development", "text": "Talented and dedicated teachers are borne of not only excellent undergraduate and graduate education and initial professional certification, but also classroom experience and continuing professional development. The National Goal for teacher professional development attests to the belief that becoming an expert in work as complex as teaching requires time, reflection, and the opportunity to consult with other professionals about problems and strategies to solve them. Most teachers reported that they had participated in some form of professional development in the year preceding the 1993-94 SASS. However, the intensity of teachers' professional development experiences has been of some concern to reformers (NCTAF 1996), and with respect to most of the topics included in the survey, teachers reported that the programs in which they participated did not last more than one day. The attention paid to teachers' professional development is predicated on the assumption that professional development makes a difference in teachers' capacity to instruct students well. Analysis of the Teacher Followup Survey (TFS) data on teachers' use of various instructional practices suggest that professional development experiences may affect teachers' instruction. Those who attended a professional development program related to cooperative learning techniques, the use of educational technology, and assessment strategies were more likely than other teachers to have students work in groups, use computers or other electronic technologies, and use portfolios to assess their students' work, respectively. Whether these results reflect differences between the teachers who chose to attend these programs and those who did not, or reflect the effects of professional development, cannot be determined from the available data.

After losing ground relative to other professionals during the 1970s, teachers' salaries had caught up to their previous levels and stabilized by the late 1980s (chapter 6). In addition, teachers were slightly more likely to report that they were satisfied with their salaries in 1993-94 than in 1987-88. However, teachers continue to earn less than other professionals with similar literacy skills, and equity of compensation among teachers is of particular concern. Public school districts that served larger proportions of low-income students had lower scheduled teacher salaries than districts with fewer such students. Not surprisingly, teachers in schools with more low-income students also tended to be less satisfied with their salaries than teachers in schools serving more affluent student populations."}, {"section_title": "Autonomy", "text": "The reform reports of the 1980s noted teachers' lack of control over their work and the conditions under which they worked, and in the 1990s the charter school movement offers one strategy for increasing teachers' control over schools. The President's Call to Action includes a commitment to increase the number of charter schools in order to give students, and teachers, more choices regarding the schools in which they learn and work. Many school districts are initiating change within regular schools as well, using site-based management as a mechanism for providing teachers and school-site administrators with greater control over their schools. In the early 1990s, most teachers perceived themselves as having a great deal of control over policies within their classrooms, but relatively fewer believed they wielded a great deal of influence over schoolwide policies, as has traditionally been the case (chapters 4 and 7). However, the majority of teachers (60 percent) also reported that teachers participated in making important decisions in their schools."}, {"section_title": "Working Conditions and Teacher Satisfaction", "text": "Although policymakers have paid increasing attention to teachers and teaching in recent waves of education reform, they also recognize the importance of the environments in which teachers work. The President's Call to Action included a commitment to safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools, and both the President and the Board called for increased efforts to involve parents and families in children's schooling. The data presented in this report indicate that these goals also pose significant challenges to the nation. One-quarter of public school teachers reported that they had been threatened by a student, and 11 percent reported that they had been attacked by a student (chapter 2). Moreover, family problems such as poverty, parental alcoholism, and parental drug abuse were significant concerns for 13 to 20 percent of public school teachers, and 28 percent of public school teachers reported that a lack of parent involvement was a serious problem in their schools. Currently, schools with larger proportions of minority students also tend to have higher proportions of lowincome students. If this relationship persists and minority students become a larger proportion of the entire student population, the problems of poverty are also likely to become more serious for schools and teachers."}, {"section_title": "ConcOusion", "text": "On some dimensionssome measures of teachers' qualifications, their satisfaction with their salaries, and their overall satisfaction with their workthe state of teachers and teaching appears to have improved between 1987-88 and 1993-94.

While some of the data were collected from universe surveys, most were gathered by surveying samples drawn from populations. Due to the variation in data collection methodology among studies, users of this report should take particular care when comparing data from different sources. Differences in procedures, timing, phrasing of questions, interviewer training, and so forth mean that the results from different NCES sources are not strictly comparable. In addition, the estimates published in this report may also differ from those published Fireviously, or subsequently, using the same data sources. These differences are due to variation among analyses in the samples of cases chosen or in the definitions of particular variables. Following the general discussion of estimate accuracy below, descriptions of the statistical methods and data sources (including a chart summarizing key pieces of information for each data set) are presented."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Nonsampling error. Both universe and sample surveys are subject to nonsampling error, which is extremely difficult to estimate. Nonsampling errors are of two kinds: nonobservation error and measurement error. Nonobservation error may be due to noncoverage, which occurs when members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame and therefore the survey sample. Nonobservation error also occurs when sampled units (for example, schools, teachers, or students) refuse to answer some or all of the survey questions. These types of errors are referred to as item nonresponse (where only responses to some items are missing) and questionnaire nonresponse (where the entire questionnaire is missing), respectively. Through the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, survey researchers sometimes attempt to correct for questionnaire and item nonresponse. Information concerning whether and how such adjustments were made in individual surveys can be found in the technical report that describes in detail the methodology used in each survey. Measurement error occurs when mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or data entry (processing errors), when the responses that subjects provide differ from the \"true\" responses (response errors), and when measurement instruments such as tests-or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Sources of response error include differences in the ways that respondents interpret questions, faulty respondent memory, and mistakes that respondents make when recording their answers. Because estimating the magnitude of these various types of nonsampling errors would require special experiments or access to independent data, information on the magnitude of these types of error is seldom available. Sampling error. Sampling error occurs when members of a population are selected (sampled), and only sample members respond to survey questions. Surveys of population universes, such as the Common Core of Data, are not subject to sampling error. Estimates that are based on a sample will differ somewhat from the data that would have been obtained if a complete census of the relevant population had been taken using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The estimated standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling, and can be used to examine the precision obtained in a particular sample. All of the NCES data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than simple random samples. These sampling designs use both clustering and stratification to sample cases efficiently and to 427 C-2 AMERICA'S TEACHERS: PROFILE OF A PROFESSION, 1993-94 obtain representative samples of relevant subpopulations (e.g., teachers in each of the 50 states). Clustered and stratified sampling designs, however, necessitate modifications to the procedures used to estimate the variance of statistics, i.e., their standard errors. One of the following software programs, which compute variance with either the Taylor series method or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method, was used to estimate most of the statistics provided in this report and their standard errors: REPTAB, STRATTAB, or the B&B:93/94 Data Analysis System (DAS). "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. These statistical tests were based on the Student's t statistic. Generally, whether a difference is considered significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions, and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability of inferring that a difference exists when, in fact, it does not. In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics, several points must be kept in mind. First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics may appear to merit special note. This is not always the case, because the size of the t statistic depends not only on the observed differences in means or the percentages being compared, but also on the standard error of the difference. Thus, a small difference between two groups with a much smaller standard error could result in a large t statistic, but this small difference is not necessarily noteworthy. Second, when multiple statistical comparisons are made within the same category of data, it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference is erroneous. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha level of .05, there is still a 5 percent chance of concluding that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of comparisons increases, the risk of making such an error in inference also increases. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple comparisons was used. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of comparisons made within a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(KI)/2) possible comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise combinations), where K is the number of categories. For example, if race-ethnicity has five categories (Asian/Pacific Islander; black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Native American/Alaskan Native; and white, non-Hispanic), K = 5 and there are (5*4)/2 = 10 possible comparisons among the categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha level for a single t test (for example, .05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons in order to produce a new alpha that is corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: (1) where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and sel and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates to be compared were not independent, a covariance term was added to the denominator of the t-test formula. Because the actual covariance terms were not known, it was assumed that the estimates were perfectly negatively correlated. Consequently, 2(sei*sei) was added to the denominator of the t-test formula."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX C: TECHNICAL NOTES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sources of Data", "text": "This report draws from a number of NCES data sets that contain information about teachers.

It is the third in a series of cross-sectional school-focused surveys, following ones in 1990-91 and 1987-88. The survey includes seven questionnaires that were sent to public school districts, public and private schools, and administrators of and teachers in both public and private schools. Details follow for all except for those sent to administrators, because administrator data were not used in this book.2 The Teacher Demand and Shortage Questionnaire for Public School Districts. All local education agencies (LEAs) that had at least one school selected for the school sample were included in the LEA sample for the Teacher Demand and Shortage (TDS) Questionnaire. In addition, a sample of 109 LEAs that did not contain eligible schools was selected directly. Only 5 of these 109 were actually in scope (that is, they reported hiring teachers). The total LEA sample initially selected was 5,464. The final sample included responses from 4,993 LEAs. The data were weighted to reflect the universe of public school districts. The weights were subsequently adjusted for survey nonresponse, and data were imputed for item nonresponse. The Public School Questionnaires. Public School Questionnaires were mailed to the 9,956 public schools in the sample. Public schools were sampled from the Common Core of Data (CCD) file for the 1991-92 school year. The CCD is believed to be the most complete list of public schools available; state education agencies report data on schools to NCES. The schools in the sampling frame were stratified first into one of four types: A) BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) schools; B) Native American schools (schools with 19.5 percent or more Native American students); C) schools in Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia (where it was necessary to implement a different sampling strategy to ensure that at least one school from each LEA in the state was included); and D) all other schools. Type B schools were stratified by Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Washington, and all other states together (except Alaska, since most Alaskan schools have high Native American enrollment); type C schools were stratified by state first and then by LEA; and Type D schools were stratified by state (all states and the District of Columbia except Delaware, Nevada, and West Virginia). The next level of stratification was_by grade level (elementary, secondary, or combined). Before sampling, non-BIA schools were sorted within each stratum by state, LEA urbanicity (central city, urban fringe, or rural area), LEA zip code (first three digits), CCD LEA ID number (a unique number assigned to each school district by NCES), school percent minority enrollment (less than 5.5 percent, between 5.5 and 20.5 percent, between 20.5 and 50.5 percent, or more than 50.5 percent), highest grade in school, school enrollment, and CCD School ID. Schools were systematically selected with probability proportional to the square root of the number of teachers within a school as reported on the CCD file. The Private School Questionnaires. The private school sample of 3,315 schools was selected primarily from 'Much of the discussion in this section on SASS is taken from R.  1The administrator data have not been included here because they were not used in this report. 2Takes into account the 5 percent of public schools that did not provide teacher lists. 3Takes into account the 9 percent of private schools that did not provide teacher lists. 4 Takes into account the 15 percent of private institutions that did not provide instructor lists. APPENDIX C: TECHNICAL NOTES the 1991-92 Private School Survey (PSS) list frame. The list frame was stratified first by school association membership (19 categories), then within association membership by grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined), and within association and grade level by four Census geographic regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Within each stratum, private schools were sorted by state, highest grade in the school, urbanicity (seven categories), zip code (first 2 digits), 1991-92 PSS enrollment, and PSS PIN number (an identifier assigned by the QED list or the Bureau of the Census). Within each stratum, private schools were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to the square root of the 1991-92 PSS number of teachers in the school. Data items on the School Questionnaires were imputed for item nonresponse using several procedures, including the hot-deck procedure. The Public and Private School Teachers Questionnaires. A total of 56,736 public and 11,548 private school teachers were selected from the sampled public and private schools. For public schools, the average number of teachers selected per school varied by wave of data collection. Teachers were selected in three waves in order to prevent the straggling teacher listing forms from delaying the teacher sampling process. At the end of the first wave, due to a higher than expected listing form response rate, the projected total sample size was running higher than expected. To compensate, the average number of sample teachers per school was lowered for subsequent waves of teacher sampling. In the first wave, the average number of teachers for public elementary, secondary, and combined schools were 3.64, 7.28, and 5.46, respectively. In the subsequent waves, these numbers were lowered to 3.1, 6.1, and 4.6. The average number of teachers selected in private schools were 4, 5, and 3 teachers for elementary, secondary, and combined schools, respectively. Within each school, teachers were stratified into one of five teacher types in the following hierarchical order: 1) Asian or Pacific Islander; 2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; 3) bilingual/ESL; 4) new teachers (those in their first, second, or third year of teaching; and 5) experienced teachers. Within each teacher stratum, elementary teachers were sorted into general elementary, special elementary, and \"other categories.\" Secondary teachers were sorted into mathematics, science, English, social studies, vocational education, and \"other\" categories. When combined schools had both elementary and secondary teachers, the teachers were sorted by grade level/primary field of teaching. Within each stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. New teachers were oversampled in private schools, but oversampling in public schools was not necessary."}, {"section_title": "SASS Variable Definitions", "text": "Public School District. A public school district (or LEA) was defined as a government agency administratively responsible for providing public elementary and/or secondary instruction and educational support services. The agency or administrative unit was required to operate under a public board of education. Districts that did not operate schools but that hired teachers were included. A district was considered-out of scope if it did not employ elementary or secondary teachers of any kind, including special education and itinerant teachers. Public and Private Schools. A public school was defined as an institution that provides educational services for at least one of grades 1-12 (or comparable ungraded classes), has one or more teachers who provide instruction, is located in one or more buildings, receives public funds as primary support, has an assigned administrator, and is operated by an education agency. Schools in juvenile detention centers and schools located on military bases and operated by the Department of Defense were included. A private school was defined as a school not in the public system that provides instruction for any of grades 1-12 where the instruction was not given exclusively in a private home. (If it could not be determined whether or not it operated in a private home, the school had to have at least 10 students or more than one teacher.) Schools that taught only prekindergarten, kindergarten, or adult education were not included. Community Type. Community type was derived from the seven-category \"urbanicity\" code (locale) developed 431 C -5"}]
