[{"section_title": "", "text": "The characteristics extracted from DTI have also been studied for the classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD,and have achieved some results (Jung, Lee, Kim, & Mun, 2015; Wee et al., 2012) . In addition, fMRI has also been used as an imaging technique based on blood oxygen level-dependent contrast (BOLD) signals for detecting human cortical nerve activity (Heeger & Ress, 2002) . The brain function network based on fMRI mainly studied the connection between GM regions in different states. The analysis of functional connectivity (FC) between GM in AD patients has a positive impact on revealing the pathological process of AD (Liu, Yu, Zhang, Liu, & Duan, 2014; Scherr et al., 2018) .\nIn recent years, increasing literature has reported WM activities detected by fMRI. For example, activation in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was observed in a magnetic field of 4T (Mazerolle et al., 2013) ; on the other hand, Tettamanti et al. used specialized task paradigms to detect enhancement of BOLD signals in WM (Tettamanti et al., 2002) . Ding et al. observed similar tempo- ral and spectral profiles between GM and WM at rest (Ding et al., 2013) and observed that their relative low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) signal powers were comparable (Ding et al., 2016) . Then, Chen et al. (2017) constructed a functional correlation tensor of WM based on the BOLD signal and used it for the classification of MCI to obtain better classification performance. Furthermore, Zhang et al proposed a noise-robust functional correlation tensor based on BOLD signals in the white matter and demonstrated its utility in AD diagnosis . Ding et al. (2018) compared the changes in BOLD signals between WM under a resting state and WM under a visual stimulation task state, and the synchronous activity and correlation between WM and GM were studied, which provided strong evidence that BOLD signals in WM can reflect neural activity under different states and demonstrated that the fluctuation in the BOLD signals in WM is significantly correlated with specific GM regions. Huang et al. (2018) detected WM activations under visual stimulation by analyzing the spatial distributions of BOLD signal frequency spectra, confirming that BOLD signal variations in WM are modulated by neural activity.\nInspired by these results, the current paper examined static and dynamic FC within GM and between WM and GM in order to evaluate the methods and areas most useful as feature sets for distinguishing NC from AD. These features will be evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The flowchart of the proposed method is shown in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "| ME THODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Materials and preprocessing of rs-fMRI data", "text": "In this study, the data used were selected from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). Forty-five AD patients were selected as the AD group, and 45 age-and gender-matched normal cognitive subjects were selected as the NC group. The specific information is shown in Table 1 .\nThe fMRI images of each subject were obtained with 3.0 T scanners. Images were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, it's repetition time is 3 s, echo time is 30 ms, flip angle is 80, slices = 48, and field of view is 212 mm RL, 198.75 mm AP, and 159 mm FH. The voxel size was 3.13 \u00d7 3.13 \u00d7 3.13 mm 3 , and the SPM12 software package (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software) was used to preprocess the rs-fMRI data. First, the images were corrected for slice timing and head motion, and subjects with substantial head motion (larger than 2 mm or 2\u00b0) were removed from the analysis. Then, T1-weighed images were segmented into GM and WM, and then, these images were registered to the corrected BOLD image. Next, the fMRI images were normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and the images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 mm 3 . And a bandpass filter was used to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise, a signal of 0.01-0.1 Hz was obtained."}, {"section_title": "| Construction of functional connectivity", "text": "Eighty-two ROIs in GM were selected by the Brodmann atlas, and 48 ROIs in WM were selected using the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 atlas. By calculating the average BOLD time series of all voxels in each ROI, F I G U R E 1 Framework of the proposed method the regional average BOLD signal was obtained, which reflects the regional neural activity at the corresponding time.\nSince rs-fMRI reflects an unstable spontaneous cognitive activity, static FC loses some information, which may underestimate the complex and dynamic interaction patterns between different brain regions, and dynamic FC changes over time reflecting additional and rich information about brain activities. Therefore, a sliding time window strategy, a popular approach Leonardi et al., 2013; Wee, Yang, Yap, & Shen, 2016) , was used to construct dynamic FC, while static FC was also obtained as a comparison.\nSpecifically, for each subject, the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted as r, of each ROI pair between GM was calculated directly to construct a static FC of GM (sGFC). And static FC between GM and WM (sWGFC) was obtained by calculating each ROI pair's r between WM and GM. Then, a sliding time window strategy was applied, and a complete time series was divided into several subsequent series by overlapping windows. We allowed the window length to be 30 and the step size to be 1. Then, the correlation coefficient of each subsequence was calculated and denoted as\nwhere i and j represent the i-th and j-th ROI, and k represents the k-th subsequence. A complete time series is divided into K subsequences. Next, the RMS feature of FC was calculated by the following formula:\nThe RMS value is also known as the quadratic mean in mathematics and reflects the fluctuation level of the signals Dey & Tech, 2014) .

Then, a two-sample t test was used to select ROI pairs with significant differences to be used as the feature subset for the classification test. For sFC and dFC, we tested different p-value and corresponding accuracy, selected the feature subset with the highest accuracy.

Feature subsets selected from dWGFC achieved a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, and its ACC was 81.11%, which is higher than that of the other three methods. Sensitivity reflected the ability to confirm AD patients, while specificity reflected the ability to confirm a normal control. A better balance between sensitivity and specificity reflected a better generalization ability of the feature subsets, which means that the association between the WM and GM signals based on fMRI has positive significance in distinguishing AD from NC. (Fletcher, Carmichael, Pasternak, Maier-Hein, & DeCarli, 2014; Habes et al., 2018; Medina et al., 2006; Shu, Wang, Qi, Maier-Hein, & DeCarli, 2011; Xie et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "| Analysis of physiological significance", "text": "The superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and fronto-occipital fasciculus belong to long contact fibers, which are connected with the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere. and its abnormality leads to damage of the nerve circuit and affects cognitive function, as well as visual spatial processing, object recognition and memory (Catani, Jones, Donato, & Ffytche, 2003) . It is generally believed that the structural integrity of the cingulum, fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus is closely related to AD (Perea et al., 2016) . The corpus callosum and fornix belong to combined fibers, that connect the left and right hemisphere cortices. The complex connection of corpus callosum fibers makes it possible for the functional integration of bilateral cerebral hemispheres to ensure normal development of human emotions and various cognitive activities. As a result, damage to different parts of the corpus callosum may lead to different symptoms (Mielke et al., 2009 ).\nThe fornix is an important part of the limbic system, which plays an important role in situational memory, emotional behavior and cognition (Nestor, Fryer, Smielewski, & Hodges, 2003) . Damage to the fornix will lead to cognitive impairment and memory decline in patients. Posterior thalamic radiation and corona radiata belong to projection fibers, and posterior thalamic radiation passes through the posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Damage to the posterior limbs of the internal capsule is closely related to motor and sensory dysfunction in AD patients.\nIn addition, the GM ROIs involved included the piriform cortex, gyrus, and the motor and somatosensory cortex. These areas are closely related to olfaction, emotion, learning, memory, and motor, and sensory functions (Chang et al., 2016; Choo et al., 2010; Daulatzai, 2015; Golob, Miranda, Johnson, & Starr, 2001; Grady, Furey, Pietrini, Horwitz, & Rapoport, 2001; Suv\u00e0 et al., 1999; Wolk, Das, Mueller, Weiner, & Yushkevich, 2017) .\nWhite matter is the area where nerve fibers congregate in the brain and carrying the transmission of information. The loss of connection between different ROIs reflects different degrees of brain damage, leading to different clinical manifestations. The FC between WM and GM can reflect this disconnection more comprehensive, which suggests that we should pay more attention to these changes in the process of cognitive impairment and AD."}, {"section_title": "| Limitations", "text": "It should be noted that this study has some limitations.
