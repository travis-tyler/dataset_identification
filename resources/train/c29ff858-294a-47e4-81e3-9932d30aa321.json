[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of hippocampal volume and CSF A\u03b2, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible for some of the observed disease heterogeneity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is increasingly prevalent among those aged 65 years and over. AD prevalence is projected to triple by the year 2050 (Hebert et al., 2001 ) making it vital to achieve early and accurate diagnosis and to discover disease-modifying therapies. The only feasible approach for presymptomatic diagnosis to date is through the use of biomarkers.\nHippocampal atrophy is the most established AD structural imaging biomarker. Hippocampal atrophy is seen in normal aging, yet in the latent AD stages hippocampal atrophy becomes greatly accelerated (Apostolova et al., 2006 (Apostolova et al., , in press, 2010a Jack et al., 1997 Jack et al., , 1998 Jack et al., , 2000 . Hippocampal atrophy shows strong correlation with cognitive decline (de Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000; Fleischman et al., 2005; Mortimer et al., 2004) and with AD pathologic markers such as neuronal and neurofibrillary tangle counts and Braak and Braak pathological stages (Apostolova et al., 2010b; Bobinski et al., 1995 Bobinski et al., , 1997 Schonheit et al., 2004; Zarow et al., 2005) .\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid beta protein (A\u03b2) and tau are the most established AD fluid biomarkers. Pathologic A\u03b2 deposition in the brain tissue is thought to occur early in the disease course and is associated with low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (Blennow and Hampel, 2003) . CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are significantly elevated in subjects with AD (Andreasen et al., 2001; Blennow et al., 1995; Clark et al., 2003; Galasko et al., 1998) and are thought to reflect neurodegeneration of tau-containing neurons. Unlike CSF A\u03b2 42 (Wallin et al., 2006) , CSF t-tau and p-tau changes occur later in the disease course and are associated with cognitive decline (Buerger et al., 2002 (Buerger et al., , 2005 Riemenschneider et al., 2002; Wallin et al., 2006) .\nSeveral research groups have independently investigated the individual accuracy of these biomarkers to differentiate cognitively normal elderly, MCI and AD subjects (Andreasen et al., 2001; Brys et al., 2009; de Leon et al., 2006; Frisoni et al., 2009; Galasko et al., 1998; Hampel et al., 2004; Mattsson et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2009 ). Yet while biomarker changes are clearly present years before AD is diagnosed, no single biomarker can adequately predict conversion to AD or serve as a diagnostic tool with an acceptable level of accuracy.\nMany groups including ours have made important strides towards multimodal biomarker diagnostic discrimination (Cui et al., 2011; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Ewers et al., 2012; Kohannim et al., 2010; Vos et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2010; Westman et al., 2012) . Here we combined imaging and CSF biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset to compare the performance of unimodal (hippocampal atrophy or CSF biomarkers alone) and multimodal (hippocampal atrophy, CSF variables and ApoE genotype combined) biomarker classifiers for differentiating NC, MCI and AD. We also examined to what extent the amyloid (i.e., CSF A\u03b2 42 ) and the neurodegenerative biomarkers (CSF tau, CSF p-tau and hippocampal atrophy) play a role for differentiating different disease stages from each other and for predestining conversion to AD. In addition we sought to determine the effect of ApoE4 genotype on diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used preparing this article were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

The mathematical principle by which SVM performs pattern recognition is by finding a multidimensional plane that maximizes the margin between data points in different classes (Vapnik, 1995) . SVMs have been particularly successful in biological classification problems, as non-linear kernels can be introduced to the algorithm so that non-planar, multidimensional surfaces can instead be used to classify patterns of data. In our study, we implemented the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and optimized its width or \u03b3 parameter (as well as the SVM cost or C parameter) through grid search using the e1071 package (Dimitriadou et al., 2006) in R (http://cran.r-project.org). Often, addition of non-contributory features can reduce classification performance. For this reason, we ranked our features based on the elements of a linear SVM's normal vector (i.e., |w i |; (Guyon et al., 2002) ) and iteratively removed those with lower weights to find sets of features that yield maximal classification accuracies.\nWe trained the SVM algorithm with CSF, ApoE4 and imaging measures for subjects with known diagnoses and used the leaveone-out approach to predict each new subject's diagnostic category. This process was repeated n times and the machine's predictive accuracy was measured by summing up the correct and incorrect classifications.

The MCI vs. AD ascertainment, as expected, proved to be more challenging for unimodal and multimodal classifiers alike presumably due to the fact that the MCI biomarker pattern is rather similar to the one seen in AD. The multimodal biomarker classifier approach had better diagnostic and predictive power than any unimodal classifier.\nSeveral important observations can be made from the discriminative classifier performance. CSF A\u03b2 42 played a significant role in discriminating NC from MCI and AD but was not selected by the MCI vs. AD classifiers while CSF p-tau contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from both NC and MCI, yet played no role in differentiating NC from MCI. These observations are in agreement with the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD where amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course and neurodegenerative markers (here CSF p-tau) become abnormal later in the disease course. Interestingly hippocampal atrophy and CSF t-tau seemed quite ubiquitously used by most classifiers including the NC vs. MCI classifiers, suggesting that these neurodegenerative biomarkers are becoming abnormal somewhere between the CSF A\u03b2 42 and the CSF p-tau changes.\nCSF A\u03b2 42 proved to be useful for differentiating NC from MCI only among ApoE4-negative but not ApoE4-positive subjects. This is likely due to the fact that many ApoE4-positive cognitively normal elderly already have significant brain amyloidosis and low CSF A\u03b2 42 rendering amyloid biomarkers insensitive for differentiating NC and MCI. At the same time neurodegenerative biomarkers (CSF tau, CSF p-tau and/or hippocampal atrophy) were readily chosen in both ApoE4-positive and ApoE4-negative NC vs. MCI classifiers establishing their discriminative role for patients with either genotype.\nBoth amyloid and neurodegenerative biomarkers were readily chosen by the conversion classifiers. Similar to the observations of others (Cui et al., 2011; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Ewers et al., 2012; Vos et al., 2012; Westman et al., 2012 ) the classifier accuracies in the full sample were marginal at best. However once split by ApoE4 genotype we observed that hippocampal volume and sex were helpful for predicting conversion to AD among ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau was helpful for the prediction of conversion to AD among ApoE4-negative MCI subjects. Both classifier algorithms chose only markers of neurodegeneration as one might expect to be the case in the symptomatic MCI stage. These conclusions are well supported by data from a recent paper by Jack et al. showing that among amyloid positive MCI subjects hippocampal atrophy, and not amyloid burden, predicted shorter time to progression to dementia because amyloid load plateaus (Jack et al., 2013) while hippocampal volume does not .\nThe CSF outperformed the hippocampal metrics in discriminating NC from MCI and AD. Low CSF A\u03b2 42 is tightly linked to the presence of amyloid pathology in the brain while hippocampal atrophy is criticized for being a nonspecific measure observed in many disease states and in normal aging (Apostolova and Thompson, 2008) . Techniques capable of detecting hippocampal atrophy in selected subfields are being developed (Apostolova et al., 2010a,c; Csernansky et al., 2000; Mueller and Weiner, 2009 ) and some have even demonstrated ability to detect hippocampal atrophy in the presymptomatic disease stages (Apostolova et al., 2010c) . Alternatively more sophisticated MRI measures such as for instance the Structural Abnormality Index (STAND), which captures hippocampal and cortical atrophy, can also improve the ability of MRI for predicting future decline (Vemuri et al., 2009a,b) .\nIn contrast to other groups that have published multimodal diagnostic classification papers using ADNI data (Cui et al., 2011; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Ewers et al., 2012; Kohannim et al., 2010; Vos et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2010; Westman et al., 2012) we also investigated classifier performance after ApoE4-stratification (i.e., investigated the classifier performance separately in carriers and noncarriers). This led to some interesting observations in respect to the modulatory effect of ApoE4 genotype on biomarker trajectory in AD. It is fascinating that support vector machine classifiers can help uncover interesting observations in respect to AD pathophysiology. This is a novel way of utilization of a statistical methodology thought by many to be only capable of diagnostic discrimination and outcome prediction.\nAlthough multicollinearity can be a problem for multiple linear regression, it is standard for SVMs to be provided with thousands of correlated predictors, and still perform very well. Only certain kinds of machine learning methods, such as naive Bayes methods, assume that the inputs of the classifier are statistically independent. Even when inputs considered to be an n-dimensional vector by SVM, are highly correlated, the SVM will find the optimal hyperplane for separating the samples and making decisions to categorize or classify future data.\nCorrelation among inputs is less of an issue when making predictions. Redundancy among predictors is common and does not undermine the predictive accuracy of the classifier. However correlated inputs do tend to complicate the interpretation of which predictor variables are driving the effects. This is more of an issue if the classifier is considered as a \"descriptive\" model -telling us the relative importance of variables for the prediction, but it is less of an issue for predictive accuracy as many of the redundant predictors can be used.\nWhen one fits an SVM with multiple predictors, if the predictors are correlated, SVM might pick some predictors on one occasion and may do equally well on another occasion using other predictors. SVM will always pick the one that minimizes the error. Sometimes the accuracies of certain feature combinations are very close, yet SVM will pick the one with the lowest error. It does not mean that the other dropped variables might not be predictive, only that they are sufficiently redundant with the ones that were used that they were not chosen.\nThis study has several strengths and limitations. The strengths of ADNI lie in its large size, its detailed cognitive assessment protocol and careful diagnostic ascertainment, as well as in the implementation of unified MRI and CSF collection and processing strategies across multiple sites and the meticulous data quality control. Yet ADNI was designed to inform decisions about future disease modifying clinical trials and as such it employs the rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria typical of clinical trials. As such, the ADNI cohort is not a complete representation of the elderly population and its findings should be generalized with caution; for example, the classification accuracies may be poorer in populations with a great mix of conditions and co-morbidities. Another relative weakness of our study is the etiologic/pathologic uncertainty in the MCI stage as at least 30% of amnestic MCI subjects have been found to harbor non-AD pathology (Jicha et al., 2006) . Even so, etiologic heterogeneity should not be expected to invalidate the biomarker-to-biomarker correlations across the pooled sample.\nAnother important limitation of our study is the classifiers' exclusive reliance on biomarkers for diagnostic categorization. By doing so we inadvertently compromise our ability to accurately classify AD vs. MCI subjects as the diagnostic distinction between these categories is determined by the presence or absence of functional decline which cannot be ascertained from biomarker data. Thus it is not surprising that our biomarker-based classifier models failed to discriminate between MCI and AD. However we must acknowledge that providing our classifiers with functional or cognitive variables would have introduced a circularity argument, as cognitive variables were used for diagnostic ascertainment of ADNI subjects.\nOne must also take under consideration that CSF tau and p-tau changes do not accurately reflect (i.e., lag behind) the severity and extent of tau pathology in the AD brain. CSF biomarkers are just peripheral surrogates of actual tau pathology. Several tau-imaging ligands are currently under development. Such technology might provide a much more accurate metric of tau pathology and contribute meaningfully to an improved understanding and staging of the early and presymptomatic stages of AD. Last but not least, our classifier results will benefit from independent validation in a different cohort with similar longitudinal follow-up and biomarker data availability.
