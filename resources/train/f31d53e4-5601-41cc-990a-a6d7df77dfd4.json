[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "The benefits of graduate education are wide ranging. Individuals gain notable financial returns as well as personal and intellectual benefits. For society, well-educated and highly trained professionals contribute to economic and technological development (McMahon 1998). It is important, therefore, to understand the potential barriers that prevent access to and persistence in graduate education. This report addresses several important questions about graduate education: Who enrolls in graduate school? What degrees do they pursue? What are their completion rates? Which factors are related to students' enrollment in and completion of graduate education? The report uses data from the 1992-93 Baccalaureate and Beyond Study (B&B:93/03), a longitudinal study of students who earned a bachelor's degree during the 1992-93 academic year. Base-year information on this cohort was collected as part of the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). Graduates were interviewed again in 1994, 1997, and 2003. The estimates in this report are based on results of surveys with approximately 9,000 bachelor's degree recipients, representing about 1.2 million bachelor's degree completers from 1992 to 1993. This report focuses on 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients' persistence in and completion of graduate education within 10 years of earning a bachelor's degree. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's t statistic. All differences cited were statistically significant at the p < .05 level. The major findings are summarized below."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Enrollment", "text": "About 40 percent of 1992\u221293 bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 ( figure A, table 1). For 31 percent of graduates, their highest level of graduate enrollment by 2003 was a master's degree program; for 5 percent, it was a firstprofessional degree program; and for 4 percent, it was a doctoral degree program. To get a more complete picture of the graduate enrollment experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, this analysis grouped students who enrolled in more than one program separately from those who enrolled in a single program. About 30 percent of all bachelor's degree recipients enrolled in a single graduate or firstprofessional degree program, and 10 percent of graduates enrolled in more than one program. Specifically, 5 percent enrolled in more than one master's degree program; 2 percent enrolled in a master's and doctoral degree program; and 3 percent enrolled in a first-professional degree program and another graduate degree program (figure B, table 2). 1 1 Multiple programs were determined over the course of the 10-year period. For example, a student may have initially enrolled in one master's program early after completing a bachelor's degree, left the program, and subsequently returned to enroll in another master's program. Enrollment in a master's and doctoral or a first-professional and other program should not suggest that the student first enrolled in a master's degree program and then went on to pursue a doctoral or first-professional degree program. For example, a student may have enrolled in a doctoral degree program, but instead decided to finish with a master's degree. The opposite could be true as well: a student may have enrolled in a master's degree program and later decided to pursue a doctoral degree. The sequence of enrollment in multiple programs is not discussed in this report. Graduate enrollment was related to a number of demographic and academic characteristics, such as students' race/ethnicity, age, undergraduate major and grade point average (GPA), and parents' education. For example, Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely to enroll in a first-professional degree program than students in other racial/ethnic groups (14 vs. 4 to 5 percent, table A). Younger students were more likely than older students (48 vs. 27 to 36 percent) to enroll in a graduate degree program. The same was true for single students; they were more likely than married students (43 vs. 32 percent) to enroll in a graduate degree program (table 3). Students who had majored in biological sciences as undergraduates were more likely to enroll in a graduate degree program than students who had majored in other subjects (67 vs. 25 to 55 percent, figure C). Academic characteristics that students displayed as undergraduates were also important. Higher achieving students (with GPAs of 3.5 or above) were more likely to enroll in a graduate program than lower achieving students (52 vs. 23 to 43 percent, table A).\nThe results of the analysis examining students' likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program are shown in table 21. All 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients are included in the table. The first column shows the percentage of students who had enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 before controlling for all independent variables included in the model. The second column presents the least squares coefficients (expressed as percentages) from the commonality analysis. These coefficients represent the difference (either higher or lower) in percentage points that might be expected between the analysis group (e.g., male students) and the comparison group (e.g., female students) after controlling for the interrelationship of all other independent variables included in the analysis. Comparison groups are shown in italics. Significant least squares coefficients (indicated by asterisks) mean that the observed differences in the likelihood of attaining a graduate degree between the comparison groups and the analysis groups remain even after taking into account the covariation of all other independent variables. The relationship between two demographic variables (race/ethnicity and number of dependents) and graduate enrollment diminished after controlling for all other independent variables. After controlling for other factors, many demographic and academic characteristics (students' age, undergraduate major and GPA, marital status, educational expectations, and parents' education) maintained a significant relationship with enrollment in graduate school. For example, enrollment rates among students age 22 or younger were higher than among students ages 23-29. The relationship between graduate enrollment and parents' highest education level only partially remained. Students whose parents held a graduate degree were more likely to enroll in a graduate program than students whose parents had a high school degree or equivalent. Academic characteristics from students' undergraduate experience retained a significant relationship with enrollment in a graduate or first-professional degree program. Regardless of all other characteristics, students who had majored in biological sciences as undergraduates were more likely to enroll in graduate school than students who had majored in business and management, engineering, public affairs/social services, mathematics and other sciences, social science, and other fields. Students' undergraduate academic achievement retained a strong positive relationship with graduate enrollment, with students who had GPAs of 3.5 or above being more likely to enroll than those with lower GPAs.

Specifically, women were more likely than men to have earned a master's degree (49 vs. 44 percent), while men were more likely than women to have earned a first-professional (13 vs. 8 percent) or a doctoral degree (7 vs. 3 percent; table 14). The likelihood of earning a graduate degree was related to parents' highest education level as well, with the rate increasing from 53 percent among those whose parents had less than a high school education to 67 percent among those whose parents had a graduate degree. There was a strong relationship between a student's family responsibilities and graduate persistence and attainment. Students who were single or had no children before graduate enrollment were more likely to have earned a graduate degree, particularly a first-professional or doctoral degree, while students who were already married or had children were more likely to be still enrolled (table 15). Parenthood seemed to have a stronger negative effect for women than for men. For example, among men, having a child before graduate enrollment was negatively related only to their likelihood of attaining a firstprofessional degree; while it does appear that men having no children were more likely to attain a graduate degree, no statistical difference was detected (figure D). Among women, having a x child was negatively related to overall graduate degree attainment, especially of a firstprofessional and doctoral degree. Graduates' degree attainment did not necessarily align with students' educational expectations at the time they completed a bachelor's degree in 1992-93. This pattern was especially evident among those with doctoral degree aspirations: 11 percent of graduate students who expected to earn a doctoral degree had done so by 2003, while 41 percent had earned a terminal master's degree (table 16). About 46 percent of graduate students with firstprofessional degree expectations had earned a first-professional degree, and 57 percent of those with master's degree expectations had earned a master's degree.\nStudents who pursued multiple degree programs generally waited less time to enroll in a graduate degree program than those who enrolled in a single degree program. Students who enrolled in both a master's and doctoral degree program and those who enrolled in both a firstprofessional and other graduate degree program typically waited about 1 year to enroll.\n\nOverall, single and married students did not differ in terms of the number of years it took them to finish a first-professional degree (table 19b). However, married students appeared to be more likely than their single counterparts to finish a first-professional degree within 3 years (65 vs. 43 percent), whereas single students were more likely to finish in 3 to 5 years (44 vs. 19 percent). Because few first-professional degree recipients had dependent children before graduate enrollment, statistical comparisons were not possible. First-professional degree recipients who interrupted their enrollment took more time to complete a first-professional degree than those who did not take a break (4 vs. 3 years) (table 19c). No difference in time to degree was found between those who had enrolled in a graduate degree program immediately after completing a bachelor's degree and those who had delayed their enrollment for 1 to 3 years. Because few first-professional degree recipients attended part time, comparison between full-and part-time students was not possible.\n"}, {"section_title": "Time to Graduate Degree", "text": "Among students who completed a graduate degree within the 10-year study period, master's degree students took an average of 3 years to complete a degree, first-professional students took about 4 years, and doctoral students took about 6 years (figure 2 and figure E). The time it took students to complete a graduate degree was related to several student characteristics. For example, Hispanic students took longer than Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and White students to finish a master's degree (table 18a). Among students who had completed a master's degree, younger students (age 22 or younger) took less time to complete a degree than older students (age 30 or older). Not surprisingly, master's and firstprofessional degree recipients who interrupted xi their enrollment took more time to complete a degree than those who did not take a break between degrees (tables 18c and 19c). Because so few students had earned a doctoral degree by 2003 (only 5 percent of all graduate students; see table 12), comparisons between many subgroups of doctoral degree recipients were not possible due to small sample sizes."}, {"section_title": "Factors Related to Graduate Enrollment, Persistence, and Attainment", "text": "Three multivariate commonality analyses were performed to gain a better understanding of how graduate enrollment, persistence, and attainment were related to various demographic and academic characteristics. 2 The first analysis focuses on factors related to students' likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program after receiving a bachelor's degree. After controlling for other factors, several demographic and academic characteristics maintained a significant relationship with enrollment in graduate school. For example, enrollment rates among students age 22 or younger were higher than those among students ages 23-29 (table 21).

Rates of completion were higher among students who entered graduate school immediately after earning a bachelor's degree than among those who waited more than 5 years to enroll (table 22). Students who enrolled full time, enrolled continuously, and enrolled in multiple programs were more likely than their counterparts to complete a graduate degree. In addition, students who had ever received grants, employer assistance, or a tuition waiver to help pay for their graduate education also had a higher completion rate than those who had never received any of these types of financial aid. The third analysis broadens the definition of degree completion to include students who completed a graduate degree by 2003 or were still enrolled in a graduate program as of 2003. Enrollment characteristics and financial aid continued to play an important role in students' persistence: students who entered a graduate program immediately after earning a bachelor's degree, attended full time and did not take time off, enrolled in multiple programs, and had received grants, employer assistance, or a tuition waiver had higher persistence rates than their counterparts who waited more than 5 years to enroll, attended part time, took time off, enrolled in a single degree program, and had never received any grants, employer assistance, or a tuition waiver (table 22).\nThe tabular analyses described in this report show that many factors are related to graduate enrollment, persistence, and attainment. However, these relationships are bivariate and may reflect more complex relationships among multiple factors. For example, while the findings presented in table 12 indicate that younger students were more likely than older students to have earned a graduate degree by 2003, this may be due partially to the fact that younger students were more likely to enroll full time and were less likely to take time off (table 11), two factors significantly related to graduate degree completion (table 15). Because a bivariate relationship may conceal more complex relationships among several variables, the next step in this analysis is to examine the unique relationship between two variables while taking other variables into account. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"commonality analysis,\" in which a multiple linear regression is used to look at the relationship between an independent variable and an outcome variable while adjusting for the common variation among a group of independent variables. 12 For the purpose of this study, commonality analysis was performed on three outcome variables. The first analysis focuses on factors related to students' likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program after receiving a bachelor's degree. The independent variables examined in this analysis include demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, parents' education, marital status, and dependent status); academic characteristics (bachelor's degree major, bachelor's degree GPA); and educational expectations at the time of bachelor's degree completion. The second analysis examines factors related to the likelihood that graduate students had completed a graduate degree by 2003. The independent variables examined in the second and third analysis include student characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital and parental status before graduate enrollment, and parents' education); academic characteristics (educational expectations, undergraduate major and GPA, and type of bachelor's degree-granting institution); and graduate enrollment characteristics (entry time, enrollment continuity and intensity, type of program, graduate degree major, and whether the student ever received grants, employer assistance, or a tuition waiver). The last analysis broadens the definition of degree completion to include students who had completed a graduate degree or were still enrolled in a graduate degree program as of 2003 (often referred to as \"persistence to a degree\")."}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report uses data collected from the 1993/03 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03) over a 10-year period to examine characteristics related to graduate degree enrollment, persistence, and completion among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients.

For the individual, there are notable financial returns as well as personal and intellectual benefits. For society as a whole, well-educated and highly trained professionals contribute to economic and technological development. It is important therefore, to understand the potential barriers that prevent access to and persistence in graduate education. The variety of choices that students face after earning a bachelor's degree may affect their future educational and career paths. For example, decisions about employment, marriage, and whether to have children may be related to graduates' likelihood of enrolling in graduate school. The financial burden of undergraduate debts may also carry some weight in whether bachelor's degree recipients choose to pursue a graduate education or enter the workforce. Once students enroll in a graduate degree program, completion of that program is not guaranteed. The same factors listed above as well as other variables are investigated in this report as they relate to the likelihood of graduate enrollment and degree completion. Introduction 2 Using data from the B&B:93/97 follow-up, Perna (2004) showed that a larger proportion of women than men enrolled in programs at the master's degree level and that a smaller proportion enrolled in doctoral (2 vs. 4 percent) and first-professional degree programs (5 vs. 10 percent). After controlling for several financial, academic, and demographic variables using multinomial logit analyses (undergraduate education debt, dependency status and income, cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA), SAT/ACT quartile, parents' educational attainment, primary language spoken at home, and the value students place on financial success and family ties), differences in men and women's enrollment patterns disappeared at the master's level but remained at the first-professional and doctoral level. Researchers have reported differences in graduate enrollment patterns among students across racial/ethnic groups. Looking specifically at the 1993/97 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97) follow-up, Perna (2004) reported that a higher proportion of Asian/Pacific Islander students enrolled in a first-professional degree program (7 percent) than students in any other racial/ethnic group by 1997. Even after controlling for the same variables mentioned above, Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely to enroll in a firstprofessional degree program than White students. Perna also reported that an equal proportion of Black and White students enrolled in master's and first-professional degree programs. After controlling for several variables (major field of study, marital status, parental status, amount of undergraduate debt, income and dependency status in 1992-93, cumulative undergraduate gradepoint average, SAT/ACT quartile, parents' highest education, whether English was spoken in the home, a derived factor measuring success in the labor market, a derived factor measuring the importance of doing intellectually stimulating work, and parental involvement), however, the odds of Black students enrolling in a master's or first-professional degree program to not enrolling is higher than it is for White students. Age may also be a factor when students are considering enrolling in graduate school. Older students may feel pressure to begin a family and career. Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy (2001) reported that age was an important factor in graduate enrollment. Students who were age 22 or younger when they earned their bachelor's degree were more likely than older students to enroll in a graduate degree program during the 4 years following graduation (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001;Bradburn et al. 2003). Introduction program were higher among those who were single before earning a bachelor's degree than among those who were married. Similar patterns were reported for women who were parents. Among men, those who were married before earning a bachelor's degree had lower rates of enrollment in a first-professional or doctoral degree program than single men. Although marriage and parenthood were not generally related to men's graduate degree attainment, Price (2005) reported a positive relationship between the time of graduate enrollment and degree completion among married men. Men who were married at the time they began graduate school were on average 4 percent more likely to graduate than their unmarried counterparts, and they completed their degree about 4 months faster than unmarried men. Married women were not any more likely to graduate than single women, but they did complete their degree about 2.5 months sooner. Factors related to a student's undergraduate education, such as undergraduate major, grade point average, and selectivity of the undergraduate institution may contribute to a student's likelihood of enrolling in and success in graduate school. Graduates with bachelor's degrees in the life, social, and physical sciences were more likely to enroll in a graduate degree program before entering the labor force than graduates with degrees in engineering or computer science (Tsapogas and Cahalan 1996). This finding is consistent with the one reported by Millett (2003) that undergraduates who had majored in specific disciplines as opposed to applied fields were twice as likely to apply to graduate or first-professional school. Ethington and Smart (1986) reported that the selectivity of the undergraduate institution attended had a positive effect on graduate enrollment for men: those men who had attended more selective institutions were more likely than their peers in less selective institutions to enroll in graduate school. Academic achievement (average undergraduate GPAs) and social integration (involvement with peers and faculty) at the undergraduate institution were reported to be strong predictors of entry into a graduate program regardless of gender (Ethington and Smart 1986;Millett 2003;Choy and Geis 1997;Hearn 1987). High undergraduate GPAs for men, however, were a stronger predictor for them, whereas high levels of social integration were a stronger predictor for women (Ethington and Smart 1986). Introduction admission to a doctoral or first-professional degree program was slightly less among those who borrowed than among those who did not borrow (38 vs. 42 percent) (McCormick et al. 1999). Millett (2003) confirmed these findings after controlling for several variables. Students with debt ranging between $10,000 and $15,000 were one and a half times less likely to apply to a graduate degree program than students with no debt. 2 When looking at enrollment in, not just admittance to, graduate school, Choy (2000) and Millett (2003) found that the effect of undergraduate borrowing diminished when examining data from up to 4 years later. That is, there was no longer a measurable difference between borrowers and nonborrowers in the percentage who enrolled in a graduate degree program. Weiler (1991) also showed that indebtedness did not have an effect on entry into graduate school. Perhaps one of the biggest choices that students are faced with after earning a bachelor's degree is the choice between entering the workforce or pursuing a graduate education. Results from the 1994 Baccalaureate and Beyond follow-up showed that 88 percent of students entered the work force and were not attending graduate school (Heller 2001). Among those working in 1994, 63 percent were working in a professional field and 32 percent were working in a clerical or other technical position. By 1997, the percentage of graduates working in professional occupations increased to 79 percent (Heller 2001). The cost of pursuing a graduate degree can be estimated by the direct cost of tuition and fees, less any financial aid, and the estimated wages that students lose by not entering the workforce immediately after college graduation. Weiler (1991), using data from the third followup of the High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study of 1980 Seniors (HS&B-Sr:80/86), investigated the relationship between estimated forgone wages, based on bachelor's degree major, and graduate degree enrollment. Estimated forgone wages have a negative effect on enrollment in a master's degree program, but no effect on enrollment in a doctoral or firstprofessional degree program. Andrieu and St. John (1993) did a similar type of study although they investigated the relationship between expected earnings and graduate persistence for students attending public universities. In their study, graduate students enrolled in fields in which expected earnings were low were less likely to stay enrolled than students enrolled in fields in which expected earnings were high.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This report uses data collected over a 10-year period from the 1993/03 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03) to examine characteristics related to graduate degree enrollment, persistence, and completion among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. Base-year information on this cohort was collected as part of the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). Graduates were interviewed again in 1994, 1997, and 2003.

In fact, by 1997, 15 percent had attained a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). By 2003, a decade after completing a bachelor's degree, 40 percent of 1992-93 graduates had enrolled in a graduate degree program (table 1). Table 1 looks at the highest graduate enrollment among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. Master's degree programs were the most common, with 31 percent of bachelor's degree recipients enrolled in them, compared with 5 percent in first-professional degree programs and 4 percent in doctoral degree programs. 4 Looking specifically at graduates who enrolled in a master's degree program, 7 percent enrolled in an MBA program (Master of Business Administration), 9 percent enrolled in an MEd program (Master of Education), and 14 percent enrolled in another type of master's degree program. This section describes the characteristics related to graduate enrollment, the type of programs in which the 1992-93 graduates enrolled, and the extent to which they had enrolled in a graduate degree program."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics", "text": "It is important to consider the demographic characteristics related to graduate enrollment. Differences in graduate enrollment by race, gender, and age are addressed in this section. Graduate enrollment was related to a number of demographic characteristics, such as graduates' gender, race/ethnicity, and age and parents' education. Although gender differences were not apparent in graduate enrollment as a whole, there was a relationship between gender and Highest graduate enrollment enrollment in specific types of degree programs (table 1). As an example, men were more likely than women to enroll in MBA (9 vs. 6 percent), first-professional (6 vs. 4 percent), and doctoral degree programs (6 vs. 4 percent), and women were much more likely than men to enroll in MEd programs (13 vs. 4 percent). Black graduates were more likely than White graduates to enroll in a graduate degree program (45 vs. 39 percent). However, using data from the B&B:93/97 follow-up, McCormick et al. (1999) reported that among students who applied to a graduate degree program, Black graduates were admitted at a lower rate than Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and White graduates. Looking at enrollment in first-professional programs specifically, Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were more likely than graduates in other racial/ethnic groups to enroll within 10 years of earning a bachelor's degree (14 vs. 5 percent). The likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program was also related to age at bachelor's degree completion. In general, younger graduates were more likely to enroll than older graduates. For example, 48 percent of graduates age 22 or younger at the time of bachelor's degree completion enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program, compared with 36 percent of those age 30 or older. However, graduates age 30 or older when they completed a bachelor's degree were just as likely to enroll in an MBA or MEd program as their peers age 22 or younger (MBA: 8 percent each and MEd 10 percent vs. 9 percent). Bachelor's degree recipients' enrollment in a graduate degree program was related to their parents' highest education level. Enrollment in a graduate degree program increased from 34 percent among graduates whose parents had a high school education or less to 49 percent among those whose parents had a graduate degree.\nRates of graduate persistence and degree attainment were related to several demographic characteristics, such as students' gender, race/ethnicity, and age and their parents' education. For example, women were more likely than men to have earned a master's degree (49 vs. 44 percent) by 2003, but men were more likely than women to have earned a first-professional (13 vs. 8 percent) or a doctoral degree (7 vs. 3 percent) (table 14). Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely than students from other racial/ethnic groups to have earned a first-professional degree (26 vs. 7 to 9 percent). Although Black students were more likely than White students to attend graduate school after receiving a bachelor's degree (see table 1), they were less likely to obtain a graduate degree (54 vs. 63 percent). However, Black students were more likely than White students to be still enrolled in 2003 (25 vs. 14 percent), particularly in a master's degree program (16 vs. 10 percent). Students' age was also an important factor in their persistence in graduate programs and attainment of a degree. In general, the younger the students, the more likely they were to have earned a graduate degree, especially a first-professional or a doctoral degree. On the other hand, the older the students, the more likely they were to have left the program without earning a graduate degree. Approximately 2 percent of students whose highest degree was a first-professional degree majored in non-first-professional fields. These students were most likely miscategorized. "}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Education Characteristics", "text": "Undergraduate education may often be seen as the foundation for preparing students for graduate education. What might students do to prepare themselves for a graduate education during their undergraduate study? Some factors, such as undergraduate grade point average (GPA), undergraduate institution type, and field of study are related to the likelihood of a student enrolling in a graduate degree program. The cumulative GPAs of graduates were positively related to their rates of graduate enrollment. Higher achieving bachelor's degree recipients were more likely to have enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 than their lower achieving counterparts (52 vs. 24 to 43 percent, table 1). Graduates of private not-for-profit 4-year doctorate-granting institutions were more likely to have enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 than those who attended any other type of institution. Fifty percent of graduates from these types of institutions had enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program, compared with 33 to 41 percent of graduates from other types of institutions. This was especially apparent among graduates enrolling in first-professional degree programs, where graduates in private not-for-profit doctorate-granting institutions were more likely to enroll as students in other types of institutions (9 vs. 2 to 5 percent). The frequency of enrollment in a graduate or first-professional degree program was also related to undergraduate major. Graduates who had majored in business as undergraduates were less likely to enroll in a graduate degree program than graduates with other majors (25 vs. 34 to 67 percent), while graduates who had majored in biological sciences were more likely to enroll than graduates who had majored in other fields (67 vs. 25 to 55 percent). This was especially apparent among graduates who enrolled in a first-professional or doctoral degree program. Graduates who had majored in biological sciences as undergraduates were more likely to enroll in a first-professional or doctoral program than graduates who had majored in any other field (23 and 22 percent, respectively, vs. 2 to 10 percent and .5 to 15 percent, respectively). Furthermore, graduates who had majored in mathematics as undergraduates were generally more likely than graduates with other majors to enroll in a doctoral degree program (15 vs. .5 to 7 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in Multiple Graduate Degree Programs", "text": "To get a more complete picture of the enrollment experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, this analysis looks at whether students enrolled in more than one graduate degree program. The sequence of students' enrollment in various programs, their original degree expectations, and specific details about each program are not discussed, however. For example, students who enrolled in both master's and doctoral degree programs may have originally been on a doctoral degree track, but decided to switch to a master's degree program to expedite entry into the workforce. Conversely, some students working toward a master's degree may have decided that earning a doctoral degree would prove to be more valuable, and for some, completing a master's degree is a prerequisite for acceptance into a doctoral degree program while for others, completing a master's degree is a by-product of a doctoral program. Over the 10-year study period, 1 in 10 of the bachelor's degree recipients enrolled in more than one graduate degree program: 5 percent enrolled in multiple master's degree programs, 2 percent enrolled in both a master's and a doctoral degree program, 5 and 3 percent enrolled in both a first-professional and another graduate degree program (table 2). Younger graduates were more likely than older graduates to enroll in multiple degree programs (13 vs. 5 to 8 percent), as were those who had majored in biological sciences than those with other majors (29 vs. 4 to 18 percent). 6"}, {"section_title": "Marital and Parental Status", "text": "Family responsibilities, such as those associated with being married or having dependent children, may impose limitations on graduates' time and their likelihood of applying to and enrolling in graduate school. Regardless of gender, graduates who were married at the time they completed a bachelor's degree were less likely to enroll in a graduate degree program than graduates who were single (never married), divorced, separated, or widowed (32 vs. 42 to 43 percent; table 3). 7 The trend also was true for marital status in 1997. That is, graduates who were married 4 years after completing a bachelor's degree were less likely to enroll in a graduate degree program than their unmarried counterparts (35 vs. 45 percent). To gain a better understanding of the differences in enrollment patterns of single, unmarried graduates and married graduates, enrollment among these groups was examined at the program level. When examining enrollment (in single programs) by type of program, single graduates were more likely to enroll in a first-professional or doctoral degree program than married graduates (firstprofessional: 10 vs. 3 percent; doctoral: 3 vs. 1 percent). However, no detectable differences were found between married graduates and single graduates in their likelihood of enrolling in an MBA program (14 and 15 percent, respectively), but married graduates were more likely to enroll in an MEd program (21 vs. 14 percent). Among single graduates, there were some gender differences in enrollment patterns. Single women were more likely than single men to enroll in a graduate degree program (45 vs. 40 at bachelor's degree and 48 vs. 42 percent in 1997). Parenthood was negatively associated with enrollment in graduate school. Graduates who reported having dependent children in 1997 were less likely to enroll in a graduate degree program by 2003 than their counterparts who did not report having children (33 vs. 42 percent). This pattern was especially prevalent among bachelor's degree recipients who enrolled in firstprofessional, doctoral, and multiple degree programs that included a first-professional degree and a master's graduate degree program. Although no significant difference was detected, there was an apparent difference in enrolling in graduate school between women and men with dependent  \nMarried students or students with dependent children typically have more family responsibilities, which may impinge upon the time available to study. This is reflected in their rates of degree persistence and completion: students who were single or had no children before graduate enrollment were more likely to have earned a graduate degree by 2003, particularly a first-professional or a doctoral degree, whereas students who were married or had one or more children before graduate enrollment were more likely to be still enrolled (table 15). Marriage was an important factor in students' likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program regardless of gender: married men and women were less likely than their single counterparts to have attained a graduate degree (men: 58 vs. 66 percent, women: 51 vs. 66 percent), especially a first-professional (men: 6 vs. 16 percent, women: 3 vs. 11 percent) or a doctoral degree (men: 4 vs. 8 percent, women: 2 vs. 4 percent). Thirty-two percent of men who were divorced, separated, or widowed before enrolling in a graduate program were still enrolled in that program in 2003, compared with 13 percent of single men. Among women, 23 percent of those who were married were still enrolled, compared with 10 percent of single women. Parenthood seemed to be a stronger negative factor for women than for men with regard to their attainment of a graduate degree. For example, among men, having a child before enrollment was related negatively only to their likelihood of attaining a first-professional degree. Although it appears that men who have no children were more likely to earn a graduate degree than men with children, no statistical difference was detected. Among women, having a child was related negatively to overall graduate degree attainment, especially for completing a first-professional or doctoral degree. Because women with children needed more time than women without children to finish a degree, as described below, they were more likely to be still enrolled in 2003 (26 vs. 13 percent). The same pattern was observed for men, but no statistical difference was detected (21 vs. 14 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Expectations", "text": "Although graduate degree enrollments have increased since the 1970s (U.S. Department of Education 2002), the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who enroll in graduate school is less than the percentage who state they would like to attain a graduate degree at the time of bachelor's degree completion in 1992-93. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, less than one-half (35 percent) of graduates who expected to earn a master's degree enrolled in a graduate degree program. This gap between expectations and enrollment was especially evident among those with doctoral degree aspirations. While 63 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who expected to earn a doctoral degree enrolled in graduate school, they were more likely to enroll in a master's than a doctoral degree program: a total of 41 percent had their highest enrollment in a master's degree program (6 percent in an MBA program, 12 percent in an MEd program, and 23 percent in another master's degree program), compared with 15 percent whose highest enrollment was in a doctoral degree program (table 4). However, graduates with doctoral degree aspirations were more likely than graduates with bachelor's and master's degree goals to enroll in a doctoral degree program. Similarly, the majority (70 percent) of bachelor's degree recipients with first-professional degree aspirations enrolled in a graduate degree program, and 36 percent enrolled in a firstprofessional degree program as their highest enrollment. A larger proportion of graduates with first-professional degree aspirations enrolled in that program than those with other degree expectations. Of graduates with master's degree expectations, just over one-third (35 percent) enrolled in graduate school, and 33 percent enrolled in a master's degree program. In looking at changes in graduates' educational expectations from 1993 to 1997 and the impact of those changes on rates of graduate and first-professional degree enrollment, graduates whose educational expectations increased from the 1993 to 1997 interviews were more likely than all other groups of graduates to enroll in a graduate degree program (59 vs. 30 to 42 percent) (table 5). Graduates with doctoral and first-professional degree expectations in 1997 were more likely to have enrolled in a graduate degree program than their counterparts with lower educational expectations (83 and 84 percent, respectively, vs. 7 and 42 percent). There were some gender differences in enrollment patterns, however. Women with master's degree expectations in 1997 were more likely to have enrolled in a graduate program than men with these expectations (44 vs. 39 percent), while men with first-professional degree expectations were more likely to have enrolled than women with similar expectations (91 vs. 73 percent). Graduates' educational expectations and completion of a graduate degree program are discussed in a later section of this report.\nGraduates' degree attainment did not align with their educational expectations at the time that they had completed a bachelor's degree. This was especially true among those with doctoral degree aspirations: 11 percent of graduate students who expected to earn a doctoral degree at the time of bachelor's degree completion (around 1993) had done so by 2003, and just 5 percent were still enrolled in a doctoral program in 2003 (table 16). Some with doctoral degree aspirations had earned another graduate degree: 41 percent had earned a master's degree, and another 10 percent had earned a first-professional degree. About 25 percent had left without completing any graduate degree. Compared with those with doctoral degree expectations, those with first-professional or master's degree expectations were more successful in achieving their goals: about 46 percent of graduate students with first-professional degree expectations and 57 percent of those with master's degree expectations had earned their expected degree by 2003. Overall, graduate students with first-professional degree expectations were more likely than those with master's or doctoral degree expectations to have attained a graduate degree (74 vs. 60 and 62 percent, respectively) and less likely to leave without attaining one (17 vs. 24 and 25 percent, respectively). As noted in table 4, about 17 percent of bachelor's degree recipients with expectations no greater than a baccalaureate degree enrolled in a graduate degree program. Among these students, about one-half (53 percent) had earned a graduate degree by 2003, including 45 percent of a master's degree, 6 percent of a first-professional degree, and 2 percent of a doctoral degree (table  16). About 23 percent were still enrolled in a graduate degree program in 2003. "}, {"section_title": "Timing of Entry Into Graduate School", "text": "Of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003, some 36 percent enrolled within 1 year of earning a bachelor's degree; 28 percent took between 1 and 3 years; 16 percent took between 3 and 5 years; and 20 percent took more than 5 years (table 6). On average, students enrolled within 2 or 3 years of earning a bachelor's degree. The average time between bachelor's degree receipt and first graduate enrollment was related to various student and institution characteristics, for example: gender, race/ethnicity, undergraduate major, age, undergraduate institution type, and marital status. There appeared to be some differences in how long students waited to enroll based on their gender and race/ethnicity. On average, men waited less time to enroll than women (2.5 vs. 2.8 years). Asian/Pacific Islander students enrolled within 2.1 years, on average. However, it has been shown that male and Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely to major in undergraduate fields in which students typically take less time off between bachelor's degree completion and graduate enrollment (such as life and physical sciences and engineering) (Bradburn et al. 2003). Students with undergraduate majors in biological sciences and in engineering and mathematics generally waited fewer years to enroll (1.8 and 2.0 years each, respectively) than students with other majors (2.3 to 3.5 years). Younger students and those age 30 or older waited less time to enroll in a graduate degree program than students ages 23-24 (2.5 vs. 2.9 years). Students who had attained a bachelor's degree from a public 4-year doctorate-granting institution typically waited longer to enroll in a graduate degree program than their counterparts at public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions (3.0 vs. 2.5 years). The opposite was true in the private sector. Students who had attended private not-for-profit doctorate-granting institutions typically waited less time to enroll than those at private not-for-profit non-doctorategranting institutions (2.5 vs. 2.8 years). Students who were single 1 year before graduate enrollment waited less time, on average, to enroll than students who were married, divorced, separated, or widowed regardless of gender (2.1 vs. 3.7 to 3.8 years; table 7). Also, regardless of gender, students who had no children 1 year before graduate enrollment typically took less time to enroll than those with children. Compared with students in any other type of graduate degree program, doctoral degree students typically waited the least amount of time between earning a bachelor's degree and enrolling in graduate school, while students in an MBA program waited the most time to enroll (table 8). The majority (65 percent) of students who enrolled in a doctoral degree program enrolled within 1 year of earning a bachelor's degree, as did about one-half of students who enrolled in a first-professional degree program. "}, {"section_title": "Sources of Financial Aid and Borrowing for Graduate School", "text": "As mentioned previously (table 6), 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients waited an average of 2 to 3 years to enroll in graduate school. Because a lack of financial resources may have contributed to their delay in enrolling, it is important to consider how students finance their graduate education. Information on tuition and costs of graduate attendance is not available for B&B; however, there is some information on sources of financial aid for graduate education that will be discussed below. Choy and Moskovitz (1998) used data from the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96) to examine patterns of financial aid receipt among students in graduate degree programs. Because 1992-93 graduates waited 2 to 3 years to enroll in graduate school, the data from NPSAS:96 approximately coincide with their typical entry year. Among all students who enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program in 1995-96, some 52 percent received some form of aid, 30 percent received grants, and 25 percent received loans. Students enrolled in first-professional programs were the most likely to receive aid (80 percent), followed by doctoral students (65 percent) and master's degree students (51 percent). At each follow-up, B&B students who enrolled in graduate school were asked if they ever received research or teaching assistantships, tuition waivers, employer assistance, grants, scholarships or fellowships, and loans. Table 9 presents information on highest graduate enrollment and various undergraduate characteristics (institution type, major, and GPA) as they relate to overall graduate school financing during the 10-year period. Loans were the most common source of financing for graduate school (45 percent), followed by grants, scholarships, or fellowships (23 percent), assistance from employers (19 percent), tuition waivers (10 percent), teaching assistantships (9 percent), and research assistantships (7 percent). Students whose highest graduate enrollment was in a doctoral degree program were the most likely, among all graduate students, to report receiving a research assistantship, teaching assistantship, tuition waiver, and grants or scholarships. Students enrolled in MBA programs (43 percent) were more likely to receive support for graduate education from an employer compared with students enrolled in other degree programs (5 to 18 percent). Similar to the findings reported by Choy and Moskovitz (1998), first-professional students (71 percent) were the most likely to receive loans to help pay for their graduate education, followed by doctoral students (63 percent) and master's degree students (35 to 40 percent). Undergraduate major was related to graduate financing. Students who majored in biological sciences as undergraduates were generally more likely to receive grants, scholarships, or fellowships and more likely to take out loans than students who majored in other fields. Business and management and engineering majors were more likely than other majors to receive funding for their graduate education from an employer. Compared with other majors, students who majored in mathematics and other sciences were more likely to receive a teaching assistantship and tuition waiver. Student's undergraduate performance, measured by GPA, was also related to graduate school financing. Students who earned a GPA of 3.5 or above were more likely to receive teaching assistantships, tuition waivers, and grants, scholarships, or fellowships. In short, students who were high achievers as undergraduates were more likely to receive merit-based 8 funding for graduate school. In Dealing With Debt: 1992-93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients 10 Years Later, Choy and Li (2006) used data from the 1993/03 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03) to further explore the financing of undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional education with this cohort. The results of that study show that 45 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who enrolled in graduate degree programs took out loans to help pay for that education and had borrowed an average of $33,200 by 2003 (table 10). Similar to findings among this cohort that undergraduate borrowing does not affect enrollment in graduate school, undergraduate borrowing did not appear to affect borrowing for graduate education (Millett 2003;Choy 2000). Choy and Li (2006) reported that students who borrowed $5,000 or more (55 to 58 percent) as undergraduates were more likely to borrow for graduate school than those who did not borrow at all (36 percent) or those who borrowed less than $5,000 (46 percent). Given that master's degree programs are typically shorter than first-professional or doctoral degree programs (see \"Time to Graduate Degree,\" below), students whose highest degree was a master's were the least likely of all graduate students to borrow to finance their education and they had borrowed the smallest amount. "}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Enrollment Enrollment Intensity and Continuity of Enrollment", "text": "Whether or not students enroll part time or full time or remain continuously enrolled may have a relationship with their likelihood of success. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003, about one-half attended exclusively full time, and 52 percent took off at least one semester or term (table 11). Students who had majored in biological sciences as undergraduates were more likely to enroll full time than those with other majors (79 vs. 30 to 63 percent). Students whose highest level of enrollment was in a doctoral or first-professional degree program were more likely to enroll full time than students enrolled in other graduate degree programs (73 and 84, respectively, vs. 30 to 48 percent). Furthermore, a greater proportion of students in first-professional degree programs were enrolled full time than students in doctoral degree programs (84 vs. 73 percent). Students in MEd programs typically were more likely to enroll part time. Several demographic characteristics, such as students' gender, race/ethnicity, age, and undergraduate GPA and parents' education, were related to students' enrollment intensity in a graduate or first-professional degree program. For example, men were more likely than women to attend graduate school full time (54 vs. 46 percent), as were Asian/Pacific Islander students than students of other race/ethnicities (61 vs. 43 to 49 percent). In general, younger students were more likely than older students to attend graduate school full time: 56 percent of students age 22 or younger at the time they earned a bachelor's degree were full-time students, compared with 33 percent of students age 30 or older. Furthermore, students with higher undergraduate GPAs were more likely to enroll full time than their counterparts with lower GPAs, as were students whose parents held graduate degrees than students whose parents had less education. "}, {"section_title": "Graduate Persistence and Attainment", "text": "This section of the report includes a discussion on persistence and attainment among those students in the B&B cohort who enrolled in graduate degree programs. Demographic characteristics and marital and parental status are looked at in relation to degree completion. The percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who are considering pursuing graduate studies is increasing. This section addresses whether students' educational expectations were realized. A large proportion of students with graduate expectations do not earn an advanced degree; the final part of this section discusses reasons why graduate students leave graduate school before completing a degree. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had enrolled in a graduate degree program between 1993 and 2003, 9 62 percent had earned at least one graduate degree by 2003. Looking at the highest degree earned, 47 percent had obtained a master's degree, 10 percent a first-professional degree, and 5 percent a doctoral degree (table 12). About 15 percent were still enrolled in a graduate degree program in 2003, and 23 percent were no longer enrolled and had not obtained a degree. The rate at which students completed a graduate degree was related to the type of graduate program in which they had enrolled and the modal length of the program. The completion rate was highest among first-professional students (71 percent), followed by master's students (60 percent) and doctoral students (43 percent). Because doctoral degree students typically need more time to finish their program (see \"Time to Graduate Degree,\" below), they were more likely than first-professional and master's degree students to be still enrolled in 2003 (28 vs. 11 and 13 percent, respectively). Master's degree students were more likely than first-professional and doctoral degree students to have left without completing a degree (27 vs. 15 and 11 percent, respectively). More than half of the master's degrees awarded to the B&B93 cohort were in education and business/management (table 13). Doctoral degree recipients tended to major in life and physical sciences (25 percent), engineering, mathematics, and computer science (14 percent), social and behavioral sciences (10 percent), and arts and humanities (8 percent).\nThe likelihood of graduate students earning a graduate degree was also related to their parents' highest education level, increasing from 52 percent among those whose parents had less than a high school education to 67 percent among those whose parents had a graduate degree. In addition, students whose parents had no more than a high school education were more likely than "}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "As expected, graduate persistence and attainment were related to the time taken between bachelor's degree completion and first enrollment in a graduate program. The shorter this time, the more likely students were to have earned a graduate degree by 2003 (table 17). On the other hand, the longer students delayed graduate enrollment, the more likely they were to be still enrolled. Other characteristics, such as enrollment continuity and intensity, are related to graduates' rates of persistence and attainment. Graduate students who enrolled continuously and full time were more likely than those who took time off or enrolled part time to have earned a graduate degree and less likely to have left without a degree. Part-time graduate students typically need more time than their full-time counterparts to finish their degree and therefore were more likely to be still enrolled in 2003 (19 vs. 9 percent). Looking at major fields of study for the highest level of graduate enrollment, 82 percent of law majors had attained a graduate degree (mostly a professional law degree) by 2003, a higher percentage than for those with all other majors. Following law majors were health professions majors (70 percent had earned a graduate degree by 2003) and life and physical science majors (67 percent), but this latter percentage was not measurably different from that for most other majors. 10"}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Leaving", "text": "Considerable attention has been paid to graduate attrition (Bowen and Rudenstine 1992;National Academy of Sciences 1996), but little research has actually focused on student-reported reasons for leaving graduate school. During the B&B:93/03 follow-up interview, students who indicated they had entered a graduate degree program between 1997 and 2003 and had left without completing a degree were asked to report the reasons they left. One of the most common reasons reported by students was a change in family status (30 vs. 1 to 16 percent) (figure 1) which supports earlier findings in this report suggesting that single students and students who had no children when they received a bachelor's degree were, in fact, more likely to persist and complete a graduate degree (table 15). According to student reports, other common reasons for leaving their graduate program without completing were related to their dissatisfaction with the program (16 percent), conflicts with their job and the military (17 percent) and needing to work (14 percent).  "}, {"section_title": "Master's Degree", "text": "A majority of master's degree recipients (70 percent) finished that degree within 3 years, 22 percent took 3-5 years, and 8 percent took more than 5 years (table 18a). The time it took to complete a master's degree was related to several student characteristics. For example, Hispanic students took longer than Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and White students to finish a master's degree. Older students (age 30 or older) took longer than younger students (age 22 or younger) to finish. Students whose parents had only a high school education were more likely to take 5 years or longer to complete a master's degree than those whose parents had a graduate degree. However, no gender differences were found in terms of the time it took to complete a master's degree. Graduate students majoring in social and behavioral sciences were more likely than those majoring in life and physical sciences, business and management, education, and arts and humanities to finish a master's degree within 3 years (86 percent vs. 53 to 70 percent). Graduate students majoring in medicine and health (85 percent) were also more likely than those majoring in business and management, education, and arts and humanities to finish a master's degree within 3 years (53 to 67 percent). Those who majored in arts and humanities were the least likely to complete a master's degree within that time frame (53 percent). In general, divorce, separation, or widowhood prolonged time to a master's degree: students who were divorced, separated, or widowed before enrolling in a master's degree program took more time to finish a master's degree than those who were either single or married (table 18b). However, this relationship was observed only for women. Having one or more children was also related to taking a longer time to obtain a master's degree. Again, this relationship was observed only for women. Late starters in a master's degree program seemed to finish that degree faster: those who had delayed graduate enrollment for more than 5 years after receiving a bachelor's degree took about 2 years to complete a master's degree, whereas those who had enrolled immediately took about 3 years to do so (table 18c). As expected, disrupted and part-time enrollment increased time to master's degree: students who took off at least one semester or enrolled part time took longer to finish than those enrolled continuously or full time or a mix of full and part time.  "}, {"section_title": "First-Professional Degree", "text": "First-professional degree programs are usually highly structured programs that take a set amount of time. First-professional degree recipients took about 4 years to finish that degree, and 87 percent finished within 5 years (table 19a). No gender differences were detected in their time to degree completion. Those who earned a first-professional degree were most likely to choose medical/health professions and law as their major fields of study (see table 13). A majority of health professions degree recipients (79 percent) took 3 to 5 years to finish a degree, the typical time for completing medical school. About 17 percent of health professions degree recipients finished a degree after more than 5 years. Most law degree recipients (79 percent) finished a degree within 3 years, the typical duration of law school, and 21 percent of them took more than 3 years to finish their law degree. "}, {"section_title": "Doctoral Degree", "text": "Doctoral degree recipients took about 6 years to complete that degree (table 20a). About two-thirds (65 percent) took more than 5 years to finish, 29 percent took 3 to 5 years to finish, and the remaining 6 percent finished within 3 years. National data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates reported the median number of years it takes students to complete a doctoral degree is 8 years (Hoffer et al. 2005). Because so few students had earned a doctoral degree by 2003 (only 5 percent of all graduate students; see table 12), comparisons between many subgroups of doctoral degree recipients were not possible due to small sample sizes and large standard errors (tables 20a, 20b, and 20c), with the exception that doctoral degree students who were enrolled continuously took less time to earn a degree than those who were not continuously enrolled (5 vs. 6 years) (table 20c). Although women appeared to be more likely than men to complete a doctoral degree within 3 years (11 vs. 3 percent), and men appeared to be more likely than women to finish in more than 6 years (29 vs. 22 percent), none of these differences were statistically measurable.

Students' age was the only exception: bivariate analysis revealed that students ages 23\u221224 were less likely than students age 22 or younger to have attained a graduate degree. This relationship partially remained after controlling for many other variables: students ages 23-24 were still less likely than students age 22 or younger to have earned a graduate degree. After controlling for all other variables, several graduate enrollment characteristics, such as entry time, enrollment intensity and continuity, and graduate degree program, retained a significant relationship with graduate degree completion. Regardless of all other characteristics, full-time students were more likely than part-time students to have earned a graduate degree by 2003. Students who entered a graduate program immediately after completing a bachelor's degree had a higher rate of graduate degree completion than those who waited more than 5 years to enroll. Completion rates were also higher among students who enrolled continuously than among those who took time off, as well as among those in multiple degree programs than among those in a single degree program. Regardless of the demographic, academic, and enrollment characteristics included in this analysis, students enrolled in master's degree programs were more likely than students enrolled in doctoral degree programs to earn a graduate degree.

As with degree completion, after controlling for all other variables, many demographic and academic characteristics were no longer significantly related to persistence. However, enrollment characteristics continued to play an important role: regardless of all other characteristics, students who entered a graduate program immediately after completing a bachelor's degree, attended full time, enrolled in multiple programs, and had received grants, employer assistance, or a tuition waiver had higher persistence rates than their counterparts who waited more than 5 years to enroll, attended part time and took time off, enrolled in a single program, and had never received any financial help in terms of grants, employer assistance, and a tuition waiver. Although doctoral degree students had a lower completion rate than master's degree students, both groups had similar persistence rates after controlling for other characteristics. This may be due to the fact that doctoral students typically take more time to finish a degree (table"}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "By 2003, some 40 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program (30 percent enrolled in a single program, and 10 percent enrolled in more than one program). Of those who continued, the highest level of graduate enrollment for 76 percent of graduates was a master's degree program, for 13 percent, it was a first-professional degree program, and for 11 percent, it was a doctoral degree program. Graduate enrollment was related to a number of demographic and academic characteristics, such as students' race/ethnicity, age, and undergraduate major and GPA and parents' education. Many of these characteristics retained a significant relationship with graduate enrollment after controlling for other variables. Graduates waited an average of 2 to 3 years from the time they completed a bachelor's degree to the time they first enrolled in a graduate or first-professional degree program. Students entering MBA programs typically waited the longest to enroll in graduate school (about 4 years) and doctoral degree students typically waited the shortest amount of time (about 1 year). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had enrolled in a graduate degree program between 1993 and 2003, some 62 percent had earned at least one graduate degree by 2003. Looking at the highest degree earned, 47 percent had earned a master's degree, 10 percent a first-professional degree, and 5 percent a doctoral degree. These attainment rates could increase in the future, as about 15 percent of bachelor's degree recipients were still enrolled in a graduate degree program in 2003. About one-fourth of students who enrolled in graduate school had left without completing a graduate degree by 2003. Attainment was higher among students who enrolled in first-professional programs than among master's or doctoral students: 71 percent of students who enrolled in a first-professional degree program had earned a first-professional degree by 2003, compared with 60 percent of master's degree students and 43 percent of doctoral degree students who earned degrees in their respective programs. The amount of time it took students to complete a graduate degree depended on the type of program in which they had enrolled. Among students who had completed a graduate degree by 2003, master's students took an average of 3 years to complete a degree, first-professional students took about 4 years, and doctoral students took about 6 years. Undergraduate education experiences mattered for graduate enrollment, persistence, and attainment of a graduate degree. After controlling for related factors, several undergraduate student characteristics, such as high achievement, age at bachelor's degree completion, and undergraduate major field of study, were related to enrollment in graduate school. In addition to the importance of undergraduate experiences, graduate enrollment experiences-such as the intensity and continuity of enrollment that students exhibited in a graduate degree programwere related to students' successful attainment of a graduate degree."}]
