INTRODUCTION", "text": "Network theory is a useful framework to describe many systems composed of interacting units, from social networks to the human brain [1] [2] [3] [4] . Real-world networks are very different from random graphs and are characterized by the existence of typical structures from the microscopic scale [5] to mesoscopic and macroscopic scales [6, 7] . A distinct large-scale structure is the so-called core-periphery organisation [8] , where nodes are partitioned into two different groups: the core, consisting of a group of central and tightly connected nodes, which are usually crucial to determine the overall behavior of the system, and the periphery, made by the remaining nodes. Since the seminal paper by Borgatti and Everett [8] , the core-periphery structure has been recognized as a fundamental property of complex networks [9] [10] [11] [12] , and has been found in several real-world systems, such as the world trade web [13] , many social [14] and biological networks [15] . A related concept is that of rich-club behavior, where the tightly connected nodes are the network hubs, i.e. the nodes with a large number of links [16, 17] . A rich-club organization has been observed in various real-world systems, such as social, technological and biological networks [16] [17] [18] [19] , as well as the brain [20] [21] [22] [23] . More recently, a refined version of the rich-club analysis, based not only on the number of connections of the hubs, but also on their capability to bridge different communities, has been shown to be relevant to support the integrative properties of a wide set of networks [24] .\nRich-club and rich-core organization, associated to the efficiency in communication and distribution of information, have been observed both in structural and functional brain networks obtained through image-processing from DTI or MRI data. In the human brain it has been conjectured that the rich cores, rather than the existence of shortest paths, may actually be responsible for the efficient integration of information between remote areas [20] , which is a crucial prerequisite for normal functioning and cognitive performance [25, 26] . In particular, current evidence suggests that posterior medial and parietal cortical regions mainly constitute the core of the human connectome, where links represent anatomical fascicles connecting different areas.\nThe units of many complex systems can interact in various different ways. In the standard network approach, different types of interactions are either analysed separately, losing the chance to integrate information coming from different layers of interactions, or aggregated all together neglecting the specific relevance and meaning of the different types of connections. Such systems can instead be better described as multiplex networks, i.e. networks with many layers, where the edges at each layer describe all the interactions of a given type [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Most of the network approaches in neuroscience have neglected the multi-layer structure of the brain, and only recent works has focused on multiplex networks to merge information from different neuroimaging modalities [32] , or from different frequency components [33, 34] . At difference with other mesoscale structure, such as community structure [35] [36] [37] , the existence and detection of core-periphery structures in multiplex networks is a topic largely unexplored, with the exception of approaches based on k-core decomposition [38, 39] .\nIn this work we introduce a new framework to identify and detect core-periphery organization in multiplex networks. The method we propose works for any number of layers and is scalable to large-scale multiplex networks, and is inspired to the algorithm by Ma and Mondragon for single-layer networks [19] . In the following, we first introduce the general framework and we illustrate how the procedure works on synthetic multiplex networks with tunable core similarity. We then apply our method to integrate information from structural and functional brain networks and obtain the first multiplex characterization of the core-periphery organization of the human brain. Our approach recovers the main hubs known in the literature, but also allows to highlight the central role played by the regions of the sensorimotor system, which has been surprisingly neglected by previous studies on core-periphery organization, despite being considered of fundamental importance in neuroscience.\nOur research shades new light on the emergence of the core regions in the human connectome, and we hope it will spur further work towards a better understanding of the complex relationships between structure and function of the brain."}, {"section_title": "II. RESULTS", "text": "A. Extracting the rich core of a multiplex network"}, {"section_title": "FIG.", "text": "1. An illustrative example of the multiplex rich core analysis. In panel (a) we show the curve\u03bc\nas a function of ranki for the Top Noordin Terrorist network, a multiplex social network with N = 78 individuals, M = 3 layers and K [1] = 259, K [2] = 437 and K [3] = 200, where\nindicates the number of links on layer \u03b1. All nodes from rank equal to 1 up to the node with maximum\u03bc + are part of the core of the multiplex network, which is shown in red color in panel (b). The cores obtained at each layer by a standard single-layer rich core analysis are reported for comparison in panel as yellow nodes (c).\nLet us consider a multiplex network described by a vector of adjacency matrices M = {A [1] , . . . , A [M ] }, where all interactions of type \u03b1, \u03b1 = 1, . . . , M , are encoded in a different layer described by the adjacency matrix A\n[\u03b1] , In our method to detect the core-periphery structure of a multiplex network, we first compute the multiplex degree vector\n} of each node i [31] . From now on, we refer to k [\u03b1] i , \u03b1 = 1, . . . , M, as the richness of node i at layer \u03b1. Notice that this is the simplest way to define the richness of a node, and different measures of richness, such as other measures of node centrality, can be as well used. For each layer \u03b1, we then divide the links of node i in those towards lower richness nodes, and those towards higher richness nodes, so that we can decompose the degree of node i at layer \u03b1 as k\n. Finally, the multiplex richness \u00b5 i of node i is obtained by aggregating single-layer information:\nwhere the coefficients c [\u03b1] modulate the relative relevance of each layer and can, for instance, be determined by exogenous information. In analogy to the single-layer case, we define the multiplex richness of a node towards richer nodes as:\nIn the most simple set-up we can assume c The nodes of the multiplex are ranked according to their richness \u00b5, so that the node i with the best rank, i.e. rank i = 1, is the node with the largest value of \u00b5, the node ranked 2 is the one with the second largest value of \u00b5, and so on. We then plot for each node i the value of \u00b5 + i as a function of rank i . Finally, the maximum of \u00b5 + i is evaluated as a function of the rank. All nodes with rank to the left of such a value are part of the multiplex core, whereas the remaining ones are part of the periphery. As an illustrative example of how our method works in Fig. 1 we report the curve \u00b5 + i as a function of rank i obtained in the case of the Top Noordin Terrorist network, a multiplex network of N = 78 individuals with three layers (encoding information about mutual trust, common operations and exchanged communication between terrorists), which has been used as a benchmark to test measures and models of multiplex networks [31] . Coefficients c [\u03b1] were chosen, in this case, to be inversely proportional to K [\u03b1] to compensate for the different densities of the three layers. The resulting multiplex rich core integrates information from all the layers and looks different from the rich cores obtained at each of the three layers by a standard single-layer rich core analysis.\nB. Testing the method on multiplex networks with tunable core similarity A network with a well defined core-periphery structure has a high density of links among core nodes. With a suitable labeling of the nodes, the adjacency matrix of the network can be decomposed into four different blocks: a dense diagonal block encoding information on core-core links, a sparser diagonal block describing links among peripheral nodes, and two off-diagonal blocks encoding core-periphery edges. The key feature of such block-structure is that \u03c1 1 \u03c1 3 , i.e. the density \u03c1 1 of the core-core block is much higher than that of the periphery-periphery block, \u03c1 3 . As first noted by Borgatti and Everett [8] , the density \u03c1 2 of the off-diagonal blocks is typically not a crucial factor to characterise a core-periphery structure.\nIn order to test how our method works on multiplex networks with different structures, we have introduced a model to produce synthetic multiplex networks with tunable core similarity. In particular, we have constructed networks in which, each of the M = 2 layers has N = 250 nodes and N c = 50 of them belong to the core. Each layer has the same average node degree k = 10, and the same set of parameters \u03c1 1 > \u03c1 2 > \u03c1 3 to describe its core-periphery structure. Our model allows to control the number of nodes that are both in the core of layer 1 and in the core of layer 2. (see Methods for the choice of the parameters and related discussion).\nIn order to quantify the similarity among cores at different layers, we introduce the core similarity S\n[\u03b1] c of layer \u03b1 with respect to the other layers as:\nwhere I\n[\u03b1\u03b2] c is the number of nodes which belong to the core of both layer \u03b1 and layer \u03b2, whereas\nis the size of the core at layer \u03b1. The core similarity S c . In Fig. 2 we show results for three multiplex networks with different core similarity. In Fig. 2 (a) we consider a multiplex with S c = 0. The cores of the two layers are not overlapping, with many nodes with high degree in one layer having low degree in the other one. In this case, the multiplex core of the system is formed by those nodes with sufficiently high multiplex richness. In Fig. 2(b) we consider a multiplex with S c = 1/2. Half of the core nodes are shared with the other level of the system, and half are typical of each level. The block representation of the two layers is partially overlapping, and the nodes are spread uniformly over the (k [2] i vs k [1] i plane. The multiplex core of the system in this case is formed by nodes which are part of the core on both layers, but also by nodes scoring extremely high in one layer, despite being periphery in the other one. At last, in Fig. 2 (c) we consider a multiplex with S c = 1. The block structure of the two layers is equivalent, the node degrees k [1] and k [2] at the different levels are correlated and most of the nodes belonging to each core are in the multiplex core of the system.

Merging structure and function to extract the connectome's core", "text": "We have applied our method to investigate the human connectome by considering, at the same time, structural and functional information. We have therefore constructed a multiplex human connectome network formed by one structural layer and one functional layer. The two layers were obtained by first averaging brain connectivity matrices estimated respectively from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in 171 healthy individuals. Each of the two layers is then thresholded by fixing the average node degree k (Methods).\nIn Fig. 3 we report the two cores found by separately analysing the two layers, together with the multiplex core obtained by our method. The figure refers to the case of a representative threshold corresponding to an average node degree k = 7. We notice that the cores of the structural and functional layers are only partially overlapping, with a value of cover similarity of S c = 0.15. Interestingly, ventral brain areas mainly constitute the structural core, while more dorsal regions appear in the functional core.\nInformation at the two layers is integrated by our method to extract the multiplex core of the human connectome. Brain regions of interest (ROIs, Table S1 ) that are in the core of both structural and functional layers also tend to be in the core of the multiplex. Instead, ROIs being in the periphery of both layers tend to be excluded from the multiplex core. However, exceptions may exist depending on the multiplex richness of the nodes. For example, the posterior part of the right precentral gyrus (RCGa3), which is in the periphery of both the structural and functional layer, is eventually assigned to the multiplex core, because of its relatively high rank score in the two layers. The situation appears even less predictable for ROIs that are in the core of one layer and in the periphery of the other layer. Only occasionally these will belong to the multiplex core. This is the case, for example, of the anterior part of right precentral gyrus (RCGa2) which exhibits a relatively low structural richness but high functional richness, i.e. ranked seventh in the functional core."}, {"section_title": "FIG. 3.", "text": "Extracting the multiplex core of the human brain from structural and functional information.

Revealing new core regions of the human brain", "text": "We have extracted the multiplex core-periphery structure of the human brain for the full range of available thresholds k = 1, 2, . . . , 120 (Methods). In this way, we have been able to calculate the coreness C i of each node i, defined as the normalised number of thresholds at which the corresponding ROI is present in the rich core. This allows us to rank ROIs according to their likelihood to be part of the multiplex core and to compare these to the rankings obtained separately for the structural and functional layers. We note that the same approach of investigating the persistence across a set of different filtering thresholds can be applied to any node property. This can turn useful for statistical validation in the case no threshold is universally accepted, as often happens for brain networks.\nParietal (pre/cuneus PCU/LOC, superior parietal lobe SPL), cingulate (anterior Ca, posterior Cp), temporal (superior temporal gyrus), insular (insular cortex IC), as well as frontal ROIs (paracingulate PC) mainly constitute the structural core, as shown in Fig. S4 . While some overlap exists between the structural and the functional cores, the latter rather tends instead to include occipital (occipital fusiform gyrus OFG, temporo-occipital fusiform cortex TOFC) and central (pre/post central gyrus CGa/CGp) ROIs and, notably, to exclude regions in the frontal lobe (top 25% ROIs, Fig. S5 ). Fig. 4 shows the coreness of the multiplex network. As expected, ROIs that are peripheral (i.e., low coreness) in both layers are also peripheral in the multiplex, while ROIs with both a high structural and high functional coreness are typically observed in the multiplex core (e.g., TOFC, OFG, Ca, Cp). Interesting behaviors emerge for those regions typically characterized by high coreness in one layer and low coreness in the other layer. In fact, some of these ROIs are part of the multiplex core, while others are usually found in the multiplex periphery, as shown Fig. 5(a) . For regions with different assignment at the two layers, we note that the main contribution to the multiplex richness \u00b5 i comes from the richness at the layer where node i was identified as core. However, not only the average richness at the layer where the node is core is higher than the one at the peripheral layer, but so are fluctuations around the mean. As a consequence, among regions in the structural core but in the functional periphery, those with relatively higher structural richness (degree), such as precuneus PCU, insular cortex IC and posterior cingulate Cp, tend to join the multiplex core no matter the exact value of their functional richness (upper right corner of Fig. 5(a) ). Conversely, ROIs with relatively lower structural degree are usually peripheral in the multiplex, and typically located in the pre-frontal cortex PC and frontal lobe FP (lower right corner of Fig. 5(a) ), as supported by Fig. 5(b,c) . Similarly, for regions in the functional core, those with relatively higher functional degree, such as precentral gyrus CGa and central operculum COC, tend to join the multiplex core (upper left corner of Fig. 5(a) ). In contrast, ROIs with relatively lower functional degree, are mostly peripheral in the multiplex, and are located in the parietal operculum POC and superior frontal gyrus SFG (lower left corner of Fig. 5(a) )."}, {"section_title": "III. DISCUSSION", "text": "Most networks have a core, a subset of central, tightly interconnected nodes at the heart of the system, which often are the primary responsible for the emergence of collective behaviors. Finding the core-periphery structure of a network is a problem of crucial importance in network science, and a variety of different algorithms have been proposed to define and extract the core in single-layer networks [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 19] . However, not all interactions are the same, and networks whose nodes are connected through connections which can vary in meaning and nature, can be better described in terms of networks with many layers [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . In this work, we introduced a method to identify core-periphery structure in multiplex networks and an algorithmic procedure to extract the multiplex core of the system. The algorithm was first shown to work on synthetic multiplex networks with tunable core similarity, i.e. with controlled overlap between the cores at the different layers. Although the algorithm is very general and can turn useful in several other contexts, it was applied here to a specific problem, namely the identification of the core of the human connectome.\nFinding the router regions that ensure integration between the different brain modules and communication in the system as a whole can help answer fundamental questions in neuroscience. The existence of a network core in the brain is considered a prerequisite for neural functioning and cognition, and damages to the core have been recently associated with several neurological or psychiatric diseases [22, 40, 41] . Previous studies have addressed the question by mainly considering the structural connectivity of the brain, and by using several techniques, such as k-core decomposition, centrality measures, and rich-club analysis [20, 42] . Standard analyses of the structural connectivity of the human brain agree on the implication of posterior medial and parietal cortical regions in the network core, but are contradictory on the role of frontal regions, such as the mPFC, that are functional components of the defaultmode network (DMN) [43] . Current trends, however, point out that a better understanding of brain networks can only be obtained by considering together the different types of interactions, and this can be achieved by investigating simultaneously both structural and functional brain connectivity [32, 44, 45] .\nOur method allows to elucidate this aspect, by exploiting also the information available in the functional connectivity, which has surprisingly been poorly explored for such a purpose. The results we have obtained confirm, on the one hand, the systematic involvement of posterior medial (C, IC, PCU) and parietal cortices (e.g., SPL) into the rich core of the human brain. Indeed, these regions have been already identified through the analysis of the structural connectome. On the other hand, the mPFC (e.g., PC and FP), which exhibited a high structural but low functional coreness, is eventually assigned to the periphery (Fig. 5a, lower-right corner) . Notably, this result can be predicted by the lower multiplex richness and relatively low structural degree, and not by the solely attitude of frontal areas to be peripheral in the functional brain network (Fig. 5b,c) . The exclusion of the mPFC from the rich core supports the hypothesis that default-mode network activity may be mainly driven from highly coupled areas of the posterior medial and parietal cortex, which in turn link to other highly connected regions, such as the medial orbitofrontal cortex [42] .\nWhile frontal ROIs are excluded, new regions gain importance and become part of the core because of their higher multiplex richness (see Fig. 5a , upper left corner). Among them, we report areas of the central gyrus (CGa, CGp to a minor extent), which were characterized by a low structural but relatively high functional degree, as shown in Fig.  5(b,c) . These regions are part of the primary sensori-motor cortex, which has been shown to be the most extensive of the resting-state components, or networks (out of 8 [46] ), covering 27% percent of the total gray matter in the brain [47] . The primary sensori-motor component has a high degree of integration (overlap and activity coupling) with all other resting-state networks (e.g., DMN), which is consistent with the increased synchronization of neural activity in cortical regions during sensory processing [48] and suggests an important role in conscious perception. Notably, ongoing functional connectivity in the primary sensori-motor network, originally revealed by seed-based analysis [49, 50] , has been extensively verified by ICA and clustering methods [51, 52] .\nThe approach we have proposed here provides an effective tool to integrate mesoscale topological information in brain networks derived from multimodal neuroimaging data. Indeed, multimodal integration in neuroscience is gaining more and more interest due, on the one hand, to the increasing availability of large heterogenous datasets (e.g. HCP http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org, ADNI http://adni.loni.usc.edu) and, on the other hand, to the need of principled ways to define more robust biomarkers. Based on a local fast algorithm, our method allows to extract the core-periphery structure of multiplex brain networks, which can be used to characterize multiscale neural mechanisms (e.g., cross-frequency coupling) and as predictive diagnostics for multifactor brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.\nIt is important to notice, that our analysis of the human connectome relies on the assumption that each layer contributes with the same intensity to the definition of the multiplex core. In general, however, the contribution of a layer \u03b1 can be weighted differently through an opportune choice of the parameter c [\u03b1] , and this can be used to enhance or reduce the importance of the different types of connectivity. A larger value of c [\u03b1] increases the relevance of the corresponding layer until when, in the limit in which c\n[\u03b1] \u2192 1 and the coefficients of all the other layers go to zero, the multiplex core is not any more defined by the topology of all the M layers, but coincides with the core at layer \u03b1. For instance, setting c\n[structural] = 1 and c [f unctional] = 0 returns a core based on the anatomical information only, and in agreement with most of the previous literature on such topic (see Fig. S4 ). As a first attempt to characterize the multiplex core of the human brain, we decided to focus our analysis on the simplest and symmetric case, c\n[structural] = c [f unctional] = 1/2, albeit other combinations are in general possible and can be explored if supported by a plausible rationale. For example, in the case of multifrequency brain networks, one could assign stronger weights to higher frequency layers in order to compensate for 1/f frequency scaling of power spectra [53] .\nTo conclude, our method to investigate multiplex core-periphery organization in networks shows that the core of the human cortex is made up of known hubs, such as posterior medial and parietal cortical regions, as well as of hubs that were previously overlooked by standard single-layer approaches. Examples are sensori-motor areas. Our findings offer an alternative definition of the rich core of a network, which takes into account not only the anatomical structure but also brain function. We hope our work will trigger additional studies to explore the composition of the multiplex core using functional connectivity acquisition in task-based experiments, in an effort to better integrate the one-to-many relationships that exist between structure and function in the human brain [54] ."}, {"section_title": "IV. METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Multiplex stochastic block model with tunable core similarity", "text": "Modelizations of multiplex networks in terms of stochastic block models can be found in Ref. [55] .

In particular, we set M = 2, N = 250, N [1] c = N [2] c = N c = 50, and we create at each layer a core-periphery structure with the same set of densities: \u03c1 1 = 0.2, \u03c1 2 = 0.04 and \u03c1 3 = 0.03. Namely, for each of the two layers, we connect with a probability \u03c1 1 two nodes both in the core, with probability \u03c1 2 a node in the core and a node in the periphery, and finally with probability \u03c1 3 two peripheral nodes. The values of the three parameters were chosen in a way that k = 10 on both layers, and the core-periphery structure of each layer is sufficiently strong to be detected with good accuracy, as discussed in the Supplementary Information. Different levels of core similarity are achieved by varying the overlap between core nodes at the two layers. When the two sets of core nodes are completely overlapping, S c = 1, whereas when the two sets are disjoint S c = 0. Despite other related formulations of S c are possible, our definition reflects the intuition that when two layers with equal core size share half of the core nodes, then S c = 1/2."}, {"section_title": "B.

In general, coefficients c\n[\u03b1] can be used to modulate the relevance to the layers of the network in order to extract its core. If one wants to have equal contributions to \u00b5 i and \u00b5 + i from all the layers but their number of links K\n[\u03b1] is different -for instance because in some layers it might be easier to establish or measure a connection than in others -a natural choice is to set c\n[\u03b1] to be proportional to 1/K [\u03b1] . In other cases, independently from their density, it might be reasonable to assign different importance to different layers, because of exogenous information.

In our block model, we connect two nodes with probability \u03c1 1 if they both belong to the core, with probability \u03c1 2 if one of them belongs to the core and one to the periphery, and with probability \u03c1 3 if they both belong to the periphery, \u03c1 1 \u2265 \u03c1 2 \u2265 \u03c1 3 . Given a stochastic realisation of the block model, we can extract the rich core of the network and compare it with the groundtruth, i.e. the set of nodes originally labeled as core nodes. In particular, we can test the accuracy of the algorithm for different choice of the parameters \u03c1 1 , \u03c1 2 and \u03c1 3 .\nGiven the three probabilities, the expected total number of edges connecting two core nodes is\n, the expected total number of edges connecting two peripheral nodes is\n, and the expected total number of edges connecting a node in the core and a node in the periphery\nThe total number of links is\nIn the case \u03c1 1 = \u03c1 2 = \u03c1 3 = \u03c1 the nodes are statistically indistinguishable from a structural point of view, the network lacks a core-periphery structure and specifying the value of \u03c1 simply sets the expected average degree of the network k = N \u03c1. For instance, for N = 250 and \u03c1 = 0.04 we obtain k = 10 and K = 1250. Of the different blocks of the adjacency matrix, the exact value of the density of the block encoding links between core and periphery nodes does not play a significant role [8] . For such a reason here we set \u03c1 2 = 0.04, and study the core-periphery structure of the network as a function of \u03c1 1 , with \u03c1 1 > \u03c1 2 . The higher the value of \u03c1 1 , the stronger the core-periphery structure of the system. In order to control for the density of the network, as we increases \u03c1 1 we have to opportunely decrease the value of \u03c1 3 . The average degree k can be kept fixed by setting\nIn our case with N = 250 and k = 10, we have K = 1250 whereas K cc and K cp are set once we fix the core size N c and the value of \u03c1 1 . In Fig. S1 we show the average Jaccard index J computed for the groundtruth partition and the partition extracted by the algorithm on the stochastic realisations of the network as a function of different values of \u03c1 1 for different core size. As shown, J increases quickly until \u03c1 1 = 0.2 and only mildly after this point. This indicates that \u03c1 1 = 0.2, corresponding to a value of \u03c1 3 = 0.03, can be considered as the smallest density of the core-core block at which the core-periphery structure of the network is sufficiently well-defined. For this reason, in the stochastic block model for multiplex networks with different values of core similarity S c described in Fig. 2 , where we have N = 250 and N c = 50 we set \u03c1 1 = 0.2. Given the set of parameters \u03c1 1 , \u03c1 2 and \u03c1 3 we can also compute the average degree k c of core nodes\nthe average degree k p of the peripheral nodes\nso that we have\nIn Fig. S2 we show the average Jaccard index J computed for the groundtruth partition and the partition extracted by the algorithm as a function of k c / k p .
