[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Emergence of the SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported in Hubei Province of Wuhan, China in December 2019, is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading across 216 countries, areas, or territories with 6,992,274 active infection cases and 403,128 deaths until June 9, 2020 (WHO, 2020) . This SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronovairus (CoV) belonging to Genus Betacoronavirus that can infect human after the two previously reported coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (Almofti et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020) , and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) (Badawi et al., 2016; Pallesen et al., 2017; Ul Qamar et al., 2019) . The SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense, single-stranded, and \u223c30 kilobase long RNA genome showing 79.0% and 50.0% identity to the genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (Abdelmageed et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Hoque et al., 2020a) . Among multiple encoded proteins (structural, non-structural, and accessory), four major structural proteins are the spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Ahmed, Quadeer & McKay, 2020) .\nThe S glycoprotein, because of its higher antigenicity and surface exposure (Almofti et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Shang et al., 2020) , plays the most crucial role for the attachment and entry of viral particles into the host cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Gralinski & Menachery, 2020; Shang et al., 2020) . It is noteworthy that E and M proteins also have important functions in the viral assembly, budding and replication of virus particles, as well as play role in augmenting the immune response against SARS-CoV (Shi et al., 2006; Schoeman & Fielding, 2019; Shang et al., 2020) . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) primarily target the trimeric S glycoprotein of the virion consisting of three homologous chains (A, B, and C), and this protein is composed of two major domains, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) (Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020) . The NTD is located on the side of the spike trimer and has not been observed to undergo any dynamic conformational changes (Shang et al., 2020) . Thus, this specific region might play role in viral attachment, inducing neutralizing antibody responses and stimulating a protective cellular immunity (Almofti et al., 2018; Ul Qamar et al., 2019; Shang et al., 2020) .\nMost of the recent vaccine candidates induce neutralizing antibodies against the different forms and/or variants of the spike protein of the SARS- CoV-2 (Le et al., 2020) . However, the immune responses generated from using single protein have generally been inadequate to warrant their use in the development of an effective prophylactic tool (Shi et al., 2015; Shey et al., 2019) . On this note, multi-epitope vaccine candidates have already been designed against several viruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and their efficacies have been further reported (Almofti et al., 2018; Ul Qamar et al., 2019; Yong et al., 2019) . Two related studies have reported the in-silico design of epitope based chimeric vaccine candidates targeting E, M, S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2, albeit not peer-reviewed (Yazdani et al., 2020; Akhand et al., 2020) . Besides, Kibria, Ullah & Miah (2020) performed an immunoinformatic approach to design a 70 aa long multi-epitope vaccine focusing on the the virion outer surface proteins (E, M, and S) (Chan et al., 2020) .\nScientists are racing over the clock to develop effective vaccine for controlling and preventing COVID-19 based on the genomics, functional structures, and host-pathogen interactions; nevertheless, the ultimate results of these efforts is yet uncertain. Currently, 10 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in the clinical trial, and 121 more under preclinical evaluation (WHO, 2020) . Strikingly, researchers are trialing different technologies, albeit targeting spike protein mainly, some of which have not been used in a licensed vaccine before (Le et al., 2020) . Their vaccine appears to be effective and safe based on a limited data and application of the vaccine within a relatively tiny group of individuals. However, there are several uncertainties, for example, whether it will relate to antibody responses in the general population, be safe within a specific sub-population (children, pregnant women, and elder people), as well as lack of a standardized virus neutralization assay and accurate vaccine titer are complicating data interpretation. Moreover, only half of the medium dose receiver developed neutralizing antibody and the T-cell response is not particularly impressive (Sheridan, 2020) .\nThus, mimicking of a more natural state of the virus where surface exposed proteins, or the immunodominant epitopes of those proteins influencing the immune response might be a solution, if those candidates ultimately cannot meet the final goal. Furthermore, excluding the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is embedded within the structure and attached to the viral genome, will amplify the chance of developing a more pseudo-virus state for the expressed chimera that may produce specific antibody as well as T-cell responses. Furthermore, peptide-based chimeric vaccines are biologically safe as they do not need in vitro virus culture, and their selectivity might ensure accurate activation of specific immune responses (Dudek et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2019) .\nConsidering the facts, we have proposed the development of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate, which differs from all the previous studies in the aspect of containing whole RBD and NTD regions of the spike protein alongwith specific epitopes of M and E proteins, giving an excellent chimeric conformation and might lead to the generation of a more potent protective immune responses since smaller epitopes have less ability to give better immune protection. Hence, we can assume that chimeric vaccine targeting multiple epitopes on the RBD and NTD segments of the S protein, M and E proteins would be a potentially effective vaccine candidate in combatting COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore, could be used against the could be used against the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Comparative structural analysis of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2", "text": "Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 77.38% and 31.93% sequence identity with the S proteins of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (Fig. S1 ). The structural (validated using the Ramachandran plot as in Fig. S2 ) alignment of the coronavirus S proteins reflects high degree of structural heterogeneity in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the chain A and chain C compared to that of chain B (Fig. S3 ). Divergence of individual structural domains, NTD and RBD of 2019-nCoV spike protein from both of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV warrants the domains for epitope-based chimeric vaccine development, particularly against SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Screening for B-cell epitopes", "text": "Linear epitopes prediction (ElliPro) based on solvent-accessibility and flexibility revealed 15, 18, and 19 epitopes within the chain A, B and C of S protein, respectively wherein score >0.8 was the threshold for the highly antigenic epitopes (Table 1 ). The amino acid (aa) residues in 56-194 and 395-514 position of the detected epitopes belonged to RBD and NTD regions of the S protein, respectively. However, the epitopes with aa position of 1067-1146 were not selected as the potential epitope candidate because of their presence in viral transmembrane domains (Fig. S4) . The tertiary structures of the RBD and NTD illustrate their surface-exposed position on the S protein (Fig. 1) . Using IEDB analysis resource and Bepipred linear epitope prediction 2.0 tools, we predicted eight and six B-cell epitopes in RBD and NTD regions out of total 22 epitopes in S protein, while the E and M proteins had 2 and 6 epitopes, respectively (Fig. 2 , Table S1 ). However, only 5 epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virion, and had a high antigenicity score (>0.4), indicating their potentials in initiating immune responses (Table 2) .\nAmong the five annotated epitopes having antigenicity score of \u2265 0.5 (VaxiJen 2.0 tool), RBD and NTD regions each possessed two highly antigenic epitopes while the envelope (E) protein contained only one highly antigenic epitope and membrane (M) protein has none (Table 2) . Furthermore, the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity profiling found five highly antigenic epitopes in RBD region with an average (antigenicity) score of 1.042 (minimum = 0.907, maximum = 1.214), and seven highly antigenic epitopes in NTD with an average (antigenicity) score of 1.023 (minimum = 0.866, maximum = 1.213) (Fig. S5 , Table S2 ). The average Kolaskar scores for envelope protein B-cell epitope (EBE) and membrane protein B-cell epitope (MBE) were 0.980 and 1.032, respectively (Table S2) .

The immune responses of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 against vaccine construct (CoV-RMEN) were estimated by analyzing the overall conformational stability of vaccine protein-TLRs docked complexes. The active interface aa residues of refined complexes of CoV-RMEN and TLRs were predicted (Fig. 5 , Table 3 ). The relative binding free energies ( G) of the protein-TLRs complexes were significantly negative ( Table 3 ) which suggest that the interaction of the chimeric protein might favor stimulation of the TLR receptors. Consistently, the number of contacts made at the interface (IC) per property (ICs charged-charged: 5, ICs charged-polar: 2, ICs charged-apolar: 17, polar-polar: 1, ICs polar-apolar: 7 and apolar-apolar: 16) for the vaccine protein-TLR2 complex.

The first nucleotides at 5 did not have a long stable hairpin or pseudoknot.

The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and subsequent deaths are increasing day by day (Tai et al., 2020) , and thus, COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a public health emergency by the International Concerns (Hui et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a) . Scientific community across the world is trying to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this rapidly emerging SARS- CoV-2 (Abdelmageed et al., 2020) . Although a good number of vaccine candidates for COVID-19 are now under trials, some of them are advanced to human trials (Lane, 2020), none has yet been declared to be effective and safe for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Strikingly, no effective therapeutic drugs or vaccines are yet to be available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients (Hoque et al., 2020a) . Through a comprehensive genomic and proteomic study, we endeavor to design an antigenic multiepitope (immunodominant) chimeric vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, named as CoV-RMEN (417 aa), which will nullify the involvement of lab-escape viral transmission, reduce the cost, and may elicit immunity by selectively stimulating antigen-specific B-and T-cells.\nThe novel approach of multi-epitope based (includes conserved multiple epitopes) vaccines designing represents inducing specific cellular immunity, and highly potent neutralizing antibodies against infections (Dawood et al., 2019; Yong et al., 2019; Gralinski & Menachery, 2020; Kibria, Ullah & Miah, 2020) . These epitope-based vaccines also provide increased safety and have the ability to focus on sustainable immune responses because of including conserved multiple epitopes. Unlike the full-length S protein, the RBD and NTD segments possess critical neutralizing domains without any non-neutralizing immunodominant region (Ul Qamar et al., 2019; Gralinski & Menachery, 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . Mutations on the RBD may enable the new strains to escape neutralization by established RBD-targeting antibodies, hence other functional regions, especially the NTD, should be considered for developing an effective vaccine as well (Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) . Besides, combined administration of RBD and NTD proteins induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity in animal models (Song et al., 2018) . Considering the safety and effectiveness perspectives, the RBD and NTD are more promising candidates in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines over the full-length S protein. The presence of E and M proteins on the envelope can augment the immune response against SARS-CoV (Millet & Whittaker, 2015; Almofti et al., 2018) and thus, considered for suitable candidate for vaccine development (Yong et al., 2020; Ahmed, Quadeer & McKay, 2020; Gralinski & Menachery, 2020) . Thus, antibodies against the immunologically substantial epitopes of S, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would provide protective immunity to the infection (Yong et al., 2020; Ahmed, Quadeer & McKay, 2020; Gralinski & Menachery, 2020; Shang et al., 2020) . Therefore, the immune response targeting the RBD and/or NTD of the S glycoprotein, M and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 would be an important prophylactic and therapeutic interventions, which can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials (Chan et al., 2020) .\nEffective immunity to viral infections is significantly dependent on activation of both B-and T-cells (Shi et al., 2015; Shey et al., 2019) . Therefore, inducing specific humoral or cellular immunity against pathogens, an ideal vaccine should contain both B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Our analyses revealed that selected RBD and NTD regions of the CoV-RMEN contain ample amount of high-affinity B-cell, MHC Class I, MHC Class II and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) epitopes with high antigenicity scores. Moreover, membrane B-cell epitope (MBE) and envelope B-cell epitope (EBE) enhanced the overall stability, immunogenicity and antigenicity of the CoV-RMEN. The development of memory B-cells and T-cells was evident, with memory in B-cells lasting for several months. These finding opposed to several earlier reports where T-cell mediated immune response was considered a long-lasting response compared to B-cells (Abdelmageed et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . Another engrossing finding of this study was the development of Th1 response which enhances the growth and proliferation of B-cells augmenting the adaptive immunity (Carvalho et al., 2002) . If a strong B-cell response occurred in animal trials (mice or rabbit), these antibodies could be used in diagnostic purposes, as they should recognize the prominent antigens on the viral surface (Kibria, Ullah & Miah, 2020) . Moreover, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses play major role in antiviral immunity (Abdelmageed et al., 2020) . Another crucial fact is that Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) can effectively bind with spike protein of the CoV (Totura et al., 2015; Zander et al., 2017) , and might play an important role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Shahabi et al., 2020) .\nThe physicochemical properties also revealed the chimera as a basic or alkaline protein (pI = 8.71) and would be thermostable upon expression, and thus, our proposed vaccine CoV-RMEN would be best suited for worldwide use in different endemic areas (Shey et al., 2019; Ul Qamar et al., 2019) . The structural forms (secondary and tertiary) of the CoV-RMEN, when tested as the synthetic peptides, showed the ability to fold into their native structure, hence could mimic the natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Almofti et al., 2018) . The refined tertiary (3D) structure of the final vaccine construct markedly presented the desirable structural features based on Ramachandran plot predictions (Shey et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2019) . Molecular docking analysis showed that predicted chimeric protein can establish stable protein-protein interactions with TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4) (Totura et al., 2015) . An efficient activation of surface molecules of the CoV-RMEN is very crucial for immune activation of dendritic cells, and subsequent antigen processing and presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via MHC-II and MHC-1, respectively (Shi et al., 2015; Shey et al., 2019; Shang et al., 2020) . The molecular dynamics simulation also revealed that the docked CoV-RMEN-TLRs complexes were stable, and had more binding affinity TLR-3 and TLR-4 (Abraham et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the CoV-RMEN showed good antigenicity scores on Vaxijen v2.0 and ANTIGENpro indicating that these peptide sequences are supposed to be highly antigenic in nature (Shey et al., 2019) . The non-allergenic properties of the CoV-RMEN further strengthens its potential as a vaccine candidate (Shey et al., 2019; Ul Qamar et al., 2019) .\nImmune simulation of the CoV-RMEN exhibited expected results consistent with typical immune responses, and there was a growing immune responses after the recurrent antigen exposures (Fig. 6) . The antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and cell stimulatory IL-2 level significantly increased, which also contribute to the subsequent immune response after vaccination in host (Almofti et al., 2018) . This indicates high levels of helper T-cells and consequently efficient antibody production, supporting a humoral response (Shey et al., 2019) . A lower IC 50 value indicates higher binding affinity of the epitopes with the MHC class I and II molecules. While most of the previous studies (Sakib et al., 2014; Adhikari, Tayebi & Rahman, 2018) reported that a binding affinity (IC 50 ) threshold of 250 nM identifies peptide binders recognized by T-cells, and this threshold can be used to select peptides, we kept binding affinity within 50 nM to get better confidence level in predicting epitopes for MHC-I and MHC-II alleles.The Simpson index estimated clonal specificity suggested a possible diverse immune response and this is plausible considering the generated chimeric peptide is composed of sufficient B-and T-cell epitopes (Fig. 6) .\nThe interaction between T-cell epitopes, and their respective HLA alleles revealed significant binding affinity reflecting the immune activation of B-and T-cells as supported by other reports (Srivastava et al., 2019; Jaimes et al., 2020) . T-cell epitopes from RBD and NTD regions showing high interaction with HLA alleles covered more than 98% of the world population with different ethnic groups, and these findings corroborated with many of earlier studies (Huang et al., 2007; Jaimes et al., 2020; Ul Qamar et al., 2019) . The incorporation of GG and EGGE linkers between the predicted epitopes of the CoV-RMEN produced sequences with minimized junctional immunogenicity, and allowed the rational design construction of a potent multi-epitope vaccine (Huang et al., 2007; Badawi et al., 2016; Shey et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2019) . The glycosylation of the surface antigens helps the enveloped viruses evade recognition by the host immune system, and can influence the ability of the host to raise an effective adaptive immune response (Pereira et al., 2018) or even be exploited by the virus to enhance infectivity (Wolfert & Boons, 2013) . Moreover, some antibodies such as mAb 8ANC195 have evolved to recognize peptide epitope with no dependence on glycan binding (Kong et al., 2015) . However, there is no data available for antibodies specific to spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2, whether their recognition is interfered by the glycosylation of spike or may either be strengthened by sugars close to the peptide epitope, or not interfered by sugar modification (Zhou et al., 2020b) . Furthermore, most of the epitopes of the CoV-RMEN harbor no glycoside apart from the NTD region (Watanabe et al., 2020) . Furthermore, most of the glycans of the NTD epitopes present at the terminii of the putative HLA antigens, and may not interfere with the antigen presentation in an HLA complex (Grant et al., 2020) . Integrity of the ACE2 receptor of the RBD, envelope protein B-cell epitope (EBE) and membrane protein B-cell epitope (MBE) in the CoV-RMEN suggests that the vaccine may maintain efficacy despite antigenic drift and glycosylation phenomena, as long as the virus continues to target the same host receptor (Grant et al., 2020) .\nOne of the first steps in validating a candidate vaccine is to screen for immunoreactivity through serological analysis. This requires the expression of the recombinant protein in a suitable host. As we focused on the epitopes without the glycosylation or non-significant glycosylation, high-level expression of the vaccine was optimized into well-established and cost-effective prokaryotic expression system E. coli K-12 strain as the first choice using the plasmid pETite containing SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) tag and 6x-His tag facilitated both the solubilization and affinity purification of the recombinant protein (Biswal et al., 2015) . Codon optimization of the CoV-RMEN revealed its high-level expression in E. coli (strain K12). Stable mRNA structure, codon adaptability index (0.87), and the GC content (50.26%) were favourable for high-level expression of the protein in the bacterium. After successful cloning of the gene, the recombinant plasmid can be propagated efficiently using E. coli cells, and subsequent protein expression can be performed in E. coli K-12 strain using IPTG (Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) induction, and cultivation at 28 \u2022 C as also reported earlier (Biswal et al., 2015) .\nAs alternative to E. coli, eukaryotic cell line, HEK-293 was considered for CoV-RMEN expression. The codon adaption index (CAI), GC content were 1.0 and 61.60 respectively, wihch indicate high level of expression of vaccine construct in the HEK-293 cell line. In this case, pSec Tag2 mammalian expression vector could be used, which have secretion signal from the V-J2-C region of the mouse Ig kappa-chain for efficient secretion of the recombinant protein, C-terminal poly-histidine (6xHis) tag for rapid purification with C-termnal c-myc epitope for detection with an anti-myc antibody. To remove the affinity and detection tags (His tag and c-myc epitope) after purification, Factor Xa clevage site (LVPR\u2193GS) could be added to the C-terminal of the CoV-RMEN (Waugh, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Sequence retrieval and structural analysis", "text": "A total of 250 partial and complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/protein) (Table S5) .

Molecular docking and dynamic simulation of the CoV-RMEN with the immune receptors (TLRs) predicted strong binding affinity, in particular with TLR3 and TLR4. Remarkably, the CoV-RMEN had more than 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. The limitations posed by fewer number of SARS-CoV-2 geneome sequence data which tends to mutate frequently may not affect our analysis since we included four peptides of high conservancy from three major proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genome in a multi-epitope vaccine with the high conservancy. However, future in vitro and in vivo studies are required to assess the potentiality of the designed vaccine candidate to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infections, and also to validate the results obtained herein through immuno-informatics analyses."}]
