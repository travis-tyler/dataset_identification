The position of the water table is expected to be elevated in response to ongoing sea level rise, producing widespread narrowing of the vadose zone and localized breaching of the land surface in the form of groundwater inundation (GWI). The objectives of this study include identifying and quantifying the spatial extent of groundwater inundation and severely narrowed (<1 m) vadose zone thickness projected for the years 2050, 2075, and 2100 for the populous and low-lying study region. At present, the Honolulu coastal zone has generally narrow vadose zones such that many construction projects working below grade require dewatering of worksites (Finstick, 1998). The conjunction of tidally influenced groundwater and narrow vadose zones produces localized temporary flooding during extreme tide events (Firing and Merrifield, 2004). Honolulu requires only a 20 cm tide above the mean higher high water (MHHW) datum to produce such flooding (Sweet, 2014). It follows that as SLR continues, vadose zones will become progressively narrowed or eliminated altogether, thus resulting in GWI. As the water table breaches the elevation of built infrastructure, flood damage will ensue. Underground infrastructure, including an array of essential attributes such as sewer mains, vented utility corridors, and on-site sewage disposal systems (OSDS) will be the first utility to be compromised by inundation. The potential for inundation of corroded sewer mains is of particular concern owing to the likelihood of groundwater contamination. Sewer mains in Honolulu are known to be leaky systems that experience occasional structural failure due to corrosion; much of this infrastructure was installed over 50 years ago, with some approaching 100 years old (O'ahu Metropolitan Planning Organization, 2011). The threat of GWI has not been considered in most adaptation planning. However, the state has relayed its concern regarding the threat that GWI poses to miles of underground infrastructure (O'ahu Metropolitan Planning Organization, 2011). Various offices in local and state government now anticipate that climate change will require the development of adaptive design standards. While adopting such standards is judicious, the lack of hazard projections and site-specific mapping is a limiting factor. This study was undertaken to address the need for hazard projections that illustrate groundwater induced flooding under projected SLR. Outcomes include high-resolution visualizations of vadose zone thinning and GWI that will ensue across the region that encompasses Waikiki, Kaka'ako, and Mo'ili'ili on O'ahu, Hawai'i."}, {"section_title": "Related studies", "text": "The existing literature on O'ahu's aquifers has largely focused on basalt aquifers, as they provide valuable sources of potable water (Stearns and Vaksvik, 1935;Wentworth, 1951;Nichols et al., 1997;Whittier et al., 2004). In contrast, studies regarding the caprock aquifer have mainly been limited to research regarding paleo sea level indicators and sediment characteristics as a foundation for construction. Stearns reviewed evidence of Pleistocene sea level transgressions and regressions revealed in drill cores and paleo shorelines, which characterize much of southern O'ahu's coastal plain (Stearns, 1935;Stearns and Chamberlain, 1967;Lum and Stearns, 1970;Stearns 1974Stearns , 1975Stearns , 1978. Two studies have been accomplished from an engineering standpoint that reported on the subsurface geology and hydrology of the caprock in Waikiki, Mo'ili'ili and Kaka'ako (Ferrall, 1976) and downtown Honolulu (Finstick, 1998). Numerous studies have been accomplished regarding the influence of ongoing SLR on the vertical extent of the water table. Rotzoll and Fletcher (2013) developed estimates of the mean water table elevation and tidal influence to evaluate vulnerability to GWI by projecting a one-dimensional model of water level vs. distance from the shoreline throughout the Honolulu and east Pearl Harbor caprock aquifer. Parkinson and McCue (2011) conducted an assessment of flood risk in the Satellite Beach, Florida area based on flooding of the static terrain. Bjerklie et al. (2012) produced a steady-state model of groundwater flow for part of New Haven, Connecticut to test hypotheses on the effects of SLR and increased recharge on groundwater levels. Masterson et al. (2014) produced a numerical model representing a barrier island groundwater system to investigate thinning of the vadose zone and saltwater intrusion resulting from SLR of up to 60 cm. Hoover et al.

Specifically, the objectives of this study were to 1) gain an understanding of the hydrologic effects of SLR on coastal water table elevations in the Waikiki, Kaka'ako, and Mo'ili'ili areas of O'ahu, Hawai'i, 2) estimate the areal extent of flooding and expected narrowing of the vadose zone resulting from SLR induced groundwater lift, and 3) produce inundation maps that illustrate localized regions more prone to GWI inundation resulting from SLR projected for the years 2050, 2075, and 2100.\nThe objectives of the hydrologic flow model included: \uf0b7 Construction of a steady-state groundwater flow model using the program MODFLOW-2005; \uf0b7 Population of the groundwater model with recent recharge and pumping distribution data.

For this study, the region of interest lies east of Nu'uanu Avenue, west of Coconut Avenue, seaward of the 10 m elevation contour relative to LMSL, and landward of the coastline. The study area is located atop a low-lying coastal platform composed of fossil carbonate reef and dredged fill. 2014 NOAA LiDAR data show that the topography is relatively flat and that the elevation across the majority of the area is less than 2 m, with inner troughs located across western Waikiki, Kaka'ako, and landward of the canal.

The Ko'olau Volcano formed approximately 2.5 to 2.2 million years ago followed by a hiatus in volcanic activity that lasted approximately 1 million years. Following the hiatus, eruption resumed forming lava flows, cinder cones and tuff cones."}, {"section_title": "Caprock", "text": "Extensive emerged reef units are present along the O'ahu coastal zone and formed during sea level changes and isostatic subsidence of O'ahu during the Pleistocene. The reef units were built upon the eroded flanks of the Wai'anae and Ko'olau volcanoes along the majority of southeastern O'ahu and have been partially overlain by alluvium that was eroded and transported from the two volcanoes. Below the caprock unit is a layer of brown clay that acts as an aquitard to the caprock. Overall, the southeastern coastal plain, upon which the study area is located, is composed of a mixture of post-erosional volcanics, eroded alluvial debris from the Ko'olau Volcano and sedimentary deposits produced by Pleistocene sea level variations including lagoonal deposits, coral debris, and coral ledges. These materials make up the geologic unit referred to as caprock (Stearns and Vaksvik, 1935;Finstick, 1998;Oki et al., 1998). Nearly the entire study area has been further overlain by heterogeneous human-placed fill consisting mainly of coralline sand and gravel (Finstick, 1998).\nThe hydraulic conductivity of caprock ranges several orders of magnitude owing to the various materials that make up the hydrologic unit. For example, the hydraulic conductivity of alluvium ranges from 0.01 to 1 ft/d (Wentworth, 1938), the hydraulic conductivity of sand ranges from 1 to 1,000 ft/d (Nichols, et al. 1997), and coral gravels and reef limestone can have hydraulic conductivities of several thousands of ft/day. While the range of hydraulic conductivities is diverse, the overall caprock is considered to have lower hydraulic conductivity relative to the underlying basalt aquifer (Visher and Mink, 1964).\nThe top of the caprock unit was defined by the topography and bathymetry. The contact between the caprock and underlying basalt aquifer was determined using basalt contours from Rotzoll and El-Kadi (2007)."}, {"section_title": "Caprock geology particular to the study area", "text": "This section has been summarized from Ferrall (1976).

The three ledges were defined nominally by the highest extent at which each bench was encountered, at +5, -15, and -30 ft relative to LMSL. The +5 ft ledge is present along the most landward extent of the study area, while the -15 ft and -30 ft ledges are located progressively seaward. The +5 ft bench was found to be approximately 20 ft thick; it overlies coralline gravel and alluvium and is topped by alluvium, and human placed fill. Volcanic deposits are present in localized areas directly beneath the +5 ft bench, produced by eruptions of Diamond Head and Kaimuki Shield. Diamond Head is located to the east of the study area, while Kaimuki Shield is located in the northeast corner of the study area; their eruptions produced localized tuff and basalt flows, respectively. The seaward extent of the +5 ft bench abruptly ends where the -15 ft ledge begins. The -15 ft bench ranges from 10 to 20 ft and is less developed than the +5 ft bench. The -15 ft bench is underlain by coralline debris and sporadic cemented layers, and overlain by a mixture of lagoonal deposits, coralline debris, alluvium, and human placed fill. The landward extent of the -30 ft bench begins where the -15 ft ledge ends and grades from -30 ft at its landward boundary to -50 ft near the current shoreline; it ranges in thickness from less than 5 ft to more than 30 ft.

The lens floats atop saltwater due to density differences between salt and fresh water (Macdonald et al., 1983) and with a centerline that is roughly described by the Ghyben-Herzberg principle, which states that for every 1 unit of freshwater above sea level, the freshwater lens extends 40 units below sea level. Groundwater from the lens system migrates predominantly horizontally from inland recharge areas to coastal discharge areas (Souza and Voss, 1987). Lower permeability caprock acts as a confining layer to the basal lens along the coastline by partially obstructing flow (Stearns, 1935). Within the caprock aquifer, the uppermost limestone unit is unconfined and contains mainly brackish non-potable water that is highly vulnerable to contamination from the overlying urban setting (Oki et al., 1998). Groundwater in the caprock aquifer is influenced by marine oscillations generated by solar and lunar tides, seasonal sea level anomalies, rainfall, and atmospheric processes such as wind, barometric pressure, seiches, and storm surge (Ponte Rui, 1994;Wu et al., 1996;Yin et al., 2001;Gonneea et al., 2013). Tidal forcing produces fluctuations of the water table boundary and are a function of porosity, hydraulic conductivity, as well as the frequency and amplitude of the tides (Li and Barry, 2000). Fluctuations become damped, decreasing in amplitude and increasing in lag as oscillations propagate further inland (Li and Barry, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Sources of surficial recharge particular to the study area", "text": "Recharge from groundwater flow occurs in the Palolo and Nu'uanu aquifers as water moves downgradient from the Ko'olau Volcano.

Influence was quantified by calculating lag, tidal efficiency, and long period efficiency (Tab. 2). Lag was evaluated by cross correlating tidal signals measured at the Honolulu tide station with tidal signals observed in groundwater data. Tidal efficiency is defined as the amplitude of the tidal oscillation in the well over the tidal oscillation in the ocean. It was found using least-squares regression of lag corrected groundwater data to tidal data. The slope of the regressed line quantifies efficiency while the y-intercept quantifies offset from LMSL. The respective offsets calculated for each well location were applied as a mean observed water level, free from tidal and seasonal sea level changes, for steady-state model calibration. Long period values of efficiency were found similarly after applying a weekly moving average to groundwater and ocean level datasets.

Goodness of calibration was evaluated by comparing simulated against observed water levels (Tab.5, Appendix). The calibration process employed manual iterative adjustment and the non-linear inverse modeling utility (PEST) that systematically estimated parameters; the PEST utility alters chosen model parameters until the error between simulated and observed water levels is minimized to an acceptable level of accuracy (Doherty, 2008). Manual iterative adjustment was employed in the estimation of the conductance parameter of the GHB defined for unit 2; manual alteration was undertaken because GMS software does not facilitate alteration of the conductance parameter when employing the PEST utility. Values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity applied to the caprock unit were estimated using the PEST utility. Both the zonal and pilot point PEST calibration methods were carried out separately to test the suitability of each solution with respect to the geology and groundwater conditions present in the study area. Justification of zone delineation is described in following sections. Ultimately, the solution calculated by using the zonal method ( Fig. 3) was chosen to represent the current hydrology of the study area. The solution exhibited more comparable ranges of hydraulic conductivities to observed ranges, presented a lower value of uncertainty (quantified by a lower root mean squares residual), and displayed a more reasonable hydraulic gradient. Additionally, the zonal approach is more appropriate in representing the contrasting geology of the study area in that it does not produce a smooth transition of site conductivities as does the pilot point approach. Observed and simulated water levels are compared (Fig. 4). The error and statistics are listed in the Appendix. The root mean squared residual was 11 cm, indicating acceptable calibration. The zonal PEST calibration method estimates hydraulic parameters for user-defined zones by iteratively adjusting the parameter values until the error of the objective function reaches a minimum. Six zones were defined in reference to the geology of the study region. One zone characterized the offshore extent of the study area, which hosts offshore sediment including limestones cemented by aragonite and high magnesium calcite (Sherman et al., 1999); the other five zones were defined based on distinct geologic units encountered within the landward extent of the study area subsurface (Ferrall, 1976). The five units were characterized by the extent in which the +5, -15, and -30 ft coral ledges were encountered. The +5 ft ledge was further broken into three units to include a region made up mainly of carbonate, a region in which Kaimuki basalt flows were encountered, and a region where Diamond Head tuff deposits were encountered and likely extend. The spatial extent of each zone and corresponding hydraulic conductivity values calculated by the PEST utility are included in Figure 5. All calculated values applied to the model were within the range observed inside or just to the west the study area as reported by Finstick (1998). Hydraulic conductivity values calculated for four of the zones fell within ranges observed for fill, lagoonal deposits, coral ledges, and coralline debris; these were zones representing the main +5 ft carbonate coral ledge, the +5 ft coral ledge with Diamond Head volcanics, the -30 coral ledge, and the offshore region. Values calculated for zones representing the +5 ft coral ledge with Kaimuki volcanics, and the -15 ft coral bench fell within ranges of fill, coarse lagoonal deposits, and cinder deposits.

Sensitivity of the model to aquifer parameter variations was manually evaluated for the basalt conductance parameter and evaluated using the PEST utility for the hydraulic conductivity parameters. The sensitivity of the conductance parameter was evaluated for two cases: the GHB conductance of unit 2 (basalt aquifer) was increased by one order of magnitude and lowered by one order of magnitude, respectively. Thus, the conductance was adjusted to 0.01 m/d in case 1 and 0.0001 m/d in case 2. The higher conductance estimate approximately tripled simulated water levels across the study area, resulting in a mean residual water level of cm and root mean squared residual of 132 cm. The lower conductance estimate caused simulated water levels to fall significantly, resulting in a mean residual water level of 18 cm and a root mean squared residual of 23 cm. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the model is highly sensitive to adjustments in conductance. A sensitivity analysis of the hydraulic conductivity parameter was calculated as part of the PEST utility (Tab. 3). MODFLOW calculates sensitivities as the derivatives of simulated equivalents to observed head with respect to model parameters. It can be concluded that all zones are sensitive to adjustments in hydraulic conductivity. The HK_15 zone shows the highest value of sensitivity owing to the majority of observation points being located in this zone.

Simulated steady-state conditions were modeled under the assumption that recharge, pumping, and groundwater flow remain constant. Current simulations do not consider small scale pumping that is likely currently employed by numerous property owners to minimize basement flooding across the study area. The simulation is not capable of assessing numerous time-dependent factors including short-term variations in recharge, pumping rates, and boundary flows. The model simulations represent conditions of average annual recharge and a MHHW stage of the tide and do not include any consideration of anomalous conditions of extreme wet or dry periods or seasonal tide anomalies. The MODFLOW-2005 model assumes a uniform density of water which limits the model's capability to simulate the saltwater/freshwater interface, and hence, does not incorporate the influence of density driven fluid flow. Because the caprock aquifer is mainly brackish, the uniform density model was deemed reasonable for use in this study; however, the caprock aquifer does have a freshwater component, thus it would be worthwhile to collect salinity observations across the study area and employ SEAWAT (Langevin et al., 2003) or a similar groundwater variable density flow model to improve future simulations. Heterogeneity in groundwater environments is prevalent, especially in the caprock aquifer; however, heterogeneities across the study area are poorly understood and thus difficult to include in the design of the conceptual model. Hydrogeologic zones and units were simulated as homogeneous to avoid overcomplicating the model, and because detailed hydrologic and geologic information is not available. Thus, heterogeneities in the caprock aquifer were not adequately accounted for. For example, karst caves are known to exist in the Mo'ili'ili area; however, since the cave system has not been adequately mapped, the presence of the cave system was ignored during model construction, considering also that the model is not suitable for non-Darcy conditions associated with such caves Simulations of future conditions only take into account changes in sea level, and do not reflect projections of future pumping rates, recharge, or changes in the terrain.

Hydro-flattening was accomplished by applying a constant elevation of -1.5 m to all major waterways, water features, and offshore areas. The 2013 NOAA LiDAR data has a linear error of 0.15 m. The DEM has a similar linear error across regions defined by high point density, and slightly higher error across regions defined by low point density. The objectives of DEM construction included: \uf0b7 Development of a highly accurate (+/-15 cm) and hydro-flattened DEM from which to compare simulations of the water table under incremental increases in sea level. \uf0b7 Production of raster visualizations illustrating GWI and narrowed vadose zones using gridded comparisons of DEM elevations vs. water table elevations. Steady-state simulations representing incremental SLR were uploaded into ArcGIS and converted into raster grids using the natural neighbor method of interpolation. Values of each raster grid were subtracted from the DEM grid to arrive at the distance of the water level below (or above) the modeled terrain. Cells with positive values were identified as having a vadose zone, while cells with negative values were identified as having GWI. Total cell counts for each model run were used to quantify the percent of the study area with a narrowed vadose zone and GWI respectively."}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty", "text": "Two main sources of error were identified in the uncertainty analysis for vertical disparity between the ground surface and potentiometric surface; these are LiDAR error and MODFLOW error. Vertical error present in the LiDAR data was reported as less than 15 cm (Photo Science Inc., 2013). Error in the MODFLOW simulation was found to be 11 cm based on the root mean squared difference between simulated and observed water levels. Natural water level variations are assumed to be encompassed by the MODFLOW simulation error. The quadrature sum of the two vertical sources of error was found to be 19 cm and is defined here as \"relative error\" because it only describes the vertical error in the combined groundwater and elevation models. Additional uncertainties are present in the GEOID 12a model, which is used to transform heights between ellipsoidal coordinates and physical height systems. Within the study area, the vertical error in GEOID 12a ranges from 59 to 73.5 cm (Ed Carlson, personal communication, May 5, 2016). Conditions that alter the vertical extent of the water table, such as drought, prolonged precipitation and seasonal sea level anomalies, were not included as part of the vertical uncertainty estimate as simulations are representative of average conditions of annual recharge at the MHHW tide stage. However, fluctuation of the water table resulting from such anomalies are a valid concern and warrant further study due to the potential of enhanced flooding."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The results of the model simulation are included in Table 4. Values are reported as percent of the study area with a narrow vadose zone (0.5 to 1 m), severely narrow vadose zone (0 to 0.5 m), shallow flooding (0 to 0.5 m), and deep flooding ( > 0.5 m) at tidal elevations representative of the MHHW datum. GWI and narrowed vadose are simulated for increases in sea level of 0.33 m, 0.66 m, and 1 m of SLR. Based on projections of SLR specific to Honolulu, we define these increases as approximate simulations for the years 2050, 2075, and 2100. Raster visualizations of GWI and vadose zone narrowing are shown in Figure 6.

Buried infrastructure (e.g., basements, cesspools, utility corridors) not designed to withstand continued submersion will experience inundation and saltwater intrusion (Bjerklie et. al., 2012). These impacts present serious engineering challenges and in anticipation of imminent flooding, preparation of city infrastructure is necessary. Practical upgrades include the installation of storm-water pumping units, the modification of drainage to reduce inflow of sea water during high tide, and the reinforcement of submerged infrastructure to withstand constant submersion in saline waters. Additional safeguards such as the construction of lock structures and raised infrastructure may need consideration as flooding events become increasingly prevalent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "A groundwater flow model was constructed as part of this study to simulate SLR induced GWI and vadose zone narrowing in the Waikiki, Kaka'ako, and Mo'ili'ili regions of O'ahu, Hawai'i. Findings are summarized below. \uf0b7 A groundwater flow model (MODFLOW-2005) was successfully constructed that simulates the water table across the study area for current conditions of sea level and increases in sea level of 0.33 m, 0.66 m, and 1 m. \uf0b7 Continuous water level monitoring was accomplished at four shallow (<10 m) monitoring wells from 2012 to 2015 to better understand the influence of the tidal oscillations on coastal groundwater. \uf0b7 The hydrologic model was well calibrated and the root mean squared residual between observed and simulated groundwater levels was found to be 11 cm. \uf0b7 A highly accurate (+/-15 cm) DEM was developed, to which simulated water levels were compared. \uf0b7 Simulations show that approximately 19% of the 13 km 2 study area presently has narrow vadose zone of less than 1 m; SLR of 1 m raises this extent to 50% and produces flooding over nearly 13% of the study area. It follows that under 1 m of SLR, the majority (~63%) of the region will likely experience either episodic or continuous flooding.
