[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The relationship between school reforms, specifically those involving the introduction of new school types, and pupil performance is studied. The particular context is the introduction of academy schools in England, but related evidence on Swedish free schools and US charter schools is also presented. The empirical evidence shows a causal positive impact of the conversion of disadvantaged schools to academies on end of school pupil performance and on subsequent probability of degree completion at university. There is heterogeneity in this impact, such that more disadvantaged pupils and those attending London academies experience bigger performance improvements.

In parts, this paper draws on and further develops some of our other work on academy schools (Eyles,"}, {"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The emergence of international student tests such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) or the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) have placed the importance of equitably and efficiently designed and managed school systems back on top of the policy agenda in many countries.\n1 Over the past decade, a number of countries have introduced reforms to their education systems with the aim of achieving better overall outcomes and reducing educational inequalities. These reforms have included introducing higher educational requirements for teachers (e.g. France), delaying tracking of students (e.g."}, {"section_title": "Germany)", "text": ", increasing the length of the school day (e.g. France), and increasing the scope for exercising more autonomy in existing schools (e.g. Portugal) or introducing new school types with more autonomy (e.g. England).\nThis paper focusses on the last of these school reforms, where new types of schools were introduced into education systems. The particular focus is on the short and medium term impact of a large-scale reform in England that introduced a new school type -the academy school -to the education landscape. Initially, these schools were typically conversions of pre-existing low performing schools. Academy schools have higher levels of autonomy than the previously predominant community schools, that is, schools operating under the remit of a local education authority. The aim of this paper is to understand whether the autonomy gains after conversion led to an improvement in student outcomes.\nThere are several reasons why granting schools more autonomy over how they allocate resources, the teachers they hire, how they set teacher pay, the teaching methods they use or what speciality subjects they offer in their curriculum might increase school performance and student outcomes. For instance, more autonomy may allow schools to M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "2 adapt better to the needs and wishes of the local community and student population.\nLikewise, greater autonomy over the choice of school leadership may allow governing bodies to select better and more suitable headteachers than a government authority that may be less informed about local circumstances and needs.\nHowever, individual schools and policy makers may have conflicting interests, making transfer of power to schools problematic. For example, the government might have as an objective the reduction in student inequality and segregation by ability. One way to achieve this is to impose ability blind admission procedures. Were schools to be provided with the freedom to set their own admissions policies they would have an incentive to admit only the best students, which could lead to higher levels of inequality. Similarly, allowing autonomous schools to select their own teachers, as opposed to having them assigned via a centralised mechanism, may cause greater selection of the best teachers into more autonomous schools, potentially leading to an increase in inequality.\nAnalysing the causal effect of increased autonomy can prove difficult because of several potential endogeneity problems. A naive comparison of outcomes between students who attend schools with high levels of autonomy and those who attend schools with low levels of autonomy is likely to be biased if unobservable characteristics are related to both school choice and student performance. Schools with higher autonomy have the scope to exercise freedoms that enable them to attract students from better family backgrounds, or they may attract better teachers because they have different pay schemes and incentives than non-autonomous schools. Likewise, in a setting where new schools with more autonomy are set up, the identification of the causal effect of attendance is made difficult by the absence of pre-treatment outcomes for these schools.\n2 M A N U S C R I P T\n4 problems associated with selection on unobservable characteristics into schools that have been converted.\n5 also offer some descriptive evidence on mechanisms that could have led to the gains from greater autonomy, which appear to be changes in leadership, changes to the curriculum on offer and changes to the performance management system for teachers and improved collaboration with other schools.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives information on the English reform and how this affected school autonomy and discusses the existing evidence on the impact of school reform on student outcomes for the US and Sweden. Section 3 introduces the data used for this study and the empirical strategy used to identify the casual effect of academy introduction on short and medium term outcomes. Section 4 and 5 present the main results and heterogeneous effects, respectively, and section 6 concludes.\n6 role in the decision making for a range of aspects in England. Among other things, they are responsible for budget decisions, appointing and dismissing staff, and holding the headteacher accountable for school performance.\nIn the early 2000s, an increasing preoccupation with inequality in student outcomes across schools, and in particular a widespread recognition of the poor performance of some inner city schools in deprived neighbourhoods, led the government to introduce a new type of school -the academy school. Academy schools are removed from local authority control and receive their funding directly from the central government. The possibility for academy conversion during the 2000's -the 'initial programme' -was restricted to very low performing schools. After a change in government in 2010, the possibility of conversion was made available to all types of school rather than just secondary schools. In addition, rather than the conversions mostly being low performing schools like those we study in this paper, many high performing schools also took up the opportunity to become an academy.\n11 schools has enabled researchers to isolate specific mechanisms by which charter schools increase performance in standardized tests (Fryer, 2014) . While the majority of papers focus on the effect of newly built charters, Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2014) use pre-enrolment in schools that later convert to charters, as well as matching, to study the effect of charter takeover on test scores and find positive effects; features of this identification strategy are detailed extensively in Section 3 in relation to academy school takeovers in England.\nA somewhat stylised finding of the literature on charter schools is that charters are able to generate sizeable test score gains in English and Math, and that overall gains often mask considerable heterogeneity. Gains often appear to be strongest in urban areas and for those who are disadvantaged. A more detailed review of the literature on charter schools and free schools can be found in Eyles, Hupkau and Machin (2015) . Table 3 of this paper offers a brief summary of that longer review.\n\n\n25 the ability to operate in an autonomous manner, and are likely to lie behind the pupil performance improvements from academy conversion identified in our empirical analysis.\nThe importance of headteacher changes at the time of conversion is studied in the empirical analysis reported on in Eyles and Machin (2015) who show headteacher turnover in the year of conversion to be very prevalent. In fact turnover of the headteacher is over 60\npercentage points higher in treatment as compared to control schools. In line with the suggestion in Table 11 that academies made use of their ability to hire teachers without qualified teacher status to supplement their existing teaching stock, there is also some evidence of modest positive changes in the number of teaching staff around conversion.\nThus the idea that leadership matters is reaffirmed as part of the mechanisms behind school improvements from the initial academies programme.\n\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3", "text": "Research that is related to our study has been undertaken on two new types of schools that have been introduced in the US and Sweden -charter schools and free schools.\nSome of this work, especially in the US setting, spends a lot of time and effort in trying to uncover the causal effect of attending a specific school (sometimes using lottery assignment of places when schools are oversubscribed). Some of the empirical approaches used in this work are relevant to what we do in this paper, and we review some of this growing literature below. Another strand of research looks at the effects of school autonomy on student performance using cross-country PISA and TIMSS data. This literature however often fails to deal with the problem of within-country selection into more autonomous schools, and is therefore unable to uncover causal effects of more autonomy on student outcomes (see Hanushek, Link and Woessmann, 2013) . The specifics of the English reform provide us with a setting that allows for the identification of the causal effect of giving schools more autonomy by analysing the effect of academy conversion. The reform meant that existing schools were converted to academy status, hence we can implement a difference-in-differences approach where we use those pupils who attend early academy converters as a treatment group and those who attend schools that later convert to academies as a control group. Additionally, by looking only at students already enrolled in the school before the conversion took place (in the terminology of Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2014, 'grandfathered' or pre-enrolled students) we can remove potential effects that work through changes in pupil composition post conversion, and avoid down which aspects of autonomy may be conducive to better performance or lower inequality across schools and students. The English reform does not directly allow us to disentangle the separate effects of different aspects of autonomy on student performance, but we present evidence in Section 5 on what type of autonomies were reportedly most used by headteachers of academy schools. Section 2 also presents evidence on US charter schools that shed light on mechanisms that drive school improvement through more autonomy.M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Using hypothetical years of exposure for pre-enrolled students at a to-be-converted school as an instrument for actual years of exposure to the converted academy, we find that, on average, attending a more autonomous academy school increases exam outcomes at age 16 by 7.2 percent of a standard deviation per year of exposure. It also increases the likelihood of degree completion within five years of completing compulsory education by 0.7 percentage points, which is equivalent to around a 10 percent rise compared to the average in our sample. More flexible specifications suggest that positive effects increase non-linearly with years of exposure, with those having attended an academy for four years gaining 29 percent of a standard deviation in age 16 exam outcomes, compared to 4 percent of a standard deviation for those with only one year of exposure, and 2.4 percentage points in terms of the likelihood of degree completion, compared to only 0.8 percentage points for those who attended the academy for only one year prior to conversion.\nAnalysis of heterogeneous effects show that for short term outcomes, the impact of attending an autonomous school are larger for disadvantaged students (students eligible for free school meals), who gain 8.9 percent of a standard deviation, compared to 6.3 percent for those not eligible for free school meals, and this gap holds both for boys and girls. Medium term outcomes do not seem to differ much across subgroups. Interestingly, consistent with various studies that emphasise big improvements in the performance of pupils studying in schools in London over the last ten to fifteen years (Burgess, 2014; Blanden et al., 2015) , we find bigger effects of academy conversion for pupils enrolled in schools in the capital. These results are consistent with evidence from US charter schools where effects tend to be stronger for disadvantaged students and students in urban areas (Angrist et al., 2013) .

Overall, privately managed publicly funded schools in England are more similar to private schools, in terms of their powers, than to public schools.

Both the United States, with the introduction of charter schools in 1992, and Sweden, which introduced free schools as part of a wider educational reform in the early 1990s, initiated new school programmes. While these have been pursued on a smaller scale than the academies programme -around 6% of state educated pupils in the US attended charters in 2013 (National Centre for Education Statistics, 2015) and about 14% attended free schools in Sweden in 2012 10 -they share some similarities. In each case, the schools are privately run but rely on public funds to operate; furthermore, these school types enjoy greater operational autonomy than other publicly funded schools.\nThe extent to which, within Sweden and the US, attendance at these school types has aided pupil performance in academic tests and, more importantly, led to positive longer-term outcomes, is the subject of a growing literature. The overall nature of the programmes, as well as the methods of allocating places in charters and free schools respectively, has shaped both the phrasing of research questions and the way in which researchers have estimated performance effects for these schools.\n10 Own calculation from PISA 2012 data."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n12 primary to secondary school having completed their Key Stage 2 assessments in the final year of primary school, year 6, at age 11.\n17 may not be the same as the pupils who were enrolled pre-conversion. Some pupils of that group may leave the school and sit their exams elsewhere. This generates the possibility of a threat to our research design because actual treatment status may be non-random: if the worst of the legacy enrolled pupils decided to leave schools once they gained academy status then our estimates will be upward biased. \nwhere ITT Exposure is the expected years of exposure when viewed from the pre-academy conversion year c for the already enrolled pupils. It measures the hypothetical number of years in an academy that they would be exposed to were they to stay on to sit their Key The IV estimator is then obtained using the prediction of Exposure from (3), which can be defined as in place of the direct Exposure variable in (1) as follows:\nso that the IV estimator equals the ratio of the reduced form coefficients .\nThe main identifying assumption is that pre-enrolment in a school, which converts in year t, as opposed to t+4, is orthogonal to test scores. The fact that schools that convert over the 2003-2013 period are observationally similar prior to conversion (see Eyles and Machin 2015) , and that enrolment decisions were made without knowledge that the school would subsequently gain academy status, suggests that this assumption is met. Under this assumption we estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE) of academy exposure that\n18 identifies the causal effect of exposure to academy status for those who attend an academy, but do so only because they happened to enrol in a school that later gained academy status before they left compulsory schooling.\nFurther interest lies in how the effect of academy attendance differs across subgroups of the population of students. In our empirical work below, we explicitly study heterogeneous effects, looking at differences by free school meal status and gender. We also \n19 continuous measure that 92.3 percent of the theoretical expected years of exposure were completed by the pre-enrolled students. The same pattern, but as one would expect with a drop off for longer durations, emerges for the dummy variable representation of ITT exposure, as is shown in columns (3) and (4) of the Table. For one year of exposure, 98.5 percent of ITT predicted years were completed, and this drops to 94.9 percent for two years, 91.1 percent for three years and 87.5 percent for the maximum four years.\nThese first stages therefore show that a very large fraction of pupils sit their KS4 exams in the school in which they were pre-enrolled. If a dummy variable for pre-enrolled status alone is instead used as the ITT variable to predict actual years of exposure (as in Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2014) it attracts a highly significant estimated coefficient of 1.603\n(with an associated standard error of 0.046).

The voucher system enabled students to attend newly established schools funded by their home municipality. Both public and free schools in Sweden receive the same level of per pupil funding, so overall funds going to state schools fall as the share of students choosing to attend free schools rises. It was hoped that this competition for students would drive up educational standards amongst incumbent schools.\nThe research on these Swedish independent schools has focused on the competitive effects of the voucher system. For example, Bohlmark and Lindahl (2015) relate the share of free school pupils at municipality level to municipality level test scores. 11 As noted by the authors, who find positive effects of the voucher reform, any overall performance effect found at this aggregated level is a mixture of the direct effect of increased free school attendance and the indirect effect that works through changes in state school performance that result from increased competition. The emphasis on the competition related effect of the reform means that little direct evidence exists of the gains from attending a free school. The small, and mainly positive effects that have been found, are elaborated upon in Table 3 .\nIn contrast to the above, the research on charter schools has focused on the direct impact of charter school attendance on both test scores and, in a limited number of cases, further outcomes such as college enrolment. The use of admission lotteries to allocate places in oversubscribed charters has been used extensively as a natural experiment to isolate the casual effects of charter attendance (Abdulkadirolgu et al., 2011) on these outcomes.

The events we study are described in Table 4 . The Table shows The conversions we analyse in this paper are for state schools for which we have full data before and after they become an academy. Therefore, we are not able to study the 12 newly set up schools (where there was no predecessor school), nor the 5 private schools on which we do not have data. We also do not consider conversions from City Technology Colleges (CTCs) as they were already highly autonomous schools that were performing well.\nIn fact, many commentators have identified CTCs as the precursors of academies (see West and Bailey, 2013) . 14 This leaves us with the following numbers per year, as shown in the To illustrate the empirical approach we adopt, note that in the first year of conversions (2002/3), three schools became academies. We only consider children who were enrolled in the academy before conversion, which in this case will be children in year 7-10 in the school year 2001/2. Because they (and their parents or carers) have already made the enrolment decision to attend the school pre-conversion, the conversion is exogenous to them.\nBy focussing on individuals who have already made their enrolment decision, this is the approach referred to as studying legacy enrolments or 'grandfathered' children -defining pupils who stay in a converting school as 'grand-fathered' pupils -as exploited in, for example, Abdulkadiroglu et al. (2014) , who study school takeovers in New Orleans.\nThus children in year 10 in 2001/2 will sit their Key Stage 4 exams in 2002/3, getting one year exposure to the academy; children in year 9 in 2001/2 will sit their exams in 14 Almost all CTCs took up the opportunity to become academies when it arose with the introduction of academy schools. There were only 15 CTCs before the introduction of academy schools and 12 of them converted in the school years we consider in this paper. They were highly autonomous schools already, being able to not fully follow the national curriculum, to run their own admissions, and not being maintained by the local authority. One can argue that the autonomy gains they experienced from academy conversion were negligible, unlike for the state maintained schools that converted who we study in this paper.

We can thus match pupils in the same school years as the grandfathered children in treatment schools to those in these control schools. Over and above this, the use of students enrolled in future academy schools as a control group allows us to control for school level unobservables such as ethos for change or being 'academy friendly'; in addition, as academy schools are typically struggling before conversion it allows us to compare outcomes for pupils who choose to attend similar, low performing schools."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "The above example refers to one set of conversion events taking place in the 2002/3 school year.

As already noted, there is one exception, which is the conversions from City Technology Colleges, who we do not include in our analysis. For each of these cohorts of conversion, we identify year 7-10 pupils who are enrolled in a school that converts to academy status in the next academic year.

The IV estimates have the interpretation of local average treatment effects (LATE). 22 The estimated effects are local to those who were induced to attend an academy only because they were enrolled prior to conversion, meaning that these individuals would not have attended an academy had they not been pre-enrolled.

They require that those individuals who do not receive treatment, despite being pre-enrolled in an academy, would still not have received treatment if they had not been pre-enrolled. We also require that being pre-enrolled is random across individuals, and unrelated to, for instance, ability. The balancing tests shown above in Table 4 indicate that on average individuals pre-enrolled in a school that would subsequently become an academy did not differ in their KS4 performance compared to pupils enrolled in the control schools.

The results are shown for both outcome variables in Table 8 . Whilst the estimated coefficients do rise monotonically across the four dummy variables for all specifications, closer inspection of the separate estimates shows the linear continuous measure does not fully represent the pattern of the estimates. In particular, the effects for one year of exposure are quite small relative to two and above years. Indeed, it is two or more years of exposure that translates into sizable effects for both outcomes. 23 Over the period of analysis, on average about 21% of students in England entered university at age 18. Combined with an average non-completion probability of just under 10%, we estimate that about 20% of students complete a first degree with three years duration (Bachelor degree) within 5 years of leaving compulsory education, that is, by the age of 21. This measure of degree completion is somewhat strict, as it requires a straight path from lower secondary school to upper secondary school and immediate enrolment into a degree at age 18. Disadvantaged students often do not follow such a straight path into university and tend to take longer to complete university entry requirements. Furthermore, some students in the UK take a gap year between school and university. We are forced to adopt this strict definition of degree completion because the last cohort of KS4 exam takers (in school year 2008/9) used in our analysis is only observed in higher education data up to the year 2013/14, which is 5 years after age 16 exams. As more recent data becomes available in due course a relaxation of the degree completion definition to within 6 years can be adopted."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 22", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous effects and additional tests", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Variations by Free School Meals and Gender", "text": "In Table 9 we show estimates where years of exposure to an academy education in secondary school are allowed to vary with two pupil characteristics -free school meal eligibility status (FSM) and gender.

For those eligible for free school meals (FSM), there is a 0.089\u03c3 effect for an additional year of exposure as compared to a 0.063\u03c3 effect for non-FSM eligible pupils. There is a less marked gender related difference in effects, as shown in column (2), where magnitudes are nearly the same at 0.072\u03c3 for male pupils and 0.071\u03c3 for female pupils. Consideration of both pupil characteristics together, in the four-way breakdown shown in column (3), reveals that it is FSM rather than gender that is more important in terms of heterogeneous effects.\nEvidence of heterogeneity in the estimated effects is less clear for the degree completion outcome measure. As the estimates reported in columns (4) to (6) show, the estimates of the impact of years of exposure to being educated in an academy secondary school are similar when broken down by FSM or gender or by both. This is probably suggestive of some fade out of the initially bigger effects for FSM pupils at KS4.

The main school reforms of this nature that have taken place in the past twenty years or so have been the introduction of free schools in Sweden, charter schools in America and academy schools in England. We discuss how each has impacted on performance, but the main empirical application of the paper is on the causal impact of academy school attendance on pupil outcomes in England.\nWe study the academy introductions that took place in English secondary schools between the 2002/3 and 2008/9 school years. For the most part, these were conversions of already existing disadvantaged schools to academies, which were able to operate with much more autonomy than in their predecessor state after conversion.

Notes: Index (standardised to have mean zero and standard deviation one across all 34 OECD countries in PISA 2012) based upon six dimensions of school autonomy: teacher hiring; teacher firing; establishing teachers' starting salaries; determining teachers' salary increases; formulating the school budget; deciding on budget allocations in schools. The index is calculated from information on all six autonomy tasks on the percentage of students in schools who say that only 'principals and teachers' or both 'principals and teachers' and the 'regional/national education authority' has/have considerable responsibility as compared to only the 'regional/national education authority'. These numbers are the average index reported in Figure IV Academy schools (prior to 2010/11): all ability independent from local authority specialist schools, which do not charge fees, and are not maintained by the local authority; established by sponsors from business, faith, HE institutions or voluntary groups, working in partnership with central government.
