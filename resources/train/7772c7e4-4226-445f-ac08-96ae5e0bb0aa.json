[1] [2] [3] [4] The inflammation hypothesis of AD posits that chronic over-activation of microglia in response to the buildup of amyloid pathology results in a positive feedback loop whereby pro-inflammatory conditions sustain the elevated expression of factors that further exacerbate amyloidogenesis. 1, [5] [6] [7] In addition to the damaging effects of ''traditional'' neuroinflammation, defined by the activation of resident microglia and infiltration of peripheral monocytes, the immune response also serves to protect against neurodegeneration; studies show that increased expression of certain inflammatory cytokines may reduce Ab deposition 8 and promote cell survival and neurovascularization. 4, 9 The convergence of inflammation and cerebrovascular pathology in AD is becoming increasingly clear, yet the mechanisms behind this convergence are poorly understood. It is known that cerebral ischemia is a strong activator of the immune response, 10, 11 and that, in parallel, vascular irregularities are themselves risk factors for AD. 12, 13 Ab deposition within neurovasculature, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), may contribute to brain ischemia and lead to cognitive impairment. 14, 15 Cerebral infarcts are regions of ischemic damage associated with aging and present to a greater degree in individuals who develop AD than in those who do not. 16 The presence of both macro-and micro cerebral infarcts, caused largely by cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), 17 have been shown to influence risk for AD as well as global cognitive performance, [18] [19] [20] and may be a consequence of accumulating cerebrovascular insults (and accompanying hypoperfusion 21 ) that are implicated in neurodegenerative processes. 22 At the neuroimaging level, white matter lesions associated with SVD can be imaged in vivo as regions of increased signal on T2-weighted MR images; these white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been associated with increased age, the presence of cerebral infarcts, multiple vascular disease risk factors, AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis, and the progression from MCI to AD. 23, 24 At the molecular genetic level, the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) has recently become a focus of interest in the investigation of psychiatric and neurological illnesses with potential immune mechanisms of illness. TSPO is expressed in activated microglia and used as a biomarker for neuroinflammation 25, 26 ; it is found in the outer mitochondrial membrane where it is thought to regulate cholesterol transport, steroidogenesis, and apoptosis. 27 In vivo PET imaging studies using TSPO radioligands show increased binding in patients with acute brain injury, 28 multiple sclerosis, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] MCI, 34 and AD. 25, 35 A single genetic polymorphism located in exon 4 of the TSPO gene, rs6971 (Ala147Thr), reliably determines the binding affinity of second generation TSPO radioligands in the brain, 36, 37 where A/A, A/G, and G/G genotypes correspond to high, medium, and low-affinity binding phenotypes (herein referred to as HABs, MABs, and LABs, respectively). It is hypothesized that the Alanine to Threonine substitution at position 147 results in a conformational change in TSPO structure that influences its interaction with ligands. 36, 38, 39 Differences in binding affinity may have important implications for the etiopathology of AD; TSPO ligands have been shown to ameliorate neuroinflammation in vitro, 40 reverse neuropathology and behavioral decline in AD mouse models, 41 reduce Ab 42 -induced neurodegeneration in drosophila, 42 as well as confer neuroprotective and regenerative effects in vivo and in vitro. [43] [44] [45] [46] Despite this potential involvement of TSPO in the etiopathology of neurodegenerative disorders, and the well-known links between inflammation, cerebrovascular disease, and AD, no studies to date have investigated the effect of rs6971 on MRI-based phenotypes or inflammatory biomarkers. We therefore sought to test whether TSPO rs6971 genotype was associated with in vivo structural imaging measures of cerebrovascular disease and neuroinflammation in two large clinical samples (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Religious Orders Study/ Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP)). To identify potential mechanisms of action, we also analyzed the effect of genotype on levels of plasma inflammatory biomarkers in living subjects, as well as on cerebral infarcts, CAA, and densities of active microglia from postmortem brain tissue. Due to the anti-inflammatory action of TSPO ligands, 47 we hypothesize that that lowaffinity binding groups would have exacerbated pathology and increased levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers vs. medium-and high-affinity binding groups, as determined by genotype."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject characteristics and genetics", "text": "ADNI.

To our knowledge, we are also the first to analyze the effect of rs6971 on microglial activation and postmortem neuropathology. We found no significant effects of TSPO genotype with respect to postmortem or in vivo cerebral infarcts (Figure 1 ). While we found a marginally protective effect (0.05 < P < 0.1) of genotype on in vivo WMH burden (ADNI 1), this finding did not replicate in either of two independent samples (ADNI GO and 2, ROS/MAP) ( Figure 2 ). Further, we found diagnosis-dependent effects of TSPO genotype on plasma levels of TNFa (ADNI 1) that did not replicate in an independent sample (ROS/MAP). After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant association of TSPO genotype with either degree of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microglial activation in postmortem tissue. Exploratory analyses found no interactions of TSPO and APOE genotypes.\nWe hypothesized that genotype-driven alterations in TSPO structure may influence its downstream neuroprotective action, [43] [44] [45] [46] thereby conferring early and enduring risk across the lifespan for atherosclerotic damage, SVD, and potentially inflammatory dysregulation. The observed trend effects of TSPO genotype on vascular phenotypes (as well as amyloid angiopathy) were most prominent in the CN subgroups of both samples; this suggests that the effects of TSPO variation may be dependent on the time course of illness, with the greatest genotype differences observed in pre-symptomatic or early stage AD subjects. Interestingly, the HAB subjects appeared to be both marginally protected from micro infarcts as well as from increased CAA severity in the ROS/MAP sample, though neither result achieved statistical significance at P < 0.05. While association between micro infarcts and severe CAA has been previously shown, 71 it is possible that the level of neuropathology across MCI and AD groups in the ROS/MAP sample is not high enough to observe a similarly significant pattern of TSPO effects on these measures; ROS subjects are priests, nuns, and brothers with well-documented healthy lifestyles and greater than average lifespan. 72 In our ADNI 1 analysis of inflammatory biomarkers, we found a diagnosis-dependent effect of TSPO genotype on TNFa, whereby HABs had higher levels if they were diagnosed with AD. TNFa is generally regarded as a ''traditional'' pro-inflammatory cytokine, but recent evidence suggests that TNFa may have regulatory roles in a diverse set of processes within the central nervous system including cell viability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. 73, 74 This finding, however, was not replicated in ROS/ MAP, suggesting that the association is likely null. This null association is further supported by our negative observations for the other four biomarkers tested. Despite evidence for the cross-talk of peripheral and central immune systems, 75 it is possible that bloodbased inflammatory biomarkers were unable to capture brain-specific molecular effects of TSPO variation.\nIn line with our primarily null findings, the evolving literature on TSPO function is somewhat equivocal, and genome-wide association studies of AD and ADrelated phenotypes have not demonstrated significant associations with TSPO variants. It is possible that the relationship between TSPO genotype and AD is modulated by additional factors that have not yet been identified. Our main effect results align with a very recent investigation of TSPO genotype effects on in vivo amyloid and cognition in the ADNI cohort, 76 which found no differences between HAB, MAB, and LAB subjects across or within diagnostic subgroups. At the molecular level, the role of TSPO in steroidogenesis has recently been called into question 77 following two studies: one showing that testicular production of testosterone was unaltered in a conditional TSPO knockout mouse, 78 and the other showing that the global knockout mouse was viable 79 (contrary to previous reports 80 ). These studies, however, do not preclude the possibility that, when present, different forms of TSPO may function in potentially divergent ways. To test this directly in the context of immune system activation, we examined the effect of genotype on microglial activation in human postmortem brain tissue, finding no genotypic group differences. Importantly, these results suggest that the mechanism via which TSPO genotype may influence downstream pathology and disease risk does not involve the modulation of microglial activation.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, while efforts were made to ensure genotype groups were matched for socio-demographic factors, potential confounding effects of unaccounted-for subclinical pathology or other environmental factors cannot be ruled out. Second, population stratification due to ethnic diversity is a concern in any genetic analysis and must be considered as a potential confounder. The observed minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for TSPO rs6971 in the ROS/MAP and ADNI samples were 0.32 and 0.31, respectively, consistent with observations in other Caucasian populations (HapMap-CEU MAF \u00bc 0.29 (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ cgi-perl/snp_details_phase3?name\u00bcrs6971&source\u00bc hapmap28_B36&tmpl\u00bcsnp_details_phase3)). Third, we recognize that the literature shows discordance between patterns of inflammatory biomarkers measured in serum vs. CSF, 81 and thus our plasma biomarker results may not apply to brain-specific inflammation. Fourth, M1-and M2-like microglial phenotypes 82, 83 have been shown to have distinct and often opposing roles in disease. 84, 85 Given that we did not quantify the relative densities of M1-and M2-like microglia, it is possible that a genotype effect on either specific cellular population may have been missed. Fifth, AD is being increasingly recognized as a pathologically heterogeneous disorder, 86 and great variability exists even at the level of our well-defined endophenotypes (i.e. location and type of infarcts and hyperintensities); therefore, heterogeneity between subjects and within diagnostic groups likely contributed to our negative findings. Finally, study design differences between ADNI and ROS/MAP should be acknowledged when considering our findings. While inter-study variability in image processing pipelines (for WMHv) and plasma protein quantification methods could potentially drive differences between sample results, the fact that we found no significant effects of genotype in either sample (other than for plasma TNFa in ADNI AD subjects only) should alleviate concerns regarding false negatives.\nIn conclusion, our findings do not support genetic variation in TSPO at rs6971 as a cerebrovascular and inflammatory risk factor related to neurodegeneration. In particular, the observed null effects of rs6971 on levels of microglial density across brain regions suggest that TSPO structural changes due to genotype likely do not alter interactions with endogenous ligands in a manner that influences microglial activation. While we provide the first insight into the potential effects of rs6971 variation on structural imaging and postmortem brain pathology in humans, continued in vitro and animal model experiments of differential TSPO binding would be required to verify the pathway-level impact of this variation with respect to AD etiopathology.
