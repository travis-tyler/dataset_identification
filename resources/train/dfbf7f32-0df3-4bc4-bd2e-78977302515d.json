[{"section_title": "", "text": "What percentage of public school teachers earn additional income by working during the summer? Regular, full-time public school teachers were asked if they worked during the summer before the 2015-2016 school year. Overall, 32 percent of teachers reported that they had a summer job. Using categories that were provided, teachers reported these jobs as teaching summer school (15 percent), nonteaching but in a school (6 percent), and nonschool (16 percent). Teachers were able to select more than one category if they had multiple summer jobs (figure 1). There was some variation by region, with a larger percentage of teachers in the Midwest and Northeast (36 and 34 percent, respectively) working in summer jobs than teachers in the South and West (both 30 percent). When percentages of teachers reporting each type of summer employment were compared across regions, the largest differences were in the percentage working in nonschool jobs in the Midwest (20 percent) versus the Northeast (16 percent), South (15 percent), and West (14 percent). Teachers were separately asked about second jobs held during the school year. Overall, 38 percent had any outside job, either during the school year or during the summer. In particular, 20 percent reported having a summer job only, 5 percent reported having an outside job during the school year only, and 13 percent reported having both (figure 2). Data in this report are from the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey, a nationally representative sample survey. To learn more, visit https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps.

The national average (mean) annual full-time teacher base salary was $55,000 during the 2015-16 school year. Teachers in the Northeast earned an average base salary of $68,000, followed by teachers in the West ($59,300), Midwest ($52,900), and South ($48,000). How much do teachers add to their base salary through summer earnings, and what types of summer jobs pay the most? Nationally, regular, full-time public school teachers who had summer jobs earned an average of $3,700 from those summer jobs (figure 3). The largest regional difference in summer income was between teachers in the Northeast ($4,000) and teachers in the South ($3,400). At the national level, teachers reporting summer employment earned more from nonschool jobs ($4,100) than from teaching summer school ($2,600) or from nonteaching jobs at a school ($2,400). This pattern held across each of the four regions. At the national level, average summer earnings were higher among those teaching summer school ($2,600) than those working in nonteaching jobs at a school ($2,400). At the regional level, this difference was only significant in the West, with higher summer earnings among those teaching summer school ($2,900) than those working in a school with a nonteaching job ($2,100)."}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "A regular, full-time teacher is any teacher whose primary position in a school is not an itinerant teacher, a long-term substitute, a short-term substitute, a student teacher, a teacher aide, an administrator, a library media staff member or librarian, another type of professional staff (e.g., counselor, curriculum coordinator, social worker), support staff (e.g., secretary), or a part-time teacher.
