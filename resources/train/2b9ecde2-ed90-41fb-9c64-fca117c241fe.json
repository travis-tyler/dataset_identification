[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We compare productivity and technical efficiency of organic and conventional dairy farms in the United States. We address self-selection into organic farming by using propensity score matching and explicitly test the hypothesis that organic and conventional farms employ a single, homogeneous technology. Utilizing the 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey on Dairy Costs and Returns Report data, we reject the homogeneous technology hypothesis and find that the organic dairy technology is approximately 13 percent less productive. However, we find little difference in technical efficiency between organic and conventional farms when technical efficiency is measures against the appropriate technology.\nKey words: dairy, organic, productivity, propensity score matching, stochastic frontier, technical efficiency Carlos D.

In 2005, certified organic dairy farms accounted for approximately 1 percent of the dairy cows in the U.S. and accounted for less than 1 percent of total U.S. milk production (McBride and Greene 2007) . However, from 2003 to 2006, sales of organic dairy products nearly doubled, making organic dairy one of the fastest growing segments of organic agriculture in the United States, as well as a fast growing segment of U.S. dairy (Organic Trade Association). Growth in demand for organic dairy has been fueled by a complex mix of consumer concerns of food safety, nutrition, concern for the environment, and other factors (Klonsky 2000; Blank and Thompson 2004; Rotz et al. 2007) . Growth in supply has been spurred in part by the promise of high returns relative to conventional dairy farming, as well as environmental concerns on the part of producers (McBride and Greene 2007) . Proponents of the organic movement have held up the organic model as a potentially profitable alternative to conventional dairy production, especially for smaller operations as well as new farmers (Sato et al. 2005; Rotz et al. 2007 ).\nYet little is known about the production practices of the organic dairy sector, not in small part because the industry is so new. In particular, little work to date has systematically addressed the effect of organic standards on the production process. Under standards defined and enforced by the USDA's National Organic Program, organic farming systems exclude the use of synthetic chemicals, antibiotics, and hormones in crop and livestock production. Organic livestock production systems also regulate feeding practices, requiring, for example, that dairy cows have access to pasture (Greene and Kremen 2003) . These standards restrict the technology of dairy 2 farming. Not surprisingly, several studies have documented reduced yields of organic farms relative to conventional farms (Tzouvelekas, Pantzios, and Fotopoulos 2001a; Tzouvelekas, Pantzios, and Fotopoulos 2001b; Oude Lansink, Pietola, and Backman 2002; Sipilainen and Oude Lansink 2005; Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipilainen 2008) . Yield differences may be due to a less productive technology or lower technical efficiency in production on organic farms, or both. Measured differences in productivity and efficiency may also be influenced by selfselection in the choice of production technology, and thus not entirely attributable to organic standards.\nOnly two studies have compared the productivity and efficiency of organic and conventional dairy farms; both use data on Finnish farms. Sipilainen and Oude Lansink (2005) used the Heckman-type correction for selection into organic production by appending the inverse Mill's ratio as a covariate in the production technology specifications. They found technical efficiency of organic dairy farms to be on average 4.5 percentage points lower than that of conventional dairy farms. Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipilainen (2008) addressed self-selection into organic production by jointly estimating the production frontiers and technology choice, where technology choice was modeled as a function of technical inefficiency and other farm characteristics. They found that on average organic farms could have produced 5.3 percent more milk had they used conventional technology. They also found that technical efficiency of organic dairy farms was on average 5 percentage points lower than that of conventional farms.\nMissing from these studies is an appropriate, formal test of the homogeneous technology assumption. Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipilainen (2008) Agricultural Resource Management Survey-Dairy Costs and Returns Report which provides the first comprehensive data on a nationally representative sample of organic dairy farms in the United States. We address potential self-selection in the choice of dairy production system by utilizing propensity score matching (PSM) to compare organic farms to otherwise similar conventional farms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply PSM to address selfselection in productivity analysis. We estimate a stochastic frontier model of dairy technology and test the hypothesis that organic and similar conventional dairy farms use a homogeneous technology. To illustrate the importance of technology and self-selection, we also estimate models of dairy farm technology that assume a homogeneous technology and ignore selfselection.\nIn microeconomic theory, the primal transformation function, or production frontier, describes the maximum output that may be obtained given inputs and technology. Some inputs may be varied at the discretion of the decision maker, while other inputs are exogenously fixed, acting as constraints to the production process. Any deviation from the maximal output is typically 4 considered technical inefficiency (Coelli et al. 2005; Ray 1988) . A firm that operates at the production frontier has a technical efficiency of 100 percent.\nA non-discretionary input of particular importance to this paper is the set of organic standards which impose constraints on the types and quantity of inputs that may be used to produce organic milk. Our objective is to test whether these production restrictions affect the production frontier, technical efficiency, or both the frontier and technical efficiency.\nWe adopt the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) framework to estimate production frontiers and measure technical efficiency. This approach takes into account the stochastic nature of agricultural processes, and also allows the inclusion of categorical variables in the characterization of technology.\nThe stochastic production frontier model is specified as\nwhere y i denotes the output for the ith farm (i = 1, ..., N), x i is a vector of the production inputs including a column of ones, \u03b2 is a vector of parameters to be estimated, v i is a two-sided stochastic term that accounts for statistical noise, and u i is a non-negative stochastic term representing inefficiency. Standard assumptions on the stochastic terms are that E[v i ] = 0 for all i, Under the further assumptions that v i is normally distributed and u i is half-normally distributed, the density function for\nis the standard normal density, and \u03a6 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (Hadri, Guermat, and Whittaker 2003) . The log-likelihood function for the double heteroscedastic production frontier model is\nThe output-oriented measure of firm specific technical efficiency is the ratio of observed output to the corresponding stochastic frontier output, i.e. when u i = 0 (Battese and Coelli 1988).\nSince the output is in natural logarithmic form, technical efficiency is defined as:\n(4) exp .\nTo predict firm-specific technical efficiency we need to assess the value of u i . After the frontier has been fit to the data, we are able to obtain an estimate of \u03b5 i , which is then used to disentangle \nAs discussed in the previous section, the frontier production function may differ between organic and conventional farms because of restrictions on the production process imposed by organic standards. We wish to test for different technologies by allowing the parameters of the production function, \u03b2, to differ for organic and conventional farms; that is, by including an organic indicator variable that interacts with the input vector x i . However, estimation of such a model is complicated by self-selection in the choice of production method. Dairy farmers selfselect into organic production. The choice to produce under organic standards may be modeled as a propensity o i * that depends on observable farm and farmer characteristics, w i :\nwhere \u03b1 is a vector of parameters and e i is a random error. If any of the determinants of technology choice, w i , also affect milk production but are not included explicitly in equation (1) approach also suffers from a \"common vexing occurrence\" of least square residuals being skewed in the wrong direction, which makes the estimation of frontiers more complicated (p.541).\nWe propose a matching approach to address self-selection. In contrast to Heckman-type methods that model sample selection bias, matching models are a special case of selection models which assume that conditioning on observable variables eliminates sample selection bias (Heckman and Navarro-Lozano, 2004) . In essence matching models create the conditions of an experiment in which production type (organic vs. non-organic) is randomly assigned, allowing for the identification of a causal link between organic technology and productivity.\nWe utilize a class of matching models called propensity score matching (PSM) to measure the effect of adopting organic production technology on productivity and technical efficiency of organic farms. The effect of organic standards on productivity is defined as E(Y 1 - (1983) show that the independence condition also holds when conditioning on a propensity score P(Z), hence the name propensity score matching. PSM reduces the dimensionality of having to match on Z. If the assumptions of this method hold, then E(Y 0 | P(Z),\nPropensity score matching is a three step procedure. In the first step, a probability model for adoption of organic production standards is estimated and used to calculate the probability or propensity score of being organic for each observation. In the second step, each organic farm is then matched to a conventional farm with a similar propensity score. For this analysis we consider single-nearest-neighbor matching, where each organic farm is paired with the conventional farm that has the closest propensity score. All other conventional farms are discarded for the analysis (Dehejia and Wahba 2002). In the third step we estimate the stochastic frontier model on the sub-sample of organic farms and matched conventional farms, and test the hypothesis that these farms employ a homogeneous technology.\nA limitation of the PSM approach (and, incidentally of the approach proposed by Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipilainen, 2008) is that unobservable variables that may affect both the choice of production technology and technology are not accounted for directly. We assume that the distributions of such unobservables are the same for organic and conventional farms.\nImbens (2004) argues for the validity of a matching approach on the basis that the unobservable factors that affect the optimizing behavior of agents, i.e. adoption of organic technology, are independent of outcomes of interest to that analyst, i.e. milk output. In fact, Imbens (2004) elaborates on an example akin to this study, i.e. the effect of adopting a new technology on a firm's output. In this example, whether a farmer adopts a technology is dependent on firmspecific marginal costs, and not output per se.\nImbens (2004) further states that the assumption that the distributions of unobserved variables are similar for treated and untreated agents is ultimately an empirical question. To provide some empirical evidence that the PSM approach is in fact eliminating the selection bias, we conduct formal tests of the endogeneity of the organic dummy variable in the production frontier.\nWe assume a Cobb-Douglas functional form for f(x) in (1), estimating the model:\nwhere y i is the natural log of farm milk output, x i is a vector of discretionary production inputs (also in natural logs) and a column of ones, I is an indicator variable for organic farms, z i is a vector of non-discretionary inputs of farm and operator characteristics, and , \u03c4, and \u03b3 are parameters to be estimated.\nWe estimate the following probit specification of (6) to obtain propensity scores:\nwhere w i is a vector of farm and farmer characteristics and \u03b1 is a vector of parameters to be estimated. The propensity score for each farm is the estimated probability of being organic.\nWe use data on U. Data are collected on farm and operator characteristics, revenue and costs of production, marketing practices, production technology, and management practices. We consider the use of TDN content to be appropriate because it is a quantity measure that is not influenced by the higher weight of certain feed items. Capital includes the ownership costs (depreciation and interest) of the investment on buildings and machinery devoted to dairy production. Our 'other inputs' category includes expenditures on agricultural chemicals, marketing containers, livestock purchases of heifers, bedding and litter, medical supplies, fuel, electricity, repairs/maintenance of machinery and buildings, contract labor, custom work, renting of machinery, and fees paid for professional services.\nThe non-discretionary inputs in z i include farm and operator characteristics. Farm characteristics include: use of rbST, type of milking facility, average weight of milking cows that are retired from the farm (which we use as a proxy for breed differences), region, percent of land rented, whether the farm supplies more than 25 percent of forage needs from pasture during pasture months, percent of replacement heifers raised in the farm, percent of feed items produced in the farm, and years that the dairy farm has existed. Operator characteristics include college education, age, years that the farmer has participated in the dairy industry, and hours of off-farm 12 work. Heteroscedasticity of the statistical and inefficiency variances are concurrently specified as a function of herd size, i.e. number of milking cows in logarithmic form.\nWe specify selection into organic production, equation (8), as a function of farm and farmer characteristics, as well management practices. For farm characteristics hypothesized to influence propensity to choose organic include region, use of a parlor, use of automatic takeoffs on parlors, herd size, pasture usage per cow, average weight of culled cows, percent of land rented, percent of feed items produced in the farm, and years that the farm has operated.\nOperator characteristics include college education of the main operator, age, years that the operator has participated in the dairy industry, and the operator's expectation that the farm will continue to produce milk for more than 11 years. The management practices include participation in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA), use of a nutritionist, use of veterinarian services, and seasonally drying off cows. For both the frontier and probit models we use the natural log transformations of all continuous variables. Continuous variables with a zero value were further transformed by adding one prior to the log transformation.\nSummary statistics and statistical significance of tests on equality of means for continuous variables and equality of proportions for binary variables of organic and conventional"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "farming.

There are no significant differences in terms of average capital invested per cow.\nThere are significant differences in farm characteristics. Most of the organic dairies are located in the Upper Midwest (44%) and the East (41%), followed by the Cornbelt (9%) and West (6%) regions. There are no organic dairies in the Southwest or Southeast in our sample.\nMost of the conventional dairies are also in the Upper Midwest (41%) followed by the East information regarding specific breed differences between organic and conventional dairies, yet from the weight of cows retired from the dairy it is evident that larger breeds predominate in conventional dairies. On average a retired milking cow from a conventional dairy weighs 1,295 pounds whereas a retired milking cow from an organic dairy weighs on average 1,177 pounds. A higher proportion of organic farms provide more than 25 percent of forage needs from pasture during pasture months.\nAlthough not statistically significant, operators of organic dairies tend to be younger, and thus have devoted less time to dairy farming. Organic operators are also more likely to have a college degree. There are no significant differences in off-farm work measured in hours per year.\nOn average, the operator of an organic dairy works outside the farm for about 130 hours a year and a conventional operator for 143 hours. When dairy operators were asked \"How many more years do you expect this operation will be producing milk?\" 66 percent of the organic operators responded a longer planning horizon of \"11 or more\" years compared to 48 percent of the conventional operators.\nIn terms of management practices, there are some clear differences between production systems. As expected, rbST is not used in organic dairies. In conventional farms, about 8 percent of the milking herd is using rbST. Conventional farms also invest more in veterinarian and nutritional management of the herd. Approximately 70 percent of conventional dairies report the use of regularly scheduled veterinary services, whereas only 39 percent of organic dairies do so.\nApproximately 73 percent of conventional dairies use a nutritionist to design mixes or purchase feed, whereas 45 percent of organic dairies do so.

A higher proportion of feed raised on the farm, and a higher proportion of rented land are also associated with organic production.

The only management practice that is associated with organic production is farmer participation in DHIA. The use of veterinarian and nutritionist services and seasonal drying off of cows are not strongly associated with organic farming. Younger farmers are more likely to farm organically, as are farmers that have a longer planning horizon.

As expected, the distribution of propensity scores for all conventional farms is skewed towards zero. By design, the distribution of the sub-sample of matched conventional farms more closely resembles that of organic dairy farms.\nThe By design, and as shown in figure 2, compared to the full sample of conventional farms, the matched sub-sample of conventional farms more closely resemble organic farms in terms of propensity to adopt organic production.

We estimate two different models. In the first we assume that both organic and conventional dairy farms have the same production technology. The specification for the second model allows the organic and conventional production technologies to differ. Using the model that allows for different technologies, we test the restrictions that the organic intercept and slope shifters are jointly equal to zero. The resulting chi-squared statistic from a Wald test is 14.25 with 6 degrees of freedom (p-value = 0.027). Thus we reject the null hypothesis that the organic intercept and slope shifters are jointly equal to zero at conventional significance levels.\nThat is, we reject the hypothesis of a homogeneous technology for organic and conventional dairy farms.\nWe find both discretionary and nondiscretionary inputs that statistically significantly affect productivity. For conventional production, the input elasticities for cows, feed and other costs are positive and statistically significant. Cows have the largest marginal effect on milk production, followed by feed, and other costs. For organic production, we find the intercept shifter to be negative and statistically significant, indicative of lower productivity in organic production. We also find the input elasticity of cows to be lower in organic production, and the input elasticity of capital higher in organic production, although the differences are not statistically significant.\nAdding up the coefficients on discretionary inputs to measure economies of scale, we find statistically significant increasing returns to scale in both organic and conventional production. The chi-squared statistic for a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the sum of the 5 input elasticity coefficients for conventional production are equal to one is 18.21 with 1 degree of freedom (p-value = 0.00002). We reject the hypothesis that the sum of marginal elasticity coefficients for conventional production is equal to one. The chi-squared statistic for a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the sum of the 10 input elasticity coefficients for organic production are equal to one is 8.77 with 1 degree of freedom (p-value = 0.003). We reject the hypothesis that the sum of marginal elasticity coefficients for organic production is equal to one. Increasing all inputs by 1 percent would cause a 1.33-percent increase in milk output on an organic farm, and a 1.21-percent increase in milk output on conventional farms. Previous research has found economies of scale for conventional farms in the U.S. dairy industry (Mosheim and Knox Lovell 2009; Tauer and Mishra 2006) . To our knowledge, our research is the first to show that economies of scale also exist in organic dairy production. Although organic farms appear to benefit more from increasing returns to scale than conventional farms, the difference is not statistically significant. The chi-squared statistic for a Wald test of the null hypothesis that the input elasticity coefficients of conventional production are equal to the coefficients of organic production is 3.53 with 5 degrees of freedom (p-value = 0.619). We fail to reject the hypothesis that the marginal elasticity coefficients of conventional and organic production are equal. Yet the organic and conventional technologies as a whole are different. In particular, the organic technology is less productive than the conventional technology all else equal, as shown by the negative, statistically significant coefficient on the organic dummy intercept shifter.\nWe find that compared to the Upper Midwest, the technology used by farms in the Southeast is more productive. Farms with cows of higher weight also produce more milk. This agrees with previous research which has documented more milk production by heavier cows, especially Holsteins (White et al. 2002; Sehested, Kristensen, and S\u00f8egaard 2003; Sato et al. 2005 ). In terms of management practices we find that farms that tend to rent more of their land for either crop production or pasture are less productive. Intuitively, a renter does not have the same incentive as a land owner to invest in the productivity of the land. Farms that raise more of their own feed seem to be less productive. This may be an indication of decreasing returns to fixed management stock (Alvarez and Arias 2004) . Operator age is associated with lower productivity. Variability in the production frontier due to technical inefficiency is approximately 1.6 times that of the variability due to the stochastic nature of milk production. Using a Wald test with a chi-square value of 11.59 and 2 degrees of freedom, we reject the null hypothesis that both variances are homoscedastic. Herd size has a statistically significant effect on the statistical and inefficiency variances. As herd size increases, statistical variance decreases while inefficiency variance increases.\nTo assess productivity differences between organic and conventional dairy farms we evaluate the stochastic frontiers at the means of discretionary inputs for all farms. When we allow technologies to be different, we find that the organic technology is 13 percent less productive than the technology used by conventional farms. This means that the best practice organic farms are not able to produce as much as a conventional dairy farm operating at the production frontier. Stigler (1976) , who argued that the measurement of inefficiency is but the lack of accounting for differences in technology between firms.\nOur productivity and efficiency results suggest that observed differences between productivity of organic and conventional dairy farms are due primarily to differences in technology, with inefficiency playing a negligible role. This result differs from findings of Kumbhakar, Tsionas, and Sipilainen (2008) and Sipilainen and Oude Lansink (2005) , each of whom find an important role for inefficiency.\nTo highlight the importance of addressing selection, we also estimate similar stochastic frontier models on the sample of all dairy farms (i.e., ignoring potential self-selection into organic). Results are presented in Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander (2009) . Input elasticities are mostly similar to those estimated on the sub-sample (table 3) . But inference on productivity and inefficiency is quite different. In particular, when we ignore selection into organic we find a bigger effect of organic on productivity; the organic frontier is 16 percent less productive than the conventional frontier, compared to a 13 percent difference when we use PSM to control for selection. Moreover, when we further assume that the technology is the same, average technical efficiency is 11 percentage points lower on organic farms than on conventional farms. Again, assuming a homogeneous technology leads to an overstatement of the inefficiency of organic farms."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This article contributes to the literature on organic versus conventional agricultural production and efficiency in two important ways. First, we use propensity score matching (PSM) to address potential self-selection in production method. Second, we explicitly test the hypothesis that organic and conventional farms employ a single, homogeneous technology. Our application employs the 2005 ARMS data that provides for the first time comprehensive, farm-level information for a nationally representative sample of organic dairy farms in the United States.\nAfter rejecting the homogeneous technology hypothesis, we estimate separate technologies for organic and conventional farms and generate technology-appropriate measures of technical efficiency. We find that the organic dairy technology is 13 percent less productive than that used by conventional farms matched to the organic farms on farm and operator characteristics.\nHowever, we find little difference in technical efficiency across these two groups of farms when technical efficiency is measured relative to the appropriate technology.\nThese findings differ dramatically from inference drawn from analyses that assume homogeneous technology and/or ignore self-selection in the choice of production technology.\nWhen PSM is used to control for self-selection, but a homogeneous technology is assumed, we find organic farms are, on average, 5 percentage points less efficient than conventional farms.\nThus, imposing a homogeneous technology on all farms results in a downward bias in the estimated efficiency of organic farms. When we ignore self-selection and assume homogeneous technology we find that organic farms are, on average, 11 percentage points less efficient than conventional farms. Thus, failure to correct for self-selection also results in a downward bias in the estimated efficiency of organic dairy farms.\nFurther, when we control for self-selection and estimate separate production frontiers for organic and (matched) conventional farms, the disparity in technical efficiency all but disappears. In this case we find mean efficiencies for organic and conventional farms statistically indistinguishable.\nGiven previous findings that unit costs are higher on organic farms (McBride and Greene, 2007) , our finding that the organic technology is less productive suggests that profit-maximizing dairy farms will continue to require a premium over conventional milk in order to stay in the organic market. The results also suggest that public policies aimed at enhancing viability of organic farms should support innovations that increase productivity of the organic technology, for example, R&D to increase the productivity of dairy technology given the organic standards.\nThere is also room to increase efficiency of organic farms, but inefficiency does not appear to be a disadvantage for organic farms relative to conventional farms. The sub-sample of conventional farms matched to organic farms on the basis of the estimated likelihood, or propensity, to produce organic milk.

We are not able to identify the quantity of inputs allocated to each type of production. Thus we drop these farms from our analysis."}]
