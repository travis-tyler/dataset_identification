A potential mechanism that may contribute to these deficits is loss of learning and memory-induced neuroanatomical plasticity. The anatomical structure of the healthy adult human brain is plastic, and demonstrates both short-and long-term learning-induced remodeling that is detectable as volumetric differences on MRI (Draganski et al., 2004; Maguire et al., 2000) . Specifically, neuroanatomical plasticity in response to long-term spatial learning and recall was demonstrated in successful London taxi driver trainees, who at the end of their training demonstrated greater grey matter (GM) volume in the posterior hippocampi compared to unsuccessful trainees and non-taxi-driving controls (Woollett and Maguire, 2011) . Recently, using high-resolution in situ post-mortem MRI and deformation-based morphometry (DBM), we showed specific growth in the dorsal hippocampus (equivalent to posterior hippocampus in human) of mice trained for five days on the spatial Morris water maze (MWM) (Lerch et al., 2011a) . To date, it is not known to what extent learning and memoryinduced hippocampal plasticity is affected in transgenic mouse models of AD.\nCerebral blood flow (CBF) insufficiency has been associated with altered learning and memory (Iadecola, 2004) . Its early appearance in AD has raised the question as to whether hypoperfusion contributes to the cognitive decline (Zlokovic et al., 2005) . Cognitive task-induced regional CBF increase is attenuated in at-risk individuals (Xu et al., 2007) and in AD patients (Peters et al., 2009 ). These observations, and the finding that CBF insufficiency can negate the effects of memory enhancing agents (Yoshida et al., 2007) , suggest that therapy that improves CBF and leads to a better blood supply to neurons could potentially improve memory in AD (Li et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2007) .\nOne such candidate is the drug pioglitazone, an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3). Pioglitazone is safe to administer to AD patients (Geldmacher et al., 2011) and was shown to improve cognition and cerebral perfusion in mild AD patients with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Sato et al., 2009) . We demonstrated in elderly AD mice that short-term pioglitazone-treatment normalized cerebrovascular function, but not cognitive performance, possibly due to short treatment duration and the very late stage of the pathology (Nicolakakis et al., 2008) . Given that pioglitazone was also able to blunt cerebral oxidative stress, glial activation, and cholinergic denervation, processes strongly associated with AD, we suggested that a favorable response on memory might be elicited by earlier and longer treatment. In the current study, we assess whether spatial learning and memory-related neuroanatomical plasticity is diminished in adult APP mice, and whether early-initiated, long-term pioglitazone-treatment improves cerebrovascular function, cognitive performance and neuroanatomical plasticity."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mice", "text": "Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP mice, line J20) and their wildtype (WT) littermates (C57BL/6J) were used in this study.

The transgene is driven by the platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2 promoter, which leads to increased production of APP-derived amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides. To eliminate sex-associated differences in brain structure, and potential estrus-cycle-related effects on working memory, only males were used. A total of 135 mice were employed, in particular, 58 APP mice and 77 WT littermates.

Activity-induced increase in CBF was measured in young mice (8 WT, 5 APP) before and after 3-day pioglitazone-treatment to determine (a) if APP overexpression induced cerebrovascular insufficiency is present in young APP mice, and (b) whether pioglitazone counters this impairment early during the course of treatment. Activity-induced increase in CBF was measured in adult mice (5 WT, 5 WT(pio), 5 APP, and 4 APP(pio)), where the treated groups received 3-months of pioglitazone, to determine (a) if cerebrovascular insufficiency is persistent, and (b) whether long-term pioglitazone-treatment rescues this insufficiency. We use the level of activity-induced increase in CBF as a marker of global cerebrovascular performance. Anesthetized mice (ketamine 85 mg/kg, intra-muscular (i.m.) and xylazine 3 mg/kg, i.m, Wyeth, St-Laurent QC, Canada) were fixed in a stereotaxic frame and the bone over the barrel cortex was thinned to translucency for positioning of the laser probe. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a heating pad. Changes in CBF before, during, and after unilateral whisker stimulation (3-6 stimulations, 20 s at 8-10 Hz) were recorded, with four to six recordings acquired every 30-40 s and averaged for each mouse.

A black curtain surrounded the pool, obscuring the distal visual landmarks, to minimize reliance on spatial strategies.\nIn both mazes, on each training day, mice received six training trials (presented in two blocks of three trials; inter-block interval was 1 h). The trial began by placing the mouse into the pool facing the wall, in one of four pseudo-randomly chosen start locations. The trial was complete once the mouse found the platform or 60 s had elapsed. If the mouse failed to find the platform on a given trial, the experimenter guided the mouse onto the platform. Spatial memory was assessed on day 5; 2 h after the final training trial, using a single 60 s probe trial during which the platform was removed from the pool. Movement of mice in the pool was followed and analyzed with the 2020 Plus tracking system and Water 2020 software (Ganz FC62D video camera; HVS Image). During training (learning phase of the test), we assessed the escape latency (the time to reach the platform) in both mazes over five days of training. In addition, for the spatial MWM, we assessed the swim path distance versus time and the mouse learning capacity using the slopes of the curves of the escape latencies (Drouin et al., 2011) , which quantify the improvement of escape latency over time as a measure of learning. Performance in the spatial MWM probe trial was evaluated using crossings over the platform area (an index of memory precision; Morris, 1984) , percent distance covered in the target quadrant (an index of memory retrieval; Morris, 1984) , percent distance covered in non-target quadrants, and swim paths.

Prior to imaging, the samples were removed from the contrast agent solution, blotted and placed into plastic tubes (13 mm diameter) filled with a proton-free susceptibilitymatching fluid (Fluorinert FC-77, 3M Corp., St. Paul, MN). Three custombuilt, solenoid coils (14 mm diameter, 18.3 cm in length) with over wound ends were used to image three brains in parallel. Parameters used in the scans were optimized for grey/white matter contrast (Lerch et al., 2011a) : a T2-weighted, 3D fast spin-echo sequence was acquired with 6 echoes, with TR/TE = 325/32 ms, four averages, field-ofview 14 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 25 mm 3 and matrix size = 432 \u00d7 432 \u00d7 780, giving an image with 32 \u03bcm isotropic voxels. Total imaging time was 11.3 h per scan. The resulting images underwent a non-linear deformation algorithm (Avants et al., 2008) to align, in a blinded manner, corresponding anatomical features among all 103 brain images. This algorithm proceeded iteratively, aligning the individual images to an evolving average image that gained anatomical fidelity as more degrees of freedom were added to account for the individual anatomical differences. The final deformation fields that aligned each individual scan to the average were then analyzed using the Jacobian determinant to compute local volume change (Lerch et al., 2011b) for each mouse. Cortical thickness was also measured using a Laplacian thickness algorithm . In addition to the voxel-wise analyses, an anatomical atlas comprised of 62 defined regions was used to perform automated template-based segmentation of regional volumes such that the same labeled template was applied to each scan (Collins et al., 1995) . Using previously published guidelines , this template was augmented to 64 defined regions by manual segmentation of hippocampus proper into the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields by a single investigator (A.B.) using the average volume generated from 103 independent mouse brain images. The software Display was used for manual segmentation (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware Visualization/HomePage, MNI, Montr\u00e9al, Canada). The guidelines for the location and boundaries of CA fields were obtained using the Mouse Allen Reference Atlas available online at http://www.brainmap.org/, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001) , and CA pyramidal cell density gradient in a manner similar to published recommendations by Richards et al.

The linear model employed consisted of all main effects and interactions between the factors genotype (APP vs WT), treatment (pioglitazone vs. non-medicated), and maze training (spatial vs nonspatial).

Per section, the average neuron size was calculated from ten randomly outlined neuronal cell bodies. In order to minimize the drift in the criteria used to manually outline the neurons we conducted the entire analyses in one sitting. The ratio of the area occupied by the Nissl-stained neurons in each area, along with the average cell size for each region, was used to calculate the average number of cells per CA1 subregion using the defined and constant surface area of the box outline.

In the spatial MWM, a progressive decrease in average escape latency following blocks of training trials was observed in pioglitazone-treated, but not in untreated APP mice (Fig. 2B) . This was confirmed by analysis of the learning capacity in pioglitazone-treated APP mice (slope = \u22125.28 \u00b1 0.94), which was improved to WT capacity (Fig. 2C) . Accordingly, a decrease in the average distance swam per training day was observed in pioglitazonetreated, but not in untreated APP mice, reaching significance on day 5 (p b 0.01, Fig. 2D ). Overall, the spatial training findings demonstrate that pioglitazone slightly improves spatial learning in APP mice. In the probe trial, pioglitazone-treated APP mice performed better than untreated APP mice in the number of platform crossings, but this measure failed to reach significance (Fig. 2E) . The percent distance travelled in the target quadrant by pioglitazone-treated APP mice was not significantly different from WT controls (Fig. 2F) . Interestingly, percent distance travelled in quadrant 3 (Fig. 2G ) was significantly greater in treated compared to untreated APP mice (p b 0.01). This was reflective of the swim path used by pioglitazone-treated APP mice, which was largely restricted to quadrant 3 and the target quadrant, a finding that contrasted with the ineffective routes swam by untreated APP mice (Fig. 2G) .

Genotype effect 3.3.1.1. Region of interest (ROI) or brain substructure-based volume analyses. At 6-months of age, the average overall brain volume was 3.2% larger in APP mice (458.0 \u00b1 18.5 mm 3 ) compared to age-matched WT controls (443.1 \u00b1 12.1 mm 3 , p b 0.0001). Volumetric analyses of 64 segmented brain structures revealed that 6 of 64 (9.3%) structures were significantly smaller, while the majority, i.e. 35 of 64 (54.7%) were significantly larger in APP mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 3) . The greatest percent volume decrease (4.3%) in APP mice was in the habenular commissure, whereas the greatest increase (13.3%) was in the amygdala. Significant volume decreases were also observed in the interpeduncular nucleus, superior olivary complex, mammillary bodies, corticospinal tract pyramids, and cerebellar cortex. Interestingly, volumes of hippocampal regions including dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3, as well as cortical structures involved in memory processing such as the entorhinal, temporoparietal, and frontal cortices were larger in APP mice.\n3.3.1.2. Deformation based morphometry (DBM) -local volumetric analyses. Voxel-wise analysis provides a measure of local volumetric expansion (N 0) or contraction (b0) relative to the reference space. A key feature of this approach is that it can detect small focal volume differences that may not be picked up in brain substructure-based approaches. Fig. 4C illustrates the differences found between APP and WT mice, with the red color scale indicating degrees of volume expansion, and the blue scale indicating degrees of volume contraction. Broad areas of volume expansion can be seen, in line with the overall larger brains seen in the APP mice. Focal regions of volume contraction in APP relative to WT were found in corpus callosum and cingulum bundle, hippocampus (in particular, CA1 region adjacent to the midline, and CA3) and cerebellar cortex. It should be noted that while volume decrease in CA1 spanned almost the entire hippocampal septotemporal axis, in CA3 it was limited to the intermediate portion. Volume contraction in the corpus callosum and hippocampal CA1 subfield in APP mice was further validated using voxel plots (Fig. 4F) . In order to understand the cellular basis of the volume differences in the hippocampus, we performed histology on sections of the CA1 subfield.\n3.3.1.3. Histochemical analyses. Qualitatively, Nissl-stained sections revealed irregular spreading of the CA1 pyramidal cells adjacent to the midline into the stratum oriens in 6-month-old APP mice (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, there was a sharp demarcation between the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and stratum oriens in WT mice (Fig. 5A) . Quantitatively, the percent area of the ROI occupied by cell bodies, and the average number of cells, were significantly reduced (p b 0.05) in APP mice (18.2 \u00b1 2.4% and 188.1 \u00b1 22.1, respectively) compared to WT controls (28.8 \u00b1 0.4% and 329.5 \u00b1 33.4, respectively) (Fig. 5B, C) . The average cell size did not differ between APP (198.9 \u00b1 5.0 \u03bcm 2 ) and WT (183.1 \u00b1 15.2 \u03bcm 2 ) mice. As a negative control, we performed similar histochemical analyses on the lateral region of the CA1, which did not exhibit focal volume decrease (Fig. 4C,F) , and found no qualitative (Fig. 5D ) nor quantitative differences (Fig. 5E, F ) between APP and WT mice.\n3.3.1.4. Whole brain cortical thickness analyses. 6-month-old APP and WT mice exhibited differences in regional cortical thickness. In comparison to 6-month-old WT mice, increase in cortical thickness was observed in the frontal association areas, anterior cingulate, retrosplenial, entorhinal, perirhinal, and primary visual cortices of 6-month-old APP mice (Fig. 6A) . The greatest percent cortical thickness increase in APP mice was in the lateral part of the entorhinal cortex (+15.6%; means, Warm colors correspond to regions where APP brains were larger than WT whereas cool colors indicate regions that were smaller. The expansion/contraction map is masked based on statistical significance at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%. Cross-hairs 1 and 2 point to specific areas that are smaller in APP brains compared to WT, namely, the corpus callosum/cingulum bundle and the midline-adjacent CA1 regions, respectively. Cross-hair 3 points to an area of no change, specifically, the lateral CA1 region.

In line with the overall lack of treatment-effect on brain structure volumes, Nissl-staining did not detect any qualitative (Fig. 5A, D ) nor significant quantitative (Fig. 5B, C , E, F) differences in the hippocampal CA1 subfield between pioglitazone-treated APP and WT mice compared to their respective untreated controls. Moreover, consistent with no treatment effect on brain volume and with earlier findings in old APP mice (Nicolakakis et al., 2008) , there was also no difference in the A\u03b2 plaque load in the hippocampus between pioglitazone-treated and untreated APP mice (Fig. 7) .\n3.4.

The increase in volume was lateralized to the left dorsal hippocampus. In comparison, for the same contrast in APP mice, focal volume increase in the CA1/CA2 boundary region was reduced (3.8%) relative to that seen in WT mice (Fig. 4E) . The training effect remained significant in the WT mice, whereas the effects in the APP did not survive multiple comparison correction (Fig. 4F) . Outside the hippocampus, significant focal volume increases were observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum bundle, entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum of WT mice that had undergone the spatial MWM (Fig. 4D) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "4.1. Mutated-hAPP overexpression induces neuroanatomical reshaping 4.1.1. Brain structure volume abnormalities\nWe find that brain volume is abnormal in 6-month-old APP mice, with both atrophy and hypertrophy present at the level of the brain substructures. Brain atrophy, both global and regional, is a hallmark feature of AD. Interestingly, the majority of atrophied structures identified in APP mice, namely the habenular commissure, interpeduncular nucleus, mammillary bodies, and cerebellar cortex are emerging extrahippocampal players in spatial memory processing (Bianco and Wilson, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2013; Rochefort et al., 2013; Vann and Aggleton, 2003) . Volume decreases in the latter two structures has also been reported in AD patients (Andersen et al., 2012; Copenhaver et al., 2006; Wegiel et al., 1999) .\nIn contrast, the observation that the majority of brain-substructures, including the hippocampus, are hypertrophic in APP mice is unexpected, but has precedent. Similar observations of regional brain volume hypertrophy have been reported in pre-symptomatic familial AD mutation carriers (Fortea et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013) and in 6-month-old APP (Swe) /PS1 (M146V) mice on the same C57BL/6J background as our mice (Maheswaran et al., 2009) . Possible mechanisms accounting for regional brain volume increase in mouse models of familial AD include (a) the space-occupying effects of A\u03b2-deposits, and soluble/deposited A\u03b2-induced inflammatory response (e.g. gliosis and edema) in the absence of brain tissue loss (Fox et al., 2005; Maheswaran et al., 2009 ); (b) hAPP overexpression-induced increase in neurogenesis (Jin et al., 2004) , and/or a shift in the distribution of neuronal cell size toward larger neurons (Oh et al., 2009) ; and (c) compensatory neuronal hypertrophy, an early cellular attempt at offsetting neuronal injury induced by A\u03b2 (Driscoll and Troncoso, 2011) . While the latter requires investigation in murine AD models, cortical and hippocampal neuronal hypertrophy has been demonstrated in asymptomatic AD cohorts from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (O'Brien et al., 2009; Riudavets et al., 2007) and the Nun Study .\nThe variability in global and regional brain volume differences reported in APP mouse models, ranging from atrophic (Badea et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2008; Redwine et al., 2003) to hypertrophic could be explained, in part, by variations in transgene(s) combination, promoter used for hAPP expression, the number and location of hAPP mutation(s), and genetic background. These variables impact APP expression, soluble and deposited A\u03b2-levels, and A\u03b2-related neuroinflammation and oxidative stress indices (Crews et al., 2010; Scahill et al., 2013) . These factors, together with age, method and locus of measurement, likely explain the observed variability in mutated-hAPP overexpression-induced neuroanatomical reshaping."}, {"section_title": "Focal brain volume differences", "text": "Voxel-wise DBM analysis demonstrated broad areas of volume expansion and selective areas of contraction in the 6-month-old APP brain, generally consistent with the brain structure-level analysis. However, voxel-level analysis revealed small areas of focal volume decreases bilaterally within the otherwise hypertrophic hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3, with atrophy more spatially extensive within CA1. Our finding in APP mice is consistent with the MRI-detectable sub-regional CA1 volume decreases apparent in early AD (Frisoni et al., 2008; Kerchner et al., 2010) . Previous work from our group using the same analysis procedure to compare ex vivo and in vivo MRI data found good agreement in brain morphology, supporting the interpretation of the observed changes as focal volume changes rather than local effects of fixation (Lerch et al., 2012) . In order to understand the cellular basis of focal volume decrease in the hippocampal subfields of APP mice, we performed histopathology on the locus in CA1 and demonstrated significantly low cell counts and disorganization of pyramidal layer (CA1sp) neurons. Neuron loss in the CA1, in particular the CA1sp, has been documented in AD patients (Davies et al., 1992) . Loss of septal CA1 neurons was recently found in 6-month-old J20 APP mice using ROI-based stereological methods (Wright et al., 2013) . Our study extends this finding by demonstrating that at this age, neuron loss in the CA1, especially that in the CA1sp, is selective to medial CA1 and spans almost the entire hippocampal septotemporal axis. In summary, since both CA1 and CA3 neurons are critically involved in spatial learning/memory in rodents (Florian and Roullet, 2004; Maviel et al., 2004) and humans (Holden et al., 2012; Suthana et al., 2009) , the mutated hAPP-specific localized hippocampal atrophy most likely contributes to impaired spatial MWM performance in our APP mice.\nOutside the hippocampus, we demonstrated bilateral focal volume decreases within the cerebellar cortex, an extrahippocampal substrate for spatial cognition (Rochefort et al., 2013) . Sub-regional volume decreases were also observed in the anterior part of the medial and lateral white matter (WM) tracts, specifically, the cingulum (CG) and underlying corpus callosum (CC). In rodents, CG and CC lesions impair spatial behaviour (Aggleton et al., 1995) , including spatial MWM performance (Warburton et al., 1998) . Volumetric reductions in CG (Villain et al., 2008) and CC (Di Paola et al., 2010 ) also occur in MCI and AD patients."}, {"section_title": "Aberrant cortical thickness", "text": "Using an automated algorithm to measure thickness across the entire cortex, we demonstrate that cortical thickness is aberrant in 6-month-old APP mice. Since APP is a crucial player in processes controlling cortical development (Herms et al., 2004 ) mutated-hAPP overexpression may be a factor in the abnormal cortical phenotype in APP mice. Cortical thickening was present in the entorhinal, perirhinal, retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and frontal association cortices, all key neocortical structures involved in spatial learning/memory (Vann and Albasser, 2011) . While unexpected in the AD literature, cortical thickening has been reported in middle-aged apolipoproteinE\u03b54 individuals, negatively impacting their spatial-cueing (Espeseth et al., 2010) , and pre-symptomatic familial AD presenilin-1 mutation carriers (Fortea et al., 2010) . This group then observed an inverted U-shaped relationship between cortical thickness and CSF-A\u03b242 levels, suggesting that pathological increases in cortical thickness may precede thinning as A\u03b2-plaques accumulate in the brain (Fortea et al., 2011) . Recent in vivo work in J20 APP mice supports the idea of a temporal evolution of cortical thickness abnormalities, with aberrant thickening of the regions involved in spatial memory/learning occurring between 1 and 3 months of age Hebert et al., 2013) . Our current results suggest that these same cortical regions remain abnormally thick at least until 6 months of age, when A\u03b2 deposition and spatial memory deficits have just been established. The greater rate of cortical thinning evident in these mice by 12-months, compared to age-matched WT controls , is reminiscent of the cortical thickness pattern observed in familial AD mutation carriers (Fortea et al., 2010 ) with a transitory thickening preceding thinning associated with disease progression."}, {"section_title": "Mutated-hAPP attenuates learning and memory-induced neuroanatomical plasticity", "text": "We found that in 6-month-old WT mice, successful spatial learning/ retrieval induced robust volume increases within the hippocampus. These increases were localized to a contiguous region beginning rostrally at the CA1/CA2 boundary-region and extending caudally along CA1 and CA2, consistent with the effect of spatial MWM on dorsal hippocampal volume that we observed in 3-month-old WT mice (Lerch et al., 2011a) . The magnitude of this increase was greatly reduced in the CA1/CA2 boundary-region of age-matched APP mice, a finding consistent with their poor spatial MWM performance. Three lines of evidence support our MRI-based neuroanatomical plasticity findings in WT mice. Lesion-based research in rats shows that dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampal lesions impair acquisition on the spatial MWM (Moser et al., 1995) . Enhanced metabolic activity in rostral CA1, extending caudally, has been demonstrated in mice following spatial radial arm maze (Ros et al., 2006) . Electrophysiological studies have shown that the dorsal hippocampus houses a higher proportion of place cells (cells responding to spatial information), and focused place fields compared to its ventral counterpart (Jung et al., 1994) . Our finding of left-lateralization of volume increase in the CA1/CA2 boundaryregion is further supported by studies demonstrating that left, but not right, hippocampus inactivation prior to spatial MWM training weakened rodent probe-trial performance (Klur et al., 2009) , and that virtual-spatial MWM learning in human increased left-anterior hippocampal activity (Cornwell et al., 2008) . Since, these findings suggest that the left hippocampus facilitates spatial memory encoding/consolidation and the right aids memory-retrieval, it appears that attenuated hippocampal plasticity in APP mice perturbs the former process. We show that neuronal activity-evoked CBF response in the somatosensory area of the neocortex was impaired in young APP mice prior to amyloid plaque deposition (Mucke et al., 2000) and measurable mnemonic impairment (DeIpolyi et al., 2008) , and persisted into adulthood. We demonstrate that pioglitazone counters this chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency as early as 3 days into treatment. This study extends our previous findings of beneficial effects of short-term pioglitazonetreatment on stimulus-induced increases in cerebral perfusion and glucose metabolism, and cerebrovascular reactivity in aged APP mice (Nicolakakis et al., 2008) . Together, the results confirm that cerebrovascular insufficiency, in particular reduced baseline Niwa et al., 2002) and stimulus-evoked CBF (Niwa et al., 2000) , is an early pathogenic marker found in various APP mouse models of AD. Our study also indicates that pioglitazone is a potent reverser of cerebrovascular dysfunction at all stages of A\u03b2-induced pathology in APP mice. It thus has the potential to alleviate the chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency observed in AD (Chen et al., 2011; Iadecola, 2004; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Zlokovic et al., 2005) . Supporting our hypothesis is the finding that daily pioglitazone intake for 6 months improves parietal lobe CBF in mild AD patients with T2DM (Sato et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Pioglitazone exerts beneficial effects on spatial learning and memory", "text": "We found that long-term pioglitazone-treatment commencing in young APP mice improved spatial learning capacity to WT levels, and exerted a mild positive effect on memory recall in adult APP mice. The beneficial effect on cognition may be due to the combined ability of pioglitazone to sustainably abrogate cerebrovascular dysfunction starting in young mice and, as previously demonstrated, reduce indexes of neuronal dysfunction such as cerebral oxidative stress, glial activation, and cholinergic denervation (Nicolakakis et al., 2008) . However, it is also possible that the limited benefits of pioglitazone on cognitive function occur independently from the CBF improvements. In the AD literature to date, pioglitazone has been shown to improve regional CBF and cognitive function in mild AD patients with T2DM (Sato et al., 2009) , and has been recommended for testing in earlier disease stages of AD (Geldmacher et al., 2011) . A clinical trial testing the ability of a low dose of pioglitazone to delay the onset of MCI of the AD type is expected to launch this year (Crenshaw et al., 2013) .\nPioglitazone treatment did not improve learning/memory-induced neuroanatomical plasticity and hAPP-induced aberrant neuroanatomical reshaping, supporting the notion that the substrate for cognitive deficits in AD is multifactorial, and treatment-paradigms may need to address multiple root causes to achieve the best outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, overexpression of mutated-hAPP in mice induces aberrant neuroanatomical reshaping, cerebrovascular dysfunction, deficits in spatial learning/memory and associated neuroanatomical plasticity. Early, long-term intervention with pioglitazone rescues brain hemodynamics and exerts positive effects on spatial learning and memory. Since treatment of vascular risk factors and/or vascular co-morbidities has been shown to slow cognitive decline (Deschaintre et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011) , pioglitazone may be of benefit to AD patients with concurrent cerebrovascular deficits. Absence of a corresponding recovery in neuroanatomical plasticity in treated APP mice with normalized functional hyperemia implicates impaired neuroanatomical plasticity as an additional factor contributing to cognitive deficits, possibly defining a new therapeutic target."}]
