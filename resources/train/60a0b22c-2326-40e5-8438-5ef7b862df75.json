[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Cognitive decline in old age is tightly linked with brain atrophy, causing significant burden. It is critical to identify which biomarkers are most predictive of cognitive decline and brain atrophy in the elderly. In 566 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we used a novel unsupervised machine learning approach to evaluate an extensive list of more than 200 potential brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -based predictors of cognitive decline. The method, called CorEx, discovers groups of variables with high multivariate mutual information and then constructs latent factors that explain these correlations. The approach produces a hierarchical structure and the predictive power of biological variables and latent factors are compared with regression. We found that a group of variables containing the well-known AD risk gene APOE and CSF tau and amyloid levels were highly correlated. This latent factor was the most predictive of cognitive decline and brain atrophy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The search for biomarkers to predict cognitive decline and age-related brain atrophy [1] is at the forefront of Alzheimer's disease research. The most commonly used predictors include cognitive assessments, the AD risk gene APOE, and AD-related pathological compounds measured from CSF (amyloid beta 1-42, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau 1-81) [2, 3] .\nIdeally, information collected in routine blood tests could help screen for individuals at higher risk of cognitive decline [4] . These markers are easily and routinely collected, are modifiable, and could form the basis for recommendations targeting cardiovascular, metabolic, hormonal, or other aspects of health. Such a strategy aims to improve overall health in at-risk individuals, but it is also critical to examine the relative predictive power of these various measures, compared to the more traditional biomarkers.\nWe used the recently developed CorEx [5, 6] method to discover hierarchical structure in over 200 biological measures in 566 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The extensive list of potential biomarkers for cognitive decline and brain atrophy included 200 laboratory tests of blood samples for cardiovascular health, oxidative stress, liver function, inflammation and immunology, hormones, growth factors, nutrition, metabolism and diabetes, cancer risk, and amyloid and tau levels. Theoretically, most of these blood test measures could be targeted with existing interventions. We also included the canonical genetic and cerebrospinal fluid measures to determine the best set of predictors for brain atrophy, defined by high dimensional morphometric and surface topology changes, as well as, clinical scores of cognition."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants and Variables", "text": "We analyzed data from ADNI participants for whom at least half of the 206 laboratory test measures were available, resulting in a sample of N=566 older adults (age: 72.8\u00b17.4 years; 215 women, 351 men; education: 15.5\u00b13.1 years; 58 cognitively intact, 397 with mild cognitive impairment, 111 with probable AD). The minimum number of variables for any participant was 158.\nPredictors in the model included 200 laboratory measures, standard demographic information (age, sex, years of education), height, weight, and APOE genotype. APOE genotype was coded as number of alleles of APOE4, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for lateonset AD, increasing lifetime risk around 3-fold for each copy of APOE4 carried [7] . The laboratory measures included blood tests for metabolism, kidney function, immune system function, growth factor levels, tumor biomarkers, inflammation levels, nutrition, oxidative stress, cardiovascular function, blood components (including red and white blood cell counts), hormone levels, liver function, and amyloid and tau pathology. We also included a urine test of kidney function and a cerebrospinal fluid test for amyloid and tau pathology.\nCognitive decline was measured as change in the widely used Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) [8] , one year after baseline. Brain atrophy was measured with a combined score based on one-year change in temporal lobe atrophy and lateral ventricle expansion.\nADNI was launched in 2004 by the National Institute of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations to identify and evaluate biomarkers of AD for use in multisite studies. All ADNI data used in this analysis are publicly available online. The study was conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the US 21 CFR Part 50-Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56-Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants."}, {"section_title": "Scan Acquisition", "text": "We analyzed brain MRIs from 566 ADNI participants. All participants received a high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI brain scan [9] . Scans were acquired on 1.5T General Electric, Siemens, or Philips scanners using a 3D sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (repetition time (2400ms), flip angle (8\u00b0), inversion time (1000ms), 24-cm field of view, 192\u00d7192\u00d7166 acquisition matrix, voxel size 1.25\u00d71.25\u00d71.2 mm 3 , reconstructed to 1 mm isotropic voxels)."}, {"section_title": "Image Analysis", "text": "For both baseline and one-year follow-up, we used one of the most powerful metrics from our lab to evaluate brain atrophy. This method combines two powerful approaches, tensor-based morphometry for the atrophy in the temporal lobe [10, 11] and shape analysis of the expansion of the lateral ventricles [12] , described in further detail below."}, {"section_title": "Tensor Based Morphometry", "text": "We have previously developed methods for Tensor Based Morphometry (TBM) to quantify and localize atrophy by computing brain volume differences at the voxel level within a preprocessed MRI brain scan [10, 11] . After standard MRI preprocessing, each participant's brain scan from the one-year follow-up was registered to the same participant's baseline brain scan [13] . This alignment is performed by a nonlinear inverse consistent elastic intensity-based registration algorithm, which optimizes a joint cost function using mutual information and the elastic energy of the deformation.\nThe Jacobian determinant, a numeric value representing the degree of local expansion or contraction of the 3D elastic warping from one-year follow-up to baseline, is calculated at each voxel in every brain scan. The values in the Jacobian image are expressed as positive and negative percentages, denoting relative tissue volume difference."}, {"section_title": "Lateral Ventricle Segmentation", "text": "The ventricles were segmented with a validated, modified multi-atlas approach [12] . This segmentation approach applies a group-wise surface registration to existing templates in addition to surface-based template blending, which produces highly accurate results. Ventricular surfaces were then extracted from segmentations and an inverseconsistent fluid registration with a mutual information fidelity term aligned a set of hand-labeled ventricular templates to each scan. The template surfaces were registered as a group using medial-spherical registration and the template that best fits the new boundary was selected for each individual, allowing more flexible segmentation, particularly for outliers."}, {"section_title": "Combined Measure of Longitudinal Brain Change", "text": "We calculated a combined TBM score from the longitudinal change in the 3D Jacobian maps and the surface-based expansion rates of the ventricular boundary [14] . Following [12] , we apply a one-class Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model to learn a spatial signature of change to optimize the resulting LDA score for each variable's performance. Initially, the TBM-based score, and the surface expansion score, based on vertex-wise maps of change in radial distance, were computed separately. A combined score was then computed using hierarchical LDA model over the same training set. The combined score outperformed both the TBM-and the Ventricle-only scores as a biomarker for predicting anatomical change. This method also achieves better effect sizes for longitudinal changes in ADNI than virtually all prior methods."}, {"section_title": "Correlation Explanation (CorEx) for HighDimensional Data", "text": "Many supervised learning methods have been used to combine features to improve prediction of biologically relevant outcomes. In this case, we learn latent factors in an unsupervised way (without using the outcomes at all), to capture latent causes of dependence in the data. Remarkably, this approach produces a latent factor, which happens to predict outcomes at a higher significance level than any feature in the data. The X i 's, represented by squares in Figure 1 , denote observed quantities that may take values in an arbitrary domain and could represent different experimental modalities or heterogeneous data types. We assume that an observation, x=(x 1 ,\u2026,x n ), is drawn iid from some unknown joint distribution p X (x), often abbreviated p(x). Groups of variables are indexed with superscripts as in Figure 1 . We measure the relationships among the variables (in this case blood test measures) by a multivariate mutual information measure historically called \"total correlation\" (TC), although in modern terms it would be better described as measure of total dependence. TC is defined as:\nwhere H denotes the Shannon entropy, and D KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nThe total correlation among a group of variables, X, after conditioning on some other variable, Y, can be simply defined in terms of standard conditional entropies as\nThen we can measure the extent to which Y explains the correlations in X by looking at how much the total correlation is reduced by conditioning on Y: Figure 1 ) that are most informative about the data. Directly optimizing this objective is intractable for large m, so we actually optimize a lower bound TCL(X; Y ) with two remarkable properties. First, we are able to optimize this lower bound efficiently (linear in the number of variables). Second, if we construct a hierarchy of representations in which ! explains correlations in X, and ! explains correlations in ! , etc., then to bound the information in X, we just add the contribution from each layer:"}, {"section_title": "TC(X|Y) is zero (and TC(X;Y)", "text": "For a more detailed discussion of bounds and optimization procedure see [5, 6] . More factors were found to be significant predictors for brain atrophy than for cognitive decline. CorEx identified a group of clinical blood test measures with an associated latent factor, which outperformed any individual clinical measure in our dataset for predicting cognitive decline (highlighted in red in Figure 2) . By combining correlated measures in an informative way, CorEx was able to produce a single factor that was a more robust predictor of both brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Note that other structure discovered by CorEx may be biologically meaningful, even though the associated factors were not significant predictors. For example, the group of variables with the largest in-group correlation (node 0 in Figure 2 ) reflects sex-linked traits."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study demonstrates how the latent factors we discovered with CorEx predict atrophy at a higher significance level and reveals relationships among a diverse set of blood test measures. The relationships were evaluated quantitatively, in terms of statistical significance, and qualitatively, in terms of the biological meaning of how measures were clustered. There were more significant predictors for brain atrophy, than for cognitive decline, perhaps because brain atrophy is a more stable measure [15] . These results also agree with existing literature [7] reporting that the commonly carried AD risk gene APOE, particularly the number of high-risk APOE4 alleles carried by an older adult, are associated with poorer longitudinal trajectory of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Three proteins known to be associated with AD-related pathology in the aging human brain [2] were the other variables identified in the top group of predictors. The measures obtainable from routine clinical examinations for health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and hormone imbalance did not perform as well as the canonical measures in the group associated with latent factor #21. Future work will include longitudinal MRI data from ADNI."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work was supported in part by a Consortium grant (U54 EB020403) from the NIH Institutes contributing to the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative, including the NIBIB and NCI and by AFOSR grants FA9550-12-1-0417 and FA9550-10-1-0569."}]
