The goal of this study is to examine the effect of sex on cognitive progression in subjects with high likelihood of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's and followed up to 10 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cerebrospinal fluid total-tau and amyloid-beta (A\u03b242) ratio values were used to sub-classify 559 MCI subjects (216 females, 343 males) as having \"high\" or \"low\" likelihood for MCI due to Alzheimer's. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models incorporating all follow-ups. The worsening from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive score (mean, SD) (9 \u00b1 12) in subjects with high likelihood of MCI due to Alzheimer's was markedly greater than that in subjects with low likelihood (1 \u00b1 6, p < 0.0001). Among MCI due to AD subjects, the mean worsening in cognitive score was significantly greater in females (11.58 \u00b1 14) than in males (6.87 \u00b1 11, p = 0.006). Our findings highlight the need to further investigate these findings in other populations and develop sex specific timelines for Alzheimer's disease progression.\nUnderstanding the role of sex in health and disease is a cornerstone of personalized medicine 1, 2 .

Initial studies of pathological (e.g. beta-amyloid and tau measurements) and neuronal loss (e.g. hippocampal volumetric imaging) biomarkers has also suggested there may be sex differences in the evolution of AD pathophysiology 1, 13, [20] [21] [22] [23] , reviewed in 1   and   6 .

The institutional review board at Duke University Health System and at each site reviewed and approved all ADNI protocols. Prior to data collection, all subjects and their legal representatives, when appropriate, gave written informed consent.\nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.ucla.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a large-scale public-private partnership with a primary goal to investigate whether the integration of clinical assessments, serial imaging studies, and other biological markers can be used to discover early signs of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. ADNI (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00106899) involved over 60 sites across the United States and Canada. ADNI-1 recruited approximately 400 MCI subjects and followed them up to 5 years. These subjects could then choose to continue in ADNI-2 and hence had total follow up of up to 10 years. ADNI-2 recruited approximately 150 new MCI subjects and followed them up to 5 years. Details of protocols and methods can be found in the procedures manual [www.adni-info.org].\nSubjects. Subjects with late MCI enrolled in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 were eligible for inclusion in this study and were pooled for analyses. All late MCI subjects were between the ages of 55 and 90, had subjective memory complaint, objective memory deficit documented by the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global of 0.5, did not meet criteria for dementia and had a Geriatric Depression Scale score of less than 6. The diagnostic criteria for late MCI were identical between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 (http://adni. loni.usc.edu/methods/documents). All subjects met criteria for late MCI. All ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 MCI subjects with at least one post-baseline visit data were eligible for inclusion. In addition to demographic data, for subject inclusion, data for all the following parameters were required: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale 11 item (ADAS-Cog11) for at least two different time points, APOE \u03b54 genotyping results, and biomarker data. The term \"baseline\" is used to indicate data collected first at either screening or baseline. The definition of the subset of subjects with a high likelihood of \"MCI due to AD\" is described under Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) methods. APOE \u03b54 Genotyping. APOE \u03b54 allele genotyping of all subjects was completed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells as detailed previously 28 .\nMRI Hippocampal Volume Measures. Hippocampal volumes for each subject at baseline were extracted from structural MRI brain scans acquired using a standardized protocol and an automated pipeline using FreeSurfer software (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) 25, 29 . For this report, only baseline total (right plus left) hippocampal volumes (mm 3 ) were used 25 .\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Assay. Baseline Next we ran three mixed-effect models to examine the effect of sex on change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11. The first model adjusted for age, education, baseline ADAS-Cog11, and APOE \u03b54 allele status as follows: In this model, the follow-up time (month) was centered with the median follow-up time and covariates were centered i.e. a 75 years old APOE \u03b54-male with 16 years of education and an ADAS-Cog11 score of 11. We included both random slope and random intercept of each subject in this mixed effect model to account for subject-specific variability in each baseline dependent variable and rate of change, respectively, as reported previously 14 . Square root transformations were used for all dependent variables in all models to obtain approximate normality of estimated error distribution and homoscedasticity (constant variance) of the errors across fitted values of each dependent variable. In the models, APOE \u03b54 status was treated as a categorical variable while age, education, cognitive scores were treated as continuous variables. In the equation, APOE \u03b54 ++ indicates carriers of two APOE \u03b54 alleles (homozygous) while APOE \u03b54 + indicates carriers of one APOE \u03b54 allele (heterozygous). We also ran a second mixed effect model replacing APOE \u03b54 with biomarkers (baseline t-tau, A\u03b242 or hippocampal volume) as covariates. Next, we ran a mixed effects model in subjects with high likelihood of MCI due to AD selected two ways. The first was based on high t-tau/A\u03b242 ratio. In this model, APOE \u03b54 status was not included as a term in this last model due to its collinearity with A\u03b242. We also ran a mixed effects model in MCI subjects who are APOE \u03b54 positive. The model terms and covariates are all described in the Tables. Not all analyses had the same sample sizes due to missing values or drop outs. All statistical analyses were conducted in the R (www.r-project.org); mixed-effect models for longitudinal analyses were conducted using the nlme package in the R. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Follow-up duration is calculated based on ADAS-Cog 11 measurement. CSF t-tau/A\u03b242 ratio cut-offs were used to classify subjects as having \"high\" likelihood of meeting criteria for \"MCI due to AD\". See text for details.

In this model, sex had a significant effect on ADAS-Cog11 slope (p = 0.003) with the cognitive decline being greater in females than males. Baseline cognition, education and APOE \u03b54 status also had a significant effect. Subjects with worse baseline cognition and higher education declined faster.

However, when normalized as a ratio to intracranial volume, they were significantly larger than that of males.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Understanding the potential underpinnings of sex-related differences in the risk for dementia is an important research priority for the field [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Our study systematically examined sex differences in longitudinal cognitive outcomes using pooled MCI data from two multicenter studies, ADNI-1 and ADNI-2. To our knowledge, this is also the first report to examine sex differences in outcomes of MCI subjects defined using pathological CSF biomarkers to have a high likelihood for MCI due to Alzheimer's.\nSeveral interesting findings emerged from this study. Our longitudinal cognitive analyses of the pooled dataset found that MCI females showed greater cognitive decline than males. Our study also found that APOE \u03b54 has an effect on both slope and curvature of ADAS-Cog11 decline and with both heterozygotes and homozygotes declining faster than non-carriers. Further among MCI APOE \u03b54 carriers, we found that females declined faster than males. We found no interaction effect between sex and APOE \u03b54 suggesting these variables may potentially have additive but not multiplicative effects. Lastly, we used CSF biomarkers to identify subjects with \"high\" or \"low\" probability of having MCI due to AD. Although not a perfect classifier, the tau/A\u03b242 ratio cut-off we used has been validated in a clinic-pathological study 25 , used in published studies e.g. 30, 31 , and cited in the NIA-AA guideline report on diagnosing MCI due to AD 27 . Approximately 70% of the ADNI MCI sample met these surrogate criteria for \"MCI due to AD -high likelihood\". MCI due to AD subjects showed a markedly greater cognitive decline (almost 9-fold) than MCI subjects not meeting these criteria. This further supports the utility of the CSF ratio as a potential prognostic marker for selecting subjects at high risk for decline in clinical trials. Further, among the \"MCI due to AD -high likelihood\" group, females showed greater cognitive decline than males. This finding extends prior reports of sex differences in MCI 13, 14, 23 and to our knowledge is the first study to examine sex differences in subjects with \"MCI due to AD -high likelihood\".\nThere are some strengths and limitations to our study. A major strength of the ADNI study data is that it represents a multicenter biomarker study that recruited subjects from over 60 sites in the US and Canada and performed longitudinal clinical and biomarker assessments using a highly standardized protocol 24 . ADNI results have, in part, formed the basis for entry criteria in many prevention trials and hence ADNI is a highly relevant dataset. Our analyses tried to mimic the emerging new criteria for MCI due to AD -high likelihood using pathological CSF biomarkers. There is as such no definitive binary marker for neuronal loss and hence we relied on pathological markers. The relatively large sample size and long duration of follow up are other strengths of the analyses. There are also some limitations. ADNI subjects were recruited largely at clinic-based research sites for a biomarker study and as such may not reflect milder subjects seen in general practice, especially in primary care settings. While we relied on a pathologically validated 25 tau/A\u03b242 ratio cut-off as a surrogate to identify biomarker positive MCI subjects, there is as yet no perfect in-vivo method to identify MCI due to AD. While the diagnostic utility of CSF tau/A\u03b242 ratio may differ by setting and laboratory 32 , it still remains useful for identifying a subset of rapid decliners. While baseline sex differences were seen in both studies, longitudinal sex differences were driven primarily by ADNI-1 data and were not significant in ADNI-2. We do not know why, but one possibility may be that ADNI-1 recruited twice as many MCI subjects as ADNI-2 and ADNI-1 subjects could have a 120 month maximum follow up (versus 60-month maximum follow up in ADNI-2). Although entry criteria were the same for late MCI between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias since the two studies were done 5 years apart. Differences in comorbid conditions and concomitant medications between ADNI studies may also have contributed. Since the follow up period was roughly the same between males and females, the observed differences are less likely to be due to attrition or survival biases but we cannot rule them out. We studied sex effects on the ADAS-Cog11 as it is frequently used in clinical trials. However, it is not necessarily perfectly balanced across all cognitive domains and there is some evidence that females may show Table 5 .

To rule out potential testing bias, it is important to also examine sex differences on other cognitive and functional domains. Hence, these issues must be kept in mind while interpreting the data and our findings must be viewed as initial pending replication in population samples. Our study does not directly address mechanisms that may underlie potential sex differences in MCI progression. Theories proposed have included a greater potency of the AD risk associated with the APOE \u03b54 allele and the BDNF Met66 allele in females, differences in sex hormones, smaller head size, lower cognitive reserve, as well as the possibility of differential expression of a variety of genes (reviewed in 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ). The disappearance of sex effects after co-varying for total hippocampal volumes and total tau levels suggest these may be somehow related. However, because AD involves multiple biochemical alterations, systems biology approaches to examine sex differences at a network and pathway level are warranted and may yield deeper insights 28, 33, 34 . In summary, our findings of sex differences in both baseline biomarkers and cognitive progression in biomarker defined MCI subjects highlight the need to further investigate sex specific biomarker evolution and disease progression in AD."}]
