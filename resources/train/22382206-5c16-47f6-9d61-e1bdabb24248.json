Main Outcome Measures: The AD Assessment Scalecognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).\nResults: A total of 177 (44.0%) of 402 MCI patients and 159 (84.6%) of 188 mild-AD patients were treated with ChEIs and 11.4% of MCI patients and 45.7% of AD patients with memantine at entry. Mild-cognitive-impair-ment patients who received ChEIs with or without memantine were more impaired, showed greater decline in scores, and progressed to dementia sooner than patients who did not receive ChEIs. Alzheimer-disease patients who received ChEIs and memantine took them longer, were more functionally impaired, and showed greater decline on the MMSE and CDR (but not on the ADAS-cog or FAQ) than those who received ChEIs only.\nConclusions: Academic physicians frequently prescribe ChEIs and memantine earlier than indicated in the US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling to patients who are relatively more severely impaired or who are rapidly progressing toward cognitive impairment.

The ADAS-cog 15, 16 is a structured scale used to evaluate memory, reasoning, language, orientation, praxis, language, and word-finding difficulty and is scored from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse performance. The CDR 17 is used to rate 5 levels of impairment (0 [not impaired], 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 [severely impaired] in each of 6 categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score is used as a measure of severity and outcome, ranging from 0 to 18. The MMSE 18 is used to evaluate orientation, registration, attention, concentration, recall, language, and visual construction. Scores are the number of correct items, with a range from 0 through 30. The FAQ 19 relies on an interview with a study partner to rate a participant's ability to perform 10 complex activities of daily living (eg, manage finances, shop, prepare a meal, and travel). Each activity is rated on 3 levels (0=does without difficulty, 1=needs frequent advice or assistance, and 2=someone else has taken over the activity); scores range from 0 to 20."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "text": "We tested for associations between diagnostic groups (MCI vs AD) at study entry on clinical characteristics and medication use (including dose and previous duration of use) and between treatment groups within diagnoses using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. (We excluded the few MCI patients who received only memantine and the few AD patients who received no medication or memantine only.)\nWe used linear mixed-effects models to assess the rate of change for each of the 4 clinical outcomes over 24-month follow-up periods between treatment groups. Time was modeled continuously and calculated from participant visit dates. Prior drug exposure was estimated using concurrent medication start and stop dates. Diagnostics for model fit were done by visual inspection of residuals. Imbalances of age, sex, educational level, apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carrier status, and family history were assessed among treatment groups. Covariates were included if they were associated with the outcome (\u2423=.15) and treatment group (\u2423=.10). Estimates were adjusted for age regardless of observed association.\nWe assessed time to progression from MCI to dementia, defined as change in CDR score from 0.5 through 1.0, using Weibull regression, an interval-censored parametric survival model, because the time could only be known to have oc-curred between 6-month visits and not on an exact date. Ratios of mean time to progression derived from the survival analysis were used to compare the risk for progression in the medication-treated groups with that in the nontreated group. Covariates were included using the same criteria as the mixed models.\nWe compared by group the proportions discontinuing their medications during follow-up, the reasons for discontinuation, and serious adverse events (by FDA definition), including deaths. We then assessed the numbers of patients who started these medications after study entry. Data were downloaded from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/) on May 7, 2009.

"}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "Rates of ChEI (84.6%) and memantine treatment (45.7%) for mild-AD patients among the mostly academic ADNI centers are similar to rates found in recent mild to moderate AD clinical trials conducted from 2003 through 2009, wherein mean ChEI treatment increased from 52.9% to nearly 100% and memantine treatment from 13.5% to 63.4%. 20 Rates were comparable to a recent tarenflurbil trial in mild AD, in which ChEI treatment was 75.1% and memantine treatment was 48.1%. 21 However, rates of treatment with those medications were higher than for similar mild-AD patients registered in the NIH National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) during 2009, of whom 152 (58.5%) of 260 received ChEIs and 65 (25.0%) received memantine (Walter Kukull, PhD; oral communication; January 13, 2010).\nCholinesterase inhibitor treatment of 44.0% for MCI patients in ADNI was nearly twice that of MCI patients in the NACC and the California Alzheimer's Disease Centers. 22 Specifically, 23.9% of 351 MCI patients in the NIH centers and 25.1% of 578 MCI patients in the California centers received these medications. Treatment with memantine (at 11.1% and 10.9%, respectively) was similar to that in ADNI (11.4%).\nThe MCI patients who received ChEIs had, on average, a more severe decline in scores than those who did not, and their scores deteriorated more rapidly. They were very similar to AD patients, as evidenced by lower performance scores; APOE \u03b54 carrier rates of 61.0% to 69.5% similar to AD patients enrolled in clinical trials 20 ; and greater rate of worsening of clinical ratings compared with MCI participants from recent trials. 4, 8, 9 Retrospectively, the study physicians probably considered the patients to have technically fulfilled the MCI criteria used in ADNI while also having AD, as further evidenced by their characterizing 95% of the MCI diagnoses as MCI due to AD. Under these circumstances, use of ChEIs could be expected to be consistent with the treatment of early AD.\nAlthough unlikely, other hypotheses merit consideration, including the possibility that treatment with ChEIs in MCI during 1 to 1.5 years is associated with worse outcomes compared with no treatment. Notably, the approximately 1.5-point ADAS-cog and 0.5-to 1.5-point CDR-SB differences between the treatment and notreatment groups during 1 to 2 years have the same magnitude as the effect of ChEIs in placebo-controlled AD trials 23 and as the effect sizes expected for experimental drugs in current clinical trials 20,21 but in the opposite (countertherapeutic) direction. This observation is also consistent with the observation herein that the mild-AD patients who received both ChEIs and memantine and received the ChEI for longer than 2 years prior to entering ADNI had greater dementia severity and a worse disease course compared with those who received ChEIs only and had been treated less than half as long. It should be emphasized, however, that none of the placebocontrolled MCI trials of ChEIs suggest cognitive or behavioral toxicity of the medications during the 2-to 4-year trial periods. [4] [5] [6] Although a relatively longer duration of treatment with ChEIs in MCI prior to entering ADNI was associated with less decline compared with no treatment in 3 of 4 outcomes, the effects, such as 0.12 MMSE point per year, were slight. This finding may represent the combination of a group taking medications who had not shown clinical decline and whose medication regimens are maintained on a long-term basis and another group who had recently started taking medications because their symptoms were more severe or their scores were showing more rapid decline.\nEvidence for the efficacy of memantine in mild AD is lacking despite its widespread use. 13 The 3 placebocontrolled trials for mild to moderate AD included few mild-AD patients (ie, they allowed only patients with MMSE scores \u054522 in 2 trials and \u054524 in 1) and were not statistically significant overall. [10] [11] [12] [13] As with MCI patients, one consideration is that the mild-AD patients who have worsening scores on the assessment measures may have had memantine added to their ChEI regimen with hope of added benefit. In other words, physicians in a predicament may choose to treat early with memantine rather than delay treatment until patients' conditions deteriorate into the severity range for which the medication has been demonstrated effective. 3 Important limitations to making inferences from these analyses include that ADNI is not a treatment study and not a clinical trial and that medication was not assigned randomly or in a double-blind manner to minimize biased outcomes. As with all observational studies, known and unknown potential biases cannot be fully corrected for by multivariable analysis. As we have discussed herein, physicians at these academic centers could have made treatment decisions based on biomarkers including APOE \u03b54 genotype carrier status, clinical severity, neuropsychological test performance, and clinical course.\nThe results raise issues regarding MCI diagnoses and in particular whether the diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer disease, as used by research physicians in ADNI, is actually early or prodromal AD before or early in the dementia syndrome. 24 Moreover, there are substantial implications for health policy and clinical trial planning and interpretations because MCI and mild-AD patients receiving marketed antidementia medications may have different responses to experimental drugs and different, counterintuitive clinical courses compared with those not receiving medications. It does not necessarily follow, however, that because medication-treated patients show worsening on assessments to a greater extent than nontreated patients, they would be more likely to respond to an experimental drug or that a therapeutic effect to such treatment may be detected more readily. Rather, the opposite could be true. Much more investigation needs to be given to the long-term effects of marketed antidementia medications; the imaging and biomarker studies in ADNI may provide additional information.
