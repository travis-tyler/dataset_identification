[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] The shallow and broad central Bering Sea shelf is the region south of St. Lawrence Island and north of Nunivak Island (Figure 1). It experiences cooling, ice formation and brine production in winter [Drucker et al., 2003], solar heating in summer, strong winds in fall, winter and early spring [Brower et al., 1988;Bond et al., 1994], large river discharges in summer [Brabets et al., 2000], and strong tidal currents [Pearson et al., 1981;Mofjeld, 1984;Kowalik, 1999;Danielson and Kowalik, 2005]. Thermohaline characteristics exhibit large inter-annual variability [Takenouti and Ohtani, 1974;Coachman et al., 1975;Danielson et al., 2011], but the causes of these variations are not fully understood. [3] North of St. Lawrence Island, the shelf flow is dominated by a net northward transport through Bering Strait of $0.8 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6 m 3 s \u00c01 ) [Roach et al., 1995;Woodgate et al., 2005a], ascribed to a sea surface height difference of $0.5 m between the North Pacific and Arctic oceans [Stigebrandt, 1984;Overland and Roach, 1987;Aagaard et al., 2006;Woodgate et al., 2005b], and in opposition to the mean wind. Westward intensification associated with the topographic beta effect forces Bering Sea slope waters on-shelf through the Gulf of Anadyr [Kinder et al., 1986;Danielson et al., 2012]. Measurements [Muench et al., 1988;Coachman, 1993] and models [Overland and Roach, 1987;Spaulding et al., 1987;Clement et al., 2005] suggest that 70-80% of the Bering Strait flow first passes through Anadyr Strait, with the rest flowing through Shpanberg Strait. Mooring-and satellite-based estimates of the instantaneous transport through Bering Strait range between about \u00c03 Sv to +4 Sv [Coachman and Aagaard, 1988;Roach et al., 1995;Cherniawsky et al., 2005;Woodgate et al., 2005a]. Numerical model results and observations [Overland and Roach, 1987;Muench et al., 1988;Danielson et al., 2012] indicate that flows in Shpanberg Strait can reverse to southward while the flow in Anadyr Strait is northward. Mean northerly winter winds (blowing toward the south) retard the northward transport in Bering Strait [Overland and Roach, 1987], so that October-March northward transports are typically one-half to two-thirds those of April-August [Roach et al., 1995;Woodgate et al., 2005a]. [4] Over the inner (0-50 m depths) and middle (50-100 m depths) southeastern Bering shelf, tidal currents are large (the two largest tidal constituents, M 2 and K 1 , sum to 25-55 cm s \u00c01 ) [Pearson et al., 1981;Kowalik, 1999;Stabeno et al., 2010], and mean subtidal flows are small (1-5 cm s \u00c01 ) [Schumacher and Kinder, 1983;Stabeno et al., 2010]. The middle shelf contains cold waters below the summer pycnocline [Coachman, 1986]. The southern extent of this \"cold pool\" is primarily determined by the previous winter's ice extent [Stabeno et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2012]. Currents over the outer shelf (between the shelfbreak and 100 m isobath) are 1-10 cm s \u00c01 , with the flow more or less steadily northwestward along the isobaths [Kinder and Schumacher, 1981;Schumacher and Kinder, 1983;Schumacher and Reed, 1992;Stabeno et al., 2001;Stabeno et al., 2002a]. Along the continental slope, the Bering Slope Current is a relatively swift (5-20 cm s \u00c01 ), deep, and strongly eddying cyclonic boundary current with a transport of $6 Sv [Favorite, 1974;Royer and Emery, 1984;Okkonen, 1993;Overland et al., 1994;Roden, 1995;Johnson et al., 2004;Clement Kinney et al., 2009;Stabeno et al., 2009]. Inflow from the Gulf of Alaska through Unimak Pass [Schumacher et al., 1982;Stabeno et al., 2002b] delivers low-salinity waters from the Gulf of Alaska, representing a first-order contribution to the shelf fresh water budget [Weingartner et al., 2005;Aagaard et al., 2006]. [5] Inter-annual temperature variations over the southeastern shelf in spring are related to the previous winter's sea ice extent and timing of retreat [Stabeno et al., 2001;Stabeno et al., 2002b]. Ice extent, in turn, is related to the combination of southward advection of ice caused by northerly wind and low air temperatures [Overland and Pease, 1982;Niebauer et al., 1999]. At the end of summer, heat content over the central and southeastern shelf reflects a combination of the heating season's incoming solar radiation and along-shelf transport anomalies, whereas the fresh water content appears to be set by the previous winter's cross-shelf transport anomaly in conjunction with river discharge, ice melt, precipitation, and evaporation [Danielson et al., 2011]. [6] The central shelf is understudied compared to the southeastern shelf and Bering Strait. The Yukon River (sixthlargest in North America), discharges adjacent to the central shelf, nearly 90% of its annual discharge ($200 km 3 ) occurring between May and October [Brabets et al., 2000]. A mean eastward flow south of St. Lawrence Island (mostly confined to within $70 km of the coast [Danielson et al., 2006]) turns northward in Shpanberg Strait, where it encounters the Yukon plume. This eastward flow can reverse under strong northerly and easterly winds Danielson et al., 2006]. There are relatively few measurements south of this eastward flow and north of St. Matthew and Nunivak islands, but the available data suggest highly variable flows with a net northward drift [Kinder and Schumacher, 1981;Aagaard and Schumacher, 1985;Muench et al., 1988;Danielson et al., 2006]. [7] Winter ice formation and southward ice drift depend on favorable winds [Muench and Ahlnas, 1976;Pease, 1980;McNutt, 1981]. Northerly winds promote southward transport of dilute waters [Zhang et al., 2010] produced by melting along the southern edge of the ice pack [Pease, 1981]. These winds also promote ice formation and dense water formation over the northern shelf. Brine generated by ice formation in polynyas results in density gradients capable of driving a baroclinic pressure gradient large enough to be important to the momentum balance . [8] Density gradients along the Alaskan coast during summer impel a northward buoyancy-driven coastal jet [Danielson et al., 2011]. The front, which traps river discharge close to the coast through the summer months, likely breaks down in fall with the onset of strong wind-forcing. Danielson et al. [2006] observed that near-surface (1 m and 10 m drogue depths) satellite-tracked drifters exhibited westward motion in the fall and suggested that this motion occurs annually. [9] Our primary goal here is to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the central shelf flow and its relation to the varying wind and thermohaline fields. Our results bear on numerous eco-and climate system issues, including aspects of salmon migratory behavior [Mundy and Evenson, 2011], advection of passively drifting larvae [Wespestad et al., 2000;Wilderbuer et al., 2002;Orensanz et al., 2004], nutrient replenishment and net production over the Bering shelf [Sambrotto et al., 1986;Whitledge et al., 1986;Mathis et al., 2010], and heat, nutrient, and fresh water fluxes northward into the Arctic Ocean [Aagaard and Carmack, 1989;Woodgate et al., 2010]. [10] We begin with a descriptive overview of the oceanic and atmospheric conditions during the field program, and a kinematic summary of the flow field. We then investigate the circulation dynamics by examining the vertically integrated equations of motion, along with geostrophic velocity computations. Finally, we use model-based sea surface height (SSH) hindcasts and analyses of the vertical and horizontal structure of the flow field to investigate the effects of variable wind-forcing, with particular emphasis on the wind direction. These results are a companion to and provide detailed context for the bi-modal Bering shelf circulation scheme recently proposed by Danielson et al. [2012]. [11] The results described here are part of the National Science Foundation's Bering Ecosystem STudy (NSF-BEST) program, the North Pacific Research Board's Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (NPRB-BSIERP) (Program summary 2010, http://doc.nprb.org/web/BSIERP/ zzWebsite/proj_mgmt/01.10_bsag_web.pdf) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Bering-Aleutian Salmon International Survey (NOAA-BASIS) program. Collectively, these programs supported an intensive set of collaborative field surveys, modeling efforts and analyses between 2007 and 2011. Our primary data set here is from eight moorings on the central Bering shelf, deployed during July 2008-July 2010 as part of the NSF-BEST program. [12] Data sets, data calibration and quality control, and numerical model fields are described in section 2. Section 3 presents results in three major subsections: an overview of the current meter, temperature, salinity and wind records (sections 3.1-3.3); the vertically integrated momentum balance and an evaluation of baroclinic contributions (section 3.4); and an analysis of co-variability of the current, wind and sea surface height (SSH) fields (section 3.5). A discussion of the results and a summary are given in sections 4 and 5, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mooring Configurations", "text": "[13] From July 2008 to July 2010, eight subsurface moorings were deployed on the 55 m, 40 m and 25 m isobaths ( Figure 1 and Table 1) for one year at a time. Moorings on the 40 m and 55 m isobaths were each equipped with an upwardlooking Teledyne RDI acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted just above the acoustic release. A Seabird (SBE) temperature/conductivity (T/C) data logger was colocated with the acoustic release; a second SBE T/C data logger was at $20 m depth. Some of the T/C loggers also recorded pressure (P). Moorings on the 55 m isobath each had a T/C/P data logger at 10 m, connected to the rest of the mooring via a weak link, and an inductive modem transmitted the data to a remote data logger mounted near the 20 m T/C recorder. This configuration permitted measurements close to the surface while providing some protection to the data and the mooring in the event that ice keels or extreme waves destroyed or removed the uppermost float. The configuration worked well. Although we lost four of the six 10 m instruments, we obtained data through the breakdown of fall stratification in both years. Also mounted on the 55 m moorings was a string of thermistors spaced 2-4 m apart between the 20 m and near-bottom T/C recorders. [14] Moorings on the 25 m isobath employed Oceanscience Group SeaSpider tripod frames. Each was equipped with a gimbaled upward-looking ADCP and T/C/P recorder with pumped intake about 1 m above the seafloor. On the 2009 recovery attempt, one 25 m tripod deployed just south of Nunivak Island was located acoustically, but never recovered. Based on visual inspection by divers we believe that the entire tripod was buried by sediment. As a consequence we did not re-deploy at this site in the second field year. The 2008-2009 N25 tripod popup buoy canister was also fouled by bottom sediment and unrecoverable from the surface, but we were able to recover it with the aid of divers in the summer of 2010. [15] In the mooring names, the first letter indicates relative latitudinal positioning within our mooring array (N = north, C = central, S = south) and the subsequent numbers (55,40,25) indicate approximate water depth."}, {"section_title": "Moored Velocity Data", "text": "[16] With the exception of C55 (whose batteries died prematurely in late May 2009 and late February 2010), nearly two complete years of current measurements were recorded at all mooring sites. Velocity data were recorded with 307 KHz Teledyne RDI ADCPs using 30-min ensembles and 1 m bins at 175 pings per ensemble. This protocol yields an expected standard deviation of 1 cm/s for each ensemble. Data within 6% of the distance from the surface to the transducer are affected by sidelobe contamination and discarded. Data were screened with the following thresholds: correlation limit of 64 counts, error amplitude limit of 80 mm/s, and minimum of 40 percent-good pings within any ensemble. Both 3-beam and 4-beam solutions that achieved these criteria were retained. Velocity vector directions were corrected for magnetic declination based on the declination computed halfway through each deployment at each mooring site (corrections ranged from 8.9 to 11.3 ). [17] Velocity data were de-tided using the MATLAB T_Tide [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] harmonic analysis algorithm following Foreman [1978] or through low-pass filtering. Filters to isolate sub-tidal (>35 h) and long period (>100 h) currents were implemented with a 6th order bi-directional Butterworth filter. Subtracting both the harmonic tide prediction and the 35-h low-pass signal from the original time series allows us to isolate non-tidal high frequency fluctuations (e.g., inertial motions). [18] Error estimates for the velocity components are based on estimates of the integral time scale, following Allen and Kundu [1978], Schumacher and Kinder [1983], and Emory and Thompson [2001]. Such computations are noisy in practice but analyses of the 35 h low-pass filtered velocity records at all mooring sites suggest a decorrelation time scale less than 48 h (87% of the estimates gave a time scale shorter than this). As a conservative estimate, therefore, we use 48 h to define the effective degrees of freedom."}, {"section_title": "Moored Pressure, Temperature and Salinity Data", "text": "[19] Each mooring hosted an assortment of T, T/C and T/C/P data loggers (Table 1). Seabird SBE-16 and SBE-37 instruments were calibrated at the manufacturer's facility prior to deployment and after recovery. Exceptions were the 2009-2010 N55 20 m depth instrument, which failed beyond repair, and some of the 10 m SBE-37 instruments, which were lost during the course of the winter. The magnitude of the temperature drift of the SBEs was less than 0.001 C over the course of one year. Conductivity cell drift resulted in salinity changes from \u00c00.003 to \u00c00.064 (measured at 3.0 S/m) with the exception of the 20 m instrument on C40, which drifted by \u00c00.154. Inspection of the salinity time series suggests that the calibrations did not capture some drift or transient offsets. For example, by late spring of the first year, the near-bottom data logger on two of the moorings showed water less dense than at 20 m. This likely resulted from biofouling or silting of the near-bottom conductivity cell over the course of the winter, sediment that was not retained in the cell prior to the factory post-season calibration. In any case, we were unable to correct these measurements for such fouling and present herein only the salinity measurements from near 20 m depth.

Mooring names beginning with N, C or S, signify the northern, central and southern array lines, respectively. The numbers 55, 40 or 25 denote the nominal water column depth at each deployment site. ADCP records for N40 in 2010 and C55 and S55 in both years ended early due to premature battery failure (see Figure 4 for actual duration of ADCP data coverage). b Mooring N25 was not recovered in 2009 due to a fouled recovery line canister, but divers recovered it in 2010. [20] Onset HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 temperature loggers were mounted on the 55 m moorings in order to increase vertical resolution (Table 1) of temperature measurements. The HOBO loggers are accurate to within 0.2 C, with a resolution of 0.02 C. Mean temperature differences in February between the upper (20 m and 10 m SBE-37 s) and lower ($45 m) Seabird instruments on the 55 m moorings is less than 0.01 C. Therefore, the water column is nearly thermally homogeneous in February and we are able to compute offsets for each HOBO logger based on the average of the temperatures measured by the Seabird temperature probes. HOBO logger offset corrections range between \u00c00.11 C and +0.06 C. We have no means to assess HOBO thermistor temperature-dependent bias or drift over the course of the deployment."}, {"section_title": "Shipboard Temperature and Salinity Data", "text": "[21] The BEST, BSIERP and BASIS programs sponsored 21 oceanographic cruises that sampled in the study region between March and mid-October over the five-year interval 2006-2010. Data from 14 of these cruises falls within two seasonal intervals relevant to our analysis: March to early June and August to October. Moored observations made between 1995 and 2011 (an interval with near-continual in situ monitoring by moored sensors at NOAA station M2 in the southeast Bering Sea) show that the 2007-2010 cruises took place following relatively cold winters, while the 2005-2006 winter was close to average [Stabeno et al., 2012]. Profiles collected by SBE-911 CTD instruments on these cruises are used to provide an overview of the seasonal changes in salinity stratification and to estimate geopotential height anomalies and geostrophic velocities associated with the in situ density structure. Processing techniques varied slightly among responsible institutions, but in each case we employ the final 1 db bin-averaged data set. We estimate that temperatures are generally accurate to within 0.01 C and salinity to within 0.02."}, {"section_title": "Gridded Sea Surface Temperatures and Ice Concentrations", "text": "[22] To supplement the moored temperature time series, we employ the Reynolds Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) product, version OI.v2 [Reynolds and Smith, 1994;Reynolds et al., 2002], which is generated daily on a 1/4 grid and incorporates in situ (ship, buoy and drifter) observations along with satellite observations and simulated SST estimates in regions with sea ice [Reynolds et al., 2002]. Satellite-based estimates of sea ice concentration are also included in the OI.v2 data set. Comparing the OI.v2 surface temperatures to temperatures measured at 10 m depth on our six 55 m moorings, we find the OI.v2 data are warmer by 0.54-0.94 C, but significantly (r > 0.95, p < 0.01) cross-correlated with temperatures at 10 m. [23] By combining the daily OISST temperatures with our in situ moored measurements, we achieve a full water column depiction of thermal stratification at the 55 m isobath moorings. Given the loss of some 10-m instruments and the problems associated with satellite detection of SSTs near the ice edge, we do not resolve the upper water column thermal stratification well in May and June, however. Stratification due to salinity is not well resolved by our mooring measurements, but examination of our CTD casts shows that the thermocline usually coincides with the halocline except in late spring and early summer, when there is salinity stratification from ice melt."}, {"section_title": "Reanalysis Winds", "text": "[24] Winds are from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) model hindcasts [Mesinger et al., 2006]. The 1979present NARR model output includes surface pressure, wind, temperature and ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes every three hours on a 32 km grid, and thus provides higher resolution than the 2.5 , six-hourly output of the global NCEP Reanalysis [Kalnay et al., 1996] used in many studies of the Bering shelf [e.g., Ladd and Bond, 2002;Mull, 2008;Stabeno et al., 2010;Danielson et al., 2011]. We chose the NARR product because we are interested in resolving spatial differences in the wind field across the mooring array, and because other regional studies have found that the NARR provides good representations over the North Pacific and western Arctic [Pickart et al., 2009]."}, {"section_title": "Model-Generated Sea Surface Heights", "text": "[25] Since we are unable to uniformly reference the moored pressure data to a common SSH, we use a model to estimate the daily mean SSH field. That field is then in turn used to investigate the regional ocean response to variable wind-forcing. Zhang et al. [2010] describe the Bering Ecosystem STudy ice-ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (BESTMAS) model, and we here update the integration through our mooring deployment period. The BESTMAS model was constructed to investigate the sea ice-ocean system of the Bering shelf. It is based on the coupled parallel ocean and sea ice model (POIM) of Zhang and Rothrock [2003], which consists of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) ocean model [Smith et al., 1992] and the thickness and enthalpy distribution sea ice model [Hibler, 1980;Zhang and Rothrock, 2001]. The model domain covers the northern hemisphere north of 39 N with 30 vertical levels and a horizontal grid spacing that varies from $50 km in the North Atlantic to less than 4 km in the northern Bering Sea. The BESTMAS model employs the ETOPO5 bathymetric digital elevation model, and errors in ETOPO5 may contribute to errors in the calculated SSH field, since, for example, just a 5 m error represents a 20% water depth error at our shallow mooring sites."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Shelf Conditions, July 2008 to July 2010", "text": "[26] We begin with a description of temperature, salinity, current, and wind records for the central shelf over the course of the July 2008-July 2010 mooring deployments. Examination of monthly mean conditions reveals three intervals for which seasonal averages are appropriate: [27] a) January to March (strong winds, extensive ice cover, ice formation and brine expulsion, increasing salinity, little or no thermal stratification, and low river discharge); [28] b) May to September (light or moderate winds, receding or absent ice cover, and increasing or strong stratification, river discharge, and shelf fresh water and heat contents); and [29] c) October to December (very strong winds and decreasing or low levels of stratification, river discharge, heat content and salinity)."}, {"section_title": "Temperature and Salinity", "text": "[30] Temperatures across the array closely follow the annual solar cycle, with surface heat fluxes largely controlling the annual cycle of water temperature changes [Reed and Stabeno, 2002;Danielson et al., 2011]. Ocean temperatures are re-set each winter to the freezing point ($\u00c01.8 C) and achieve their maximum values, e.g., $10 C near 20 m depth, in late summer or early fall. Along the 55 m isobath, late-summer water temperatures show a strongly stratified two-layer system ( Figure 2), with a thermocline consistently near 20 m depth through August and September 2008, but a progressively deepening one from June into October 2009. In the fall of both 2008 and 2009, strong wind mixing and surface heat loss homogenized the water column, first at S55 and C55 (in October) and then at N55 (in November). Following fall homogenization, cooling continues, such that by the end of December (N55) and January (C55 and S55) the entire water column is at the freezing point. In half of the six observed cases, an ice cover is present before temperatures at 10 m depth attain \u00c01.5 C, indicating that at these locations the presence of ice is often due to advection from the north [Pease, 1980]. Temperatures largely remain at the freezing point through April. In four of the six deployments along the 55 m isobath, temperatures at 20 m rose above \u00c01 C prior to ice retreat, suggesting that ocean heat plays a role in the spring decay of the ice pack, either by advection or by absorbing solar radiation [Jackson et al., 2010]. [31] In contrast to temperature, the salinity time series depict greater spatial heterogeneity and considerable variability on weekly to monthly timescales ( Figure 3). Sites N25 and C25 are closest to the coast and least saline over most of the year, with annual salinity minima occurring in fall. The Figure 2. Contoured time series of temperature at moorings (top) N55, (middle) C55, and (bottom) S55 from July 2008 to July 2010. The contours show the annual cycle, the depth of stratification, and the timing of stratification setup and breakdown along the 55 m isobath. Thin horizontal black lines denote the depth of temperature measurements; note that the $10 m depth instruments on N55 and C55 were lost partway through each deployment. Grey bars at the top denote the presence of ice with concentrations >30%. Ice concentrations and surface temperatures are from the daily gridded OISST data set at the grid point closest to each mooring. Thick vertical black lines depict monthly mean observed salinity profiles taken by shipboard CTD casts within 50 km of each mooring site. The CTD salinity profiles are plotted so that their bottom-most measurement is located on the 15th day of month within which they were taken; horizontal spacing of one month is equivalent to DS = 1. seasonal decline of salinity from late summer to a late fall/ early winter annual minimum generally progresses from the shallowest (25 m) to the deepest (55 m) mooring sites. This is consistent with a westward movement of low-salinity coastal waters mixing with ambient shelf waters offshore [Danielson et al., 2011]. Curiously, waters at mooring C55 remain fresher than waters at either N55 or S55 over extended intervals, e.g., July 2008-April 2009 and January 2010-April 2010, suggesting that the low-salinity signal at C55 is not due to along-isobath advection from the south or the north. Sites N40 and N55, closest to the St. Lawrence Island polynya, were the most saline (S MAX > 32.5) during winter 2009, while in winter 2010 the most saline waters were at N40 and N25 (S MAX > 33). For parts of each winter (but especially in 2010) the salinity decreased across the shelf from C25 to C40 and again to C55. This pattern suggests that as the fresher inshore waters were advected away from the coast, they were replaced by higher-salinity waters and/or the shallow coastal waters experienced a greater degree of salinization due to freezing, which is enhanced over shallow depths and in coastal polynyas. [32] In both winters, higher salinities occurred at N55, N40, N25 and C25 than at C55, C40, S55 or S40. At these temperatures salinity differences control the horizontal density gradients and the salinity distribution at winter's end implies a mid-shelf salinity minimum. Such a feature would promote an anti-cyclonic geostrophic velocity field with southward flow along its eastern boundary."}, {"section_title": "Currents and Winds", "text": "[33] Figures 4 and 5 show vertically averaged, sub-tidal (35-h low-pass filtered) time series of the velocity components projected onto their major and minor principal axes of variation at each mooring site. Positive (nominally northward) peaks in flow speeds have greater magnitude than negative (southward) excursions. Few of the time series exhibit seasonal mean velocity components that are statistically different from zero (Table 2), although all sites experience significant mean flow over averaging intervals spanning several weeks to a month or more. For example, this was seen in the mean southward flow from March to May at C40 and S40 in 2010, and the mean northward flow at all moorings in February 2009. For October-April, typical and maximum 35 h lowpass filtered half-hourly current speeds are 6-12 cm s \u00c01 and 30-70 cm s \u00c01 across the mooring array, respectively. Over the May-September period, these variables range from 3 to 6 cm s \u00c01 and 10-30 cm s \u00c01 (Table 2). [34] The velocity time series show that synoptic-scale variability in the flow field is strongly seasonally modulated, with fewer peaks exceeding 25 cm s \u00c01 occurring between May and September than in the rest of the year. This is also demonstrated by the fraction of the total kinetic energy accounted for by tides, viz., 61-93% between October and April and 80-97% between May and September ( Table 2). The four dominant tidal constituents (M 2 , N 2 , K 1 , and O 1 ) semi-major ellipse axes amplitudes sum to 30-80 cm s \u00c01 at 10 m depth (Table 3), greater than the filtered velocities described above. [35] Seasonal changes in the flow field are captured by mean monthly principal axis ellipse decompositions ( Figure 6). At most mooring sites, the fall, winter and early spring ellipses are larger, more elongated and more nearly parallel to the local isobaths than the ellipses of late spring through late summer. At N55, the ellipse amplitudes are less variable over the course of the year, but the ellipse orientation is more variable. [36] Analysis of the vertical structure of the sub-tidal horizontal currents reveals that for the 55 m moorings, the mean 5-40 m current shear increases from 0.15 s \u00c01 during May- Figure 3. Daily mean salinity time series. The annual salinity minimum in fall progresses from nearshore sites (C25 and N25) to the other sites in deeper waters. All instruments were located between 17 and 25 m depth. The distance between each 31 line is DS = 2 on the vertical axis; vertical tick marks are spaced every DS = 1. Every other record is plotted with thick (thin) lines for clarity. Figure 4. Time series of 35 h low-pass filtered and vertically averaged velocities along the major axis at each mooring site. Note the strongly seasonal change in variance. The axis orientation is computed from each low-pass filtered two-year time series composite and is noted next to each mooring site label. The distance between each zero line is 80 cm s \u00c01 on the vertical axis. Figure 5.

The axis orientation is computed from each low-pass filtered two-year time series composite and is noted next to each mooring site label. The distance between each zero line is equivalent to 80 cm s \u00c01 on the vertical axis. December to 0.21 s \u00c01 during January-April, with these means significantly different at the 95% confidence level. In contrast, at the 25 m moorings the 5-20 m shear was largest in fall (0.44 s \u00c01 ), smallest from May-September (0.29 s \u00c01 ) and intermediate in January-April (0.37 s \u00c01 ), with these means significantly different from one another. [37] Winds, strongest in fall months (Figure 7), reflect the evolution, location and strength of storms associated with the Aleutian Low [Wilson and Overland, 1986;Pickart et al., 2009]. The 3-hourly wind record from the NARR grid point closest to site C55 contains 20 wind speed peaks with magnitude \u226515 m s \u00c01 . Of these, 17 occurred in October, November or December 2008 and 2009; the remaining three were in July and August 2009. Winds do not strongly favor one orientation: only 57% of the variance is directed along the principal axis. Rotary coherence calculations at all grid points across the shelf with respect to the grid point closest to 60 N, 170 W reveals that coherence-squared values of 0.8 occur within a radius of $200 km for long (\u226532 h) periods, but only within $100 km for shorter periods (Figure 8). Thus, over short time scales the wind field is not uniform across the mooring array, which spans 3 degrees of latitude and 4 degrees of longitude. [38] Figure 9 summarizes averages of the current meter and wind records for the periods January-April, May-September and October-December. On average, winds are northerly during each period, and strongest in fall and weakest in summer. Vertically averaged currents are generally northward along the 55 m isobath. In contrast, the flow along the 25 m isobaths is southward. Here the mean vectors, along with those at N40 and C40 suggest a clockwise circulation over the inner half of the central shelf. The currents at S40 are weakly southeastward in winter and summer, but become northwestward and strengthen in fall. Mooring C40 vectors are remarkably different from those at the 55 m moorings, but are consistent with the flow field depicted by the N40, N25 and C25 moorings. [39] In summary, weekly and shorter variations in the flow field are large with respect to seasonal and annual means, but temperature and salinity fields are dominated by variability on monthly to annual time scales. Seasonal averages of the wind and current fields show that near-surface (<10 m) waters flow predominantly westward. Vertically averaged inner shelf currents are southward or westward during the fall, winter and early spring. Consistent with this flow, low salinities are first observed at the nearshore (shallow) sites in the fall and early winter, and only later in winter at the offshore moorings. However, in winter the moorings nearest to St. Lawrence Island and the Alaskan coast are more saline than at the other moorings. [40] The flow field is not horizontally uniform and the measurements do not suggest that the surface Ekman drift is locally compensated by a subsurface flow. Consideration both of along-shelf variations in the flow field and of the dynamics of surface and bottom boundary layers are therefore necessary to construct an adequate picture of the circulation field."}, {"section_title": "The Momentum Balance", "text": "[41] We next examine the vertically integrated equations of motion in order to identify the relative importance of the N is the number of half-hour samples obtained over the course of the deployments. Net speed and direction computed for 35-h LPF data. Percent tidal kinetic energy is determined from yearly harmonic tidal analyses at frequencies resolved with signal-to-noise greater than or equal to 10. The highfrequency band contains frequencies remaining after passing through a 35-h high-pass filter, less the resolved harmonic analysis tidal portion. Midfrequencies are band-pass filtered over the 35-100 h range; low frequencies are low-pass filtered at 100 h. Net speeds greater than zero at the 95% confidence level are given in bold type, based on a decorrelation time scale of 48 h. various sources and sinks of momentum. Following Brink [1998], we vertically integrate the linearized horizontal momentum balance (1), prescribing the along-shelf direction with (y, V), positive along the northward-directed principal axis of variation (Figure 4), and the cross-shelf direction oriented 90 to the right with (x, U). [42] The upper line of (1) is the cross-shelf momentum balance; the lower line is the along-shelf momentum balance. From left to right in (1), the five terms represent local and Coriolis accelerations, horizontal pressure gradients, and surface and bottom stresses. The parameters include the Coriolis frequency ( f ) and water depth (h) appropriate for each site and the water density (r w = 1025.3 kg m \u00c03 ). The surface and bottom stress terms are where the neutral drag coefficient C d is computed following Large and Pond [1981] and is doubled [McPhee, 1980] for intervals when the mooring site is covered with ice (concentration > = 30%). The linear bottom friction coefficient r is set to 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 m s \u00c01 after Lentz and Winant [1986]; air density (r a ) is 1.22 kg m \u00c03 ; and the wind velocity vector W = W u + iW v uses 3-hourly NARR wind velocities from the grid cell closest to each mooring site. The momentum balance is computed with the raw (unfiltered) time series of velocity and wind speeds. Each term is subsequently low-pass filtered (35 h cutoff) in order to focus only on the coherent portion of the flow field (as justified below in section 3.5). Nonlinear advective terms are neglected, because the Rossby number R o = U/fL \u226a 1 for characteristic subtidal speed and length scales of 10 cm s \u00c01 and 100 km, respectively. The horizontal pressure gradient cannot be estimated directly from our data and is therefore determined as the residual in the momentum balance. The approach used here depends on the surface and bottom drag coefficients. Sensitivity analyses show that a factor of two change in the surface and/or bottom stress drag coefficients alters the magnitude of any seasonal mean pressure gradients by $5-10% over the 40 m and 55 m isobaths and by $10-30% for sites along the 25 m isobath. Maximum changes for these two depth groupings are 20% and 40%, respectively. The largest changes are associated with the along-shelf momentum balances. The first three columns list the tidal constituent name, the mooring name, and the number (N) of 29-day segments that comprise each summary statistic. The last eight columns contain the mean and standard deviations (s) of the semi-major axis (MAJ), the semi-minor axis (min), the inclination (I) and the Greenwich phase (G). Negative values of the semi-minor axis denote clockwise rotation; positive values denote counter-clockwise rotation. [43] An example of all terms in (1) evaluated at one site (C25), which is representative of the other sites, is shown in Figure 10. The balance is primarily geostrophic in both the along-shelf and cross-shelf directions, because only the pressure gradient residual is large enough to balance the Coriolis term. Short intervals during which the other terms are important, or even dominant, include energetic wind events and transitions between positive and negative along-shelf flow, when our assumption of linearity is unlikely to hold. To quantify the relative importance of the terms in (1), we compute the seasonal mean root-mean square (RMS) magnitude of each term and scale these as a fraction of the combined total at each site (Figure 11). For along-shelf currents, the Coriolis term is nearly balanced by the cross-shelf pressure gradient during all seasons, although surface stress can account for up to 20% of the balance. Stronger winds in fall generate surface stresses slightly larger than those of winter, despite enhanced frictional coupling by winter ice. Bottom stress and local accelerations together represent <10% of the cross-shelf momentum budget. The contribution from bottom stress terms is proportionally larger (as expected) at the shallow sites, due to h in the denominator of (2). The pressure gradient and Coriolis terms also dominate the along-shelf momentum balance, however the local acceleration, wind stress and bottom friction terms can account for 15-40%, depending on location and season. The momentum balance averaged across all mooring sites varies little among seasons despite seasonal changes in the RMS value of the individual terms (Table 4). This suggests the importance of the wind in setting up the SSH gradients, regardless of season. [44] In addition to the barotropic response of the shelf to SSH gradients, horizontal variations in the thermohaline fields may play a role in forcing the circulation field. We use late winter/spring and late summer/early fall CTD survey data collected between 2006 and 2010 to examine the mean seasonal changes of the dynamic topography, noting that the shallow water depths preclude referencing the computations to a realistic level of no motion. We measure in situ shear with the current meters, but direct comparison to the baroclinic shear is difficult due to overlap between the surface Ekman layer, the bottom Ekman layer and the geostrophic shear. [45] Between spring and the end of summer, nearshore (shallow) waters warm and freshen proportionally more than mid-shelf waters. In addition, the cold, saline sub-pycnocline waters on the middle shelf (including the cold pool) are dense and will therefore tend to stagnate on weakly sloping continental shelves [Hill, 1996]. By late summer, the juxtaposition of low-density nearshore waters and the denser cold-pool waters over the mid-shelf promotes a northward baroclinic flow along the eastern side of the cold pool. This hydrographic structure is evident in previous cross-shelf transects as well [Coachman, 1986;Kachel et al., 2002;Danielson et al., 2011]. We therefore average the late summer-early fall BASIS hydrography from 2006 to 2009 to generate the 0-30 db dynamic topography and associated geostrophic Figure 6. Mean monthly decomposition of the flow field into ellipses denoting the along-and cross-principal axis of variation for currents at 20 m depth. Each set of axes begins with January on the left and ends with December on the right as labeled for C55. Most sites exhibit an annual modulation in magnitude and show relatively little variation of direction among months; N55 is a notable exception. Due to battery failures both years at C55, axes are missing in June for this mooring. Triangles denote the associated mooring location for each set of axes. Strait, where the current veers northward upon encountering the fresher and warmer waters near the Alaska coast. [46] In March, April and May, mid-and inner shelf waters are nearly isothermal so that the late winter dynamic topography is determined primarily by salinity. Upon combining Figure 8.

Short period fluctuations have much smaller decorrelation length scales than those of longer period. The reference site is marked by x and the mooring sites by dots.

Pie charts depicting the relative contribution of the momentum balance terms to each site's total based on 35-h low-pass filtered RMS magnitudes. The top three rows depict the cross-shelf momentum balance and the lower three rows the along-shelf momentum balance (equation 1). The left three columns show January-April, the middle May-September, and the right October-December. Colors represent the Coriolis (light blue), local acceleration (dark blue), bottom stress (red), surface stress (orange) and horizontal pressure gradient (green) terms, respectively. Numbers denote the magnitude of the horizontal pressure gradient term multiplied by10 5 m 2 s \u00c02 . Reduced magnitudes at all sites are evident in May-September but the relative importance of each term changes only slightly. The cross-shelf momentum balance shows little dependence on bottom friction or local accelerations. CTD profiles from the March to mid-June cruises of 2006-2010, we find a geopotential height minimum south of St. Lawrence Island and along the Alaskan mainland coast and a maximum farther offshore (Figure 12, left). This reverses the late summer cross-shelf baroclinic pressure gradient so that by the end of winter inner and mid-shelf waters have a southward geostrophic tendency. Similar plots from individual year CTD data are generally consistent with this 5-year climatology. We note that a late winter salinity minimum over the middle southeastern shelf was also observed in an April 1979 cross-isobath transect [Coachman, 1986]. [47] The baroclinic currents computed from these five years of shipboard data indicate that the surface (relative to 30 db) geostrophic vectors are of the same magnitude as the observed vertically averaged seasonal mean flow (Figure 9), so that the baroclinic field appears dynamically important. Whereas the northward baroclinic velocity vectors in summer oppose the mean southward (but weak) winds, the southward baroclinic vectors in winter are aligned with the prevailing winds. The late winter-spring and late summer-fall means in Figure 12 probably represent the strongest baroclinic pressure gradients, because they include the cumulative effects of cooling and salinization through winter and warming and freshening through summer. Very likely the baroclinic velocity field is therefore smaller in mid-winter and mid-summer. [48] The total pressure gradient is the sum of the barotropic pressure gradient (rP barotropic ) due to wind-forced convergences and divergences and the baroclinic pressure gradient (rP baroclinic ). We earlier computed rP = P x + iP y as the momentum balance residual. Here, we scale the baroclinic contribution against the other terms in equation 1. From Figure 12 and from inspection of the gridded velocity field The column labeled RMS total depicts the sum of all five terms in the momentum balance multiplied by 10 5 ; the other columns show the fraction of the RMS explained by each of the five components of equation 1. Despite large seasonal changes in the total kinetic energy, the relative contributions of the individual terms remain approximately the same. Figure 12. Geopotential height anomaly (color shading) and geostrophic current vectors computed over 0-30 db for 2006-2010 (left) late winter and early spring and (right) late summer and early fall. Over much of the central shelf, the vectors depict a northward velocity tendency at the end of summer and a southward tendency at the end of winter: the cross-shelf baroclinic pressure gradient reverses sign between these periods. Small red dots depict the location of CTD casts. for each individual cruise, we find that the typical (maximum) 0-30 db geostrophic velocity is about 1 (3) cm s \u00c01 and rP baroclinic is about 1 (3) \u00c2 10 \u00c06 m s \u00c02 . In late winter and late summer, rP baroclinic is therefore generally larger than the local accelerations, wind stress, and bottom friction, but 60-90% smaller than the Coriolis term. Comparing these results with the pressure gradient residual in equation 1implies that rP barotropic is 2-8 times greater than rP baroclinic . We note also that the SSH field changes rapidly in response to synoptic winds, while the temperature and salinity fields evolve more slowly. Hence, the cross-shelf baroclinic pressure gradient can alternately oppose and reinforce the changing barotropic pressure gradient. [49] In summary, the along-and cross-shelf momentum balances at all sites are predominantly geostrophic in response to sea surface height gradients. However, changes in the crossshelf thermohaline structure, current and wind velocities, and sea ice seasonally modify the cross-shelf momentum balance. In the next section, we examine the vertical and horizontal structure of the current field and its relation to the wind field, and we show that Ekman dynamics lead to a flow field that is highly sensitive to the wind direction and the resultant sea surface topography."}, {"section_title": "Co-variability of the Current, Wind and SSH Fields", "text": "[50] We next examine the temporal and spatial structure of the flow field and their relation to winds. Following this, we use the BESTMAS model to relate wind and current variations to the structure of the SSH field. [51] Prior evaluations of the wind-current relationship found weak to moderate correlations [Schumacher et al., 1982;Muench et al., 1988;Danielson et al., 2006] over the central shelf, although these estimates were primarily based on time domain correlations. Here we first examine the rotary coherence structure (frequency domain relations) between near-surface currents and winds across specific portions of the frequency spectrum. All coherence computations are based on non-overlapped windows truncated with a Hanning tapering function. The velocity records used for the coherence computations were de-tided using harmonic analysis applied to monthlong segments. [52] While energetic flows are roughly coincident across the array (Figures 4 and 5), close examination of differences in the phasing and magnitude of currents suggest a flow field that evolves with considerable spatial structure over short time scales and whose relative magnitude and phasing vary among the various energetic flow events. Figure 13 shows that at high frequencies (periods <35 h), winds and currents at 5m depth are incoherent across the array. At low frequencies (periods > 100 h) winds and currents are significantly coherent on average, but with the coherence-squared (g 2 ) $ 0.4. Inspection of the phase shows that the wind leads the 5 m current by 45-90 for all periods greater than $30 h. The wind-current coherence peak in Figure 13 at $40 h corresponds to a corresponding maximum in wind energy. Analysis of vertically averaged currents and the wind shows the same frequency dependence as for the 5 m currents, although g 2 in the low-frequency band is smaller ($0.3). [53] Based on Figure 13, we divide the velocity time series into three frequency bands and use vertically averaged currents to compute g 2 between each mooring pair, shown in Figure 14 as a function of separation distance. The high frequency band (13-22 h) was formed by band-pass filtering the velocity records after subjecting them to harmonic de-tiding of monthlong segments. This band contains the inertial (13.8 h at 60 N) and near-inertial periods. The mid-frequency band spans periods of 32-102 h and the low-frequency band 128-512 h. [54] The high-frequency portion of the spectrum has low coherence (g 2 < 0.4) (with a slight linear dependency on separation), and most correlations are not significant at the 95% level. The mid-frequency band shows that 0.4 < g 2 < 0.65 at sites within 100 km of each other and these are all significant. Moreover, most sites within 200 km of each other are also coherent, but only weakly so. The low frequency band is coherent for nearly all mooring combinations; values range from 0.6 < g 2 < 0.8 at 50-100 km separation to g 2 < 0.5 at separations >250 km. With an average separation distance of $85 km between adjacent moorings, the mooring array therefore resolves a large portion of the flow field at synoptic to fortnightly time periods. [55] We next examine the vertical structure of current co-variability in the mid-frequency portion of the spectrum. Figure 13. Coherence-squared (g 2 ) between NARR winds at each mooring site with currents measured at 5 m depth. Sixteen comparisons (thin light traces) are shown, one for each yearlong deployment at each of the eight mooring sites. The thick dark line is the average of all sixteen. The dashed line shows the average significance level. At the shallow (25 m) sites the currents are coherent over the entire water column, although there is some seasonal variation (Figure 15). Over the 40 and 55 m isobaths, the currents are vertically coherent between 5 m and 30 m depth (g 2 > 0.6) during fall, winter and early spring, coincident with weak stratification and strong winds (see Figures 2 and 9). Coherence decreases (g 2 < 0.6) between mid-spring and late summer below 20 m depth, consistent with Figure 2 and other observations that find the upper mixed layer is typically between 15 and 30 m depth [e.g., Ladd and Stabeno, 2012]. Slight differences in coherence between the fall and winter are statistically insignificant, but suggestive of the influence of ice cover. [56] We now turn to the SSH field. Pressure measurements made at seven of the eight mooring sites were de-tided with a 35-h low-pass filter and converted to equivalent SSH fluctuations (Figure 16). Variations from the record-length means greater than 0.5 m occur most often in fall, winter, and spring. The largest SSH excursions are at the 25 m sites, where storm surges of $1 m are seen in December 2009. Record-length cross-correlations between the BESTMAS model and observed SSH fields show that the model captures from 31% (at N55) to 61% (at N40) of the observed variability ( Figure 16). With the exception of site N40, correlations between the observed and modeled SSH fields are stronger between October and May than during June-September ( Table 5). The barotropic Rossby deformation radius R bt = (gH) 1/2 f \u00c01 varies from 120 km for water 25 m deep to 160 km for 40 m depths and 180 km for 55 m. For comparison, N25 (N40, N55) is $70 km (170 km, 300 km) due west of the Alaskan mainland. The BESTMAS model and the above scaling indicates that mooring N55 was in a region with relatively small horizontal SSH gradients, so the lower levels of correlation here are not surprising. [57] The time of maximum correlation (r) between the wind and observed pressure fluctuations varies slightly with water depth (not shown), so that at the 25 m and 40 m sites the SSH tends to lag the winds by 0-8 h, with 0.2 < r 2 < 0.5, while at the deeper sites r 2 < 0.3 and the maximum correlation occurs with a lag of up to 20 h. [58] Table 4 and Figure 11 show that the momentum balance is not strongly seasonally variable. Therefore, based on the Figure 14. Rotary coherence-squared (g 2 ) of vertically averaged currents from all mooring pair combinations. Symbols denote the depth combination for each comparison (see legend). Symbols plotted with thick lines are significantly coherent at the 95% confidence level and the mean level of significance for all combinations is plotted with a dotted line. direction of the mean regional wind vector (formed by equally weighting the NARR wind time series from all eight mooring sites), we made record-length averages of the mean wind vector, the BESTMAS SSH field, and the moored current measurements (Figure 17). Because the model output is daily, and because of the lagged wind-SSH relation, we made 24-h averages of the wind vector preceding each current measurement to determine the wind direction bins used in assembling the panels of Figure 17. [59] Changes in wind velocity impact currents through SSH gradients (Figure 17). The near-surface (5 m and 10 m depths, red and yellow vectors) flow field is typically aligned to the right of the wind field, consistent with surface Ekman dynamics. At deeper depths, the current vectors generally rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, indicating the influence of the bottom Ekman layer. However, for winds toward 225 T and 270 T the currents rotate primarily clockwise with depth. In these cases the winds are directed off-shelf and the 5 m currents are directed nearly 90 to the right of the wind. We also note that currents at depth are more closely aligned along the model-derived SSH contours than are those near the surface. In aggregate, these observations are consistent with the flow field being in near-geostrophic balance and responding strongly to the interaction of the wind-driven Ekman flow with the convoluted Bering Sea coastline. [60] The structure of the SSH field and its associated currents is highly sensitive to the wind direction. Northerly and northwesterly winds generate the strongest coastal divergence (depressed SSHs over Chirikov Basin, Norton Sound and the central shelf), but the cross-isobath SSH gradient weakens considerably where the local coastline changes from a predominantly north-south orientation (between Norton Sound and Nunivak Island) to a more west-east orientation (in Kuskokwim Bay and Bristol Bay). The shelf response switches rather abruptly from divergent (northerly winds) to convergent (easterly winds) conditions. [61] We note that the shelfbreak and outer shelf isobath orientations can be represented by a line extending from the northwest (Cape Navarin) to the southeast (Unimak Pass) and because the shelf flow field adjusts to northerly and easterly winds as described, we segregate all records into two modes based on the wind direction. The coastal convergence (i.e., downwelling) mode is associated with southeasterly winds and results in along-isobath currents directed toward Bering Strait. The coastal divergence (i.e., upwelling) mode is  All correlations are statistically significant at the 95% level except for the short record at mooring S40. On the vertical axis, the distance between the zero line for each time series is equivalent to 1 m SSH change, with tick marks every 0.25 m. associated with northwesterly winds and results in currents directed away from Bering Strait. Divergent conditions occurred 64% of the time over the course of our field program; convergent conditions occurred the remaining 36% of the time. Southeasterly wind, though less frequent during the measurement program, leads to stronger currents than northwesterly wind. The net effect of these competing circulation modes yields the highly variable but small mean currents that characterize the flow field of the eastern Bering shelf."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "[62] We have shown that currents over the central shelf are coherent over scales of $200 km for most sub-inertial and sub-tidal frequencies and are moderately (but significantly) coherent with the local winds. Vertical coherence of the flow field is reduced during late spring and summer, coincident with reduced mean wind speeds and increased ocean stratification. Variations in SSH and the underlying current field are sensitive to the direction of wind-forcing through the upwelling and downwelling responses of the Ekman transport, and the transition from upwelling to downwelling conditions occurs for winds directed approximately to the southwest [Danielson et al., 2012]. [63] Our analysis suggests that the entire central Bering shelf circulation responds strongly to coastal convergence and divergence. Convergence is associated with enhanced northward flow resulting from coastal sea surface setup caused by onshore Ekman transport driven by southeasterly winds. Coastal divergence results from offshore Ekman transport driven by northwesterly winds. In general, southeasterly winds result in stronger flows, but northwesterly winds occur more often. Note, however, that our observations were made during two relatively cold years in the Bering Sea [Stabeno et al., 2012]. We expect that Bering Sea warmer years will likely show a greater proportion of downwelling (i.e., southeasterly winds). Note also that the more energetic convergent response may at least in part be Figure 17. Composite oceanic response to various wind directions. Each panel is for a different set of wind directions (top center \u00c022.5 T to +22.5 T, etc.). The mean wind vector is the black vector emanating from 59 N, 172 W. Current vectors are color-coded based on depth: 5 m = red, 10 m = yellow, 20 m = green, 30 m = blue, 40 m = black. The BESTMAS SSH field is contoured at 2 cm increments between 1 cm (blue) and 41 cm (red) elevations and is clipped at levels beyond this, so that the entire dynamic range is not fully represented. The mean wind direction is over the 24-h period prior to the ocean current observation. L denotes the total time represented by each panel's average. A scale vector for both the wind and current is provided in the center. due to the propagation direction of storms across the shelf. Cyclones typically approach the shelf from the southwest and so first impart northward momentum with their leading edge of southeasterly winds; the trailing edge (northwesterly winds) must first decelerate the northward flow before reversing the current direction. Not all high wind events, however, are associated with propagating low-pressure systems. [64] Our synthesis of shelf behavior in fall and winter is consistent with the findings of Danielson et al. [2011], who used CTD survey data from the BASIS program to show that the freshwater content over the shelf is correlated with the October-May wind direction anomaly. Northerly winds promote offshore spreading of low-salinity coastal waters, whereas easterly winds promote northward along-shelf transport and presumably prevent offshore spreading of fresh water. [65] We have also shown that the baroclinic pressure field reverses direction, from promoting southward flow in late winter to promoting northward flow in late summer. Because effects of heating and freezing are enhanced in shallow waters, warm summers increase the magnitude of the cross-shelf density difference and thus enhance northward transport, and cold winters with increased ice production and brine rejection also increased the magnitude of the (now reversed) cross-shelf density difference and enhance southward transport. Conversely, milder summers or winters lead to smaller cross-slope density differences, and thus weaker flow, so that the greater preponderance of southeasterly winds inhibits the offshore transport of dilute coastal waters. Thus, the baroclinic pressure gradients respond to the atmosphere's influence on both freezing and advective processes. (As a cautionary note, some atmospheric circulation patterns can result in warm Gulf of Alaska air being recirculated southward over the Bering Sea [Rodionov et al., 2007], so that winds from the north are not always associated with enhanced ice production and brine rejection.) Although the baroclinic velocity is large enough to influence seasonal transports, it is not as important as the effect of the wind-driven convergences and divergences in setting up the shelf pressure field. [66] Transport through Bering Strait increases in summer due to larger horizontal density gradients (presence of the Alaskan Coastal Current) and a reduction in northerly winds [Roach et al., 1995;Woodgate et al., 2005aWoodgate et al., , 2005b. Surprisingly, the mean summer flow we observe over the shelf is not uniformly northward over the inner shelf, despite a crossisobath baroclinic pressure gradient that promotes northward flow in summer. This suggests that much of the increased summer flow through Bering Strait comes from the Gulf of Anadyr, either directly through Anadyr Strait or from the eastward transport on the southern side of St. Lawrence Island, and/or from Alaskan Coastal Current waters inshore of our mooring array. Intriguingly, the BESTMAS model SSH field averaged over May-September, shows that a large majority of the SSH contours in the Gulf of Anadyr pass through Anadyr Strait, with only a small fraction directed eastward south of St. Lawrence Island before turning north in Shpanberg Strait. During October-April all the SSH contours pass directly through Anadyr Strait. Taken together, these findings suggest that waters from the central Bering shelf contributed relatively little to the Bering Strait throughflow over the course of our field years, with the possible exception of summer waters immediately adjacent to the Alaskan coast, inshore of our moorings. [67] Based on our observations reported here, together with those of , Danielson et al. [2006] and Danielson et al. [2012], we propose that waters originating in the Gulf of Anadyr are a source of nutrientrich waters to the central Bering shelf, particularly in winter. Indeed, the BESTMAS model SSH contours are consistent with our observations suggesting an advective pathway that extends eastward from the Gulf of Anadyr, passing south of St. Lawrence Island, and is then south-or southeastward toward Nunivak Island. This linkage occurs under northwesterly winds and is consonant with the mean October-April and May-September SSH fields (not shown). The model results of Clement et al. [2005] also show a southward flow tendency across the central shelf region in 1979, a year that their model indicated reduced northward transport through Bering Strait. Similarly, based on a two-month reversal of currents in Shpanberg Strait, Muench et al. [1988] schematically suggested a pathway for Chirikov Basin water (primarily of Anadyr origin) moving eastward north of St. Lawrence Island, and then southward through Shpanberg Strait. These various lines of evidence have important implications for biological production, since they suggest that the rich nutrient load in the Gulf of Anadyr can be brought onto the central shelf region at least as far south as Nunivak Island under sustained southeastward flow (e.g., a monthlong mean speed of 10 cm s \u00c01 ). Indeed, this nutrient pathway may at least in part explain the recent observation of elevated net community production over the central shelf [Mathis et al., 2010]. [68] We further suggest that inter-annual variations in biological production over the central shelf may be linked to the long-term variability of the wind-driven southeastward circulation mode that we have described. We expect that winters with more northwesterly winds will increase the central shelf nutrient reservoir leading into spring and summer, while the fresh and nutrient-depleted coastal waters that normally reside over the central shelf will be carried south of Nunivak Island and farther offshore. Conversely, winters with more southeasterly winds will flush central shelf waters northward, some fraction possibly through Bering Strait, and increase on-shelf nutrient fluxes over the southern Bering shelf. Interannual variation in the preponderance and strength of northwesterly and southeasterly winds will therefore result in a variable supply of nutrients to large portions of the shelf, and possibly northward through Bering Strait. These ideas could be tested further with the data sets recently collected as part of the BEST-BSIERP program, along with analysis of new and existing numerical model integrations. [69] The central shelf circulation alternates between the two described modes, resulting in a flow that is small in the mean but highly variable both spatially and temporally. Within this variable regime, we estimate residence time for the central shelf as follows. The distance from each mooring to its closest neighbor is 61-142 km, with a mean of 85 km. To cover these distances in one month would require a flow of 2.3-5.5 cm s \u00c01 . Given that flows are largely coherent at low frequencies and within 200 km of each other (Figure 14), we assume a uniform flow field and integrate the raw velocity record at each mooring with respect to time. By progressively shifting the integration start by one observation time step (30 min) through the velocity record, we compute the minimum time it would take a particle at 5 m depth to move 50 and 100 km from its initial position. We find that the probability distribution function is lognormal, with modal peaks centered near 6 and 12 days for the minimum time required to displace a particle in the upper water column 50 and 100 km, respectively. The durations lengthen to 14 and 34 days for currents at 30 m depth. For comparison, mean monthly vertically averaged velocities suggest typical monthly displacements of 30-90 km and maximum displacements of $230 km. Taken together, these estimates suggest a mean residence time of many months, but two or three successive months of anomalous flow could largely flush the central shelf. [70] It is unclear what changes over the central shelf mean for the northward transport through Bering Strait because Danielson et al. [2012] show that bi-directional exchange through both Anadyr and Shpanberg straits must be considered in the regional volume balance. Although winds over the central shelf are not coherent with those over Chirikov Basin, Bering Strait and the southern Chukchi Sea (Figure 8), the model results show that northwesterly and southeasterly winds over the mooring array are associated with SSH anomalies that extend to Chirikov Basin and Norton Sound (Figure 17). Comparison of observed monthly mean velocities at Bering Strait mooring MA3 to the fraction of time that wind at 60 N, 170 W blew from the southeast shows a weak but statistically significant relation (r = 0.39, p = 0.002) such that southeasterly winds are associated with northward transport anomalies in Bering Strait [Aagaard and Schumacher, 1985;Woodgate et al., 2005a]. [71] Our results also suggest that some fraction of the Yukon River discharge may be advected westward across the central shelf under the southeastward circulation mode, first being brought southward past Nunivak Island and then westward with the offshore flow. Direct evidence is sparse, but tantalizing. Most notably, three of fifteen satellite-tracked drifters deployed near Nunivak Island in September 2002 headed west past Cape Navarin under the influence of generally northerly winds [Danielson et al., 2006] (also see http:// www.ims.uaf.edu/drifters/). More generally, the central Bering shelf may constitute a branch point between subarctic and arctic domains, with freshwater, heat, larvae, or contaminants on the inner shelf being transported either westward toward the deep basin or northward toward the Arctic, depending on the wind-driven circulation. [72] Finally, retrospective analysis shows that the mean wind direction over the Bering shelf has changed in concert with recent climate and ecosystem regime shifts. One major change occurred during the mid-1970s North Pacific regime shift, coincident with a transition from more upwelling-favorable conditions to more downwelling-favorable [Danielson et al., 2011]. Forecasts from global climate models suggest that climate warming may slightly deepen the Aleutian low and move it $100 km northward within a few decades [Salath\u00e9, 2006]. Over the eastern Bering shelf, monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) contours show little variability over 100 km scales, and so we would not expect a large change in wind direction over most of a year. September and October may be somewhat more sensitive to changes in the Aleutian low position, however, because the mean monthly isobars are oriented from NE to SW over the central shelf [Pickart et al., 2009] and from NW to SE over the outer southeastern shelf. For these months, a northward shift of the low would subject more of the eastern shelf to upwelling winds and increase the eastward flux of nutrients from the Gulf of Anadyr. Additional insights on this issue might be achieved from climate projection models by focusing on seasonally dependent changes in the position of the Aleutian low."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "[73] We analyzed the data from an array of eight current meter moorings distributed over the central Bering Sea shelf between the 25 and 55-m isobaths, between 58.6 N and 62 N. We find that the along-shore currents are primarily geostrophic and vary in response to the wind-forced sea level gradients associated with coastal Ekman convergences and divergences. Cross-shore currents are also predominantly geostrophic, although surface stresses, bottom stresses, and local accelerations account up for up to 40% of the momentum balance, depending on season and location. Shelf waters near the mooring array alternately flow northward (under southeasterly winds) and southward (under northwesterly winds) in response to the winds and the sea level gradients they force, resulting in typical sub-tidal speeds of 3-12 cm s \u00c01 , peak speeds of 65 cm s \u00c01 , and vector means <5 cm s \u00c01 . [74] Density-controlled horizontal pressure gradients vary seasonally and promote northward flow in late summer and southward flow in late winter. However, the baroclinic pressure field is of secondary importance in the momentum balance compared to the wind-forced barotropic pressure field, and baroclinic forcing is likely muted following warmer winters and cooler summers. [75] The two circulation modes associated with coastal convergence and divergence probably play a significant role in the freshwater, heat, and nutrient budgets of the central shelf. In particular, we suggest that waters from the Gulf of Anadyr (advected either eastward along the south side of St. Lawrence Island or southward from the Chirikov Basin) can provide inorganic nitrogen to the central shelf at least as far south as Nunivak Island. Wind direction controls the ocean circulation modes, and the transition between southward and northward currents occurs between winds directed southward and westward. One or two months of strongly anomalous flow conditions may be sufficient to replace large portions of the central shelf with nitrate-rich waters from the northwest. [76] We observed northwesterly winds nearly twice as often as southeasterly winds, but this is probably not representative of all years. Extended re-orientation of the mean wind direction would likely result in systematic changes to the circulation and a shelf-wide reorganization of many physical, chemical and biological fluxes that impact regional heat and freshwater content, nutrient stocks, and primary production.
