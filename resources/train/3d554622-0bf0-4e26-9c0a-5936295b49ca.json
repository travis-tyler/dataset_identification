[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Interspecific spatial associations (ISA), which include co-occurrences, segregations, or attractions among two or more species, have been an under-represented topic in biodiversity science and in largescale assessments of biodiversity change in the anthropocene. Also, ISA has not been perceived as a facet of biodiversity on par with beta diversity or species richness. This is likely because it is unclear what makes ISA useful in a biodiversity context, little is known about the theoretical connections between ISA and other biodiversity facets, and there is a confusing variety of approaches to measuring ISA. Here we address these three issues. First, we argue that ISA is an important facet of biological diversity since it not only reflects species interactions, but it also provides a benchmark for validation of ecological theories, and it can be explored for potentially predictive macroecological patterns. Second, we review links of ISA to other classical biodiversity facets, namely to alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, and species accumulation curves, showing that they mostly fail to reflect changes/variation in ISA, with the exception of average pair-wise beta diversity. Third, we review the metrics that are designed to reflect ISA. These are spatially implicit indices of association for both binary and abundance data, community variograms, and summary functions such as bivariate pair correlation functions for point patterns. We test and compare some of these approaches on empirical and simulated data. We provide specific recommendations for how to use these approaches in biodiversity science and macroecology. Our main conclusion is that measuring of ISA must evolve to embrace spatially explicit, i.e. distance dependent, approaches."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Organisms are rarely distributed randomly in space. Instead, they aggregate or segregate as a result of spatial distribution of resources, barriers, environments, and/or by interactions with other organisms. Such non-random spatial aggregation and segregation occurs both among individuals within a single species and among species; we call the former the conspecific spatial aggregation (CSA), and the latter the interspecific spatial association (ISA) (Fig. 1, Appendix S1 ). Patterns of CSA are indicative of ecological niches, interactions among individuals of the same species, or dispersal limitations (Table 1) . CSA also underpins concepts such as species endemism, beta diversity, and rarity (Table  1) , and there is a substantial literature on these connections (Fig. S1 ). In contrast, ISA indicates overlap of niches among species, as well as interspecific interactions and interaction networks (Table  1) , which underpins community assembly, coexistence theory, and ecosystem functioning. ISA is also foundational to classifications of communities to habitats, coenoses, or biomes (Hoekstra et al. 2004 ). Thus, both CSA and ISA can be seen as both useful and fundamental components or \"facets\" of biodiversity, if biodiversity is broadly defined as \"variation of life at all levels of biological organization\" (Gaston and Spicer 2009) .\nPerhaps surprisingly, ISA has been underrepresented relative to CSA in the study of macroecological and biogeographic patterns of biodiversity in space and time [with notable exceptions , Lyons et al. 2016 , T\u00f3th et al. 2019 , and ISA has been missing in recent high-profile studies of the ongoing biodiversity change (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005 , WWF International 2012 , Newbold et al. 2015 , Blowes et al. 2019 . To demonstrate this gap, we scanned Clarivate Web of Science (Fig. S1 ), finding that literature on biodiversity has most often focused on quantities at sites (i.e. species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity, extinctions, invasions, relative abundances), or quantified similarity among sites (i.e. beta diversity, turnover, nestedness, speciesarea relationships; Fig. S1 ), which are also intimately connected with CSA (Storch et al. 2008) . In contrast, terms associated specifically with ISA received an order of magnitude less attention measured by the total number of published papers per year (Fig. S1 ), although ISA analyses require exactly the same data as analysis of beta diversity. So the lack of attention cannot be explained by a lack of data. Clearly, although ISA is an important component of biodiversity (Table 1 , next section), it has not been perceived as such by biodiversity scientists. We propose three reasons for this: First, it may be unclear what makes ISA important or useful when studying biodiversity. Second, little is known about the theoretical connections, or their lack, between patterns of ISA and other biodiversity patterns (e.g. those of richness or beta diversity). Third, it is unclear how biodiversity scientists should actually measure ISA, given the plethora of approaches.\nIn this paper, we aim to address each of these three issues. In the first part, we summarize why ISA is an important facet of biodiversity that deserves to be quantified alongside the other facets such as beta diversity or species-area relationships. We then outline the theoretical links between ISA and some fundamental facets of biodiversity, focusing particularly on species richness, beta diversity and species-area relationships. Finally, we review the current methods to measure ISA. We sort the methods according to the types of data that ecologists are likely to encounter, and we compare the methods on empirical datasets and on simulated pairs of species with known ISA. Based on our review and the simulations, we offer guidelines to select the appropriate approach to analyzing ISA based on the question of interest and particular type of data at hand. We hope our results will stimulate the study of ISA and promote its use in biodiversity assessments alongside more traditional measures.\n3 Why ISA matters for biodiversity Why, in the context of biodiversity, should we consider ISA patterns in space and time? The bestknown reason for analyzing patterns of inter-specific spatial associations and co-occurrences is that they may give hints on biotic interactions and interaction networks among species , Harris 2016 , Morueta-Holme et al. 2016 , Thurman et al. 2019 , which is among the biggest topics of biodiversity science (Fig. S1 , Proulx et al. 2005 , Newman 2006 , Bascompte and Jordano 2017 . The traditional approach is to conduct null model randomizations of the presence-absence matrices Simberloff 1979, Gotelli 2000) , whereas more recent approaches statistically partition ISA due to shared environmental requirements and dispersal limitations from ISA caused by the interactions, for example by joint species distribution modelling (JSDM, Warton et al. 2015 , Ovaskainen et al. 2017 , Zurell et al. 2018 , by looking at ISA within environmentally homogeneous environment with no dispersal barriers (e.g. T\u00f3th et al. 2019) , or by making an assumption about the spatial scale of biotic interactions vs. environmental variables, which enables to separate these two in a null model (e.g. Wiegand et al. 2012 ). The latter is practical since it requires no data on environmental conditions. Other reasons for measuring ISA, which we cover below, are less appreciated. First, the problem of inferring biotic interactions from co-occurrences can also be meaningfully reversed. Instead of asking \"How important are biotic interactions in a given system?\" we can ask \"What drives the observed patterns of ISA?\" Or more specifically: \"To what extent can we explain the observed ISA by environmental conditions, dispersal limitations, and/or biotic interactions?\" This approach broadens the focus to all of the processes that potentially generate the observed ISA (Table 1) . It is also a challenge for biogeography and macroecology, where explaining gradients of various facets of diversity has dominated the field for decades, yet patterns of co-occurrence have been largely overlooked ( Fig. S1 ), in spite of some remarkable exceptions (Blois et al. 2014 , Weinstein et al. 2017 , D'Amen et al. 2018 .\nSecond, ISA and its patterns are useful even without mechanistic underpinning, because patterns are useful as summary statistics for predictions and forecasts, based on inductive logic, as opposed to the causal one. Examples of such predictive biodiversity patterns that proved to be useful are species-area relationships with their utility to predict extinctions due to habitat loss (Keil et al. 2015) or the use of richness-environment correlations for making spatial interpolations and predictions of diversity patterns (Algar et al. 2009 ). There is a similar value in documenting generality of empirical patterns of ISA in both time and space, since they can enable us to predict ISA in data-deficient locations, or its change under anthropogenic environmental change.\nWe thus argue that ISA can be understood as a summary statistic capturing a unique state of nature, on a par with other popular quantities such as species richness or beta diversity. Simply reporting how these summary statistics vary geographically, or in time, repeatedly proved to be among the most powerful starting stimuli in the field, generating countless explanatory and testable hypotheses. An example is the very existence of latitudinal and altitudinal diversity patterns, which have fascinated ecologists for centuries. The recently uncovered temporal patterns of biodiversity proved to be similarly stimulating --an example is the zero net change of local species richness coupled with decrease in beta diversity (Dornelas et al. 2014 , T\u00f3th et al. 2019 , Blowes et al. 2019 ) and with decrease of global gamma diversity (Barnosky et al. 2011) . Similar approach has recently gained traction in the co-occurrence field. For example, Lyons et al. (2016) hypothesize that observed changes in ISA patterns might be indicative of the impact of human expansion and agriculture on assembly of communities. Likewise, T\u00f3th et al. (2019) isolate the footprint of biotic interactions via ISA patterns, without direct interaction data.\nThird, ISA can provide new explicanda for major ecological theories (McGill 2010 , Currie 2019 . This could be an addition to patterns which are correlated with CSA, but uncorrelated with ISA, for example the species-area relationships (Plotkin et al. 2000 , Storch 2016 ) (see next section). For example, it has been demonstrated that neutral theory (Hubbell 2001) or the maximum entropy theory (Harte 2011) both reproduce realistic species-area relationships, but it is unknown if they predict patterns of ISA [but see Bell (2005) ]. The ability to explain patterns of ISA can thus be a new panna cotta for validating theories.\nThe last reason for why biodiversity science should re-focus on ISA is that some of the simple measures of biodiversity, such as average species richness or rarefaction, are insensitive to ISA, as we will show in the next section. Any biodiversity assessment that relies only on these simple measures runs into a risk of missing variation, or temporal change, of ISA. This also emphasizes the need for metrics designed to specifically quantify ISA."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs other biodiversity metrics", "text": "In order to study ISA in the context of biodiversity, one should be aware of how it relates to other biodiversity metrics and patterns. As mentioned above, this may be critical in any comprehensive biodiversity assessment that aims to capture as many independent facets of biodiversity as possible. Apart from that, the other facets may interfere with our ability to capture ISA, or inversely, ISA may interfere with our ability to measure other facets, which may necessitate statistically accounting for the confounding effects. Below we focus on what we see as the simplest and most fundamental metrics, namely alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, species-area relationships, and species accumulation curves."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs alpha diversity", "text": "Here we show that local species richness at any single given site is potentially sensitive to changes in ISA, while mean local richness (alpha diversity) is insensitive to changes in ISA.\nLet \u03b1 j be local species richness at a site j, where j \u22081 : n, and where n is the total number of sites within a given spatial domain. Let O i be the number of occupied sites (i.e. occupancy) by species i, where i\u22081 :\u03b3, and where \u03b3 is the total number of species (i.e. gamma diversity) present at all sites together. When we manipulate ISA in the system, values of \u03b1 j change as a result -for example, in Let us now consider \u1fb1, the alpha diversity averaged across all sites, which can also be calculated as the sum of prevalences O i /n (\u0160izling and Storch 2004) , i.e. as:\nAgain consider the scenario in Figure 2a in which there was a shift in the ISA from segregated to 4 aggregated, given that Oi, n and \u03b3 remained constant, \u1fb1 will not be affected by the change in ISA. In other words, when species in a given spatial domain segregate or move close to each other, it has no effect on average local species richness. Hence, an empirical assessment of biodiversity which summarizes net change of \u1fb1 over many locations may be blind to changes of ISA, unless it also assess patterns that are sensitive to ISA, for example pairwise beta diversity. Further, this insensitivity of \u1fb1 propagates to species-area relationships and to species accumulation curves diversity, as we show later."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs gamma diversity", "text": "From a purely geometrical perspective, simply rearranging mutual positions (ISA) of species within a given spatial domain has no effect on total number of species \u03b3 in the domain (given that n is constant). A more interesting question is what happens when the effect is reversed, i.e. how ISA changes when \u03b3 increases or decreases. This has biological implications, since \u03b3 limits the magnitude of ISA within a given domain, which can also limit biotic interactions. It also has methodological implications, since variation in \u03b3 across spatial domains can hinder direct comparisons of ISA within these domains, which may require statistical treatment (Ulrich et al. 2018) . Several propositions about the relationship between ISA and \u03b3 have been made and some of them have been empirically tested.\nThe first has been summarized by McGill (2010) : the richer the metacommunities, the weaker the associations will appear on average, despite the presence of some strong associations (Paine 1988 , Wootton 1997 , McGill 2010 . This can be seen by considering that the total number of possible pairwise associations in the domain is \u03b3 (\u03b3 \u22121)/2. If every species is significantly spatially associated with k species in a symmetric fashion, then the total number of significant spatial associations in the domain is (\u03b3 k)/2. Thus, for any given k <(\u03b3 \u22121), the total number of all possible pairwise associations increases faster with \u03b3 than the number of actually significant associations.\nThe second proposition operates on relative abundances: If the total area and density of individuals are constant, but there is an increase of the total richness \u03b3, then the average per-species abundance must decrease, which will reduce the likelihood of detecting inter-specific co-occurrences in communities (Hubbell and Foster 1986 , Lieberman and Lieberman 2007 , Wiegand et al. 2007b , Volkov et al. 2009 , Wiegand et al. 2012 , Rajala et al. 2019 ). This only concerns the observed cooccurrences, and the effect should disappear after the observed spatial associations are contrasted with those predicted from a null model that is constrained by the observed \u03b3 and n.\nThe third proposition exposes the mathematical constraint on the possible values of negative associations in a species-by-species association matrix . Simply put, if species A and B have strong negative association (represented by negative correlation, covariance, or other index), then it is mathematically impossible for a third species C to have strong negative association with both A and B. This is because the association matrix is positive semidefinite ). Fox (2012) also showed that, under the assumption that all species have the same negative correlation with each other (e.g. due to competition-induced compensatory dynamics), the minimum possible value of the correlation approaches 0 as we increase species richness. Thus, on average, the more competing species are added to the metacommunity, the weaker their observed average negative association gets.\nThe fourth proposition, which is biological rather than statistical in nature, suggests that communities with more species may only be stable if the interactions get weaker on average, as found by May (1972) in an analysis of the stability of Lotka-Voltera type multispecies models. Stone (2016) found in a generalization of the analysis that stability and feasibility under increasing species richness requires a strong reduction in the mean and standard deviation of the value of the interspecific competition coefficients.\nBased on all of these arguments, we should expect the overall ISA to weaken as \u03b3 increases. Indeed, Wiegand et al. (2012) found that species associations were significantly weaker in rich forest communities compared to species poor ones, even after the null-expected associations were taken into account. However, it is unclear if this occurred for the purely statistical reasons provided in proposition 1-3, and thus it may be desirable to account for them if ISA is compared across systems with different \u03b3. Ulrich et al. (2018) provide null models to account for the effect of varying \u03b3 in spatially implicit binary co-occurrence species-by-site matrices, suggesting a randomization procedure that preserves both column and row total of the species-by-site matrix. We are unaware of similar procedures that account for the statistical effect of \u03b3 on ISA in abundance-based matrices, or in spatially explicit data. Finally, we also note that there may be limits in the ability of the null models to control for these effects (Ulrich et al. 2017 )."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs beta diversity", "text": "Here we show how ISA is conceptually related to another important biodiversity facet: beta diversity.\nWe also show how one particularly popular matrix-wise measure of beta diversity, Whittaker's index, is insensitive to ISA, while pairwise indices of beta diversity are sensitive to ISA (Fig. 2) , although we still lack the exact mathematical theory for this. We show that spatially explicit point pattern analysis may offer the right toolbox to build such a theory.\nThere is a fundamental connection between ISA and beta diversity, i.e. the differentiation of species composition in space. The connection is best illustrated on a spatially implicit site-by-species community matrix Y . In short, ISA is the association among species , Bell 2005 , whereas beta diversity is the dissimilarity among sites. In this simplified case, both ISA and beta diversity are calculated using exactly the same data and indices (Tables 2, 3); the only difference between them is whether they are applied to the rows (\"R-mode\" of Legendre & Legendre 2012) or columns of Y (\"Q-mode\"). In other words, any index of beta diversity that is normally applied to sites can be applied to species and can be meaningfully interpreted as an index of ISA, and vice versa Legendre 2012, Arita 2017) . For example, Ara\u00fajo and Rozenfeld (2013) define a \"co-occurrence score\" as the \"ratio of the number of geographical cells where species A and B co-occur to the total number of occupied cells\". Although not stated, this is equivalent to the classic Jaccard index. Thus, the list of measures that have been typically used to measure ISA (Tables 2 and 3 ) can be expanded with e.g. Jaccard or S\u00f8rensentype indices (Arita 2017) . Inversely, the list of commonly used measures of beta diversity can be expanded by some typical ISA indices; for instance the Cforbes (Table 2 ) could find its niche in the beta diversity research, since it explicitly quantifies the deviation of the observed ISA (or beta diversity) from the ISA (or beta diversity) expected under random distribution of incidences (Forbes 1907 ).\nHowever, little has been written about the actual relationship between beta diversity and ISA within a given spatial domain. There is insufficient theory and empirical evaluation showing exactly how ISA and beta diversity are related, and what the limits and constraints of the relationship are. The one simple exception is Whittaker's beta diversity when expressed as \u03b3 /\u1fb1, which is insensitive to ISA ( Fig. 2 and next section), given that the extent of the spatial domain remains constant. Some useful connections between ISA and beta diversity are given by Arita (2017) , who showed that both ISA and beta diversity are linked to the fill of binary community matrix, from which it follows that pairwise metrics of beta diversity should somehow be correlated with ISA, although not perfectly (Fig. 2) . Also, \u0160izling et al. (2011) and McGlinn and Hurlbert (2012) give a potential clue by showing the relationship between average pairwise Jaccard beta diversity and the Whittaker index is modulated by the occupancy frequency distribution [see also McGeoch and Gaston (2002) ]. This reasoning could perhaps be extended to provide a link between pairwise beta diversity and ISA.\nIn contrast to the spatially implicit indices for binary and abundance data, the connection between ISA and beta diversity is well known in analyses of point patterns (Wiegand and Moloney 2014) which do not operate with discrete sites, but rather with continuously varying areas for which position and species identity of every single individual is known. The ISA-beta connection can be demonstrated in the spatially-explicit version of Simpson's index \u03b2 (r ) (Shimatani 2001, Wiegand and Moloney 2014 section 3.1.5.1), and this is something that could potentially inspire development of theory for other data types. Unlike the traditional spatially implicit version of the Simpson's index (Simpson 1949 ) (i.e., the probability that two randomly selected individuals are heterospecifics), which is a measure of diversity, \u03b2 (r ) is a measure of beta diversity, since it captures dissimilarity over a given distance (Shimatani 2001 ) (i.e., the probability that two randomly selected individuals distance r apart are heterospecifics). The index is defined as:\nNote the two alternative but equivalent definitions. In the first definition in eq. 2, f i and f j are the relative abundances of species i and j, g ij (r ) is the bivariate pair correlation function describing the spatially explicit ISA and g(r ) is the pair correlation function of all individuals together (see following sections). The \u03b4 ij (r)=1 if i\u2260 j and \u03b4 ij (r)=0 if i= j . As expected, if there are no spatial patterns of ISA, i.e. when g ij (r )=1, we obtain the non-spatial Simpson index, and depending on the abundances and ISA of the different species, beta diversity will be larger or smaller than this point of reference. The second definition in eq. 2 operates purely with con-specific aggregation (CSA), measured by within-species pair correlation function g mm (r ). We can see that the spatially explicit \u03b2 (r ) depends on the balance between the ISA and CSA, whose overall effect sums up to 1.\nWe thus conclude that point pattern analysis, through \u03b2 (r ), offers a comprehensive framework that can link abundances, CSA, ISA, gamma diversity and alpha diversity, each with an exactly defined and mathematically tractable metrics. Not only does it stress the importance of making all of the diversity facets spatially explicit, but it also potentially offers a roadmap for future unification of the concepts in the field of macroecology that deals with plot-, grid-, or sample-based spatially implicit data on abundances or incidences."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs species-area relationships and species-accumulation curves", "text": "Here we demonstrate that species-area relationships and rarefaction curves are insensitive to ISA. We have stated that \u1fb1 and \u03b3 in a given domain are insensitive to ISA, given that spatial extent or a study remains constant. These are the two components of Whittaker's index of beta diversity (Whittaker 1960) , which is \u03b3 /\u1fb1, and so Whittaker's index is insensitive to ISA. It means that nested species-area relationships (SAR), which are a generalization of the Whittaker index over a continuous range of \u1fb1 and \u03b3 (Crist and Veech 2006) must also be insensitive to ISA (Fig. 2 ). However, this only holds when \u1fb1 is considered in the nested SAR (Storch 2016) ; we are unaware of any study that investigates this for other types of SAR [e.g. island SAR (Scheiner 2003) ].\nWhen every individual's spatial position and identity is known, then the theory of point pattern analysis also makes it clear that there is no direct link between ISA and SAR. The relevant equation is (Shimatani and Kubota 2004) :\nwhere S(r ) is number of species present within r from an arbitrarily chosen \"test\" location, H i is the spherical contact distribution function for species i, which is the probability that the first neighbor of species i is distance r away from the test location. S(r ) becomes a species-area curve when r is converted to \u03c0 r 2 . Importantly, the H i is insensitive to ISA, since it is only based on the locations of species i. We note that point pattern analysis also has a scaling curve that is sensitive to ISA: the individual species-area relationship [ISAR (Wiegand et al. 2007a )] which always focuses on a focal species f :\nwhere D fi (r) is the bivariate nearest neighbor distribution function, and IS (r ) is the probability that a point of species i is distance r away from an average point of focal species f . Again, r can be converted to area as \u03c0 r 2 .\nFinally, we turn to species-accumulation curves, from which the classical examples are the spatially implicit individual-based and sample-based rarefaction curves (Gotelli and Colwell 2001) , and their spatially-explicit versions (McGlinn et al. 2019 ). In the former, individuals or samples are accumulated randomly, irrespectively to their spatial position, which effectively breaks any pattern of both CSA or ISA, making the spatially implicit curves indeed insensitive to ISA. In the latter spatially explicit case, samples (plots) are accumulated by nearest neighbors, which makes these curves closely related to SARs, which we have shown to be sensitive to CSA, but insensitive to ISA. This is in line with the core idea of partitioning of rarefaction curves to their components (McGlinn et al. 2019) , which are the regional species-abundance distribution, density of individuals, and con-specific aggregation, but not ISA."}, {"section_title": "ISA vs biodiversity -summary", "text": "To summarize this section, we have shown that although there are biodiversity facets that reflect ISA, such as pairwise between-site beta diversity, there are also many which ignore ISA. Specifically, these are the average local species richness \u1fb1, the regional gamma diversity \u03b3, their ratio \u03b3 /\u1fb1, and species accumulation curves including species-area relationships and rarefaction curves. The insensitivity of these measures to ISA has two important practical implications: First, when the research focus is only species richness, con-specific aggregation, and their spatial scaling, then there is no need to worry that ISA confounds these facets. Second, for the same reason, studies that aim to describe the multifaceted nature of biodiversity need to consider additional approaches designed specifically to capture ISA. Below we offer an overview of these approaches. 5 Approaches to measuring ISA Methods capturing aspects of ISA have emerged from several schools of thought based on different data types (Fig. 3 ). The first school uses non-spatial information on presence/absence (or abundance) of species in different sites and has focused on tests of hypotheses related to assembly of ecological communities (Cody and Diamond 1979) by comparing the observed patterns of ISA with simulations of null models (Gotelli and Graves 1996 , Sanderson and Pimm 2015 . The second school has been more descriptive, identifying typical groups of species that can be observed together, a typical goal in phytocoenology (Braun-Blanquet 1964) . This has seen much of its development in continental Europe (Kom\u00e1rek 2017) , particularly in geobotany, and it relies on methods such as ordinations and cluster analysis (ter Braak 1987, \u0160milauer and Lep\u0161 2014) . The third school comes from the field of geostatistics (Cressie 2010 ) and uses additionally the spatial position of the sites, offering extensions of variograms that show how covariance between two species changes with spatial distance (Wagner 2003) . The fourth school, requiring the most detailed data on exact spatial position of every individual, and offering the richest inference, is the analysis of point patterns (Wiegand and Moloney 2014) . While each of these schools of thought have generated numerous conceptually diverse measures of ISA, there has been little cross-fertilization. Below we provide an overview of the main approaches."}, {"section_title": "Spatially implicit approaches to ISA", "text": "We begin with measures of ISA designed for one of the most common types of data in biodiversity science, the community matrix Y , which describes the distribution of \u03b3 species (rows) over n sites (columns). Each element y ij of matrix Y contains either binary incidence or some measure of abundance, and i\u22081 :\u03b3 and j \u22081 : n. We follow (Gotelli 2000) by setting rows as species and columns as sites, but others may prefer to reverse these. Since a community matrix Y contains no information on the spatial location of the sites, we use the term spatially implicit for all measures of ISA that only use Y .\nTo date, nearly 100 indices applicable to Y have been proposed to capture ISA in binary cooccurrence data , Rajagopalan and Robb 2005 , Ulrich and Gotelli 2013 , Arita 2017 ) and for abundance data De C\u00e1ceres 2013) , although only a dozen have been widely used in ecology. Some of the pairwise indices, such as C-score or togetherness (Table 2) were developed specifically to capture ISA, others were adopted from the literature on beta diversity , Arita 2017 . Guidelines on the selection of appropriate indices exist based on theoretical properties and performance on empirical data , Koleff et al. 2003 , Legendre and De C\u00e1ceres 2013 , as well as on arguments of comparability between current and historical analyses . In Tables 2 and 3, we give examples of some widely used and/or sufficiently unique indices. Most of the indices are available through R packages vegan (Oksanen et al. 2019) , EcoSimR , bipartite (Dormann et al. 2008) , and betapart (Baselga and Orme 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Pairwise associations in binary data", "text": "The conceptually simplest approach is to look at associations between binary occurrences of two species, either focusing at a specific pair of interest, or as a species-by-species association matrix ( Z) (Table 2) are based on four different quantities that result from the community matrix: the number of sites occupied uniquely by species 1 (c) and species 2 (b), the number of sites where both species co-occur (a), the number of sites where none occurs (d), and n=a+b+c +d . The classical and widely used C-score (Cseg = bc), for example, gives the number of pairs of sites with a \"checkerboard\" (i.e., one hosts species 1, the other species 2). Inversely, togetherness (Ctog = ad), gives the number of pairs of sites with no species and those with both species. The Jaccard index then gives the proportion of sites occupied by both species among all occupied sites ( C jacc =a /(a+ b+c ) . Table 3 lists some commonly used indices for pair-wise ISA in abundance data. The first family includes indices of covariance and correlation, both parametric and non-parametric (i.e. CAcor and CArho), applied on either raw or transformed abundance data. The typical transformations are logarithmic, Hellinger (avoids the double zero problem), or square root transformation; are all aimed at removing the strong leverage of extremely common or rare species on correlations . Another family includes indices that are extensions of the incidence-based similarity measures, and example is R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka similarity CAruz, which is one of the abundance-based versions of Jaccard's index for binary data (Legendre and De C\u00e1ceres 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Pairwise associations in abundance data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Higher-order and matrix-wise associations", "text": "When the aim is to quantify the overall magnitude of ISA in the entire matrix Y in a single number, one option is to simply use the mean or median of the species-by-species association matrix Z.\nHowever, focusing only on pairwise comparisons ignores interactions of higher order [i.e. interactions between 3 or more species (Harris 2016) ]. Although not widely deployed, methods have been proposed that capture the magnitude of species associations across multiple orders. For example, Baselga (2017) and Arita (2017) both present their variants of the classical similarity measures for incidence data and abundance data that, in theory, capture N-wise species associations when applied to the rows of Y . The problem with these indices is their sensitivity to double zeroes and it is still unclear how common are the higher-order associations [a.k.a. motifs (Milo 2002) ] in the real world; accordingly, this approach to similarity measures has already attracted criticism (Marion et al. 2017) .

The simplest test of significance of association in a twospecies binary matrix is Fisher's exact test (Arita 2016) , which is identical to the randomization procedure of Veech (2013) . However, when more than two species are involved, or when the data are abundances rather than incidences, one needs to use a randomization procedure that aims to produce the expected distribution of a given ISA metric under the null expectation. For binary data these null models are covered by Gotelli (2000) , and available through R package EcoSimR , while provide an extensive evaluation of the models for abundance data.\nApart from the calculation of statistical significance, one may also quantify the deviation of the observed metric from the null expectation, and use this deviation as a new metric of ISA. This idea underpins the Cforbes and CFETmP metrics (Table 2) , and the so-called Z-score (Gotelli and McCabe 2002 , Ulrich et al. 2009 , Ulrich and Gotelli 2013 , where the latter is defined as ( E raw \u2212 E exp )/SD exp , and where E raw is the ISA metric (e.g. from Table 2 ) calculated on observed data, E exp is the null expectation of the index, and SD exp is the standard deviation of the null expectation. The Z-score approach is also useful when comparing between systems which differ in the number of samples and species which can influence a raw estimate of ISA."}, {"section_title": "Spatially explicit approaches to ISA", "text": "Thus far, we have only considered spatially implicit metrics of ISA that ignore the spatial distances (lags) between samples, individuals, or species' geographic ranges. Yet this spatial structure can be of key significance, particularly when attempting to detect nonrandom associations. Consider the simple example in Figure 4 in which the same community matrix can be underlain by either between-species aggregation or segregation at fine spatial scales. Spatially implicit metrics of ISA reviewed thus far, conflate these two spatial community patterns, and thus miss part of the ISA.\nIn contrast, spatially explicit techniques directly acknowledge that ISA is intimately connected to spatial distance between sites or individuals. When spatial coordinates of sites or individuals are available, the general way to make the ISA spatially explicit is to only consider pairs of sites that are within a given distance interval when using any of the metrics from the previous section (Tables 2 and  3) , and then to examine a range of distances. This is also the idea behind community variograms (Wagner 2003) described below. A point pattern-based version of this, when the location and identity of each individual is known, is to use bivariate pair correlation functions which describe positive and negative ISA between individuals over continuous distance (Wiegand and Moloney 2014) . In the following section, we describe principles of these two approaches, and refer to software implementations."}, {"section_title": "Community variograms", "text": "Community variograms, borrowed from geostatistics, use the species-by-site community matrix Y together with spatial coordinates of each site (Wagner 2003) . A community variogram then expresses the species-by-species variance-covariance matrix Z (r ) as a function of spatial distance or lag r between two samples. Spatial lags can be binned to avoid interpreting distance lags with low sample size and thus high uncertainty in the estimate of covariance, and covariances should not be interpreted at lags larger than half the maximum extent (Wagner 2003, Wagner and Fortin 2005) . The community variogram approach allows the following analyses:\nthese change with distance, and also the relative magnitude of CSA and ISA at a given distance.\n\u2022 At each distnace, negative and positive between-species covariances can be summarized separately, as a sum or average. This allows to asses the relative magnitude of positive (attraction) and negative (repulsion) ISA at a given distance.\nWe note that covariance calculated on binary data is closely algebraically tied to the Cseg or Ctog metrics and their scaled versions (Table 2) , which summarize only negative or positive covariances respectively. Another closely related metric is the ratio of total community variance to within-species variance (i.e. Cratio, Table 2 ), which should be 1 when species are independent. Similarly to covariance, the Cseg, Ctog and Cratio, as well as many of the other metrics from Tables 2 and 3, can be made distance-dependent and used in the community variogram framework. We also note that spatially implicit metrics are simply the weighted sum of spatially explicit metrics across all possible spatial lags in which the weights are equivalent to the number of samples separated by a given lag. Finally, the approach can easily be integrated into the joint species distribution models, as also demonstrated by Ovaskainen et al. (2017) .\nTo test for non-random patterns of spatial species covariance an appropriate null model is required. The distnce-dependent Cratio is typically used with a trivial null model of Cratio = 1 under species independence which can be biased in a number of different ways (Palmer and van der Maarel 1995) .\nIn particular, it can be biased by patterns of within-species clumping. Even if species are arranged independently on a landscape if they have strong patterns of within-species clumping they will appear to be spatially segregated at least up to the scale of the within-species clump size. Therefore, the most common type of null model is one in which the within-species spatial clumping is held constant but otherwise species are shuffled randomly (Palmer and van der Maarel 1995, Roxburgh and Chesson 1998) . Two R packages that allow calculation of community variograms are spacemakeR (Dray 2019) with the function variomultiv, and package vario (https://github.com/dmcglinn/vario) with the function vario.\nEven though the idea of community variograms has been featured in prominent methodological reviews (Dray et al. 2012) , and elements of it occasionally appear in empirical analyses , Seabloom et al. 2005 , Kikvidze et al. 2005 , Ovaskainen et al. 2017 , we are unaware of its direct use specifically for the purpose of estimating distance-dependent ISA. At the same time the method is the closest thing to the truly spatially-explicit description of ISA for community matrices with additional spatial coordinates, and we thus see potentially important applications."}, {"section_title": "Point pattern analysis", "text": "There is a suite of methods that capture various facets of ISA in data where exact position and species identity of every single individual within a spatial domain is known. These data, known as point patterns, are rich in detail, offering the most accurate and spatially explicit quantification of ISA, but are also costly to get and thus rare, and they have limits when applied to mobile organisms. Consequently, analyses of ISA based on point patterns are less common than analyses based on community matrices. Here we focus on bivariate pair correlation functions and P-M classification scheme (Wiegand et al. 2007b, Wiegand and Moloney 2014) .\nThe bivariate pair correlation function g12(r) measures the association between two species 1 and 2 at different spatial scales (Stoyan and Stoyan 1994, Wiegand et al. 2007b) ; it is the density of a second species at distance r of the typical individual of a first species, normalized with the overall density of the second species in the plot. Thus, positive association (attraction) occurs for g12(r) > 1 (larger than expected neighborhood density) and negative association (segregation) for g12(r) < 1 (smaller than expected neighborhood density). The g12(r) is particularly useful since it quantifies repulsion or attraction at each distance independently on other distances. Example studies that employ g12(r) are (Wiegand et al. 2007b , 2012 , Wang et al. 2010 ). The popular K-function K12(r) is the cumulative version of g12(r). The Z-scores of the point pattern summary functions are also sometimes used (Vel\u00e1zquez et al. 2016) ; popular software to calculate g12(r) and K12(r) be are Programita Moloney 2004, 2014) , and R package spatstat (pcfcross function) (Baddeley et al. 2016 ).\nThe P-M classification scheme visualizes pairwise spatial association between species at a given spatial scale r, using the Z-score of the cumulative neighbourhood density K12(r)/\u03c0r 2 as x-axis (Maxis) and the Z-score of the nearest neighbor distribution function D12(r) as y-axis (P-axis) (Getzin et al. 2014) . Because K12(r) and D12(r) capture fundamentally different aspects of ISA, the scheme allows for four ISA association categories: independence, segregation, partial overlap, and mixing. The scheme is best used to compare the overall ISA structure e.g., among tropical forests at a given spatial scale. It can be calculated using the Programita software Moloney 2004, 2014) , and we also offer an R implementation at https://github.com/petrkeil/spasm that relies heavily on the spatstat package (Baddeley et al. 2016) .\nNull models for point patterns. A well developed toolbox, summarized by Wiegand and Moloney (2014) , is available to those seeking to compare observed summary statistics [e.g. g12(r), K12(r), D12(r) ] with those expected under the null expectations of independence. These are based on breaking the association between species, while keeping all of the other properties of single-species point patterns intact. The simplest null model for independence is the toroidal shift where one entire pattern is displaced against the other by a random vector (and the points falling outside the plot are wrapped using torus geometry), with a more refined version based on pattern reconstruction (Wiegand et al. 2013 , Getzin et al. 2014 . Depending on the question, other null models can be used as well. For example, a heterogeneous point process where the individuals of pattern 2 are displaced only to random location within distance r of their original location. Here we note that particularly the heterogeneous point process null models (also combined with pattern reconstruction) should be appealing to all those seeking to estimate biotic interaction from mere occurrence data; notably, this can be done without actually having the environmental data at hand, but by assuming that the spatial distance of biotic interactions is shorter than the distance of environmental autocorrelation (Wiegand et al. 2007b ). Because in this null model points are displaced only within distance r of their original location they mey land in a similar environments. Null models for point patterns are implemented in Programita software Moloney 2004, 2014) and in the spatstat R package (Baddeley et al. 2016 )."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of the approaches", "text": "Here, we compare the performance of the approaches reviewed above when they are used on a common set of empirical and simulated communities. Our aim is to assess redundancy among the approaches, as well as their sensitivity to the common variables such as number of sites, number of species, magnitude of con-specific aggregation, or spatial grain. We are also interested in how well the different measures capture negative associations (i.e. segregation) as opposed to the positive"}, {"section_title": "Spatially implicit measures vs empirical data", "text": "Our goal in this first exercise was to calculate the common metrics of ISA for a set of real-world and spatially implicit species-by-site matrices, and to see how the metrics correlate with each other. We evaluated the metrics listed in Tables 2 and 3 using 290 empirical binary community matrices collated in , and 186 empirical abundance matrices collated in . We excluded matrices with too little information to allow meaningful calculation of all of the indices, or which gave negative or positive infinity values of some of the metrics. For the pairwise metrics, we averaged them over the species-by-species association matrix Z to obtain a single number comparable with the matrix-wise measures. We subjected the metrics to principal components analysis (PCA), for which we transformed some of them to have an approximately normal distribution. We plotted the PCA as an ordination biplot, and we also plotted a graph representation of the correlation matrix of the measures (Fig. 5) .\nIn both the incidence-and abundance-based spatially implicit indices we found clear differentiation along the PCA axes ( Fig. 5a, b ) and in the graph (Fig. 5c, d) , reflecting the different aspects of ISA that they were designed to capture. In binary metrics, there is a clear cluster dissimilarity-based indices (Cjacc, Csor), the Whittaker index (Cw), Alroy's index (Calroy), as well as its closely related connectance (Cconn) (Fig. 5 a, c, Fig. S1 ). Two measures that explicitly measure departure from Poisson randomness (CFETmP, Cforbes) grouped together. The classical C-score (CsegSc) and its counterpart, togetherness (CtogSc), the matching coefficient (Cmatch), the checkerboard score (Cchecker), and number of unique combinations (Ccombo) are to some degree unrelated to the rest of the metrics. In the abundance-based metrics, we found similar clustering of the dissimilarity-based ISA metrics (CAruz, CAbray, CAchi, CAhell) , while the correlation-based metrics (CAcor, CAcor_hell, CAtau) formed another group.\nNotably, among the incidence-based metrics only Ccombo is strongly correlated with the total number of sites in a matrix (n), while only Cchecker correlated strongly with the total number of species ( \u03b3) (Fig.   S2 ). Unsurprisingly, covariance-based measures (CAcov, CAcov_hell) grouped together with the total number of sites n. Among all the metrics several metrics are correlated with \u03b3, but none of them strongly ( Figure S2, S3 )."}, {"section_title": "Spatially implicit measures vs spatially explicit simulations", "text": "In the second exercise, we devised simulations with known magnitude of ISA between two species (Fig. 6, S4 , Appendix S2). We aimed to illustrate how the different approaches are able to recover this simulated ISA. In contrast to spatially implicit simulations performed in other studies (Gotelli 2000, Ulrich and , we simulated the position of every individual within a bounded domain. In each simulation, we generated point patterns of two species, with a given magnitude of ISA between them, and with varying con-specific aggregation and number of individuals per species (see Appendix S2 for details). See for an example use of the same simulation procedure.\nWe modelled ISA as dependent on spatial distance (Fig. 6b) , and it was controlled by a single parameter called simply ISA, with negative values for segregation (ISA < 0), zero for independence (ISA = 0), and positive for attraction (ISA > 0) (Fig. 6) . In order to calculate measures based on incidence or abundance, we converted the point patterns to grids of varying resolutions (grains). Across all simulations, we then measured performance of the metrics from Tables 2 and 3 as their Spearman correlation with the ISA parameter. We also examined how the performance was affected by spatial grain and magnitude of conspecific spatial aggregation (CSA) (Fig. S6, S7 ). Detailed description of the simulations, and their analysis, is in Appendix S2, and complete code for the exercise is at https://github.com/petrkeil/spasm.\nWe found the best correlation with overall ISA, as well as correlation with both negative ISA (attraction) and negative ISA (repulsion), in Pearson's tetrachoric correlation (Cpears), Forbes index (Cforbes), and the mid-P variant of Fisher's Exact Test (CFETmP) for binary data, and Spearman's correlation (CArho) and Hellinger distance (CAhell) for abundance data (Fig. 7) . The best overall Spearman correlations between the simulated ISA and its estimated measures were around 0.75 (Fig.  7) , an imperfection that we attribute to the inability of the spatially implicit measures to capture the distance-dependent part of ISA (Fig. 4, Fig. 6b ). We found no clear indication that either abundance or incidence-based metrics performed best. We also found that measures based on correlation (Cpears, CArho, CAcor, CAcov) , or on deviation from an expected null association (Cforbes, CFETmP) performed better in capturing ISA, while dissimilarity measures (Csor, Cjacc, CAbray, CAruz) performed worse. This is also in line with our supplementary analysis of Z-scores ( Figs. S6 and S7 ). We found that refining the spatial grain of the analysis, and increasing the magnitude of CSA, had both mostly negative or no effect on the performance of the metrics (Figs. S6 and S7) , although there were exceptions from the trend.\nImportantly, we found that the spatially implicit metrics tended to saturate at extreme negative (ISA < 10) association (Fig. S5) , most likely because the community matrices are identical above these extreme ISA values (demonstrated in Fig. 4) . Thus, most abundance-based metrics show weak overall correlation with repulsion ( Fig. 7b) , with the exception of the distance-based Ruzicka (CAruz) and percentage difference (CAbray) indices. Finally, we found that when the metrics were averaged at a given spatial grain, they varied dramatically in their relationship with grain (Fig. S8) , and this variation is difficult to interpret."}, {"section_title": "Spatially explicit measures vs spatially explicit simulations", "text": "Finally, we used the 2-species simulations to illustrate the idea of community variograms and pair correlation functions. Here, our goal was simply to show the potential of these methods, rather than to perform the same comprehensive evaluation as above, since these techniques do not measure ISA in a single number, but as a function of spatial distance r. Because of that, they have the potential to actually recover the shape of the entire probability density function f sp 2 (r ) from Figure 6b . For the spatially explicit techniques, we performed 9 simulations that correspond exactly to the panels of Figure 6a (the only difference is that we used 200 individuals per species). For the purpose of fitting the community variograms, we used a single grid resolution with 20 cells along each side of the simulated domain.\nCommunity variograms (Fig. 8a) estimated the relationship between distance r and negative covariance in a way that matched the shape of the original f sp 2 (r ) from Figure 6b . However, they had problem with accurately capturing the spatial pattern of attraction when there was a confounding effect of strong con-specific dispersion (CSA > 0.01), where the pattern was indistinguishable from independence. In contrast to community variograms, pair correlation functions more accurately estimated the distance-dependent ISA (compare Fig. 6b with Fig. 8a) , i.e. the estimated relationship between distance and pair correlation function closely matches the shape of the original f sp 2 (r ) from Figure 6b . Similarly to community variograms, there was a somewhat limited performance for attraction and high CSA values, but the problem is less severe. Overall, the point pattern-based bivariate pair correlation functions provided the most complete picture of the \"true\" simulated ISA pattern."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and recommendations", "text": "Based on the existing literature and our comparisons of the methods, we make several concrete recommendations for capturing ISA in the context of biodiversity."}, {"section_title": "Best indices", "text": "There is a variety of indices that were designed to capture different aspects of ISA and some of them may even be uncorrelated [see our results, but also ]. Thus, in empirical assessments, we recommend not to rely on a single metric [as also recommended by Ulrich and Gotelli (2013) ].\nOverall, we suggest that the most promising indices for spatially implicit analyses are those that can capture both negative and positive ISA. They should also offer the option to be eventually integrated into, or compared with, spatially explicit analyses such as community variograms, it should be possible to contrast them with indices of con-specific aggregation, and they should be applicable in association matrices of parametric joint species distribution models. For abundance data these are covariance (CAcov) and Pearson correlation (CAcor), coupled with a data transformation (e.g. Hellinger or log) if appropriate. For incidence data these are the C-score (Cseg, CsegSc) and togetherness (Ctog, CtogSc) which capture the positive and negative ISA respectively and are mathematically linked to covariance. We caution that that low C-score values do not indicate high togetherness, and vice versa. Thus, both should be employed, unless only one direction of ISA is specifically of interest.\nFrom the other indices for pairwise binary data, among the all-purpose metrics that capture both repulsion and attraction, we recommend the mid-P index (CFETmP), Forbes's coefficient of association (Cforbes), or Pearson's tetrachoric correlation (Cpears); the latter is also (with reservations) recommended by . Jaccard's index (Cjacc) is a good alternative, since it captures both negative and positive ISA, and it can easily interpreted as proportional overlap, although it may not reflect the overall ISA as accurately as the correlation-based indices. For pairwise abundance data, apart from covariance-and correlation-based parametric indices, we advocate for the Spearman rank-rank correlation (Crho), since it requires no prior transformation, and it captures well both negative and positive ISA.\nConcerning the community-wide measures that quantify the magnitude of ISA for all species in a single number, an obvious choice is to use summarized pairwise metrics, although one needs to beware that some summarizations (e.g. averaging) blend repulsions and attractions. Perhaps the best way to avoid this problem is to decompose the pairwise association matrix to positive vs negative ISA, by separately summarizing positive vs negative covariances in abundance data (this is also the approach used in community variograms), or by considering both togetherness and C-score in incidence data. Finally, we advise caution when using indices such as Whittaker's (Cw) or the related connectance (Cconn) because of their problematic interpretation which conflates ISA with beta diversity.\nspatial proximity of two species when they are already 100% spatially segregated (Fig. 4 ), a problem that will grow in severity as spatial resolution becomes finer. Ultimately, this problem will make the spatially implicit metrics meaningless at spatial grains that reach the size of an average individual, or when the data become point patterns. This partly explains why none of the examined spatially implicit metrics gave a perfect correlation with the simulated distance-dependent ISA, and why we observed the saturation of performance towards extreme values of ISA in our simulations (Fig. S5 ). This is a drawback of any analysis based purely on spatially implicit community matrices, even though the problem may be less severe at coarse spatial resolutions. We argue that there is only one way to address it systematically and conceptually: Whenever there is information on spatial position of the sites, indices of ISA are better considered as a function of spatial distance. Both the community variograms and point pattern analysis offer straightforward ways to do that.\nApart from being practical, going spatially explicit (when data permit) also makes ISA more biologically interpretable; after all, interspecific biotic interactions among individuals do happen over a certain distance. Thus, measuring ISA in a spatially explicit way can identify those distances over which the interactions matter. An added advantage of such an approach is that it also allows to separate ISA due to interactions vs environment, without the necessity of actually having the environmental data when it appears that fine-scale environmental heterogeneity is negligible (Wiegand et al. 2012) .\nOne specific application in which ignoring spatial distance is likely to result in severe consequences is Joint Species Distribution Modeling, or JSDM (Warton et al. 2015 , Ovaskainen et al. 2017 , Zurell et al. 2018 , where species-by-species covariances (or correlations) are estimated as model parameters, conditional on the species-environment relationships. We recommend that these covariance matrices also need to be conditional on spatial distance in order to avoid the saturation arising from strong ISA. One specific implementation of such an approach is offered through hierarchical parametric models of Ovaskainen et al. (2017) ."}, {"section_title": "Spatial scale", "text": "Most of the commonly studied facets of biodiversity depend on spatial scale. In the case of ISA, scale has been approached from two angles. The first focuses on ISA as a function of the average area of a site in a community matrix, which is equivalent to spatial resolution (grain) of a grid (\u00d8kland 1994 , Hui 2009 , Segurado et al. 2012 , Ara\u00fajo and Rozenfeld 2013 , McNickle et al. 2018 . These studies show that ISA is grain-dependent, but neither theory nor empirical observations predict a systematic direction of the grain dependence; ISA-area relationships can be increasing, decreasing, or humpshaped. One thing that complicates consensus is the use of various metrics of ISA across studies. Our simulations (Fig. S8) show that selection of the ISA metric critically affects the grain dependency; for example, Z-scores of abundance-based metrics may have hump-shaped relationship with grain (e.g. Zscore of CAbray), while raw binary dissimilarity may monotonically increase or decrease with grain ( Fig. S8) . This is something that the field needs to sort out before any empirical scaling of ISA is explored and interpreted.\nThe second approach to spatial scaling of ISA uses distance instead of grain in the form of community variograms or bivariate pair correlation functions (Wagner 2003, Wiegand and Moloney 2014) . One advantage of this approach is its straightforward biological interpretation, particularly in the context of biotic interactions, since spatial distance is the ultimate condition for interactions (grain is only proximate). In other words, most ecologists will understand that species interact over a certain distance, but might be puzzled by the statement that they interact at a given grain.\nLuckily, both the grain-based and distance-based approaches to the scaling of ISA can be combined in a single analysis [see Wiegand et al. (2012) ]. Finally, point-pattern analysis has theory that links the area-based with the distance-based approaches to ISA (Wiegand and Moloney 2014) . Future investigations of ISA should more explicitly embrace the issue of scale (both the grain and perhaps also extent) by focusing on the ISA-area relationships (Ara\u00fajo and Rozenfeld 2013, McNickle et al. 2018) , or by focusing on the spatially explicit approaches to ISA which handle scale more naturally than the spatially implicit ones."}, {"section_title": "Null models and Z-scores", "text": "Most of the literature on ISA emphasizes the importance of null models and null expectations, be it spatially implicit (Ulrich and Gotelli 2013) or explicit (Wiegand and Moloney 2014) . The most common use of these is to get to statistical significance of the observed ISA, and to standardize the metrics so that they are comparable across different ecological situations or studies. In Figures S6 and  S7 , we show that transforming ISA indices to Z-scores makes them more robust against the confounding effects of conspecific aggregation or varying resolution, while (Ulrich et al. 2018) show that null models also account for the confounding effect of total species richness ( \u03b3). The same sentiment underlies Wiegand and Moloney's (2014) book: to analyze spatially explicit patterns of ISA, one has to contrast them against a null expectation of no ISA. However, one needs to bear in mind that when Z-scores and null models are used, they tend to converge to the same value, irrespective of the original meaning of the metric ; in a way, the meaning of the null model overrides the meaning of the index. Thus, when null models are deployed, we recommend that users know their ecological interpretation exactly.\nSince null models often involve intense randomization algorithms, they may be computationally demanding, particularly when used in large-scale macroecological analyses of biodiversity. Luckily, there are analytical shortcuts for some of the approaches. For example, in spatially implicit methods, if computational efficiency is desirable, measures such as CFETmP or Cforbes already have the deviation from the expected randomness implicit in their definition."}, {"section_title": "Measuring macroecological patterns of ISA", "text": "Finally, we return to the main point of this paper, which is the premise that patterns of ISA is an important standalone facet of biodiversity that is on par with macroecological classics such as species richness or beta diversity. We have demonstrated that ISA is at least partly independent of these other facets. Thus, in order to empirically document patterns of ISA, and their generality or variation over broad spatial and temporal scales, we need analytical approaches designed specifically to measure ISA with the kind of data available over broad scales. From all of the reviewed approaches, we see community variograms as the most useful, since:\n(1) Community variograms are spatially explicit, thus they avoid the pitfalls of the spatially implicit indices mentioned above, offering rich biological interpretation.\n(2) Community variograms are applicable to a wide range of data types, including systematic continental surveys such as the US North American Breeding Bird Survey, metacommunity data in databses such as PREDICTS, BioTime or CESTES (Newbold et al. 2015 , Jeliazkov 2019 , Blowes et al. 2019 , regional gridded atlases such as the Atlas Florae Europaeae, and global grids such as the the IUCN red list data. In contrast, point pattern analysis has highly specific requirements on data format, limiting its use to a small number of local plots with limited spatial extent.\n(3) Calculation of community variograms is computationally feasible.\nGiven that there is an ever increasing availability of biodiversity data from large spatial extents (Jetz et al. 2012) , we see an exciting opportunity here for exploration of empirical macroecological patterns of ISA, particularly through community variograms.

Apart from its connection to biotic interactions, ISA can also provide a benchmark for judging different types of ecological theories, and it can serve as a summary statistic capturing a unique property of nature. This is underscored by the fact that many of the biodiversity statistics that have been monitored are insensitive to ISA.\nWe provide an overview of the main approaches to measure ISA, which we sorted into three main schools of thought, based on the data that they use: spatially implicit indices, community variograms, and bivariate pair correlation functions. Our main conclusion is that considering space, and particularly spatial distance, is vital for the progress of the field, and for any broad-scale assessment of patterns of ISA in geographic space and in time. In all, we hope that our overview of ISA, its measures, and its utility provides a starting point for researchers interested in broadening the scope of biodiversity facets that they study, as well as a new inspiration for those who have already studied ISA. Among these, we turn to two kinds of researchers for whom our review seems particularly relevant: The first are those working in the emerging field of joint species distribution models (JSDM), where spatial distance has rarely been considered, and which still rely mostly on spatially implicit covariances and correlations.

(b) Truncated exponential probability density function [ f sp 2 (r ) ] describes how likely is to observe an individual of sp2 at a given distance from any individual of sp1. This f sp 2 (r ) is convenient since its shape depends on a single parameter (here called ISA) which represents various magnitudes of inter-specific repulsion (left) and attraction (right) and their relationship with distance.

Panel (a) shows overall correlation between the true ISA and the metric. Panels (b) and (c) show the correlation when only inter-specific repulsion is considered (ISA < 0) or when only positive attraction is considered (ISA > 0). Given are absolute values of Spearman correlation coefficient. Note that some metrics very well separate negative from positive associations (i.e. they have good correlation with overall ISA), but within these two categories they have weak correlation with the underlaying ISA parameter, e.g. covariance-based measures (CAcov, CAcov_hell) . See Fig. S5 for details of these relationships. Figure S1 Temporal trends in sub-fields of biodiversity science. Y-axis shows the total number of papers published in a given year that are listed on Clarivate Web of Science, and that contain the search given term AND biodiversity. Note the log10 scale of the y-axis. Left plot (red lines) shows terms related to general notion of association and interaction among species. Second to the left plot (blue lines) shows terms associated with classical biodiversity patterns in space and time. Second to the right plot (green lines) shows terms specifically related to ISA.
