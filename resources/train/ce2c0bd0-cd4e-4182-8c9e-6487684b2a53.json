[{"section_title": "FOREWORD", "text": "The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to assess the quantity and quality of the earth resources of the Nation and to provide information that will assist resource managers and peacemakers at Federal, State, and local levels in making sound decisions. Assessment of water-quality conditions and trends is an important part of this overall mission.\nOne of the greatest challenges faced by waterresources scientists is acquiring reliable information that will guide the use and protection of the Nation's water resources. That challenge is being addressed by Federal, State, interstate, and local water-resource agencies and by many academic institutions. These organizations are collecting water-quality data for a host of purposes that include: compliance with permits and water-supply standards; development of remediation plans for a specific contamination problem; operational decisions on industrial, wastewater, or watersupply facilities; and research on factors that affect water quality. An additional need for water-quality information is to provide a basis on which regional and national-level policy decisions can be based. Wise decisions must be based on sound information. As a society we need to know whether certain types of water-quality problems are isolated or ubiquitous, whether there are significant differences in conditions among regions, whether the conditions are changing over time, and why these conditions change from place to place and over time. The information can be used to help determine the efficacy of existing water-quality policies and to help analysts determine the need for and likely consequence of new policies.\nTo address these needs, the Congress appropriated funds in 1986 for the USGS to begin a pilot program in seven project areas to develop and refine the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. In 1991, the USGS began full implementation of the program. The NAWQA Program builds upon an existing base of water-quality studies of the USGS, as well as those of other Federal, State, and local agencies. The objectives of the NAWQA Program are to:\nDescribe current water-quality conditions for a large part of the Nation's freshwater streams, rivers, and aquifers.\nDescribe how water quality is changing over time.\nImprove understanding of the primary natural and human factors that affect water-quality conditions. This information will help support the development and evaluation of management, regulatory, and monitoring decisions by other Federal, State, and local agencies to protect, use, and enhance water resources.\nThe goals of the NAWQA Program are being achieved through ongoing and proposed investigations of 60 of the Nation's most important river basins and aquifer systems, which are referred to as study units. These study units are distributed throughout the Nation and cover a diversity of hydrogeologic settings. More than two-thirds of the Nation's freshwater use occurs within the 60 study units and more than two-thirds of the people served by public water-supply systems live within their boundaries.\nNational synthesis of data analysis, based on aggregation of comparable information obtained from the study units, is a major component of the program. This effort focuses on selected water-quality topics using nationally consistent information. Comparative studies will explain differences and similarities in observed water-quality conditions among study areas and will identify changes and trends and their causes. The first topics addressed by the national synthesis are pesticides, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, and aquatic biology. Discussions on these and other waterquality topics will be published in periodic summaries of the quality of the Nation's ground and surface water as the information becomes available.\nThis report is an element of the comprehensive body of information developed as part of the NAWQA Program. The program depends heavily on the advice, cooperation, and information from many Federal, State, interstate, Tribal, and local agencies and the public. The assistance and suggestions of all are greatly appreciated.\nRobert M.

Land-use maps and estimates of water use by irrigated agriculture were needed for Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka Counties (south-central Idaho), four of the most intensively irrigated counties in the study unit. Land use in the four counties was mapped from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery data for the 1992 water year using the SPECTRUM computer program. Land-use data were field verified in 108 randomly selected sections (640 acres each); results compared favorably with land-use maps from other sources. Water used for irrigation during the 1992 water year was estimated using landuse and ancillary data. In 1992, a drought year, estimated irrigation withdrawals in the four counties were about 2.9 million acre-feet of water. Of the 2.9 million acre-feet, an estimated 2.12 million acre-feet of water was withdrawn from surface water, mainly the Snake River, and nearly 776,000 acre-feet was withdrawn from ground water. One-half of the 2.9 million acre-feet of water withdrawn for irrigation was considered to be lost during conveyance or was returned to the Snake River; the remainder was consumptively used by crops during the growing season."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 1991, the upper Snake River Basin (USNK) was selected as one of the first 20 National WaterQuality Assessment (NAWQA) study units. Land-and water-use data were used to describe activities that could potentially affect water quality, including biological conditions, in the basin. Data were used to describe water quality and biological conditions in (1) drainages upstream from surface-water-quality sample sites, (2) areas of ground-water-quality land-use studies, and (3) stream habitats (Clark, 1994; Rupert, 1994; Maret, 1995; Maupin, 1995) .\nDescriptive and comprehensive land-and wateruse data were acquired and summarized during the first 2 years of the USNK NAWQA study. Land-use data acquired from the Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS) represent conditions in the mid-1970 's (U.S. Geological Survey, 1986 and were the only available land-use data that included the whole study unit. However, GIRAS data have land-use classification errors. Water-use data for 1990 were available from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS). Important data from this source were ground-and surface-water Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumptive use of water in Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka Counties ( fig. 1 ).

The counties cover almost 3,300 mi2 (Idaho Department of Commerce, 1996) . About 1,054 mi2 is classified as irrigated cropland and pasture (U.S. Geological Survey, 1986) . In 1990, almost 14 percent of the total irrigation withdrawals in the USNK occurred in these four counties. A typical growing season in the vicinity of Rupert and Twin Falls is about 130 days, which begins in early March and extends to mid-or late October (Doug Doctor, Bureau of Reclamation, oral commun., 1996) .\nThe study area is from 2,600 to slightly less than 6,400 ft above sea level ( fig. 2) . The highest part, Mount Bennett Hills, is composed of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The Snake River defines the southern boundary of the study area, and between Shoshone Falls and King Hill, the river is entrenched in a canyon as much as 700 ft deep. Generally flat lands, used mostly for agriculture, compose the central and eastern parts of the study area; large basalt flows, with little or no vegetation, are located in northern Minidoka County.\nAnnual temperatures average about 50\u00b0F (Bureau of Reclamation, 1994) throughout the study area, and mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 10 to 20 in.

Land-use data developed by the Consortium reflect the diverse needs of each program. Figure 4 depicts the organizational structure of the Consortium. Jennings (1996) The MRLC Consortium oversees a cooperative agreement between member agencies and the USGS EROS (Earth Resources Observation Systems) Data Center (EDC) in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. EDC supplied the resources for preprocessing, spectral clustering (see Landsat Imagery Data section), ancillary data acquisition, data distribution, and archival of the massive collection of TM data. The preprocessed data are copyrighted by the EOS AT Company and are to be used only by MRLC Consortium agencies in their respective programs. No distribution of these data is allowed. However, clustered and formatted data (see Clustering and Formatting section) are public domain and may be freely distributed for only the cost of reproduction and handling. The clustered and formatted data are designed to be used with SPECTRUM software.\nThe NAWQA Program provided information to the MRLC Consortium to guide the acquisition of TM data that would be best suited for land-use classification of agricultural lands. TM data were acquired for the 1991-93 growing seasons to enable discrimination of agricultural land from other land uses; the 1992 growing season was given highest priority. If available, multitemporal data were acquired within the same growing season. These data provided more descriptive information for crop identification. Through the MRLC Consortium, the NAWQA Program supplied each study unit with TM data, software, and assistance in classifying land uses. TM data were provided to the study units with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Typically, DEM data are organized by areas shown on 1:250,000-scale quadrangle maps (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987); EDR combined into one file all the DEM data associated with a TM scene."}, {"section_title": "LANDSAT IMAGERY DATA", "text": "Landsat sensors measure reflective and emitted energy from the Earth's surface as visible, near-infrared, middle-infrared, and thermal-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. Landsat TM bands 1 through 7 are associated with different wavelengths in the spectrum (fig. 5), and satellite sensors measure and record each band in a TM scene. A TM scene covers approximately 71 x 69 mi. Data for all bands, except band 6 (not used in this study), are collected at a spatial resolution of about 98 x 98 ft and are called pixels, or picture elements.\nThe USNK NAWQA study unit received 11 preprocessed TM scenes from EDC; all but one were single-date scenes. The scene that covers the four-county study area ( fig. 6 ) was recorded in July 1992 and, therefore, depicted crops that were emergent and fairly well established. Preprocessing at EDC included the removal of errors from the scene; mostly missing data were interpreted and terrain corrections were made. Standardized procedures were used to correct errors (Jensen, 1986, p. 95) . Terrain correction, using DEM data, and geometric corrections, using l:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1989) were done by EDC."}, {"section_title": "Clustering", "text": "EDC grouped the TM data into 240 clusters (groups of data based on similar spectral response) using a program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico (Kelly and White, written commun., 1994). The program randomly selected pixels in a systematic manner and grouped them using the k-means clustering algorithm. During each iteration, an increasing number of pixels were selected from the TM data, and the mean value for each of the six bands was computed. As more pixels were added, a clearer representation of the clusters was defined. When the process was finished, 240 clusters were defined, and a mean value was calculated for each band in each cluster. Finally, each pixel from the original TM data was assigned to the cluster for which band values were most similar. When the clustering process was finished, the size of the file used in the SPECTRUM computer program was about one-seventh the size of the original TM data set. The data set was then written to a file that was specially formatted to be read by the SPECTRUM computer program."}, {"section_title": "Analysis Using SPECTRUM Computer Program", "text": "The SPECTRUM computer program is an imageclassification system that associates clustered TM data to a land-use classification scheme through interactive Landsat Imagery Dataprocesses in a menu-driven environment. The SPEC-TRUM program will read the clustered and formatted TM data and display them with an associated, predetermined land-use classification list. Pixels may be selected in a display window and assigned to land-use categories that best describe the area. The clustered nature of the TM data allows land-use categories to be assigned systematically throughout the whole TM scene. For example, when a pixel is selected and defined as a certain land-use category, all other pixels that belong to that cluster automatically are chosen and defined as well. Many clusters (and therefore, pixels) may belong to one land-use category, and clusters may be redefined from one category to another. may be classified using the information that is available in multitemporal TM scenes. The SPECTRUM program was able to map only agricultural, forest, range, and urban lands; rock; and water. The SPECTRUM program was able to divide agricultural lands into two categories center pivot and other irrigated lands because center-pivot irrigation systems were easily recognizable.\nAfter the SPECTRUM program classified the TM scene, a file was written that explained the association between the land-use categories and the 240 clusters. The file was read into a geographic information system (GIS) to further refine the land-use classifications, plot field-verification maps, and display the final products. The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1989) contain the township, range, and section numbers for each county and were used to help determine areas where field verification would be conducted."}, {"section_title": "Field Verification", "text": "A computer program designed by Scott (1990) was used to randomly select, for field verification, a sample of 10 percent of the sections (1 mi x 1 mi, or 640 acres) in which part or all of the section was classified by the SPECTRUM program as agricultural land. A random sample of only sections with agricultural land was necessary to determine the effectiveness of the SPECTRUM program and to later estimate irrigation water use. Field verification included a drive-by survey and photographic documentation of land and water use in 108 sections in the four counties ( fig. 7) . Field verification occurred during a 2-week period in late May and early June 1996.\nA standardized form ( fig. 8 ), USGS 7.5-minute orthophoto quadrangle maps, and methods similar to those used by Zelt and others (1995) were used to (1) verify land-use classifications from the SPEC-TRUM program, (2) determine type of irrigation systems, and (3) identify specific crops in each section. Orthophoto maps were used because crop boundaries and landmark features are easily discernible. No efforts were made to compensate for orthophoto maps that were older than the TM data (1992); however, most orthophoto maps were more recent than 1987.\nLand-use boundaries and codes were plotted and labeled on transparent film and registered to the orthophoto maps. Section boundaries were outlined on the transparent film to help the surveyors locate sections to be field verified. In the field, surveyors documented the correctness and accuracy of the land-use classifications by making any changes to the boundaries plotted on the transparent film and, if necessary, receding land uses with codes listed on the standardized form ( fig. 8) . Accuracy of the land-use classifications was determined using a transparent grid overlay (100 squares per section). For each section, the surveyor determined the percentage of land correctly classified and gave it a ranking of \"very good,\" \"moderate,\" \"fair,\" \"poor,\" or \"terrible\" (fig. 8) . Additionally, the surveyor noted irrigation-system types and tabulated the percentage of land serviced by each type. If crops were planted and emergent, crop types were noted and mapped. At least two photographs were taken at each section using 35-mm (millimeter) color film to document crops, irrigation systems, and any unusual water-conveyance techniques. Additional comments and notes were recorded in the \"NOTES/ COMMENTS\" section on the form."}, {"section_title": "AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE CLASSIFICATION", "text": "About 691,000 acres was classified as agricultural land using SPECTRUM, about 33 percent of the total land area in the four counties ( fig. 9 ). The total amount of agricultural lands mapped using SPECTRUM was within 95 percent of the total agricultural lands mapped by the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) (Idaho Department of Water Resources, 1996) and within about 89 percent of 1992 Census of Agriculture enumerations (Idaho Department of Commerce, 1996) . All lands classified as agricultural were presumed to be irrigated, but not all of the agricultural lands were irrigated cropland. For instance, pasturelands were not considered irrigated cropland but were irrigated and, therefore, were included in the agricultural classification.\nSummary statistics from field-verified sections produced a mean accuracy rating of \"moderate\"; on average, 76 to 90 percent of each field-verified section was classified correctly. A comparison between the acreages of agricultural lands from SPECTRUM, GIRAS, and BOR maps indicated that the methods and results were reasonable.\nAbout 10 percent of land classified as agricultural was different between GIRAS and BOR maps and the SPECTRUM map. Shaded areas in figure 10 indicate where agricultural lands were classified differently.

Most land-use differences between GIRAS and SPEC-TRUM maps were along the fringes of agricultural lands. More agricultural land was mapped in all four counties by SPECTRUM than by GIRAS; 17 percent more in Gooding County, 7 percent more in Lincoln County, and 10 percent more in Jerome and Minidoka Counties. Some of the differences can be attributed to an increase in agricultural land between the 1970's, represented by the GIRAS map, and 1992, represented by the SPECTRUM map."}, {"section_title": "IRRIGATION SYSTEMS: OK IF NOT THERE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TERRIBLE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Irrigation system", "text": "Likewise, more agricultural land was mapped in all four counties by SPECTRUM than by BOR; 15 percent more in Gooding County, 12 percent more in Lincoln County, and about 10 percent more in Jerome and Minidoka Counties. The BOR map was derived using 1987 aerial photography (l:40,000-scale) and 7.5-minute quadrangle maps that were photoreduced to a scale of 1:40,000. Agricultural land uses were delineated from the photography onto the quadrangle maps; randomly selected sample areas were field checked in 1992 and revised in 1996. Therefore, differences in percentage of agricultural land can be attributed mostly to different data collection methods and, to a lesser degree, different source data.\nAlthough land-use changes were small in most sections that were field verified, land use changed more than 80 percent in others. For example, field verification revealed freshly plowed fields and a newly installed center-pivot sprinkler system in one section in Jerome County (J092016, Appendix A). The land-use change doubled the agricultural acres for the section and, accordingly, reduced the rangeland acreage. Land use in fieldverified sections is listed in Appendix A. The comparison among percentages of rangeland, agricultural land, and other land-use acreages determined using SPEC-TRUM and results from field-verified sections are shown in table 1.\nMore agricultural land consistently was classified with SPECTRUM than was recorded in the field verification because some fenced and grazed rangeland appeared similar to certain types of agricultural land in the SPECTRUM classification process. Also, multitemporal TM data were not available, which would have allowed for distinction between certain crops and rangeland. Comparisons among SPECTRUM maps, field-verification data, and BOR maps have been useful in correcting misclassified areas.\nClassifications using SPECTRUM correlated best with field-verification sections in Gooding County, where total acreages of agricultural land corresponded with more than 95 percent of acreages determined with SPECTRUM. In Minidoka County, rangeland acreage determined with SPECTRUM was only one-half that in field-verified sections; consequently, agricultural-land acreages were overclassified. Areas classified as agricultural land in all counties may include small tracts of rangeland, and agricultural lands were favored in the SPECTRUM classification process. In parts of some counties, especially Gooding and parts of Jerome Counties, fields with crops were small and often were interspersed with homesteads and pastures. SPECTRUM was unable to distinguish pastureland from cropland where land use was patchy. However, differentiation of irrigated pasture from cropland was necessary to best estimate water use in each county. Therefore, the homestead and pasture categories (Pi and A, respectively) were added to the field form ( fig. 8 ) to determine the percentage of pasture and homestead land uses in each section.\nField-verification measurements for these two categories provided a means to differentiate irrigated land in pastures and yards from major agricultural crops. Homesteads were interpreted in the field as areas occupied by farmhouses, yards and gardens, barns and surrounding equipment yards, and small corrals and stock pens. Typically, less than 5 percent of each fieldverified section was occupied by homesteads. The percentage of pastureland varied by county and ranged from 19 percent in Lincoln County to 7 percent in Minidoka County. In final tabulations, land used for pasture and agriculture was combined to obtain total irrigated acres.\nThe anticipated application of the maps from SPECTRUM was limited because multitemporal TM data were not provided. Multitemporal data are two TM scenes, taken at different times during the growing season. Different stages of crop development are more accurately depicted from multitemporal TM data and, therefore, crop-type distinctions are possible. For this study area, SPECTRUM was unable to differentiate specific crop types because the single-date TM scene was basically a \"snapshot\" of the growing season. The only determination that was possible was one that distinguished between any type of agricultural land (pasture, crop, homesteads) and rock, water, rangeland, or urban lands. If multitemporal TM data had been provided, crop types could have been determined and more accurate land-use maps developed. Similarly, the single-date TM data limited the use of the maps for wateruse estimations.

Consumptive-use estimates were based on acreages and crop consumptive irrigation requirement (CIR) values. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Statistics Service (ASS), provided specific crop acreages; pasture acres were derived from the National Resources Inventory (NRI) data base (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1994). Land-use acreages from SPECTRUM were not used because SPEC-TRUM was unable to differentiate specific crop types. The following sections describe the methods used to make estimates of irrigation water use."}, {"section_title": "Consumptive Use", "text": "Consumptive use is the amount of water (in inches) that a healthy, well-watered crop evapotranspires (ET) during the growing season. Summer months in the USNK are hot and dry, and during the 1992 growing season, very little precipitation was available for plant use. Therefore, CIR were assumed to equal the amount of water needed for crop ET. CIR values from the BOR Agricultural Meteorological (AgriMet) stations (McVay, 1992; Gardiner, 1994) were used with crop and pasture acreages to estimate total CU in acrefeet for each county.\nAgriMet weather stations in and near the study area are located at Rupert and Twin Falls, Idaho ( fig. 1) . The stations are equipped with sensors that automatically monitor and relay information such as air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation. Data are transmitted digitally via a satellite relay to the BOR regional office in Boise, Idaho, and are used in the 1982 Wright-modified Penman equation to calculate CIR for different crops (Powers, 1992) . CIR values from the Twin Falls station were used for Gooding and Jerome Counties; values from the Rupert station were used for Lincoln and Minidoka Counties (table 2) .\nThe eight largest crops (pasture is not considered a crop) in the study area in 1992 were, in descending order: wheat, alfalfa, barley, sugar beets, potatoes, beans, corn, and oats (table 3) . Three-fourths of the wheat in the study area was grown in Jerome and Minidoka Counties, and almost two-thirds of the alfalfa was grown in Gooding and Jerome Counties. Barley, sugar beets, and potatoes were large crops in Minidoka County. Almost half of Lincoln County crop acreages were planted with wheat and alfalfa.\nTotal consumptive use for the crops in 1992 was about 1.43 million acre-ft of water. In all counties except Minidoka, alfalfa, pasture, and wheat accounted for the three largest consumptive-use estimates. The three largest consumptive-use estimates in Minidoka County were for wheat, sugar beets, and barley (table 4). "}, {"section_title": "Surface-and Ground-Water Withdrawals", "text": "Most irrigation water is withdrawn from the Snake River near Minidoka Dam and at Milner Dam ( fig. 1 ). Surface-water diversions for irrigation usually begin in mid-March or early April and end in early to mid-October (Idaho Department of Water Resources, 1992, Appendix F). Streamflow records for the Snake River near Minidoka show an increase in flow in midMarch when irrigation withdrawals for Minidoka County begin; concurrently, streamflow at Milner Dam decreases substantially when diversions to the north and south reduce the flow to nearly zero ( fig. 11 ). Streamflow at King Hill shows the effects of recharge from springs along the north canyon wall, between Milner Dam and King Hill, irrigation-return flows from northand south-side irrigated lands, and flow from the Malad River.\nThe 1992 water year (October 1, 1991 , to September 30, 1992 was one of the lowest on record in terms of streamflow. Below-normal precipitation the previous 4 years resulted in depleted water reserves in the reservoir system and diminished flows in the Snake, Big Wood, and Little Wood Rivers. Diversions for irrigation were below normal, and some irrigation needs were not met. Surface-water diversions northward from the Snake River were measured and reported by the Idaho Department of Water Resources (1992) and totaled 1.7 million acre-ft (table 5), whereas in previous years, diversions were closer to 2.0 million acre-ft. Part of the diversions southward from the Snake River are reported with the Minidoka Irrigation District diversion; only quantities of water diverted to the north, however, are included in table 5. Surface-water diversions from the Big Wood and Little Wood Rivers, which supply water to northern parts of Gooding and Lincoln Counties, were measured in 1992 at 340,000 acre-ft (R. Lutz, Idaho Department of Water Resources, written commun., 1996). Therefore, total surface-water diversions in the study area were about 2.08 million acre-ft during the 1992 water year.\nMeasured surface-water diversions are most desirable for determining the surface-water irrigation water use. Estimated surface-water withdrawals from this report were compared to the aforementioned measured withdrawals to determine the accuracy of estimation methods. However, there were no available groundwater measurements with which to compare estimated ground-water withdrawals. Withdrawals for groundand surface-water irrigation in the study area were estimated using the following equation: \nwhere W A S = total irrigation water withdrawal for a county, in acre-feet; CIR = consumptive irrigation requirement for a particular crop, in inches; = acres of a particular crop in a county; = ground-or surface-water-irrigated lands, as a percentage of total irrigated acres in a county; and L = irrigation-system efficiency for groundor surface-water-irrigated lands, based on the type of irrigation systems in a county, expressed as a decimal percentage."}, {"section_title": "CU = CIR", "text": "x A 1 12, in acre-feet, and CL =W-CU.\nWithdrawals were estimated separately for surface-and ground-water-irrigated agricultural land because irrigation-system efficiencies differ for each.

Surface-water withdrawals were estimated to be about 2.12 million acre-ft, mostly diverted from the Snake River; ground-water withdrawals were estimated to be nearly 776,000 acre-ft, mostly pumped in Minidoka County. Estimated surface-water withdrawals exceeded measured withdrawals by about 40,000 acre-ft."}, {"section_title": "Conveyance Losses", "text": "The efficiency of an irrigation system reflects its ability to effectively transport water from the point of diversion to the place of use. Conveyance losses include leakage through the bottoms and sides of canals, irriga- tion-return flows, water use by phreatophytes along canal banks, and deep percolation; specific values for the different types of conveyance losses were not estimated in this study. Most irrigation water was diverted from surface-water sources, conveyed in canals, and distributed by sprinkler systems. Irrigation water from ground-water sources was usually transported through closed pipes and sprinkled directly on crops. Irrigation systems that use surface water were estimated to have an irrigation-system efficiency of 42 percent (Brockway and Claiborn, 1975, p. 32) . Irrigation systems that use ground water were estimated to have an irrigation-system efficiency of 70 percent (Frenzel, 1985, p. 224) . Irrigation systems have become more efficient since these studies were published; therefore, efficiency values used to estimate irrigation water use in this report may be smaller than actual efficiency values.\nConveyance losses (equation 1) were estimated to be 1.46 million acre-ft, or just over one-half of the total estimated withdrawals in the study area. Surfacewater-irrigated land in Minidoka County is localized in the southern part of the county, and water diverted from the Snake River at Minidoka Dam travels through a relatively compact network of canals. Ground-water-irrigated land in Minidoka County is north of the surfacewater-irrigated land, and conveyance losses are minimal (Brockway and Claiborn, 1975; Alien and Brockway, 1979; Jeff Bohr, A & B Irrigation District, written commun., 1992) . In contrast, irrigated lands in Jerome County are more dispersed, and water travels greater distances between points of diversion and irrigated fields. Surface water diverted at Milner Dam can travel as far as 50 mi in the mostly unlined North Side Main Canal, allowing for conveyance losses along the way. Much of the irrigated land in Gooding County receives Snake River water from the Milner-Gooding Canal, which stretches more than 100 mi from Milner Dam across the open expanses of rangeland and basalt flows of the Snake River Plain."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Land-and water-use information was used to estimate irrigation withdrawals in the upper Snake River Basin NAWQA study unit. As part of the NAWQA Program, new land-use data were obtained using Thematic Mapper satellite imagery and the SPECTRUM computer program. Four intensively irrigated counties (Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka in south-central Idaho) that coincide with other NAWQA surface-and ground-water and biological study areas were mapped. Rangeland, agricultural land, and other land uses were mapped and compared with land-use data from other sources using GIS techniques. During the summer of 1996, the land-use data were verified in the field for 108 randomly selected sections of 640 acres each in the four-county area. Results of landuse mapping and field verification were favorable in comparison with land-use data from other sources but proved to be less than adequate for water-use estimations because of SPECTRUM'S inability to identify specific crop types. Other data eventually were used to estimate irrigation water use for the largest crops and pasturelands in the four counties.\nWater-use estimates for consumptive uses, irrigation withdrawals, and conveyance losses were derived from acreages, crop irrigation requirements, and irrigation-system efficiencies. During the 1992 water year, an estimated 2.9 million acre-ft of water was needed to meet consumptive use and conveyance losses. However, the 1992 water year was the peak of a drought that left some farmers with a less-than-adequate water supply. Estimated surface-water withdrawals for irrigation (2.12 million acre-ft) exceeded measured withdrawals (2.08 million acre-ft). Surface-water withdrawals in previous normal water years ranged from 1.7 to 2.0 million acre-ft. Of the estimated 2.9 million acre-ft withdrawn for irrigation (surface and ground water), nearly one-half was lost in conveyance (mostly canal leakage and irrigation-return flow), and the remainder was consumptively used by crops during the growing season.
