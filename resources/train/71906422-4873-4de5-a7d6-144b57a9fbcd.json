[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The disease caused by a coronavirus that recently emerged in Wuhan, China (He et al., 2020) is now known as COVID-19. Most patients with COVID-19 have a respiratory illness with flu-like symptoms including cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Some have pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure, and a few die (Huang et al., The COVID-19 outbreak started a few weeks before the Chinese Spring Festival, which usually occurs in January or February on the Gregorian calendar. In 2020 it was celebrated January 24-30.\nEach year around the time of that festival, many Chinese people visit their ancestral homes and some people from outside China visit the country for sightseeing and to celebrate the start of the lunar year. In 2020, that seasonal increase in travel exacerbated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within China and also to countries and territories outside China. The worldwide pandemic was recognized as such on March 11, 2020, after more than 118,000 cases had been reported in 110 countries and there was judged to be a sustained risk of further global spread ). As of mid-March, 146 countries were affected, 154,000 people had been infected, and 5,700 fatalities had been recorded. In absolute terms, the number of cases was very high in China (81,048 cases), followed by Italy trans-national phenomena regarding how economic activity is associated with the spread of the disease and with the resulting burdens on healthcare systems. The findings from such analysis can also be used by policy makers, international organizations, and bilateral agencies to allocate resources for the control of the epidemic according to income-defined groups. We therefore describe the worldwide distribution of the numbers of cases and deaths by country and by country-level income status; describe trends in the numbers of cases and deaths; and examine how country-level income status is associated with COVID-19 case-fatality rate and with the numbers of cases and deaths per million population in the first five months of the pandemic. For that purpose we consider each country's income status, using the World Bank's approach, classifying countries into high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income groups (Fantom and Umar 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Two sources of publicly available data were used. First, data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in all affected countries were downloaded from the Our World in Data (OWID) website. The OWID's data on cases and deaths come from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; data on testing were collected from formal reports of countries by the data team of OWID; data on other variables came from the United Nations, the World Bank, the Global Burden of Disease Collaborative (OWID data 2020 a ).\nSecond, data classifying countries by their income status were downloaded from the World Bank website and incorporated into the master dataset. The countries were classified according to the World Bank classification of countries by income, which has been used since 1989. It divides countries into four groups -low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income -using gross national income per capita valued annually in US dollars using a three-year average exchange rate.\nThe classification is published at http://data.worldbank.org and revised versions are published each year on July 1 (Fantom and Umar 2016). The World Bank did not provide data on income for seven small areas, all of which reported cases of COVID-19: Jersey, Guernsey, the Falkland Islands, Vatican City State, Montserrat, Bonaire Sint Eus, and Anguilla. Therefore, those seven were categorized as \"small areas with unknown income status\". The data were exported to STATA 2012 for analysis.\nCases on international conveyances (e.g. cruise ships) were excluded from the analysis, because the patients were from many countries, and therefore as groups they could not be linked with any of the World Bank's income categories.\nDescriptive statistics regarding cases, deaths, case-fatality rates (as percentages), cases per million population, and deaths per million population for each country and for income-defined groups of countries were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks was used to examine associations of country-level income category with the variables listed above. Data from the small areas with unknown income status were excluded from the Kruskal-Wallis analysis because there was no information on country-level income status, and because the numbers of cases were much smaller than in the other income-groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine associations of country-level income category with the time since the onset of the pandemic.\nChanges over time in the indices mentioned above were also examined for trends during the period for which data were available."}, {"section_title": "Expansion period of the pandemic", "text": "The first cases of COVID-19 were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. By June 3 rd , 2020, the disease had spread to 210 countries and territories ( Table 1 ). The mean number of days from the time that the first case was reported to the WHO until June 3, 2020 differed widely among income-defined groups: 100.5 (SD 19.6) days for high-income countries; 94.8 (SD 18.6) for upper-middle-income countries; 89.5 (SD 20.1) for lower-middle-income countries; and 79.1 (SD 17.2) for low-income countries (F= 870.36, df = 3, p < 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Numbers of reported cases and deaths:", "text": "In five months, 6,804,286 cases were reported globally.

The income-defined category of a country was positively associated with the number of COVID-19 cases and with the daily incidence rate per million population.\nThe large differences in daily incidence rates probably reflect differences in epidemiologic and population characteristics, and differences in clinical and public health practices.\nFirst, the most obvious of the epidemiological differences is in the timing of the introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the various countries. Among the income-defined groups, strong connections by air travel probably resulted in the relatively early and widespread transmission of the disease among high-income and upper-middle-income countries. The date on which a country reported its first case(s) to the WHO can be taken as indicator of the date on which the disease began to spread in that country. Given that indicator, it is clear that the temporal order of the introduction and the start of transmission among income-defined categories is exactly the same as the economic ranking of those categories In other words, overall, the disease has been spreading from higher-income countries to lower-income countries.\nA second possible explanation for the observed differences in the number of cases by income-defined groups of countries involves differences in the availability of and approaches to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including testing patients with illness of various severities. In this context two indices of testing are often used: daily tests per capita and test-positivity rate (the number of positive tests as a percentage of the total number of tests done). High-income and upper-middle-income countries are more likely to test more people with illness of various severities than are lower-middle-income and low-income countries. Kobia and Gitaka (2020) also attributed the low apparent incidence rate of COVID-19 in Africa to insufficient testing. In large parts of Africa and also in most low-income and middle-income countries elsewhere, shortages of test kits, lack of capacity to implement large-scale testing and contact tracing, and lack of capacity to roll out surveillance testing have been reported (Jaffer Shah et al. 2020; Kobia and Gitaka 2020), all of which can cause the true incidence rate of COVID-19 in .

High test-positivity rates can indicate that only the sickest patients are being tested, which may imply that more people should be tested. The WHO has issued guidance stating that the positivity rate should be below 5% for at least 14 days before social-distancing measures are relaxed. The actual percentage varied both within and among income-defined groups. As shown on the OWID website, testing was limited in lower-middle-income countries and possibly also in low-income countries, which probably resulted in underestimation of incidence rates (OWID data 2020b).\nThird, the income-related differences might also have been caused in part by differences in the timing, adherence to, and/or implementation of preventive and community and public-health measures among the countries. Such measures include frequent handwashing with soap and water, use of alcohol-based hand rub, wearing masks, social distancing, case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of exposed persons, closure of schools, public libraries, cinemas, and clubs, and suspension \nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 15, 2020. Nonetheless, the most likely explanation for the bulk of the difference between income-defined groups may still be the relatively late establishment of transmission of the virus in lower-income countries.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 15, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153064 doi: medRxiv preprint upper-middle-income countries.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 15, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153064 doi: medRxiv preprint comments and suggestions.\n.
