[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by amyloid-beta deposits in extracellular plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated tau, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Transgenic rodent models to study Alzheimer's mimic features of human disease such as age-dependent accumulation of abnormal beta-amyloid and tau, synaptic dysfunction, cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration. These models have proven vital for improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and for identifying promising therapeutic approaches. However, modelling neurodegenerative disease in animals commonly involves aging animals until they develop harmful phenotypes, often coupled with invasive procedures. We have developed a novel organotypic brain slice culture model to study Alzheimer's disease using 3xTg-AD mice which brings the potential of substantially reducing the number of rodents used in dementia research from an estimated 20,000 per year. Using a McIllwain tissue chopper, we obtain 36 x 350 micron slices from each P8-P9 mouse pup for culture between 2 weeks and 6 months on semi-permeable 0.4 micron pore membranes, considerably reducing the numbers of animals required to investigate multiple stages of disease. This tractable model also allows the opportunity to modulate multiple pathways in tissues from a single animal. We believe that this model will most benefit dementia researchers in the academic and drug discovery sectors. We validated the slice culture model against aged mice, showing that the molecular phenotype closely mimics that displayed , albeit in an in vivo accelerated timescale. We showed beneficial outcomes following treatment of slices with agents previously shown to have therapeutic effects and we in vivo, also identified new mechanisms of action of other compounds. Thus, organotypic brain slice cultures from transgenic mouse models expressing Alzheimer's disease-related genes may provide a valid and sensitive replacement for studies that do not involve behavioural analysis. in vivo"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, currently affects around 35 million people worldwide and carries huge societal and economical costs. AD is a multifactorial disease with two major pathological hallmarks; extracellular plaques composed of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing aggregated posttranslationally modified tau. The only available treatments for AD target the symptoms of disease, but not disease course.\nIntensive research efforts are ongoing to better understand the biological causes of disease so that effective disease-modifying therapies can be developed.\nPerhaps the most accepted models for AD research are transgenic rodents that express wild-type or mutant human AD-associated genes and recapitulate key molecular phenotypes of AD. Mice are generally one of the best accepted animal models in neuroscience research since there is significant homology between the human and mouse genome, mice have a relatively short life span, well-defined genetic backgrounds, are amenable to further genetic manipulations, enable assessment of changes in behaviour, cognition, brain biochemistry and physiology during disease progression, and a battery of wellcharacterised tasks are available to study behaviour and cognition 1 .\nOur estimates, based on a PubMed search using the terms \"Alzheimer's + transgenic + mouse\" and our evaluation that an average of 30 mice for each of the 700 papers published, suggest that over 20,000 wild-type and transgenic mice were used in AD research in 2017. Due to the age-related neurodegenerative nature of the disease, this research often involves aging several cohorts of mice to observe disease progression. Allowing mice expressing AD-related genes to reach the terminal stages can result in severe phenotypes, and some studies are coupled with invasive procedures such as advanced live imaging or collection of interstitial or cerebrospinal fluids.\nAlternatives to in vivo AD research in mammalian systems include rodent and human cell lines manipulated to express genes of interest, however these can be criticised for lacking key features of differentiated post-mitotic neurons and can be prone to artefacts resulting from protein over-expression. Dissociated neural cell cultures are commonly used as a readily tractable model in which pathways of interest can be manipulated, however even co-culture systems do not completely replicate the complex connections between different neural cell types and the brain vasculature, and they cannot model the synaptic and anatomical connectivity of mammalian brain. The latter is also true for neural cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Recent reports using iPSC-derived neurons also highlights the extensive time in culture required before even subtle disease relevant changes are observed in these human neural cells 2 . Organotypic brain slice cultures are a well-established technique. Slice cultures maintain a three-dimensional organisation with the preservation of cytoarchitecture and cell populations, and are an accessible system lending their application to electrophysiology, morphology and biochemical analyses [3] [4] [5] . The interfaceslice culture method established by Stoppini and colleagues in 1991 6 is the most common method to culture brain sections ex vivo. This relatively simple method cultures brain tissue explants from neonatal mice/rats on a porous membrane insert that acts as an interface between the humidified incubator atmosphere and the culture medium that provides nutrition 6 . Cultures can be maintained for several weeks in culture after explant and continue to develop and mature once plated 7, 8 ."}, {"section_title": "Research highlights", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Scientific benefits:", "text": "\u2022 Neurodegeneration in AD is progressive and agedependent and therefore many experiments rely upon animals developing a moderate to severe phenotype prior to assessment of disease parameters\n\u2022 Aging slices in a culture dish obviates this requirement, as well as providing an in vitro system in which all neural cell types are present, and functional and anatomical connectivity is retained 3Rs benefits:\n\u2022 Here we describe methods of culturing pups from 3xTg-AD mice. A McIllwain tissue chopper is used to obtain 350 \u00b5m slices from postnatal day 8-9 mice that are cultured for 2-weeks to 6 months on 0.4 \u00b5m pore semipermeable membranes. Brain slice cultures can be used as an alternative to some in vivo experiments thereby reducing the numbers of animals required for such studies \u2022 Disease phenotypes are accelerated in brain slice culture models so equivalent data can be obtained from neonatal mice in 1 month of in vitro experiments rather than 12 months of aging in vivo from fewer total mice\n\u2022 36 brain slices can be cultured from a single mouse brain, so studies can be refined as it is possible to assess several parameters or disease-modifying agents in a single brain thereby minimising biological variation\nIn addition, 36 slices containing the cortex and hippocampus can be prepared from one postnatal mouse brain allowing multiple variables to be tested or manipulated in tissue from the same mice, thereby considerably reducing the number of mice required as well as minimising experimental variation. Importantly, slice cultures are prepared from neonatal (P8-9) mice which removes the need to age mice until stages where they develop adverse phenotypes and avoids aging several groups of mice to different disease stages for these studies. This method requires only the maintenance of small breeding colonies which also minimises the inherent costs.\nAD researchers are beginning to embrace organotypic brain slice culture models, with recent papers describing AD-relevant changes in slice cultures prepared from mice that overexpress amyloid precursor protein or are seeded with A\u03b2, which show some accumulation of A\u03b2 and synaptic alterations 9-11 . Others have shown that slice cultures prepared from mice that overexpress human tau can accumulate phosphorylated and some sarkosylinsoluble tau 11, 12 . We recently demonstrated that slice cultures prepared from 3xTg-AD mice 13 overproduce A\u03b2, accumulate somatodendritic and synaptic phosphorylated tau at an accelerated rate compared to 3xTg-AD mice 14 , allowing study of A\u03b2-tau interactions and AD disease pathways ex vivo.\nThe utility of slice cultures for drug discovery efforts has previously been reviewed 15 , and we have validated 3xTg-AD slice cultures for this purpose by showing that the effects of disease-modifying compounds observed in vivo can be recapitulated in slice culture 16 . We also identified novel targets for compounds, further demonstrating the usefulness of slice cultures for therapeutic development. In this paper, we provide detailed methods for the preparation of organotypic brain slice cultures for the study of AD and we discuss the advantages of this model system in terms of the 3Rs in AD research, most specifically in reducing mouse numbers. We believe that this model system will be of most benefit to researchers in the neurodegeneration field, who are either focussed on understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning disease or who aim to screen and test the efficacy of novel disease-modifying therapeutics.

We examined abnormalities in \u03b2-amyloid and tau that accumulate in AD brain. We found that 3xTg-AD slice cultures show an accelerated development of highly phosphorylated and oligomeric/64kDa tau species, some of which redistributed to synaptic compartments by 28 days in vitro (DIV). Similar changes in vivo are typically observed from 12 months of age. An accelerated accumulation of potentially pathogenic A\u03b2 species were also observed in brain slice cultures from 3xTg-AD mice, with significantly increased A\u03b21-42 levels detected at 28 DIV in slices. In comparison, we could only detect significant changes in A\u03b21-42 amounts in 3xTg-AD brain in 12-month old mice. Thus, disease-associated protein species show an accelerated accumulation in long-term brain slice cultures in comparison to in vivo. Using differential centrifugation approaches we were also able to show the differential accumulation of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated tau species in synaptic compartments and at membranes, in agreement with previous reports using human tissue and primary cell cultures 19, 20 . Table 1 provides a summary of molecular changes in the slice culture model in comparison to findings made using tissue from aged 3xTg-AD mice. Primary data is available here (Dataset 1).\nThere is also a great deal of versatility in the methods that can be used to assess disease changes in this model. We have confirmed that methods including, but not limited to the following, can be used with slice cultures; biochemical changes can be assessed by ELISA or immunoblotting, slice cultures can be examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, sufficient material is present to allow differential centrifugation to enrich cell compartments such as synaptosomes, membrane and cytosol. Additionally, cell death can be measured using lactate dehydrogenase assays and the release of disease-associated proteins into culture medium can be quantified 14, 31 . Others have used imaging methods to describe the anatomy of slice cultures 6,7,32 and have also shown that brain slice cultures are amenable to ultrastructural analysis 33 , live cell imaging 34-36 and live calcium imaging 12 .\nValidation of the model: Organotypic brain slice cultures can be used to assess acute pharmacological treatments and to determine drug targets In addition to comparing molecular features of AD in slice cultures in comparison to in vivo, we also validated the use of slice cultures for studying the effects on tau phosphorylation of acute application of compounds in comparison to their reported effects in previously published in vivo studies.\nLithium chloride (LiCl) can inhibit activity of the prominent tau kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3) 37 , which targets many of the tau residues known to be aberrantly phosphorylated Table 1 . Biochemical and pathological features of 3xTg-AD organotypic brain slices in comparison to in vivo 3xTg-AD brain and AD brain. Primary references are shown. AD: Alzheimer's disease; DIV: days in vitro.\nFeature AD brain 3xTg-AD mice in vivo 3xTg-AD ex vivo brain slice in AD 21 . Treatment of 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice for 3 months with the GSK-3 inhibitor, LiCl, was shown to reduce phosphorylation of tau at Thr 181, Ser 202/Thr 205, Thr 231, and Thr 212/Ser 214, but not Ser 396/404 38 . We found that application of LiCl for 4 h to 3xTg-AD brain slice cultures at 28 days days in vitro (DIV) resulted in significantly reduced tau phosphorylation at the Ser396/404 and Ser202/Thr205 epitopes, in addition to causing a subtle reduction in total tau amounts when compared to slices treated with control (NaCl). There was also a notable shift in the apparent molecular weight of tau in lysates from LiCl treated slice cultures, which is characteristic of reduced tau phosphorylation 16 . Of interest, others have shown that okadaic acid induces hyperphosphorylation of tau in organotypic brain slice cultures prepared from TG APP_SweDI mice (SweDI; expressing APP harboring the Swedish K670N/M671L, Dutch E693Q, and Iowa D694N mutations; C57BL/6-Tg(Thy1-APPSwDutIowa)BWevn/Mmjax) 17 . Thus, this platform is very amenable for the study of treatments that modulate tau phosphorylation.\nAnother potential therapeutic approach for AD is to use microtubule-stabilising agents to recover the loss of function, which occurs following the detachment of phosphorylated tau from the microtubule cytoskeleton 37 . Neuroprotective effects of the peptide NAPVSIPQ have previously been reported in 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Mice administered NAPVSIPQ for 3 months showed reduced phosphorylation of tau at Ser 202/Thr 205 and Thr 231, but not at Ser 202 alone. Treatment of 28 DIV 3xTg-AD slice cultures with 100 nM NAPVSIPQ for 24 h significantly reduced tau phosphorylation at the Thr231 epitope, but did not alter the total amount of tau when compared to control cultures 16 , thus we find that equivalent treatment of 3xTg-AD organotypic brain slice cultures recapitulates previous in vivo findings conducted in 3xTg-AD mice [38] [39] [40] .\nPrimary data is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ articles/PMC5547074/ 16 .\nWe also used the slice culture model to identify novel taudirected effects of BTA-EG 4 16 , a compound that had previously shown A\u03b2-binding effects and synaptic protection [41] [42] [43] . A growing body of publications have further demonstrated the tractability of the slice culture system, including pharmacological manipulation of A\u03b2 production 10 and tau aggregation 12 , in addition to modulation of microglial composition to examine the phagocytic action of microglia on A\u03b2 deposits 33 .\nThese data suggest that potential therapeutic agents can be sensitively examined in organotypic brain slice culture models. Since a number of methods can be applied to study slice culture tissues, this system should be considered as a replacement for in vivo studies with molecular and cellular study parameters and when end-points do not include life-span or behavioural assessment. Certainly, in academic and industrial laboratories, slice cultures should provide an excellent system for medium throughput drug screening or range-finding studies. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Organotypic brain slice cultures can reduce the number of animals required for some in vivo studies Depending on the nature of the experiment, one postnatal day 8 or 9 pup can provide an n=36 for immunohistochemical analysis, and a single well containing three slices can be combined to give n=12 for biochemical analysis or compound screening. For example, the preparation of slice cultures from only six postnatal pups would allow the opportunity to study 12 time-points in six different animals, a reduction in numbers of 91% in comparison to the 72 mice that would be required for an in vivo aging study. In addition, since multiple time points will be assessed in tissues from the same animals, experimental within-group variation is substantially reduced.\nTake-up of this method within academic laboratories in the UK appears to be growing, however it is very difficult to accurately quantify the number of animals that have not been used as a result of researchers preparing slice cultures in preference to in vivo experimentation. Within our own laboratories, we estimate that our in vivo experimentation has reduced by approximately 20% as we train more researchers in the method of brain slice culture preparation."}, {"section_title": "An adaptable model for neurodegeneration research", "text": "While we have focussed on AD research in this article, organotypic brain slice cultures are equally suitable for research into a range of other neurodegenerative and neurological conditions, as well as for basic neuroscientific research (reviewed by 44). Slice cultures can also be prepared specifically from the hippocampus 10 or from other tissues such as spinal cord 45 ; the latter being used to investigate prion-like properties of mutant SOD1 proteins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The technique is not limited to mice, rats are commonly used 44 and methods are emerging to allow long-term culture of human organotypic brain slice cultures 46 . There are no major restrictions on uptake of this model since it requires only modest investment in terms of equipment provision. Training in tissue dissection and slicing may be beneficial, but the technique can readily be learned with practice."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of this model", "text": "It is important to consider some of the limitations associated with organotypic slice cultures in general, and in the context of Alzheimer's disease research. Firstly, we use a mouse line here that expresses genetic mutations in APP and PS1 that cause AD, alongside an FTD-causing tau mutation. It is unclear to what extent mice expressing FAD-causing genes recapitulate the more common sporadic forms. However, pathophysiological similarities between familial and sporadic AD suggests that familial models have, at least some, utility for investigating disease mechanisms. For example, recent work from the expansive DIAN-TU study highlights the similar progression and overlapping pathology between sporadic and familial AD, which further supports the use of familial models to understand sporadic AD (https://www.alzforum.org/news/conference-coverage/dian-and-adni-data-say-familial-and-sporadic-ad-converge).\nMore generally, the limitations of slice cultures should be considered by users. These have been reviewed elsewhere 44 , and will only be briefly mentioned here.\n\u2022 Slice cultures do not have a functioning brain vasculature. In the context of neurodegeneration, this may mean that they are not the best system for studying changes in the neurovascular unit or those resulting from changes in cerebral blood flow. However, they likely still have advantages over dissociated co-culture primary cell culture for this purpose, and the lack of a blood-brain-barrier has advantages for drug screening.\n\u2022 Slice cultures have been axotomised, and as a result show loss of target innervation. This may be somewhat ameliorated by the addition of nerve growth factors 44 . We recommend a \"resting period\" of 2 weeks before analysing plated slices to allow many of the acute effects of axotomy to be resolved.\n\u2022 Slice cultures develop, at least soon after plating, a layer of reactive astrocytes on their outer surface as a protective response to cutting 34 . This may present difficulties for some analysis methods including imaging and patch clamping, although these can be overcome.\n\u2022 Slice cultures become flattened over time (100-200\u00b5m) , which is partially reduced by the addition of high concentrations of horse serum, but results in some disruption to their anatomical structure and electrophysiological properties 44 ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Here, we describe a detailed method for the preparation of long-term organotypic brain slice cultures from postnatal mice.

Slice cultures show a significant acceleration in the timescale in which disease features develop, with relevant pathological changes observed at 28 days in vitro as opposed to 12 months in vivo in 3x-TgAD mice. We suggest that organotypic brain slice cultures can be used to replace several in vivo studies and that their widespread uptake could reduce the number of animals used in neurodegenerative disease research by 20-50%.

We agree with this comment from the reviewer that others have published results using organotypic slice cultures, mostly limited to the hippocampus, from a range of Alzheimer's-relevant transgenic lines, particularly those expressing either human APP or tau. We cite several of these papers in the current manuscript.\nThis publication addresses a current gap in published descriptions of the full methodology used to produce organotypic cultures containing the hippocampus and cortex. We have already published twice with this method (Croft et al., 2017a , Croft et al., 2017b and attribute the novelty of this system to our comparison of the development of pathological features in slice cultures and mice. We also show the utility of these slice cultures for identifying novel disease features and novel disease-modifying properties of compounds. We do not intend to suggest that our system is necessary a better model for investigating AD -the mouse line that is used will be dependent upon the specific question under investigation. However, the methods we describe can be applied to any mouse line.\nIt was a little bit confusing on the section stating: In brief, slice cultures are cut whilst still on their membranes and then treated as free-floating sections. Is this illustrated in Figure 1 ? If so could be made clearer? Figure 1 describes only the preparation of the slice cultures, prior to their culture. The statement mentioned is with regards to immunohistochemical staining which is described in full in a methods paper by others (Gogolla et al., 2006) . Essentially, to avoid disruption to the tissue during its mechanical separation from insert membranes, the membranes are cut and sections with membranes adhering to their bottom surface are processed as for free-floating sections.\nNot convinced the n=12 from one pup statement is correct, as this would be replicates. N usually refers to different biological repeats. The n=12 refers to the fact that 36 slices can be obtained from a single postnatal mouse brain. If, as commonly occurs, slices are plated 3 per well, this yields 12 wells of slices. If slices from several pups are plated in parallel, it is possible that each well could be analysed in relation to the corresponding wells from other pups. For example, either 12 time-points or 12 compounds can be examined in slices prepared from a single mouse. (2011) . This was out-with the scope of the current publication, but we have added details of these papers to our manuscript to direct the scope of the current publication, but we have added details of these papers to our manuscript to direct the reader to these complementary publications.\nThe LDH was not explained enough and perhaps the time course could have been shown. We have previously described the methods and results obtained using LDH assays (Croft et al., 2017b) , To avoid unnecessary duplication, this paper is focussed principally on the detailed methodology used to prepare organotypic cultures."}, {"section_title": "Referee Report 22 May 2018 Christian Humpel, Laboratory of Psychiatry and Experimental Alzheimer's Research, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria", "text": "Please provide more details in the Abstract, especially, on the organotypic brain slice model (3xTg mice, chopper slices, 350 \u00b5m, postnatal d8-9, cultured for > 2weeks on 0.4 \u00b5m pore semipermeable membranes). Please also add this information in the Box research highlights. This is important to see on one view which kind of slices you mean. We agree that this is a useful addition to the manuscript and have added this information to the revised paper.\nI suggest that you are more careful about the used number of animals. In Abstract you write an estimated 20,000 mice per year for dementia research and on page 3, right col. sec. paragr. you write ... were used in AD research, and you write 20,000 transgenic; assuming from 30 mice per paper. What do you mean: (1) per year in UK, Europe or the world?, (2) total mice per year or only transgenic per year? (3) based on which fact you assume 30 mice per paper (value 30 is just your thoughts or is this based on an official reference?). I suggest that you check an EU report on the total number of animals/mice/transgenic, or you check your national institution (and also give the official reference). Such rough values could be very problematic. As we describe in the introduction, the number of 20,000 mice that we cite in the paper was calculated on the basis of a Pubmed search using the search terms \"Alzheimer's + transgenic + mouse\" in 2017. The results of this search are not limited to a single geographical location, so take into account world-wide publications. Sampling of these papers allowed us to estimate an average number of 30 transgenic plus non-transgenic mice per paper; where some use over 100, others use less than 12. It would be very useful to obtain official statistics on animal use, but the methods for collecting this data vary widely by regulatory authority. For example, in the UK, transgenic and wild-type mice subjected to regulated procedures are counted, but wild-type killed using Schedule 1 methods are generally not. We acknowledge that the numbers we cite are only an estimate and have modified the wording of this section to clarify this further. We believe that our estimate is very conservative and that actual animal usage is likely to be higher.\nPage 3 third paragr: .... importantly, slice cultures are prepared from neonatal mice ... this (neonatal) should be explained as it is unclear. We have made an addition to the manuscript to better explain that the use of neonatal mice is important because it precludes the ageing of mice with neurodegenerative phenotypes, removes the need to age numerous mice and requires only the maintenance of small breeding colonies for both cost and animal savings. We clarify elsewhere that we are referring to postnatal day (P) 8-9, but others have reported the same methods to prepare slice cultures form slightly older mice (P10-12; Duff et al., 2001) .\nIt would be helpful to give the average weight of the postnatal d8-9 mice. We usually weigh them, to be sure about the stage. Or do you have other rules to be sure on the correct stage. Also mention up to which age does your model work?\nMice were time-mated and checked every day to first confirm pregnancy and subsequently to check for the Mice were time-mated and checked every day to first confirm pregnancy and subsequently to check for the delivery of pups. The first day pups were found was marked as p0; p8-9 corresponding to 8 or 9 days from this time. In our hands, weighing the mouse pups was less consistent since this often corresponds to litter size and can vary with genotype. We therefore recommend preparing slices from p8 or p9 mice, which allows a time window to compensate for the lack of accuracy of recording birth time. We have previously prepared slices up to p12 (Duff et al., 2002) , but with a different transgenic line which suggests that there may be variability between colonies. Slice cultures were also successfully prepared from p6 or p7 mice, although less slices per pup are obtained at these ages.\nPage 5, point 6: typo: 2x remove This has been corrected, thank you.\nPage 7 right col, last paragr: ....when reporting on the phosphorylation of tau via LiCl and GSK-3, the authors may cite the recent paper Foidl and Humpel (2018) in Frontiers Aging Neurosci. on hyperphosphorylation of tau in organotypic brain slices induced by okadaic acid. In this respect also the review on brain culture slices by Humpel (2015) in Neuroscience should be cited (page 4, left col, line, 14) . Thank you for these suggestions. We have added these papers to the revised manuscript.\nPlease explain better your definition of the n-number (page 8, right col.) .... one postnatal d8 or 9 pup can provide an n=36. I think that one mouse only gives an n=1; for an experiment you need at least 6-8 different mice (n=6-8); but one mouse can give up to 36 different treatments (or in duplicate 2x18). What is your suggestion on power calculations (how many slices per group?). Please explain better any statistical issues. We agree that slices prepared from one mouse are equivalent to N=1. The n=12 refers to the fact that 36 slices can be obtained from a single postnatal mouse brain. If, as commonly occurs, slices are plated 3 per well, this yields 12 wells of slices. If slices from several pups are plated in parallel, it is possible that each well could be analysed in relation to the corresponding wells from other pups. For example, either 12 time-points or 12 compounds can be examined in slices prepared from a single mouse. We used data generated from our previous work with post-mortem brain and brain slice cultures to perform power calculations. These calculations show that at a 5% significance level and a statistical power of 90% to show 25-30% differences between groups, for most experiments, we require sample sizes of n=6 for slice culture work. All brain slice culture experiments will include experimental triplicates to improve robustness and reproducibility of our findings.\nFinally, please state in your conclusion the limits of the brain slices; how to study genetic (familiar) versus sporadic AD, how comparable is the developmental stage with the adult stage (maturation of neurons after 2 weeks in culture?), how long do you need to culture to get at least an early comparable adult stage, what about axonal networks and the problem of axotomy. We already discuss the equivalent times in culture versus for the neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo being studied in this work ( Table 1 ). We are unable to comment knowledgeably on the equivalent developmental stages in slices compared to , and this is somewhat outside the scope of this in vivo methods paper. We agree that it is a good idea to further discuss some of the limitations of this system, including the lack of vasculature, the problems with axotomy and loss of innervation, layer of reactive astrocytes and flattening/thinning of the slice cultures over time. We have therefore revised the manuscript to include additional discussion. In terms of sporadic versus familiar AD, it is acknowledged that studying sporadic AD is a universal problem in the field but the pathophysiological similarities between familial and sporadic AD suggests that familial models have utility. For example, recent work from the expansive DIAN-TU study highlights the similar progression and overlapping pathology between sporadic and familial AD, which further supports the use of familial models to understand sporadic AD further supports the use of familial models to understand sporadic AD (https://www.alzforum.org/news/conference-coverage/dian-and-adni-data-say-familial-and-sporadic-ad-converge)."}]
