For example, brain imaging data have been regarded as quantitative phenotypes to investigate the genetic variants in brain structure and function as it has a potential promise to understand complex neurobiological systems, from genetic determinants to cellular processes and further to the complex interplay of brain structure. On the other hand, the genotypes (e.g., the APOE4 allele) have been suspected to associate with the development of early and late-onset AD as the genetic variants may reflect the variability of neuroimaging phenotypes [4] , [5] , [6] .\nThe main challenge in current imaging-genetic association study comes from the large number of variables from both brain imaging data and genetic data, thus requiring appropriate statistical techniques such as regression, variable selection and sparsity constraint. In the literature, pairwise univariate analysis (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) measures the correlation between individual phenotype and an isolated genotype without considering the potential correlations on the phenotypes and the genotypes. Regularized ridge regression (e.g., [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] ) conducts the imaginggenetic association study via ordinary least square estimation, which considers the correlations among the variables (e.g., the genotypes in this work) and but ignore the correlations among the corresponding responses. Earlier, Wang et al. [13] proposed to consider the interlinked structures among Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to output interpretable results. Batmanghelich et al. [14] uses a sparse Gaussian model to conduct the imaging genetic analysis. The studies in [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] also considered the correlations among the responses to implicitly output interpretable results. In a nutshell, the state-of-the-art methods have individually manifested that all kinds of correlations (e.g., between the responses and the variables, among the variables, and among the responses) are useful and necessary for imaging-genetic analysis. Furthermore, techniques for use of correlations inherent in the data may result in more reliable models [13] , [19] , [20] , [21] . However, to our best knowledge, the previous studies were limited in the sense that they didn't jointly consider the relational information in a unified framework.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel low-rank variable selection method in a regularization-based linear regression framework by taking correlations inherent in phenotypes and genotypes into account and also avoiding the adverse effect of noise and redundancy. We use the genotype data (i.e., variables) to regress the phenotype data (i.e., responses) with a least square regression to consider the correlations between the variables and the responses. We further devise new regularization terms to exploit the inherent information in both brain imaging data and genetic data for better understanding their associations. Specifically, we employ a low-rank regression model with the hypothesis of the lowrank property in both brain imaging data and genetic data to consider the correlations among the responses. Then, we devise a novel acyclic digraph regularization along with a structured sparsity regularization (i.e., ' 2;1 -norm regularization) to consider the potential relations among the variables. The rationales of our method are: 1) the highdimensional data have low-rank representation and redundant variables due to noise or dependency in the data; 2) graph learning has been successfully used for AD study by considering the similarity among the data; and 3) the structured sparsity constraint can effectively select highly informative SNPs in predicting brain imaging features. Finally, we conduct the biomarker selection for the brain imaging features using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. The important SNPs selected by our new method can more accurately predict the brain imaging features than the biomarkers selected by other state-of-theart approaches.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model has the following contributions. First, this work uses the low-rank assumption to take the advantages of the correlations among both the neuroimaging features (i.e., Region-Of-Interests (ROIs)-based features in this paper) and the SNPs to improve accuracy of selecting genetic biomarkers related to AD. Our motivation is that noise and redundancy may induce the low-rank of the data [22] and there exist correlations among both the SNPs and the ROIs [3] , [14] , [23] . For example, multiple SNPs derive from one gene, while brain regions (e.g., ROIs or voxels) are anatomically connected. In addition, the low-rank regression, which makes a constraint on the rank of the coefficient matrix to convert the high-dimensional data to their lowrank representation [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , has been widely used in statistics and is significantly different from subspace learning [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , which learns the lowdimensional representation of the data by only considering the correlations among the variables.\nSecond, inspired by the popular application of the selfrepresentation property of the samples, where each sample is represented by a small subset of other samples, in machine learning and computer vision [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , this work devises a novel self-representation property of variables to represent each variable by other variables excluding itself. Their difference is obviously: 1) the exiting methods take each subjects as a node to build a undirected graph while our method regards each variable as a node to build a digraph, where the out-degree has different meaning from the in-degree of the digraph; 2) the exiting methods represent each sample by other samples including itself, thus easily leading to a trivial solution, while our method avoids this issue by excluding each variable to represent itself.\nLastly, we integrate the low-rank assumption and the sparsity in a framework to achieve their optimal results with the motivation that while different forms of constraints help construct reliable models, it can introduce unexpected redundancies and noises. In our model, variable selection causes to discard unimportant variables by satisfying the low-rank constraint, while the low-rank constraint makes it possible for variable selection in the low-rank representations of the data. In this way, the proposed method avoids the adverse influences of noise and redundancy to achieve optimal results of both low-rank regression and variable selection. In a statistical learning context, the propose model has the effects of: 1) feature embedding on both genetic data and brain imaging data via a low-rank constraint, and 2) variable selection on genetic data via the proposed sparse digraph and the structured sparsity regularization, simultaneously."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND DATA PREPROCESSING", "text": "We obtained the SNP and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data of 737 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (adni.loni.usc.edu) for performance evaluation.

The main goal of ADNI was designed to test if the serial of MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early AD. As a consequence, ADNI recruited over 800 adults (aged 55 to 90) to participate in the research.

We obtained raw Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) MRI scans from the public ADNI website, where these MRI scans have been reviewed for quality, and automatically corrected for spatial distortion caused by gradient nonlinearity and B1 field inhomogeneity. We then processed all MR images following the same procedures in [38] , [39] as detailed below:\nWe used the MIPAV software 1 on all images to conduct anterior commissure-posterior commissure correction, and then corrected the intensity inhomogeneity using the N3 algorithm [40] . A robust skull-stripping method [41] was applied to extract only a brain on all structural MR images. The manual edition and intensity inhomogeneity correction were followed for better quality. After repeating N3 algorithm three times to remove the cerebellum based on registration and intensity inhomogeneity correction, we used FAST algorithm in [42] to segment the structural MR images into three different tissues, i.e., gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. We used HAMMER [43] to conduct registration and obtained the ROI-labeled images, for which we used the Jacob template [44] to dissect a brain into 93 ROIs. For each of the 93 ROIs in a labeled image, we computed the gray matter tissue volume. Thus, for each MR image, we extracted a feature vector of 93 gray matter tissue volumes. By following the previous work [13] , [19] , in this paper, we considered 16 ROIs, which were identified as highly related to AD in different studies [13] , [45] , [46] , as the informative phenotypes. The selected ROIs, marked in Fig. 1 (left) are parahippocampal gyrus left, uncus right, hippocampal formation right, uncus left, middle temporal gyrus left, perirhinal cortex left, temporal pole left, entorhinal cortex left, lateral occipitotemporal gyrus right, hippocampal formation left, amygdala left, parahippocampal gyrus right, middle temporal gyrus right, amygdala right, inferior temporal gyrus right, and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus left."}, {"section_title": "Genotype Extraction", "text": "After sequentially pre-processing by the standard quality control (QC) step and the imputation step, we selected the SNPs, within the boundary of 20 K base pairs of the 153 AD candidate genes listed on the AlzGene database (www. alzgene.org) as of 4/18/2011 [47] , to be used in this work.\nThe QC criteria for the SNP data include: 1) call rate check per subject and per SNP marker; 2) gender check; 3) sibling pair identification; 4) the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test; 5) marker removal by the minor allele frequency; and 6) population stratification. In this paper, we used the MaCH software to impute the missing SNPs satisfied the QC step.\nAs a consequence, we obtained 2,098 SNPs extracted from 153 genes (boundary: 20 KB) using the ANNOVAR annotation. 2 In this paper, we used these 2,098 genotype data to form two datasets for performance evaluation. First, we regarded the dataset with 2,098 SNPs as the 'Large' dataset. Second, by following [13] , [19] , we further selected the SNPs, overlapping with the top 40 AD candidate genes reported in the AlzGene database from 2,098 SNPs, to form the 'Small' dataset, which consisted of 304 SNPs on 27 genes.

Hereafter, we regard X and Y as the variable matrix and the response matrix, respectively. In order to identify the potential correlations between the SNPs and the volume of ROIs, we formulate their association via a linear regression as follows:\nwhere W 2 R p\u00c2q denotes a weight coefficient matrix and b 2 R q\u00c21 is a bias term. In the least-square sense, our objective is to find the optimal coefficient matrix W and bias term b, which can be formulated as follows:\nwhere e 2 R n\u00c21 denotes a column vector with all ones. The ordinary least square estimation [48] can give a closed form solution to Eq. (2), i.e.,\u0174 \u00bc \u00f0X > X\u00de \u00c01 X > Y, which does not consider possible correlations among the responses.\nIt is, however, noteworthy that recent studies of brain imaging analysis witnessed high correlations among different brain regions [18] , [49] . Moreover, X > X is invertible only when it has full rank, which does not always hold due to noises, outliers, and potential correlations inherent in the data, especially, in imaging-genetic analysis [18] . In addition, given a large number of SNPs, some of them may not be related to neuroimaging phenotypes. These observations motivate us to seek a subset of low-rank variables in SNPs. On the other hand, the previous studies (e.g., [18] , [21] , [50] , [51] ) have manifested that the low-rank assumption in data representation helps make the resulting regression model more accurate.\nIn these regards, we first impose a low-rank constraint on W (i.e., rank\u00f0W\u00de min\u00f0p; q\u00de or rank\u00f0W\u00de min\u00f0n; p; q\u00de [48] ) to seek the low-rank representations of SNPs and neuroimaging phenotypes. With the low-rank constraint on W, it is possible to decompose it into the product of two low-rank matrices, e.g., W \u00bc UV > , where U 2 R p\u00c2r and V 2 R q\u00c2r by assuming r \u00bc rank\u00f0W\u00de. Meanwhile, based on the hypothesis that not all the SNPs are associated with neuroimaging phenotypes, it is desirable to find or select the phenotyperelated SNPs in the regression framework. In order for this, we further introduce an ' 2;1 -norm sparse regularization on U into our objective function. By considering the low-rank constraint and the sparse regularization together, we formulate our objective function as follows:\nwhere I 2 R r\u00c2r is an identity matrix and a is a control parameter for regularization term. In Eq. (3), the orthogonality constraint on V, i.e., V > V \u00bc I, encourages the column vectors in V uncorrelated and shrinks the heterogeneity between X and Y, i.e., the relation between X and Y are more homogeneous. Actually, Eq. (3) conducts feature selection by a sparse reduced-rank regression [52] .\nClearly, the low-rank of U and V via the low-rank constraint on W implies that the variable and response matrices of X and Y can be represented by a linear combination of r low-dimensional latent variables and latent responses, each of which can be obtained from XU and YV. From a machine learning context, this can be interpreted as low-rank regression on both X and Y by considering the correlations among the responses, i.e., regarding q responses as a group. It is noteworthy that, subspace learning, popularly used in machine learning and computer vision, also converts the high-dimensional data into their low-dimensional representation. However, most of subspace learning methods consider the correlations among the variables which is also taken into account in our proposed method by designing a sparse acyclic digraph detailed in Section 3.2. Moreover, low-rank regression has been seldom used in imaginggenetic analysis.\nThe ' 2;1 -norm regularization penalizes U in a row-wise manner by considering the correlations among the variables to output important variables. Specifically, Eq. (3) first conducts variable selection and low-rank regression to convert X to yield its low-dimensional representation XU, and then applies an orthogonal transformation to yield XUV > , by which we can estimate the latent associations between X and Y. These sequential transformations allow to conduct heterogeneous data associations, i.e., molecular-level genetic data and tissue-level brain imaging data in our work."}, {"section_title": "Sparse Graph Representation in SNPs", "text": "As a gene sequence includes a number of SNPs, there may be high correlation among SNPs [21] , [51] . Moreover, while there are thousands of SNPs, some of them may not be associated with neuroimaging phenotypes. In this work, we further hypothesize that the internal correlations among SNPs can give additional information to make better association between SNPs and neuroimaging phenotypes. Thus, we utilize such potential correlations in our regression method in the form of regularization.\nThe correlations between each pair of the SNPs are often measured by Pearson correlation, with no consideration of high order relations. To better reflect the complex relations among SNPs, we exploit a graphical representation, where we explicitly denote the relational characteristics among variables such that if a variable (i.e., target) can be represented by a linear combination of a subset of other variables (i.e., sources), then there are directed arcs from the sources to the target. To be precise, we design a sparse acyclic digraph by denoting each variable as a node and representing relations among variables with directed arcs. By the acyclic property, we confine that each variable can be represented by the other variables to avoid obtaining a trivial solution. In addition, by the digraph, the out-arcs and the in-arcs are differentiated with different meanings. Lastly, we hypothesize that there are some representative variables with which all the variables can be represented effectively.\nLet G \u00bc \u00f0N ; E\u00de denote a graph with a set of N nodes (i.e., p nodes (or variables) in this paper) and a set of E edges. An arc x i ! x j denotes that x i is involved in representing x j and the contribution of x i is specified by s ij . The larger the value of s ij , the more x i is involved in representing x j . The number of out-arcs of a node x i , called as 'out-degree' and denoted by deg \u00fe \u00f0x i \u00de, means its contribution to represent other variables. The number of in-arcs of a node x j , called as 'in-degree' and denoted by deg \u00c0 \u00f0x j \u00de, indicates the contribution of x j in representing x j . Obviously, the outdegrees of the representative variables and the outdegrees of the nonrepresentative 3 variables are, respectively, at most \u00f0p \u00c0 1\u00de and zero. By assuming d 0 as the number of representative variables, their corresponding indegrees are at most \u00f0d 0 \u00c0 1\u00de (excluding itself) and at most d 0 , i.e., a non-representative variable is presented by all d 0 representative variables. By denoting the set of edges in a matrix S 2 R p\u00c2p , where s ij denotes an edge from a node x i to a node x j , we can derive a sparse graph representation problem as follows:\nwhere p 2 R p\u00c21 is a bias term, a and b are the control parameters, and diag\u00f0S\u00de denotes the diagonal values of a matrix S. The ' 2;1 -norm regularization imposes unimportant rows of S to be zeros, while the ' 1 -norm regularization pushes unimportant elements of S to be zeros. Note that 1) the ' 2;1 -norm regularization in Eq. (4) determines the set of variables, which are involved in representing at least one of all the variables; 2) the ' 1 -norm regularization selects a subset of the variables, which are chosen by ' 2;1 -norm regularization, useful in representing each variable independently, e.g., x k and x l , respectively, are represented by two representative variables (i.e., x i and x j ) and three representative 3 .

(3) conducts a low-rank variable selection between Y and X to output informative variables, while Eq. (4) conducts a sparse graph representation on variables. We can integrate these two objective functions in a unified framework to obtain our final objective function as follows:\nNote that the regularization of \u00bdU; S k k 2;1 plays the role of finding informative variables (i.e., SNPs) by jointly solving these two regression problems of kY \u00c0 XUV\n, where \u00bdU; S 2 R p\u00c2\u00f0p\u00feq\u00de implies that Eq. (5) selects the variables (i.e., SNPs) be jointly satisfying the constraints of two variable selection models. This makes the selected SNPs more confident. As integrating it with the low-rank constraint on V, both variable selection and lowrank regression may further be strengthened. More specifically, the low-rank constraint outputs the low-rank (i.e., low-dimensional) representations of X and Y so that the sequential variable selection is conducted by avoiding the impact of the noise of the data, hence improving its performance. In contrast, by simultaneously considering the correlations between the responses and the variables as well as the correlations among the variables, the structured sparsity constraints ensure the low-rank constraint to explore the low-rank representations of data on the 'purified data' by removing uninformative SNPs.\nAfter optimizing Eq.

We listed the detail of the competing methods as follows:\nRR imposes an ' 2 -norm penalty regularization to shrink the regression coefficients. This minimizes a penalized residual sum of squares for analyzing multiple regression data. Since the variances of least square estimation may be large, the estimation of RR could be far from the true values while multi-collinearity occurs, i.e., variables used in a regression are highly correlated.\nMTFL employs a least square loss function plus a structured sparse regularizer (e.g., an ' 2;1 -norm regularization as in our method) to learn sparse representations shared across multiple responses. This method only considers the correlations between the variables and the responses and is able to control the number of learned common variables across the responses using the structured sparse regularization. MTFL has been widely used in AD study, such as [46] , but does not consider the correlations among the responses. gMTFL considers the interlinked relationship among the genotypes (i.e., the variables) to select informative genotypes by considering each SNP as a variable and each neuroimaging feature as a responses (i.e., a learning task) in a multi-task regression framework. gMTFL does not take the correlations among the responses into account. sRRR conducts low-rank regression on both the neuroimaging phenotypes and the genotypes and implicitly enforces the sparsity in the regression coefficients.

For performance comparison, we exploited the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a metric.\nWe used 5-fold cross-validation to compare all methods. Specifically, we first randomly partitioned the whole dataset into 5 subsets. We then selected one subset for testing and used the remaining 4 subsets for training. We repeated the whole process 10 times to avoid the possible bias during dataset partitioning for cross-validation. The final performance was obtained by averaging results from all experiments.

This manifested that our method accurately estimated the imaging features thanks to the constraints of (1) low-rank and (2) acyclic digraph with sparse penalty in a unified framework. The paired t-tests at 95 percent significance level between our method and each of the competing methods showed that the respective p-values were less than 0.001 on both Small and Large datasets. The more the selected SNPs in the regression model, the better performance the method achieved, i.e., smaller RMSE. That is because more SNPs enabled to build reliable models. However, the values of RMSE of all methods first decreased to their minima ( i.e., about 160 selected SNPs out of 304 SNPs) and then began to increase on Small dataset. This indicated that too many SNPs may add noise or redundancy, thus it is essential to conduct SNP selection on high-dimensional data for imaging-genetic analysis.\nIn our experiments, we averaged the absolute value of UV > in Eq. (5) from all 50 experiments to sort the resulting matrix in a descending order along the rows (or the columns) to select the top 10 SNPs (or to obtain the orders of all ROIs) of our proposed method. We then reported the heatmaps of the regression coefficients of the selected top 10 SNPs and the ordered ROIs, respectively, of all methods, in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 . In particular, from Fig. 3 , we have the following observations:\nThe top 10 selected SNPs were from six genes, i.e., PIC-ALM, SORCS1, APOE, DAPK1, ADAM10, and SORL1, each of which has been reported as one of the top 40 genes at AlzGene database. Specifically, our proposed method selected the APOE gene on two datasets. In addition, our method selected six SNPs from PICALM geneand threeSNPsfromSORCS1gene, onSmalldataset, and selected four SNPs, two SNPs, one SNP, one SNP, and one SNP, respectively, from gene PICALM, SORCS1,DAPK1,ADAM10andSORL1,onLargedataset. It is noteworthy that the selected top 10 SNPs from two datasets with our method only have four overlappings, i.e., APOE (rs429358), PICALM (rs11234495), PICALM (rs7938033), and SORCS1 (rs10884387), even though Small dataset is the subset of Large dataset. That is, the top SNPs selected in Small dataset (i.e., PIC-ALM (rs10501604), PICALM (rs10898427), SORCS1 (rs685316), SORCS1 (rs669061), PICALM (rs10792821), and PICALM (rs713346)) weren't overlapped with the top 10 SNPs selected in Large dataset. Actually, their corresponding ranks were top 32, 45, 22, 24, 12 , and 20, out of 2,098 SNPs in the experiments of Large dataset. The reason may be that there are more noisy SNPs in Largedataset,comparedtoSmall datast. Our experimental results on two datasets selected top 10 SNPs from three common genes, such as PICALM, SORCS1, and APOE. A number of literature have indicated that they are in relation to AD. Specifically, first, PICLAM, a new Ab toxicity modifier gene, has been frequently reported to significantly associate with a risk of late-onset AD [1] , [4] , [49] . For example, the SNPs such as 'rs7938033' and 'rs11234495', which were selected on two datasets, have been reported in relation to heritable neuro-developmental disorders [6] . In particular, the SNPs 'rs11234495' was experimentally indicated to strongly associate with both the left formation and the right hippocampal formation [19] . Second, the APOE-4 variant of the APOE gene has been reported to be responsible for the production of apolipoprotein E [6] . In our experiments, all methods selected its SNP 'rs429358' as one of top SNPs and our method indicated its strongest association with phenotypes. Lastly, as [55] , [56] presented, the temporal cortex of gene SORCS1 influences Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) processing to play an important role in the regulation of Ab production in AD. Even though these three genes (such as SORL1, ADAM10, and DAPK1) were only selected as top 10 SNPs on the experiments of Large dataset, they have been reported in relation to AD. For example, the genetic variants in the gene SORL1 have been shown to associate with the age at onset of AD [57] , [58] , while ADAM10 gene encodes the major a-secretase responsible for cleaving APP in families with late-onset AD [59] , [60] . In addition, DAPK1 plays an important role in neuronal apoptosis and could affect the pathology of late-onset AD [61] , [62] .

"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we proposed a novel low-rank graphregularized sparse regression model to find the associations between SNPs and brain imaging features. The proposed low-rank constraint and sparse graph representation regularization in SNPs along with a structured sparsity constraint in a linear regression framework helped to effectively utilize the inherent information in genetic data and brain imaging data, and thus finding informative associations. The experimental results indicated that our proposed method achieved the best performance of imaging-genetic analysis, compared to the competing methods. Although the proposed method has been demonstrated to outperform all the competing methods in our experiments, the performance of our proposed framework can be further improved for SNP selection. First, we assume there is a linear relationship between SNPs and ROIs, but the data are often found to have complex nonlinear relationship. In this case, even though a number of literature have reported that the sparsity-inducing regularization may implicitly result in nonlinear relationship, an explicit assumption of nonlinear relationship (e.g., mapping the original data into kernel space by kernel functions) could be tried in our further work. Second, we only selected 16 ROIs related to AD to conduct SNP selection in this work. It should have other ROIs which are also in relation to SNPs in imaging-genetic analysis. For example, Vounou et al. focused on the association analysis between the whole brain (i.e., 93 ROIs in our work) and the entire genome [18] . Hence, SNP selection with the whole brain imaging features should be very interesting for imagegenetic analysis as the current focus can be taken as one of its special cases. Third, in this work, we considered only a single brain imaging modality, it would be also important to extend our model to SNP selection with variables of multiple brain imaging modalities, which have been demonstrated to provide complementary information to each other in AD diagnosis [38] \" For more information on this or any other computing topic, please visit our Digital Library at www.computer.org/publications/dlib."}]
