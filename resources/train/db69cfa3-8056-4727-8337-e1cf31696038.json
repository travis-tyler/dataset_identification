[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Motion-contaminated T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results in misestimates of brain structure. Because conventional T1w scans are not collected with direct measures of head motion, a practical alternative is needed to identify potential motion-induced bias in measures of brain anatomy. Head movements during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning of 266 healthy adults (20-89 years) were analyzed to reveal stable features of in-scanner head motion. The magnitude of head motion increased with age and exhibited within-participant stability across different fMRI scans. fMRI head motion was then related to measurements of both quality control (QC) and brain anatomy derived from a T1w structural image from the same scan session. A procedure was adopted to \"flag\" individuals exhibiting excessive head movement during fMRI or poor T1w quality rating. The flagging procedure reliably reduced the influence of head motion on estimates of gray matter thickness across the cortical surface. Moreover, T1w images from flagged participants exhibited reduced estimates of gray matter thickness and volume in comparison to age-and gender-matched samples, resulting in inflated effect sizes in the relationships between regional anatomical measures and age. Gray matter thickness differences were noted in numerous regions previously reported to undergo prominent atrophy with age. Recommendations are provided for mitigating this potential confound, and highlight how the procedure may lead to more accurate measurement and comparison of anatomical features.

"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Accurate neuroimaging measurements of brain structure are essential for anatomical characterization, betweenmodality image registration, and functional localization. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide high-resolution measurements of gray and white matter anatomy that are often the focus of within-and betweenparticipant comparisons of aging [see Dickerson et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2009; Fotenos et al., 2005] , development [e.g., Tamnes et al., 2010] , clinical disorders [e.g., Cannon et al., 2015; Dickerson et al., 2009; Kempton et al., 2011] , and therapeutic intervention [e.g., Bearden et al., 2008; Dazzan et al., 2005] . In practice, structural MRI scans are readily analyzed with convenient, automated image segmentation tools that derive measurements from an individual's regional neuroanatomy (e.g., thickness, surface area, volume), often implemented with freely available software packages [e.g., FreeSurfer [FS] , VBM8, FSL-VBM; Ashburner and Friston, 2000; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999a; Smith et al., 2004] that have been externally validated with manual tracing and post-mortem analyses [Cardinale et al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2009; Kuperberg et al., 2003; Rosas et al., 2002; Salat et al., 2004; Sanchez-Benavides et al., 2010] .\nA combination of objective precision and ease of rapid quantification makes the automatic measurement of anatomy a practical method for studying brain morphometry in healthy and diseased populations. The performance of many segmentation algorithms relies on features of image intensity, probabilistic matching to tissue-type priors, and local spatial relationships between expected brain structures. Consequently, the accuracy of measures extracted from structural MRI is largely contingent on initial image quality, which is sensitive to multiple sources of variability. For example, differences at the participant level [e.g., gray and white matter intensity contrast; Westlye et al., 2009] , and instrument-related noise [e.g., image gradient distortions; Jovicich et al., 2006] may both significantly influence estimates of brain structure [also see Gronenschild et al., 2012; Han et al., 2006] .\nIn line with the above, in-scanner head motion during MRI has been observed to induce structured and often visually detectable artifacts in brain images [e.g., ringing, blurring; Bellon et al., 1986; Wood and Henkelman, 1985; Zaitsev et al., 2015] . Substantial emphasis has been placed on characterizing how motion-induced artifacts affect echo-planar imaging (EPI): both in functional MRI [fMRI; Power et al., 2014; Satterthwaite et al., 2012; Siegel et al., 2014; Van Dijk et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014] and diffusion weighted imaging [DWI; Koldewyn et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2014; Yendiki et al., 2013] . There has been less focus on characterizing how spurious motion-related biases impact high-resolution T1-weighted (T1w) images. This has been due, in part, to limitations in acquiring direct estimates of head motion during T1w sequences. A recent study showed that measures of brain structure from T1w scans contaminated by experimentally induced motion were reliably different from uncontaminated scans of the same individuals [Reuter et al., 2015] . Specifically, instructed patterns of head motion during structural MRI resulted in underestimates of gray matter volume and thickness in healthy young adults. While that report did not detail how the degree of instructed movements related to the natural variation in the types and magnitudes of motion observed across individuals, many cross-cohort studies contrast individuals who are likely to differ in their degree of motion during MRI [e.g., older vs. younger subjects, children with autism spectrum disorders vs. healthy controls; Chan et al., 2014; Koldewyn et al., 2014; Yendiki et al., 2013] . As a result, the variability in participant motion could systematically bias analyses of structural differences [e.g., Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016] .\nWithout employing procedures that prospectively correct or remove head motion-induced artifacts from anatomical scans [e.g., PROPELLER, PROMO, volumetric navigators, Pipe, 1999; Tisdall et al., 2012 Tisdall et al., , 2016 White et al., 2010] , biases due to variability in head motion are likely to confound studies of brain structure in addition to any processing steps or statistical analyses that rely on accurate measurements of brain anatomy (e.g., localization of functional activations, surface-mapping, registration of functional and anatomical images between participants). Accordingly, until quantification and correction tools are further developed and sufficiently adopted for T1w MRI, a practical alternative is necessary in order to advance the interpretation of anatomical measurements. One method for identifying scans with potential motion contamination is to visually inspect structural scans for artifacts and screen them out [as done in Reuter et al., 2015] . While this visual inspection technique is commonplace in structural neuroimaging, it has inherent limitations intrinsic to many subjective procedures including the presupposition that all forms of motion-related bias are detectable by visual inspection and the possibility that subjective quality assessments may exhibit high inter-and within-rater variability [e.g., Mantyla et al., 1997; Scheltens et al., 1997] . To overcome some of these preceding limitations, we propose some intuitive hypotheses: (1) participants who move more in one scan of a given scan session will move more in other scans collected during the same session, (2) scans that acquire movement estimates may be used to flag structural scans that lack direct estimates of motion but contain motion-induced artifacts, (3) many of the anatomical scans flagged by high movement may not otherwise be identified by visual inspection alone, (4) flagging potentially problematic scans can help mitigate the effects of movement on brain morphometry, (5) the anatomical scans flagged for movement and poor experimenter-defined image quality will exhibit systematically biased estimates of brain structure, and (6) removing flagged scans from an estimation sample will influence the measurement of brain structure.\nHow might we begin to test these predictions? In addition to T1w structural data, many study designs acquire functional scans (e.g., task-evoked, resting-state) for which frame-to-frame motion estimates are routinely derived. The primary objective of this report was to determine whether the measurements of head motion quantified during these functional scans (e.g., frame-by-frame displacements [FD] ) might benefit the identification of structural brain scans that contain motion-related bias. Specifically, we predicted that FD accurately summarizes individual differences in scanner motion such that one's relative rank within the distribution of average FD values is consistent across fMRI scans. We hypothesized that this relationship would extend to T1w acquisitions whereby increasing FD would be associated with reduced QC ratings of T1w scan quality. Lastly, we predicted that elevated average FD and low QC ratings could be combined to flag subsets of participants whose T1w structural scans are most likely susceptible to motionrelated bias. In addition to determining whether the movement-related features noted above exist, we intended to measure the impact of motion-related bias on the measurement accuracy of anatomical differences (e.g., regional thickness) detected over the healthy adult lifespan.\nWe analyzed data from 266 healthy adult participants, age 20-89, in order to (1) examine the correlation of individuals' tendency to move during scans where head motion is currently measureable (e.g., fMRI), (2) test how well the motion estimates from these independent scans complement the subjective quality control (QC) ratings of T1w anatomical scan quality, and (3) determine whether removing scans \"flagged\" by a combination of QC ratings and consistently elevated FD alters the measured effects of both aging and motion on brain morphometry. The current dataset allowed extensive measurement of head motion across several EPI scans with differing taskdemands in a single session using the same scanner and scanning protocol. Furthermore, alongside careful estimation of each individual's anatomy (e.g., semi-automated FS processing), the dataset provided a well-balanced sampling of the healthy adult lifespan (e.g., at least 30 individuals in each decade of age between 20 and 90 years) with substantial variance in average magnitude of head motion for quantifying individual differences. Crucially, given the purposes of this investigation, accurate quantification of individual variability in movement and anatomy could be considered jointly in an extensive dataset where agerelated observations could be systematically assessed."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The present sample is a subset of healthy adult participants (n 5 266) aged 20-89 years (M 5 54.5, SD 5 20.4, 169 female) enrolled in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS). This subsample includes at least 30 participants in each decade of the sampled age range and represents individuals who performed the complete series of seven fMRI runs [e.g., Chan et al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2015; Park et al., 2012 Park et al., , 2013 see Fig. 1] . Critically, this inclusion criterion allowed extensive measurement of participant inscanner head motion across a variety of task categories with differing behavioral demands (e.g., scans including \"active\" behavioral response demands versus scans requiring no overt behavioral responses).\nParticipants were recruited from the Dallas-Fort Worth community and provided written consent before participation.

During the MRI session, a T1w structural MRI scan and seven fMRI scans were collected using a Philips Achieva 3.0T scanner (Table I ). In short, this involved: a sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) three-dimensional T1w anatomical scan (TR 5 8.1 ms, TE 5 3.7 ms, TI 5 1,100 ms, flip-angle 5 128, shot interval 5 2,100 ms, FOV 5 204 3 256 mm, 160 sagittal slices with 1 mm 3 voxels, and scan duration 5 3 min and 57 s), and seven Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) acquisitions (all functional runs: TR 5 2000 ms, TE 5 25 ms, flip-angle 5 808, FOV 5 220 mm 3 220 mm, 43 interleaved axial slices per volume, 3.5/0 mm (slice-thickness/ gap) in-plane resolution 5 3.4 3 3.4 mm). The MRI protocol is depicted in Figure 1 . The seven BOLD runs comprised four task categories (\"VV,\" \"words,\" \"scenes,\" and \"rest\"; Table I ) collected in this order: two runs of a passive viewing ventral-visual stream localizer task (\"VV1\" and \"VV2\" scans; 202 frames each), a semantic classification task (e.g., \"living\"/\"nonliving\" judgment; \"words\" scan; 231 frames), three runs of an incidental encoding task (e.g., \"water\"/\"no water\" judgment of outdoor scenes; \"scenes1,\" \"scenes2,\" and \"scenes3\" scans; 171 frames each), and a single restingstate scan (\"rest\" scan; 154 frames). The T1w scan was collected immediately after the third run of the incidental encoding task (scenes3) for all participants. Following the T1w acquisition, participants exited the magnet for a short break before returning for their resting-state fMRI scans. One participant did not provide complete data for their scenes2 scan (see Table I ), but was retained in the sample as they contributed sufficient functional and structural data to estimate the effects presented in this report. Experimenters verified that participants complied with all scan instructions via verbal confirmation (see Supporting Information for extended fMRI task instructions)."}, {"section_title": "Data Preprocessing fMRI preprocessing", "text": "BOLD images were preprocessed to reduce known artifacts. Five \"dummy\" volumes were first discarded from the beginning of each functional run to allow the MR signal to reach steady state. Pre-processing involved: (i) correction of slice intensity differences attributable to the interleaved acquisition within each TR, and (ii) motion correction for head movement within and across runs. Motion correction was performed with SPM8's realignment procedure, which applies a least squares approach to perform a six-parameter (three translational and three rotational) rigid-body transformation for every functional frame to a reference image [Friston et al., 1995] . Realignment was performed within-participants for each run by estimating the transformation matrix of every functional frame relative to the very first volume collected in the applicable task category (e.g., all frames from VV1 and VV2 scans were realigned to the very first frame of the VV1 run, whereas every frame of the words scan was realigned to the first frame in the words scan)."}, {"section_title": "Head motion estimates", "text": "In-scanner head motion for each functional run was quantified with frame-by-frame displacement (FD) as in Power et al. [2012] . In short, for a given fMRI run the six realignment parameters estimated from SPM8 (three translations in mm and three rotations in radians) indexed the absolute displacement of the participant's head at each TR relative to the first EPI frame collected for the task. First, rotational estimates were converted from radians to mm displacements relative to a sphere with a radius of 50 mm MRI scanning protocol. The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study data acquisition protocol included a T1w anatomical (T1) scan and seven functional MRI (BOLD) scans. Healthy adult participants (n 5 266, 20-89 years) were each imaged in a single session on the same MRI scanner. Acquiring seven fMRI runs allowed thorough examination of the variation in average head movement (i.e., frame-by-frame displacements [FD] ) within and between individuals (see text and Table I for scan information). Conversely, T1w quality control (QC) was performed using researcher-defined quality ratings. While all data were collected in a single imaging session, participants took a brief midsession break, (i.e., 10-15 min) exiting the scanner following the T1w acquisition. Of the BOLD scans, \"VV\" and \"words\" employed block design whereas \"scenes\" and \"rest\" were event-related designs. \"Words\" and \"scenes\" tasks involved active behavioral responses in response to stimulus delivery (i.e., button-press), while \"VV\" and \"rest\" scans involved passive viewing of visually presented stimuli. Combining estimates of EPI head motion from various fMRI scans with T1w QC ratings allowed close inspection of potential motion-related bias in estimates of anatomy.

The resulting six-dimensional time-series was differentiated in order to index the relative displacement of the participant's head in each dimension for each EPI frame relative to its immediately preceding frame across the task. FD was calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the six differentiated realignment parameters at each frame of a scan (i.e., total movement for each frame was summarized as a positive displacement value).\nAverage frame-by-frame displacements ( FD) were calculated for each individual within each of their task scans and are distinguished by subscripts throughout this report (Fig. 1) . Task FD, which indexed the amount of motion occurring across a given task, was calculated for each participant as the average of the their FDs across individual runs of the same task (e.g., FD VV was the average of FD VV1 and FD VV2 ). Task FDs were further collapsed into FD all2task (average FD across all four task types). Averaging independent task\nFDs also minimized possible biasing as a function of the number frames collected in a given run or the number of runs contributing to a given task."}, {"section_title": "T1-weighted image quality control (QC) ratings", "text": "All T1w scans were visually checked and rated for scan quality by two researchers (N.S. and P.A.). Raters evaluated images for both motion-related artifacts [e.g., ringing, blurring, ghosting, and striping; Bellon et al., 1986; Wood and Henkelman, 1985; Zaitsev et al., 2015] and artifacts related to other general properties of brain image quality, such as head coverage, radiofrequency noise, gradient distortions, signal inhomogeneity, wrapping, and susceptibility artifacts [Bennett et al., 1996; Ericsson et al., 1988; Pusey et al., 1986; Sled and Pike, 1998; Vargas et al., 2009] . As in Reuter et al., raters attributed an overall qualitative quality control (QC) assessment of scan quality to each individual's structural image on a three-category scale (\"pass,\" \"warn,\" or \"fail\") according, in part, to previously documented criteria [Reuter et al., 2015 , http://cbs.fas.harvard. edu/science/core-facilities/neuroimaging/informationinvestigators/qc]. We include a description of the criteria we used in the supplementary section of this report and also provide extensive documentation so that other researchers may adopt similar screening procedures (see below and Supporting Information)."}, {"section_title": "Morphometric estimates", "text": "Estimates of brain morphometry were quantified with the default image-processing pipeline of FreeSurfer v5.3 [FS; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999a] , which provided volumetric segmentation and surface-based cortical reconstruction of individuals' anatomical data. This involved brain extraction using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, volumetric segmentation, tessellation-based generation of white matter (WM), and pial surfaces, inflation of the surfaces to a sphere, and surface shape-based spherical registration of each individual's \"native\" surface renderings to the FsAverage atlas [Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl et al., 1999b,; Segonne et al., 2004 Segonne et al., , 2005 .\nWhereas segmentation provided general measures of volumetric anatomy (e.g., gray matter [GM] volume, white matter [WM] volume, subcortical GM volume), surface reconstructions allowed estimates of GM thickness and surface area. Surface area was calculated as the sum of tessellated areas at each location (i.e., vertex) over the full cortical GM-WM boundary in an individual's \"native\" surface representation. Cortical GM thickness was calculated as the distance between the GM-WM boundary (\"white\" surface) and the outer cortical surface (\"pial\" surface) at each point across the cortical mantle. This surface-based thickness estimation is not restricted to voxel resolution of the original T1w image and can detect sub-millimeter differences between groups [Fischl and Dale, 2000] validated with both histology and manual tracing [Rosas et al., 2002; Kuperberg et al., 2003] .\nFS processing has been demonstrated to have high test-retest reliability in identifying and measuring various aspects of brain anatomy across scanner manufacturers and field strengths [Dickerson et al., 2008; Han et al., 2006; Jovicich et al., 2006; Morey et al., 2010; Reuter et al., 2012] . However, it is important to point out that the FS processing pipeline requires careful inspection of processed outputs to ensure that segmentations and reconstructions are spatially accurate and anatomically correct. At times, manual intervention is required to correct errors related to inaccuracies in the Talairach atlas transformation, insufficient removal of non-brain tissue (e.g., dura mater along superior aspects of cortex), inclusions of vessels or other tissue that neighbor the cortex (e.g., often near temporal, orbitofrontal or posterior occipital locations), and field inhomogeneities or inadequate intensity normalization that obscure the GM-WM boundary. In datasets of aging and/ or clinical populations, manual intervention is particularly important because of possible true anatomical abnormalities (e.g., atrophy-induced uncertainty in tissue-type boundaries, white matter hyper-intensities imaged with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, enlarged ventricles) that may be resolved inappropriately by the default FS pipeline.\nThrough an iterative process, FS data for each individual included in this report was visually inspected, edited for inaccuracies (with re-checking and re-editing, as needed), and verified by an independent researcher. All researchers involved in editing were instructed from the official FreeSurfer Wiki and editing tutorials (http://freesurfer.net/ fswiki/FreeSurferWiki; https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard. edu/fswiki/FreeSurferBeginnersGuide), an in-house guide to our laboratory's FS editing procedures, and in-person training sessions with a more experienced researcher. We have posted an up-to-date \"live\" manual of in-house FreeSurfer processing procedures to our laboratory webpage (http://vitallongevity.utdallas.edu/cnl/publications) r Savalia et al. r r 476 r so that other researchers may follow the recommendations and editing procedures we highlight in the manuscript, and as they are continually refined. Details of the editing procedure and instructions are also included in the supplementary section of this report (Supporting Information). Particular attention was paid in fixing poor skull removal, correcting improperly segmented WM, applying control points to improve tissue classification near the GM-WM boundary, and ameliorating persistent defects in surface reconstruction.\nIn addition to the manual editing noted above, each participant's intracranial volume (ICV) was manually traced [see Kennedy et al., 2009 ] and used to correct for all statistical effects related to volumetric measures of brain structure. A number of studies have suggested that head size (e.g., ICV) covaries with gray and white matter volume and cortical surface area, but generally not with GM thickness [Im et al., 2008; Pakkenberg and Gundersen, 1997] ; accordingly, participant gender was used instead of ICV as a nuisance variable for statistical analyses of GM thickness [Barnes et al., 2010] . The results of this report remained qualitatively similar when using both covariates in statistical models. Recent evidence also suggests that FS pipeline outputs may differ based on FS version, workstation and operating system [Gronenschild et al., 2012] ; all processing in this study was performed using FreeSurfer v5.3 on a single Enterprise Linux (CentOS 6.6) server.\nSurface-based thickness maps were generated by first bringing the fsaverage-registered left and right hemisphere anatomical surfaces into register with each other using deformation maps from a landmark-based registration of the left and right fsaverage surfaces to a hybrid left-right fsaverage surface [fs_LR; Van Essen et al., 2012a] and resampled to a resolution of 163,842 vertices per hemisphere (164k fs_LR) using Caret tools [Van Essen et al., 2001] . Each individual's \"native\" FS-generated left and right hemisphere surfaces were deformed to the left and right 164k fs_LR surface meshes using single deformation maps, allowing for minimal resampling of anatomical data. Vertex-wise thickness estimates for each participant were deformed from \"native\" FS-derived surfaces to 164k fs_LR space with the same deformation maps used in the original registration. Individuals' cortical thickness maps were smoothed with a 15 mm kernel (full width-half maximum, [FWHM] ) within the surface representations of each of the two hemispheres. This smoothing parameter was adopted so as to be comparable to previous surface-based reports examining measurements of cortical thickness [e.g., Fjell et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2015] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Within-session stability of fMRI head motion\nWe first tested whether a participant's average head motion ( FD) was strongly correlated across scans collected within the same session.

To test this hypothesis, two ANCOVA models were constructed to compare FD all2task and QC ratings to one another and to morphometry derived from FreeSurfer.

We emphasize that the sizable cross-rater variability suggests that the range of possible T1w artifacts may not be well represented by the category distinctions of subjective raters and reinforces the motivation to identify more quantitative approaches.\nTo exercise caution in flagging problematic anatomical data, the lower of the two valuations (more stringent) from the raters determined the final category label given to each scan (e.g., one rating of \"warn\" and another rating of \"pass\" resulted in a final label of \"warn\"). Ultimately, 161 T1w scans were labeled \"pass\" (60.5%), 88 labeled \"warn\" (33.1%), and 17 labeled \"fail\" (6.4%).

We calculated the vertex-wise full-partial correlations of GM thickness and FD all2task while controlling for age and gender before and after removing flagged scans from the estimation sample. After removing the 31 flagged scans, the distribution of effect sizes was significantly reduced compared with 1,000 pseudo-randomly re-sampled groups of the same size (Fig. 6A) .

Examining the flagged anatomical scans revealed that the regions most prone to potential movement-related effects include many reported to undergo prominent atrophy with age. Taken together, the results suggest that natural in-scanner head movements exert a potential confound on structural MRI measurements when left uncontrolled. This take home point is particularly relevant for studies comparing subgroups with high variability in head motion (e.g., older adults, adolescents, clinical populations), and/or studies examining multiple timepoints of data acquisition (i.e., longitudinal studies). In addition to describing the movement-related observations we noted, we also offered readers some initial recommendations to overcome this potential source of bias in their own datasets.\nA substantial body of research has focused on measuring and controlling for participant head motion during echo-planar imaging [Friston et al., 1995; Jenkinson and Smith, 2001; Woods et al., 1992] . The nature of functional acquisitions (e.g., a BOLD image collected every TR) provides an opportunity to directly measure head position over the course of the scan. Since changes in head position are calculable frame-to-frame in EPI, a variety of methods have been developed to identify and account for motionrelated variance [e.g., frame censoring, regression; Jo et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014; Power et al., 2014; Satterthwaite et al., 2013] . Likewise, the confound of motion artifacts remains an ongoing problem for structural brain imaging, where correction methods have not yet mitigated their bias. In contrast to echo-planar imaging (e.g., fMRI, DWI), typical T1w structural acquisitions generate a single image over a several minute span without any direct estimations of how head position changes over the course of the scan. When direct measures have been available, one recent study has shown alarming inaccuracy in estimates of gray matter thickness and volume in the presence of head movements [Reuter et al., 2015] , albeit in a smaller preliminary experiment that prescribed that motion.\nGiven that head motion confounds such measurement but is typically unavailable with T1w structural scans, we are met with a key challenge: how can we ensure that scans acquired without direct movement information are Regional effects of age-related cortical thinning are reduced when removing flagged scans that are susceptible to potential motion-related bias. (a) The cumulative distribution function of vertex-wise age vs. GM thickness correlations differs before (blue line) and after (red line) removing anatomical scans flagged by T1w quality ratings and elevated FD all2task . The subtle rightward shift in correlations (toward z(r) 5 0) indicates a significant reduction in overall effect sizes when structural scans flagged for potentially motion-related artifacts have been removed from the estimation sample. (b) A scatter plot of the correlations (Fisher's z-transformed r-values) of anatomical parcel thickness versus age before and after removing flagged scans reveals that the majority of regional effect sizes are reduced (86% of parcels) after scans susceptible to potential motion-related bias have been filtered from the sample (diagonal line indicates no difference). (c) A surface-based map illustrates that the differences in average correlation between age and GM thickness occur variously across anatomical parcels (all relationships remained negative; color-scale reflects the strength and direction of correlation change after removing flagged scans). Reduced age effects are prominent along the cortical midline (e.g., cingulate cortex, precuneus, calcarine sulcus), bilateral lateral temporal cortex, right lateral parietal, and right anterior insular cortex, suggesting that these particular regions may be most susceptible to misestimates of age-related cortical thinning when motion-related bias is left uncontrolled.

Although continued development of prospective methods will improve the way that future studies use structural imaging to study anatomy [see Zaitsev et al., 2015] , development of such innovations is not applicable to a number of extremely valuable legacy datasets and to many other ongoing large-scale data collection initiatives [e.g., ABIDE, ADHD-200, ADNI, Betula, DLBS, FCON1000, HCP, HABS, NIMH adolescents, PNC, SLS; ADHD-200-Consortium, 2012; Biswal et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2014; Dagley et al., 2015; Di Martino et al., 2014; Giedd et al., 1999; Jack et al., 2008; Nilsson et al., 1997 Nilsson et al., , 2004 Park et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 2014; Schaie and Willis, 2010; Van Essen et al., 2012b,] . While many studies have led efforts to correct the motion-related bias in EPI, less work has demonstrated a suitable technique for mitigating the motionrelated bias on T1w imaging. To maximize data cleanliness, the sensitivity and reliability of morphometric findings, and predictive power/large sample size, a practical alternative is necessary to retroactively control for the motion-related biases in T1w measures of brain anatomy.\nOne recommendation has been to assess image quality based on visual inspection, either removing problematic scans or reacquiring higher quality data when practical [Reuter et al., 2015] . However, a combination of intra-and inter-rater variability and an under-characterized framework for appraising MR image quality currently renders this approach sub-optimal. We proposed an objective method to supplement QC ratings wherein independent scans that measure head motion in the same scan session (e.g., EPI sequences) are leveraged to identify potentially motion-contaminated T1w images. Critically, QC ratings and FD predicted non-overlapping variance in estimates of brain structure, suggesting that the two measures complement one-another in flagging potentially problematic data points. Of note, T1w scans flagged by a combination of FD and QC ratings: (1) increased with increasing age, and (2) exhibited considerably reduced global and regional estimates of gray matter volume and thickness. Reductions in gray matter volume and thickness are well documented as a hallmark of healthy aging and cognitive decline [DeKosky and Scheff, 1990; Dickerson et al., 2008 Dickerson et al., , 2012 Sowell et al., 2003] . We suggest that these effects may in some cases be overestimated, particularly in certain brain locations, by the inclusion of biased estimates from T1w structural scans with motion artifacts. The present work leveraged the variability in head motion and morphometry in a healthy adult sample to show that: (1) independent estimates of motion significantly predicted GM thickness (independent of age and gender), and (2) motion slightly but significantly biased thickness estimates in several regions that are often highlighted to undergo cortical thinning with increasing age [e.g., medial PFC, cingulate cortex, precuneus, IFG and anterior insula, SMG, lateral temporal cortex; Fjell et al., 2009; Lemaitre et al., 2012; Raz et al., 2005; Salat et al., 2004; Storsve et al., 2014] .\nIt is important to note that many of the age-associated differences in morphometry found with T1w imaging are robust neuroanatomical findings supported by more direct methods of anatomical measurement [e.g., histological studies of neuronal counts, cell density, and thickness; Morrison and Hof, 1997; Pakkenberg and Gundersen, 1997; Terry et al., 1987] . We emphasize that the removal of problematic T1w images in the present study did not negate the strong overall pattern of cortical thinning typically observed across the healthy adult lifespan, but instead highlight both where and how the effect size of age on thickness may be susceptible to misestimation when T1w scans with motion artifacts remain in a study sample. The present method of removing \"flagged\" scans from the estimation sample also reduced the association between head motion and GM thickness, suggesting that our flagging procedure may improve the accuracy of morphometric findings by mitigating the motion-related bias. Looking forward, we suspect that when automated and semi-automated methods of morphometry (e.g., ANTs, FSL, FreeSurfer) are used to compare populations where movement differences are more prominent or samples are smaller, the effects of head motion could be exacerbated and may incorrectly influence the conclusions drawn from the data [see Ducharme et al., 2016] . Moreover, it seems likely that motion-related bias will limit other T1w image processing steps that rely on accurate brain anatomy; for instance, our preliminary observations suggest that T1w scans flagged according to FD all2task and QC ratings exhibit reduced precision of within-modality registration (see Supporting Information).\nIt is worth considering that fMRI motion here serves as a proxy measure for the motion that occurs during structural scans. Given that T1w scanning may non-uniformly encode motion artifacts (e.g., movements during the middle of an MPRAGE scan can cause greater artifacts than motions near the start/end), more work is needed to evaluate how well fMRI motion estimates approximate the presence of movement-induced artifacts in T1w images. In addition to mean FD values, researchers may consider using median or variance of motion to describe one's tendency to move during a scan session (e.g., to avoid bias from abnormal motion spikes). In the current sample, our findings were qualitatively unchanged when flagging with median FD (see Supporting Information). Also, since different fMRI motion algorithms may vary in precision [e.g., Ardekani et al., 2001; Morgan et al., 2001 ] they may differentially predict motion during T1w scans (e.g., SPM used here); notably, calculating outputs from another common motion algorithm (FSL's MCFLIRT) revealed high consistency of parameters ( FD all2task between r(265) 5 0.99, P < 0.001) and identified all but one of the scans flagged here. Another possibility is that motion estimates from subsets of scans that are temporally proximal and/or similar in task-demands to the T1w acquisition are best suited for this prediction. For instance, the correlation matrix in r Savalia et al. r r 486 r Figure 2 suggests that the average movements in scans separated by greater intervening scans are nominally less correlated, particularly when participants exit the scanner between tasks (e.g., between \"scenes3\" and \"rest\" scans). While the current task-ordered scanning protocol limited the interpretability of temporal and task effects, the highly significant pair-wise relationships between individual rank ordering in FD across scans suggests that FD all2task likely quantifies an accurate cross-scan feature in individuals relative to a sample.\nA recent study revealed a number of findings parallel to those reported here while examining fMRI motion and structural estimates in a large pediatric and young adult sample [Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016] . Firstly, this previous report demonstrated that fMRI head motion may be stable across similar EPI scans. Second, the authors similarily identified a motion-related bias in gray matter volume estimates of a stringently screened study sample (with visual QC). The present report not only confirms the prior findings, but also furthers these observations in important ways to demonstrate: (1) fMRI head motion might reflect a relatively stable within-participant feature that persists across task demands and even over brief intervals where participants exit the scanner, (2) fMRI head motion and visual QC ratings exhibit statistically independent biases on multiple brain-wide measures of morphometry derived with T1w images, and (3) flagging a relatively small number of T1w scans via a combination of fMRI head motion and QC ratings may significantly reduce the effect of motion-related bias in analyses of morphometry. Notably, the significant continuous effect of fMRI motion parameters on T1w measures of whole-brain and regional GM thickness observed in the current report was undetectable in the study be Alexander Bloch et al. [2016] , possibly due to relatively less variability in head motion estimates than those found in the present adult lifespan dataset. Collectively, there is strong evidence that that average fMRI head motion measured within the same session is highly correlated within-participant and may perform well as a proxy measure for motion-related bias in scans without more direct measures of head movement. Additional work will be necessary to clarify precisely how motion-related bias in T1w images varies and overlaps across these distinct study populations. Presently, we reiterate that future studies aiming to characterize accurately the morphometry of groups that differ in their tendency to move (e.g., younger vs. older adults, patients vs. controls) will be strengthened by considering whether their observed effects are robust to the motion-related bias.\nThough the discrepancy in FD and QC ratings as well as the similarity in head motion during EPI and T1w structural scans warrant further study, the distinct influences of FD and QC ratings reported here substantiate the consideration of both measures when analyzing structural MRI. The present findings indicate that the presence of biases in anatomical scans may be partially controlled by a combination of methods relying on rater-defined QC and independent fMRI-based estimates of head motion. It is important to point out that this strategy of \"flagging\" structural images with potential bias is distinct from that of correcting the image sequences themselves or using motion estimates as covariates in statistical analyses. Approaches that covary motion estimates may provide a reasonable strategy for controlling motion-related biases on structural estimates; however, until FD all2task values can be more closely related to motion-induced artifacts in T1w scans it remains unclear whether using FD all2task as a statistical covariate can accurately remove the motion confound in morphometric analyses. Improving T1w acquisition techniques will surely advance future studies of brain morphometry, however, improved QC and data screening may be the most practical alternative for existing datasets and ongoing data collection initiatives. Researchers must bear in mind that aggressive screening procedures can be inherently limited. For example, since high in-scanner head motion and poor rater-defined T1w quality can be strongly tied to variables of interest (e.g., aging, differences in diseased populations), flagging these data points for removal can result in sampling bias (i.e., only older adults or individuals healthy enough to stay still in the scanner will be studied). Notably, this inherent bias is not conceptually very different from the bias introduced by MRI eligibility requirements in many studies (e.g., no history of cardiovascular issues or head trauma) that already preselect a relatively healthy subpopulation. Experimenters need to be continually mindful in this trade-off when adopting data screening techniques for T1w images.\nAn intriguing possibility is that dissimilarities in the propensity to move one's head during an imaging session is related to a trait-like feature [e.g., impulsivity, Kong et al., 2014] , and that this feature is a direct consequence of the local or global differences in brain anatomy highlighted here (e.g., Fig. 6 ). For instance, variation in the tendency to move during MRI might reflect a broader phenotype that is triggered in part by certain patterns of cortical thinning. One recent study reported that group-based differences in the resting-state correlations of the default mode network might distinguish high-motion scans of high-moving individuals from high-motion scans of lowmoving individuals [Zeng et al., 2014] . While we cannot rule out a comparable scenario here, given that excessive motion has been shown to systematically bias structural measures in within-subject longitudinal study designs [Reuter et al., 2015] , we suspect that the reduced morphometric estimates found in the structural images flagged by the present report are a consequence of excessive movement during T1w scans rather than a cause. Still, additional work will be needed to characterize a potential link between gray matter morphometry and trait-like head motion, particularly since a residual association between head motion and thickness persists after removing flagged scans; studying the extent to which head motion estimates r Motion-Related Artifacts in Structural Brain Images r r 487 r are stable across multiple imaging sessions [see Reuter et al., 2015; Van Dijk et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014; Zuo et al., 2014] might help examine this possibility. To this end, it remains essential to relate the stability of movement patterns during fMRI to direct measures of head motion during T1w scanning. Nonetheless, given the nature of the noted biases we have reported, we maintain that withinsession head motion measurements (as used in this report) can provide a critical data-flagging tool for removing potential motion-related bias in structural imaging studies.\nIt is evident that motion-related artifacts in structural MRI pose a potential limitation on measuring brain morphometry. Though most MRI research protocols acquire EPI images along with high-resolution structural scans, if motion estimates from independent scans (e.g., fMRI, DWI) are also unavailable, investigators would have to rely exclusively on visual QC while accepting that some residual motion-related bias is likely to limit their conclusions. Moreover, without adequate control for motionrelated bias, structural imaging studies requiring highly sensitive computational methods may be inherently limited (e.g., structural change in clinical trials). The present results are based on FreeSurfer estimates of morphometry, however the findings are likely to generalize to other structural estimation algorithms as well (e.g., ANTs, FSL, CIVET). As mentioned above, biased structural imaging may impair within-and between-modality image registration, but also functional localization methods, and analyses that require accurate mapping to anatomical surfaces [McDonald et al., 2010; Wig et al., 2014] , all of which often rely on accurate characterization of brain anatomy. Such problems with image registration may be exacerbated in cross-cohort comparisons by warping T1w anatomical scans to a template image with varying degrees of success due to differences in motion-related artifacts. The implication of this naturally extends to other measurements based on accurate estimates of brain anatomy including analysis of structural covariance networks [e.g., Zielinski et al., 2010; Montembeault et al., 2012] , volume based morphometry [e.g., Schmitter et al., 2015] , tract-based spatial statistics [e.g., fractional anisotropy, diffusivity; Smith et al., 2006 Smith et al., , 2007 , and brain lesions imaged with FLAIR [e.g., white matter hyper-intensities, infarctions; Hajnal et al., 1992; Brant-Zawadzki et al., 1996] , among many others."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The present findings suggest that motion-related bias in T1-weighted structural MRI may be retrospectively flagged and removed, in part, via a combination of procedures relying on rater-defined visual QC ratings and estimates of movement obtained from independent scans collected during the same scanning session. The inclusion of head motion estimates from other scans provides valuable information that would be missed by visual inspection alone. Broadly, the current findings may offer researchers a practical framework for objectively identifying problematic data points in other brain scans that also do not supply more direct measures of head motion (e.g., FLAIR, MRA). The observations highlighted warrant continued development and implementation of both qualitative and quantitative QC to improve the analysis of brain structure. The use of automated and semi-automated methods in preparing and analyzing brain data are instrumental to enhancing the ways that researchers can examine functional and structural brain organization. Nonetheless, biased estimates of gray matter volume and thickness resulting from participant head motion during data collection is a serious issue that places important limits on the accuracy with which cross-cohort anatomical differences and longitudinal change can be quantified. For this reason, we emphasize the importance of considering both visual inspection and objective motion-related QC when assessing brain structure with MRI."}]
