[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Quality of life, as commonly noted in the literature (e.g., Molnar 1985), is a global construct that implies for individuals in their daily life a sense of well-being or contentment. To the extent that the concept of \"quality of life\" encompasses the notion of \"well-being\", this makes the concept hard to quantify as it may mean different things to different people (Nzaku and Bukenya 2004). Beesley and Bowles (1991) assert that while quality of life is an elusive concept, for people who articulate a preference for small centers and rural areas, such a preference is motivated by a desire to live in areas with less crime, better environmental qualities, and lower cost of living. This is in addition to having a desire for a less hectic lifestyle and for one that includes peacefulness and serenity, and proximity to friends and families. A seminal study by Davis (1945) has noted that it is the gap between standard and level of living that aspires and motivates human behavior and that to the extent that such a gap exists, impacted individuals are likely to report discontentment and a desire to act in a way that would reduce the gap. Studies about perceptions of wellbeing have long centered about finding valid and efficient ways of assessing these perceptions, which have all resulted in the development of various quality of life indicators. Prominent among these studies, and to name a few, are those by Andrews and Withey (1976), Campbell et al. (1976), and Strumpel (1976). Winter et al. (1995) note that a common thread among the resulting social indicators literature is that well-being should be assessed through the concurrent use of subjective indicators (e.g., reported satisfaction, reported rankings, and reported comparison to referent groups) and of objective indicators (e.g., wealth, income, health status). Many researchers have contributed towards improving the social and economic make-up of the communities of people involved in farming by assessing the determinants of social and economic well-being of rural farm families (e.g., Dillman and Tremblay 1977;Molnar 1985;Winter et al. 1988;Allen and Dillman 1994;Mishra et al. 2002). The objective of this study is to contribute to this effort by first using a nationally recognized survey to construct a subjective indicator of quality of life based on operators' own prior perceptions of well-being regarding the communities where farm households live and second, to use count-data models to examine the determinants of such a newly constructed indicator. 1 The paper is organized as follows: The first section provides a detailed description of the data and of the quality of life indicator utilized in the analysis. This is followed by two sections that detail the statistical methods employed and the corresponding empirical results. The final section provides conclusions and a brief discussion of policy implications."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and the Quality of Life Indicator", "text": "Numerous data sources are utilized in the analysis. The primary data source used in the construction of the quality of life indicator and in the execution of the empirical analysis is the 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS data, which is collected annually and in three phases by means of personal interviews, is sponsored by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the US Department of Agriculture. The ARMS data is the primary source of information on the financial condition of farm businesses, on their production practices and resource use, and on the economic well-being of farm households in the USA (see Farm Business 2006a). Of the nearly 1 To the extent that some farms are operated by more than one household, the focus of the paper is on the household of the senior operator. The paper excludes from the analysis those operator households whose farms are organized as non-family corporations or cooperatives, or when the operator does not receive any of the net income of the farm business. Focusing on only this group of household is because they are the major entrepreneurs and receive most of the residual income from the farming activity itself (for more detail, see Ahearn et al. 1993). 2.1 million farms represented in the ARMS sample, about two-thirds are classified as rural residence farms which include limited resource farms (sales less than $100,000 in 2003 and low farm household income in 2004), small farms (sales less than $250,000) whose operators are retired, and residential/lifestyle small farms whose operators' major occupation is other than farming. While these rural residence farms tend to comprise the majority of all farms in the USA, they nevertheless disproportionately produce about 9% of all the farm output and receive about 15% of all farm program payments. The fact that these farms, unlike their counterparts who operate intermediate-and commercial-sized farms, are less involved in farming is further evident by noting that their households, on average, tend to receive 75% of all the income earned from off-farm wages and/or salaries and from off-farm businesses. The sample design of ARMS is complex and is technically described as a multiphase, multi-frame, and stratified, and as such, specialized computer algorithms are required when variances of estimates are to be computed. The sample design of ARMS is based on a probability-weighted sampling structure, which means that each observation has a different weight, or expansion factor, which by construct is equal to the inverse of the selection probability of a particular farm operation (see Farm Business 2006b). The paper also utilizes some auxiliary socio-economic data for the lower 48 states that are merged with the ARMS data using the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. Specifically, the local labor area and other pertinent characteristics used in the estimation of predictors of the quality of life indicator are based on county level data from the 2003 Regional Economic Information System files (Bureau of Economic Analysis), the 2003 Local Area Unemployment Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics) files, and the 2000 Census of Population, SF-3 file. Table 1 presents the household survey instruments used in the construction of the composite quality of life indicator (QOLI). 2 Of the 6,706 farm operator households with usable questionnaires in the 2004 ARMS sample (or 2,067,373 households when the sample is expanded using survey weights), only 6,424 of these households (or 95.4% of the expanded population) had a response from their senior farm operators to the questions regarding the ten survey instruments used in the construction of QOLI. 3 These ten instruments are grouped under four broad socio-economic domains that characterize the quality of daily life in the place of residence: labor market conditions, quality of neighborhood, public and/or private services, and social interaction. Figure 1 shows the characterization, in weighted percentage terms, of occurrence of perceived problem in the ten attributes of quality of life. A surprising finding is the perceived high level of 'Crime and vandalism' as reported by farm operators in the communities where they live (31%), second only to what one would expect regarding rural 'Access to airport' (33%), and surpassing even 'Access to health care' (28%), which has always been known to be a problem in rural areas. The construction of QOLI starts by noting how the operator of the ith (i=1, \u2026, n) farm operator household had responded to each of the ten community-attributes questions that comprise the four domains. To demonstrate, if the response to the first question regarding whether the availability of employment opportunities in the place of residence of the farm operator was a problem (i.e., major or minor), a value of 1 would be coded in vector D 1 , and a zero would be coded if otherwise. As the last row in Table 1 indicates, QOLI for the ith household results by simply summing up the encoded values of either 0 or 1 across all ten vectors of community attributes. When the resulting QOLI for the ith household is 0, this would indicate that based on the operator's own perception, there exist no deficit in the quality of life attributes in the community where the operator lives. On the other end of the spectrum, a value of 10 for QOLI would indicate the presence of a deficit in each one of the ten community-based quality of life attributes considered in the analysis. It is important to note that the constructed QOLI weighs, in terms of importance, each of the ten elements described in Table 1 equally. In not allowing for the weights attached to each of the ten components of QOLI to vary is done because of lack of information in the ARMS data on operator's own assessment of the importance of each one of these ten quality of life attributes.   operators reporting a zero deficit in the quality of life indicator at one extreme, to about 1% of the operators reporting a deficit in each of the ten quality-of-life attributes considered."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "In trying to model the predictors of QOLI, the paper utilizes a two-stage procedure usually referred to in the literature as Heckman's method (see Heckman 1979). In the first stage, the selective decision by the farm operator to whether or not to respond to the ten questions describing the socio-economic status of his/her rural community (see Table 1) is modeled by means of a binary-choice regression technique. This step, which estimates a response equation, is needed in order to assess potential refusal bias which may occur in the modeling of the predictors of QOLI, which compromises the second stage in the analysis, and which is conducted, due to the discrete (with censoring at zero and at ten) nature of QOLI, using a variety of count regression models. Because survey samples are nonrandom as in the case of this paper, selection bias due to non-response is far too likely and is due to the possibility of systematic differences between responders and non-responders (for detailed discussion, see Berk 1983;Greene 2003, pp.780-784). The two-stage estimation procedure, which treats sample selection as a model specification error, provides a mechanism for testing and if needed, for correcting estimates for non-response bias as in the following: First stage estimation Let the binary variable I i tracks the decision of the ith farm operator to respond to each of the quality of life indicator questions, which will take place only if the level of utility (or psychic satisfaction) u i received by the operator from answering these questions exceeds a certain threshold U i 4 : The expected value of I i denoted by E is the probability (P i ) of a farm operator providing his/her own assessment of the community-based quality of life attributes as in (see Aldrich and Nelson 1984): where F(.) is the cumulative distribution function and f(.) is the probability density function of \u025b, which is a composite random variable that approximates the random aspect of operator's decision to whether or not to respond to the quality of life questions in ARMS. Under Heckman's method, the probability distribution P i in Eq. 2 is assumed normal, which if found true would require use of a probit regression. In this paper, Lee's method is used instead of Heckman's to test and to correct for selfselection bias. Lee's method, while similar to Heckman's in that it requires a two-step procedure when addressing self-selection bias, is considered more advantageous. This is because P i is allowed to have either a normal or a logistic distribution which makes the technique more flexible thereby facilitating its application to any binary choice model (Lee 1982(Lee , 1983. Using Lee's method, the first stage in the paper uses logistic regression to estimate P i as in: ; which leads to: where \u03b2 is a vector of coefficients and Z i is a full set of explanatory variables. 5 This is followed by estimating the selectivity variable \u03bb, also known referred to in the literature as the inverse mill's ratio: Second stage estimation A preliminary representation of the prediction QOLI takes the following form: where + is a vector of parameters to be estimated, and \u03bd is a vector of error terms. Because of the censored nature of QOLI due to the selective responsedecision of the operator, modeling 5 by means of weighted least squares without attending to the potential for selection bias will yield inconsistent estimates of +, similar to a result of a specification error of an omitted variable. To remedy this, the second stage of the estimation process will augment 5 with l as in: where g l is the coefficient, once estimated, that will determine if selection bias is present in the model. If b g l is found significant, including l in the weighted least squares estimation of QOLI will yield consistent and unbiased estimates of +. Yet another complication in the estimation of Eq. 5 warrants further attention. In that multiple weighted linear regression technique may be used in analyzing the model, the prevalence of zeros in QOLI, coupled with the positively skewed and discrete nature of its distribution begs the need for another estimation strategy. This stems from the inadequacy of the classical linear regression model to deal with an integer and skewed dependent variable because the distribution of the error terms \u03bd i is no longer homoscedastic or normal (Blundell et al. 1995). Four alterative count-data estimation techniques are considered, with each being capable at improving the model's fit relative to estimation based solely on least squares regression (see Gourieroux et al. 1984;Hausman et al. (1984); Cameron 1986;Cameron and Trivedi 1998;Lambert 1992;Greene 1994;Moore and Shellman 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Poisson Regression Model", "text": "This model specifies that each element d i of QOLI is drawn from a Poisson distribution with a parameter \u03b7 i , which is related to the covariates x i as in: In the context of this paper, Eq. 7 indicates that the expected number of deficits in the quality of life indicator is equal to the variance of the distribution of d i . This property of the Poisson regression, called 'equidispersion', seems restrictive, since it is not unlikely to find that the variance of d i , particularly due to the preponderance of zeros (e.g., 36% of the weighted sample) in QOLI, is larger than the mean of d i , which implies the presence of 'overdispersion' in the underlying data."}, {"section_title": "Zero-inflated Poisson Regression Model", "text": "In contrast to Eq. 7, this model, which is due to Lambert (1992), allows for excess zero counts by assuming that a count of only zero (d i =0; or regime 1 with probability=p i ) is generated by a process that differs from a Poisson process that generates an alternative count (d i \u22650; or regime 2 with probability=1\u2212p i ) so that 6 : where, as in the Poisson model, h i \u00bc e x 0 i g .

The conditional mean and the variance of the distribution in Eq. 8 are (see Long 1997, p. 243;Sorensen 1999;Greene 2003, p. 750): where d* denotes the outcome of the Poisson process in regime 2."}, {"section_title": "Negative Binomial Regression Model", "text": "This model relaxes the restriction of the Poisson regression model that conditional mean equals the variance. Accordingly, the Poisson model is generalized by introducing an individual, unobserved effect into the conditional mean h \u00c3 i : where 5 i is a specification error or a product of cross-sectional heterogeneity that tends to characterize micro-level data (see Greene 2003). This leads to the following conditional distribution of d i : where x i \u00bc e w i , and for mathematical convenience, is assumed to have a gamma distribution with parameter m i . The expected value of Eq. 12, when taken over \u03be i , yields the following negative binomial distribution: where \u0393 is the gamma function (see Long 1997; p. 232 for more detail) and where E (\u03be i )=1 and Var(\u03be i )=1/m i .

This paper uses the delete-a-group jackknife approach, which is a method similar to bootstrapping, where the original sample of surveyed farms representing all farms in the 48 contiguous states is divided by NASS into 15 nearly equal and mutually exclusive different subgroups. A re-sampling method with replacement is then conducted by NASS which results in a set of 15 vectors of replicate weights. These vectors of replicate weights, in addition to the vector depicting the survey's full sample weights (W) are then used in 16 runs to estimate means (or regression parameters) of non-binary variables. The first estimated mean of a particular variable, m (or vector of regression parameters, b), which is reported in the table, is based on W which yields the full sample estimate m (or b), and the remaining 15 mean estimates (or regressions) of the same variable are based on the 15 vectors of 'replicate' weights which, in turn, result in a set of 15 b \u03bc m (m=1,..., 15) [or b \u03b2 m (m=1,..., 15)]. The final step involves the derivation of the jackknife variance of an estimated mean (which can be generalized for each regression coefficient) as in the following: where S is a scalar representing the adjustment to the degrees of freedom for the jackknife procedure (here, S=14/15). The square root of Var(\u03bc) provides the appropriate standard error of the mean (or of a regression parameter) of a particular variable when data has the type of complex survey design structure as in ARMS. The covariates hypothesized to predict QOLI are listed in Table 3 and include those that are likely to impact the level of life satisfaction in the community where the farm operator household is located. 8 Specifically, a set of variables is used that describes, while not exhaustively, the economic type of the county where the operator lives: farming-dependent; manufacturing-dependent, government-dependent; and servicesdependent. Next is a set of policy-type variables including identifiers that capture whether the county of residence is a persistent-poverty or population-loss county. Extent of urbanization (based on eleven dummy variables) and of employment in the  8 Since all of the right-hand-side variables in the count-data models are based on auxiliary data, and not on data from the ARMS as in the case of the dependent variable, estimation of the variances of the parameters was done in STATA, Version 9.2 (StataCorp 2005), using the Huber/White/sandwich method, and not by means of the Jackknife delete-a-group method. The Huber-White variance (see Froot 1989) estimation method is robust since it renders regression estimates resistant to the heteroskedasticity problem that tends to plague cross-sectional data.

The index begins at zero which indicates county where farm is located having the least productive soils and ends at 100 which reflects the county as having the most productive soils (see Pierce et al. 1983 for details). area are considered; this is in addition to a variable that assesses the adequacy of income (as measured by county's per-capita income) of individuals and that allow for social and economic comparison within the county of residence. Figure 3 shows the spatial geographic distribution of the economic and policy type indicators used in the analysis. To demonstrate, the map of persistent poverty counties in the lower 48 states shows these counties to be clustered in several areas ranging, among others, from the Great Plains and the Rio Grande Valley, to Appalachia, the Black Belt, and the Mississippi Delta.  1980-1990and 1990-2000 Economic and policy county types The determinants of a quality of life indicator for farm operator households"}, {"section_title": "Empirical Findings", "text": "The estimates of the logistic regression aimed at capturing the determinants of responding to the quality of life questions needed in the construction of the QOLI are presented in Table 4. This model, which is a first stage in the process of modeling the determinants of QOLI, shows a good fit based on a McFadden's pseudo R 2 value of 0.473. The negative and statistically significant coefficient of OPAGE, and the positive and statistically significant coefficient of OPAGESQ indicate a curvilinear relationship between the likelihood of a response to the questions and the age of the farm operator. In fact, and based on the signs and magnitudes of these two coefficients, the U-shaped relationship between the likelihood of a response and age of the operator seems to bottom out at age 58. The marginal effect of a one year increase in the age of younger operators, while holding all else equal, indicates a decrease in the likelihood of a response by 3.44%. Findings also show that married farm operators with children (MARRIED_CHILD), perhaps due to time constraints, are less likely to respond to questions on quality of life than their non-married or married with no children counterparts. Farmers operating dairy operations (DAIRY), perhaps due to their relationships with cooperative extension agents in their county aimed at improving milk production and/or leaders of their local four-H clubs, are found more likely than other farmers with other types of farm specialization to respond to the questions on the quality of life in their surrounding communities. Of the remaining factors, those that indicated the importance of taking over the operation from a family (TAKEOVER), or of investing in real estate (INVEST), or of living in a rural (LIVE_RURAL) area as reasons for the farm operator to becoming a farmer are all shown to be positively correlated with the likelihood of a farmer providing a response to the quality-of-life survey questions. Since these factors do reflect a sense of commitment by farmers to their farms and their communities, this perhaps would make it more likely that they not refuse answering these questions with the hope that survey findings on the quality of life attributes may help remedy some of the existing deficits in these attributes by local or state governments. Table 5 shows the findings from the second stage process of modeling the determinants of QOLI. As indicated by the lack of significance on the coefficient of l in three count models considered, selection bias is found not to be present. In contrast, the significant coefficient of l in the Poisson count model points to the importance of including the inverse-mill's ratio variable in the regression equation as a means of mitigating the potential problem of selection bias. The finding of lack of significance of l in three of the four count models considered may be due to the large proportion of the self-reporting operators (i.e., the 95.4% who answered the questions in the survey on quality of life attributes), and as such, may point to the need of conducting similar selectivity test if future ARMS samples exhibited a sizeable decrease in the proportion of respondents. The first column of results pertains to the Poisson model. Because the variance of the dependent variable (QOLI) based on the raw sample is nearly three times larger than the mean (see Table 3, footnote 1), it is evident that the distribution of this variable shows signs of overdispersion. This further indicates that the variance of QOLI is greater than what might be expected if the Poisson distribution is to be assumed, and consequently, if the Poisson regression is to be used. Accordingly, results from the Poisson regression are presented only as a benchmark that allows for comparison of findings when other more appropriate count regression models are used. Specifically, use of a zero-inflated Poisson model to predict the determinants of QOLI shows only nine explanatory variables, as opposed to fifteen as in the case of the Poisson model, to be important. Under the zero-inflated Poisson model, for communities of farms located in farming dependent counties (FARM_DEP), or when farms are in counties that are classified as more rural (as reflected in the base category of the urban influence codes; see footnote 3, Table 3), findings point towards the presence of a greater number of deficits in the quality of life attributes. On the other hand, for communities of farms located in manufacturing-dependent counties or in counties with higher per-capita income, results indicate the presence of a lesser number of deficits in the quality of life attributes. After splitting the model to allow for zero counts using logistic regression, results from the zero-inflated Poisson model show that the likelihood of a community having a zero count in terms of the number of quality-of-life deficits is much lower if the community is located in a persistent poverty county or in a county that is classified as farming-dependent. In contrast, results also show that such likelihood is much higher if the community is located in a county with a higher per-capita income. The third and fourth columns of Table 5 show results of negative binomial (NBN) models, one that does not allow for excess zero counts and one that does. Under both of these models, while the count variable QOLI is assumed to be generated by a Poisson-like process, the variation in QOLI here is allowed to be greater than that allowed based on a true Poisson model. The fact that the dispersion parameter \u03b1 is found significant under both of the NBN models makes these models more attractive in terms of fitting the data than those of the Poisson models, with or without allowing for zero-inflation. Under the negative binomial specification without model splitting (column 3), communities in farming-dependent or poverty-persistent counties, and a county's rate of unemployment are all factors that are found to be positively correlated with number of deficits in quality of life attributes. A similar positive and significant impact on the number of quality-of-life deficits is found for the variable FARM_DEP in the negative binomial model with zero-inflation (column 4). After splitting the model to account for zero counts, the negative binomial model seems to indicate that dependence of the community on farming as indicated by the FARM_DEP variable seems to lessen the chance that a community will have a zerocount deficit in the quality-of-life attributes, which stands in contrast to the positive effect of higher per-capita income of the county where the community is located. 9 9 In terms of discerning which of the models are most preferred, a test for non-nested models would need to be performed. STATA, the software used in the estimation of the count models allows for such test, known in the literature as Voung (V) test. However, it is only allowed for estimation without sampling weights. Large positive values of V would show a preference of using negative binomial models over Poisson models. Performing such tests on unweighted samples showed a preference of using a zeroinflated Poisson model over the Poisson model (V=22.29) and a preference of using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model over the standard negative binomial model (V=5.80)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "The paper has used a two stage procedure along with data, primarily from a national survey, to model the determinants of a quality of life index (QOLI). In the first stage, a logistic model aimed at capturing the factors that would entice a farm operator to respond to survey questions on quality of life attributes was estimated. In addition to age of the farm operator, other variables, particularly those reflecting the level of commitment of the farmer to his/her operation and/or community, were found important to the decision to respond to these questions. The results from this model were then used in a second stage of a process aimed at assessing the determinants of QOLI using count models while testing for the presence of selection bias. Findings from this paper show that self-selection was an issue in only one of the four count models considered, perhaps due to the fact that only a small proportion of farm operators (nearly 5%) declined to respond to the survey questions pertaining to the quality-of-life attributes.

In considering economic and policy type variables, in addition to some variables that are indicative of peoples' wellbeing (e.g., county's per-capita income) in the analysis, findings should help inform the policy debate on how to help communities better their quality of life. Some obvious policy tools that may be advocated center around improving employment opportunities in the communities across the country coupled with policies that will increase income levels of wage earners."}]
