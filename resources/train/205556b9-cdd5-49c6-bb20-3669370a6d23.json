However, it is still critical to archive originators' data as it was sent to NODC.\nIn order for the international scientific community to develop climate system forecast capability for seasons, to determine the role of the world ocean as part of the earth's climate system and to improve climate assessments for decadal and longer time-scales, the most complete databases of historical oceanographic data such as the WOD are required. These databases, and scientific products based on these databases, represent the infrastructure on which much ocean and climate research and assessments are now based. Specifically: a) Objective analyses of the data in these databases provide gridded climatologies that are used as initial and boundary conditions for ocean climate simulations and to verify simulations of the climate system; b) The data are used to prepare diagnostic studies, particularly for estimating interannual-to-decadal ocean variability of ocean heat content (Levitus et al., 2000) ; c) In recent years the data have been used as the input for ocean data assimilation efforts (Carton and Giese, 2008) . Planners of such programs should have access to all historical oceanographic data in order to optimize measurement strategies for these programs. Scientists analyzing data from such programs need historical data in order to study interannual-to-decadal variability. Operational forecast centers need historical data in order to perform quality control of synoptic data; f) The data are a crucial tool to understand fisheries variability, and to manage fisheries and other marine resources; g) More specifically the data in the WOD has been used in a variety of products including the production of global climatologies of temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrients at ocean depths from the sea surface down to 5,500 m depth , Antonov et al. (2010) , Garcia (et al., 2010a,b) . Regional atlases have also been prepared (Matishov et al., 2004) and studies of the frequency distribution of ocean variables computed (Levitus and Sychev) . These climatologies are used in a variety of ways including initialization of ocean models, and ocean data assimilation studies among others; h) The data in WOD have also been incorporated into other atlases including the International Comprehensive\nOcean-Atmosphere-Data-Set (Woodruff et al. (2011) )."}, {"section_title": "WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE WOD", "text": "The following table (Table 1) is a list of the oceanographic variables included in the WOD: The following table is a list of the instrument types used to collect the data included in the WOD: "}, {"section_title": "THE WOD IS A COMPLEX, HETEROGENOUS, AND LABOR-INTENSIVE DATABASE TO DEVELOP", "text": "Consider the last release of the WOD which is known as the World Ocean Database 2009 (WOD09) Johnson et al. 2009 ). The WOD09 is a global, comprehensive, integrated, scientifically qualitycontrolled database with all data in one well-documented format. We characterize WOD09 as a \"heterogeneous\" database. As an example, the Ocean Station Data (OSD) component of WOD09 contains data from, 65,840 cruises, 3,465 ships and other platforms (buoys, profiling float, etc), 564 institutes, 70 countries, 653 Principal Investigators (P.I.s). Populating the database with these metadata and many other metadata (e.g., instrument codes, scientific methods used, etc) is labor intensive. Populating the database with the actual data is laborintensive because the data come from so many different sources in so many different formats. Also, both the metadata and data we receive frequently have problems associated with them such as misreported units, locations, etc. which we attempt to fix with the assistance of the data originators."}, {"section_title": "TIME SERIES HISTORY OF INSTRUMENTAL DATA WITH TEMPERATURE DATA IN WOD09", "text": "History of ocean temperature profile data set available in electronic form from NODC/WDC contained in WOD09 is shown in Figure 1 .

History of ocean temperature profile data set available in electronic form from NODC/WDC contained in WOD09. \"MBT is the abbreviation for mechanical bathythermographs, \"XBT\" represents expendable bathythermographs, \"CTD\" represents Conductivity-Temperature-Depth, and \"PFL\" represents profiling floats. The category \"Other\" includes data from gliders, moored buoys, drifting buoys, undulating ocean recorders (e.g., towed CTDs), and instrumented elephant seals. "}, {"section_title": "WOD UPDATING SCHEDULE", "text": "The WOD is updated online every three months with all of the data that we have processed for that quarter. Corrections are made for data and metadata reported or found to have been in error and reported to data originators. We compute seasonal temperature anomaly fields for 0-700 m depth and these are placed online (www.nodc.noaa.gov) as well as the 0-700 m ocean heat content field and time series of the global integral of this field. We plan to extend these products to include salinity and extend all of the analyses and computations down to 2,000 m depth. Approximately every four years the data in the WOD are subjected to additional quality control and a new database is released on DVD and on-line."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS", "text": "As part of its commitment to the scientists, institutions, and countries that have made their oceanographic data available, the GODAR and the WOD projects through NODC/WDC have made all data available on DVD media as well as on-line via the Internet from the NODC/WDC website (www.nodc.noaa.gov). Beginning with World Ocean Database 1998, all data have been made available on-line.\nThe World Ocean Database products come with software conversion routines so that users of software packages, databases, and programming languages such as MATLAB, IDL, PC-Surfer, C, and FORTRAN can access the data. In response to user requests, we have defined the WOD format to be as 'self-defining' as possible so as to eliminate, or at least minimize, the need for any structural changes to the format when new data types are added. All code tables, documentation, and software containing metadata are available on-line as well as on the CDROMs and DVDs which are used to distribute the WOD series. When a new database is released (every 3-4 years) users can acquire the new database or simply acquire data for those ocean stations that have been added or modified since the previous release. In addition, as corrections are made to the database after a release of WOD, users can acquire any modified data several days after the end of every month. There is a \"Help Desk\" and \"Frequently Asked Questions\" for the database available on-line. Scientists do not want to be limited to downloading one profile at a time. WOD09 contains approximately 9 million temperature profiles, 3.5 million salinity profiles as well as profile for other ocean variables therefore a user must be able to easily download multiple profiles."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE WORK", "text": "The WOD project continues incorporating as much historical as well as modern oceanographic data as possible. The outlook for continued international cooperation is excellent. The WOD and products and papers based on it are frequently cited in the scientific literature. We plan to continue our work with the cooperation of the international scientific and data management communities to improve the WOD and products based on it."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We acknowledge the contribution of many individuals, organizations, and countries to the projects described in this document. Scientists and technicians studying the world ocean have undertaken the task of collecting and processing the data. Oceanographic data centers and marine institutes have been particularly helpful through their participation The NOAA Climate and Global Change Program, the NOAA Earth Science Data and Information System Management Program, the NOAA Environmental Data Rescue Program, and the NOAA Climate Database Modernization Program have supported the work of the GODAR project. NASA contributed to the development of enhanced upper ocean thermal data sets.
