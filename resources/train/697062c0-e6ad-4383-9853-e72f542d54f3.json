By introducing the concept of network, the research interest of brain imaging analysis has been extended from functional specialization of local regions to the functional integration in the whole brain connectivity [1] . Although the complex graph theoretic measures such as smallworldness and modularity have been widely used for finding the global characteristics of brain connectivity, we still want to know which parts of brain are related to the specific cognitive function or neurodegenerative disease. In this sense, community and rich-club detection have been proposed to extract functionally specialized subnetwork [2, 3] . They find densely connected subregions with large modularity or high degree in the whole brain connectivity. Those regions are usually considered to be related with the specific cognitive function, and weakened by the disease progression. However, it is rarely mentioned how the shape of brain network is changed after the deterioration of connections in the regions.\nIn this paper, we propose a hole detection method to find the shape change during the disease progression. Hole is also a connected component, but there is a path that any node in the hole can return to itself, and the path consists of at least four consecutive edges. Like a connected component, a hole is also the fundamental shape descriptor defined in algebraic topology [4] . While densely connected component represents the network's local efficiency, the hole with many consecutive edges characterizes the network's inefficiency. The concept of hole defined in topological data analysis has been already used for brain network analysis [5, 6, 7] . In the topological data analysis, a persistent hole that lasts for a long threshold is considered as a signal of network and a hole with short duration of threshold is considered as a noise. In this sense, the existing hole detection methods find the significant hole using the persistence of the hole. However, we determine the significance of hole using the probability map of persistence diagram because not only the persistent hole, but also the hole that appears and disappears at abnormal thresholds are impor-tant to determine the shape of brain network. The kernel density estimation is used for obtaining the probability map of persistence diagram.\nThe proposed method finds a harmonic hole represented by the weighted sum of edges based on Hodge Laplacian [8, 5] , while the existing method usually finds a hole in the binary representation of edges, i.e., a subset of edges [6, 7, 9] . The weights of the harmonic hole are proportional to the contribution of edges to the hole. Moreover, while the existing method can not find the unique representation of a hole, i.e., there are many other possible subsets of edges for representing a hole, the harmonic hole method finds the unique representation of a hole. In experiments, the proposed method was applied to FDG PET data of Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) and showed that the proposed method can find the abnormal shape of network as AD progressed."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Network construction", "text": "The ADNI FDG-PET dataset consists of three groups, 181 normal controls (NC), 168 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 135 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects (Age: 73.75\n.9, range 56.1\u00b490.1). The MCI group was divided into two groups, 91 stable MCI (sMCI) and 77 progressive MCI (pMCI), depending on whether a subject remained stable or progressed to AD after three years. Details of data sets and preprocessing are in [10] . The whole brain image was parcellated into 94 regions of interest (ROIs) based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL2) except for cerebellum [11] . Each ROI serves as a node and its measurement is obtained by averaging FDG uptakes in the ROI. The distance between two nodes was estimated by the diffusion distance on positive correlations between measurements of two ROIs. The diffusion distance considers an average distance of all direct and indirect paths between two nodes via random walk. Suppose that a weighted network N pV, E, Lq consists of p nodes in a set V and q edges in E, and an edge distance matrix L P R p\u02c6p . The entry of L \" rlpe ij qs is the distance of the edge e ij P E connecting two nodes v i and v j (v i , v j P V ).
