[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Cognitive complaints, particularly memory complaints, are often present in clinical populations of older individuals, and play an important role in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 7 and dementia. Some have argued that memory complaints should not be used in formulating a clinical diagnosis 8 as attempts to relate subjective complaints to objective measures of impairment have resulted in mixed findings 1,2 . Yet, other studies do provide evidence of a relationship between subjective complaints and memory performance [3][4][5][6] . In addition to dementia diagnosis, it has also been suggested that memory complaints may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for dementia before the onset of significant impairment 9 . Despite the increased focus on cognitive complaints as predictors of future outcomes, few studies have looked at factors that may contribute to high levels of cognitive complaints in older individuals. Here, we examine the impact of depression and reported cognitive impairments on cognitive complaints. These factors were chosen because both depressive symptoms 10,11 and cognitive impairment 12 have been linked to cognitive complaints in separate studies, suggesting that both affect and reported impairments can play a role in generation of subjective complaints. In the current study, we aim to disentangle the role of self and informant-reported impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression (CES-D) scale 15 ) on the generation of self-reported cognitive complaints (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ)) in healthy older adults. Reported impairment, as measured by the CDR, relies heavily on informant reports, and for that reason is more reflective of functional deficits in daily activity. By investigating differences in CDR and CESD scores in relation to CFQ scores, we aimed to differentiate the effect of deficits in daily function from the effect of depressive symptomology on the production of cognitive complaints in a healthy cohort. Using longitudinal data from cognitively normal older participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we hypothesized that reported impairments, albeit subtle, and depression would play independent roles in the generation of cognitive complaints. We further explored whether an interaction between these factors was present."}, {"section_title": "METHOD Subjects", "text": "We used data from 105 participants (59 male, 46 female) in the neuroimaging study of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA); 13 who had completed the CFQ (Broadbent, 1982). The CFQ was completed for a mean of 3.98 (SD = 1.70) visits for each participant ( Table 1). All participants were free of consensus diagnoses of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and follow-up, as data from the point of diagnosis and beyond were excluded from analyses for the 15 participants who received a clinical diagnosis during the study. Cognitive status was determined by consensus diagnosis according to established procedures, which considered information from the CDR but was not based solely on this measure 14 . By removing data points from point of diagnosis, we were able to investigate complaints in a cohort within the normal range of functioning and determine the relationship between subtle cognitive deficits and cognitive complaints after accounting for the effect of depressive symptomology. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant at each visit, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and the National Institute on Aging."}, {"section_title": "Assessment and Analysis", "text": "At each annual visit, participants completed the CESD, and the total score was used as a measure of depressive symptoms. Finally, the CDR scale (range 0 -3), a combination of self-and informant-based report, was administered on visits when participants scored 3 or more errors on the Blessed-Information-Memory-Concentration test and annually for all participants in the BLSA autopsy program. Out of the 105 participants, 91 met criteria for CDR administration. Of those, 90 participants had an informant-based CDR assessment. In addition to the CDR total score, the CDR sum of boxes (CDR-SB) was calculated by adding the scores on each of six domains: memory, judgment and problem solving, hobbies, orientation, community affairs, and personal care. The CDR-SB served as the measure of reported impairments 16 . Participants who did not meet criteria for CDR administration (14 participants) were assigned a CDR total score and CDR-SB score of 0. All data from visits with CFQ administration (all neuroimaging visits from 2000 -2009) were used in analyses. Participants completed the CFQ at each neuroimaging visit since the year 2000. This measure assesses subjective cognitive complaints and is composed of 25 questions relating to basic cognitive problems people may experience in everyday activities, such as: Do you forget why you went to one part of the house? Do you forget whether you have turned off a light? Do you find you confuse your left and right? Questions are rated on a scale of 0 (never have this problem) to 4 (I have this problem very often), and higher scores signify greater perceived difficulties. All data analysis was conducted using SAS 9.1 Software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Mixed effects models (SAS PROC MIXED) were used to investigate the effects of depressive symptoms and reported impairment on the outcome variable of cognitive complaints measured by CFQ. Mean CESD scores, mean CDR-SB, baseline age, interval (days from baseline visit), and their interactions were included in the model as fixed effects. Mean CESD and mean CDR-SB scores across all CFQ visits were used as predictors to index more chronic depressive symptoms and long-term cognitive difficulties, respectively. Random effects included the interval and the intercept. Longitudinal change was modeled using the interval term and interaction terms with interval. Model reductions were performed using backward elimination, whereby non-significant terms were sequentially removed from the model."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Data from all visits with a CFQ administration were used and included visits from 2000 -2009. There was no significant effect of interval indicating that CFQ scores were stable over time. Similarly, there were no significant interactions between interval and mean depressive symptoms or reported impairment on change over time in CFQ scores. Thus, interval was removed from the model, and analyses were repeated using a simplified model to investigate associations of mean CESD and mean CDR-SB on overall CFQ scores across time. Analysis of the effects of mean CESD scores and mean CDR-SB scores on subjective cognitive complaints (Table 2) showed significant main effects of mean CESD (t(99) =5.17, p < .0001) and mean CDR-SB (t(99) = 2.88, p = .005) on overall CFQ scores, illustrating that both higher depressive symptoms and reported impairments are related to greater cognitive complaints. Further, there was a significant CDR \u00d7 CESD interaction (t(99) = \u22123.12, p = .002) on CFQ scores. This interaction indicated that the association between higher levels of depressive symptoms and higher CFQ scores was most apparent in individuals who did not show high levels of reported impairments as rated by the CDR-SB (Figure 1). Finally, there was a significant CDR \u00d7 Baseline Age interaction (t (99) = \u22122.71, p = .008) on CFQ scores, indicating that reported impairments were related to CFQ scores for those younger but not older than 80 years old (Figure 2). The analyses were repeated excluding the 14 participants who had imputed zeros for the CDR and results were similar to those using with imputed CDR scores."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We investigated whether chronic levels of depressive symptoms and reported cognitive impairments are related to cognitive complaints (CFQ score) in cognitively intact older adults. Our findings indicate that higher mean levels of depressive symptoms and reported impairments are each significantly associated with higher scores on the CFQ measure of cognitive complaints. Furthermore, significant interactions between CESD and reported impairment suggest that depressive symptoms are most predictive of CFQ scores in individuals who have no reported impairments (CDR-SB = 0). In addition, reported impairments are associated with cognitive complaints in those with baseline age less than 80 but not in those ages 80 and older. We found no significant evidence of change over time in subjective complaints in this relatively healthy sample."}, {"section_title": "Depressive Symptoms and Cognitive Complaints", "text": "Our first goal was to examine the relationship of chronic levels of depressive symptoms measured by the CESD with cognitive complaints. As predicted from prior studies, higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with higher levels of cognitive complaints. Some investigators have argued that subjective cognitive complaints are more related to depression and mood than objective cognitive performance [17][18][19][20] . Recent work has also linked depressive symptoms to cognitive decline, poor cognitive function, and changes in regional cerebral blood flow in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions [21][22][23] . However, it is possible that elevated depressive symptoms are part of the dementia prodrome rather than a cause of cognitive decline per se [24][25][26] . Moreover, we and others have reported that cognitive complaints measured by the CFQ are related to cognitive performance even when controlling for depressive symptoms, indicating that mood state is not the sole mediator of subjective complaints 4,27 . Interestingly, depressive symptoms and cognitive complaints were most strongly linked in those individuals without reported impairments. This finding suggests that complaints may be most vulnerable to the effect of mood state in the absence of cognitive deficits. On the other hand, in the presence of cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms are less predictive of cognitive complaints. These results are especially interesting in light of the question as to whether baseline cognitive impairment is a necessary prerequisite for complaints to have predictive validity. 28 It has been suggested that variability in subjective memory judgments reflects objective cognitive differences in those individuals with depression as opposed to non-depressed complainers 29 . In the current sample, depressed mood and reported impairment were associated independently with complaints, but the significant interactions suggest that depressive symptoms may contribute less as signs of reported impairment begin. Our findings suggest that evaluation of both reported impairments and depressive symptoms will aid in interpretation of cognitive complaints."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Complaints and Reported Cognitive Impairments", "text": "The second goal of this study was to examine the relationship between reported impairments and cognitive complaints. Despite the restricted range of CDR scores in our sample, we found that participants' CFQ scores varied based on their rating on the CDR-SB. Higher levels of reported impairments were related to more cognitive complaints. This relationship was consistent across participants until they reached about 80 years of age, after which CDR scores were not useful in differentiating CFQ scores. The present sample consists of cognitively normal older adults, and in this case, it may be that expectations change with age. Perhaps the older individuals in our study who report some level of impairment do not believe their struggles are outside of the ordinary. In contrast to our result, other studies have observed high levels of complaints in older adults who have cognitive deficits and have thus concluded that expectations do not change with age. Specifically, a relationship between subjective memory complaints, concurrent cognitive performance, and longitudinal cognitive decline has been observed in an especially old cohort 30 , illustrating that older adults do complain and that those complaints are important. One possible difference between our study and these findings is the inclusion of demented older adults in the prior report. It may be that the subtle types of impairments reported in our cohort are less likely to be reflected in the complaints of older adults, but when complaints do arise in response to more extreme cognitive changes, they act as a strong predictor of future impairment. Additional investigation is needed to better understand the relationship between age, objective performance, and subjective cognitive complaints. The lack of associations between age, depressive symptoms, reported impairment and longitudinal change in cognitive complaints may be due to the relatively short interval of CFQ assessments and the limited sample size in the current study. Future studies over longer intervals will be necessary to determine the extent to which these factors and their interactions influence longitudinal changes in CFQ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our findings provide evidence that both chronic levels of depressive symptoms and self and informant-reported cognitive impairments are related to self-reported cognitive complaints in older individuals without a diagnosis of MCI or dementia. Our study adds to the growing literature that shows depressive symptoms may contribute to cognitive complaints. However, we also demonstrate that age and reported impairments may modify this association. The pattern of interactions observed in our study suggests that combined assessment of age, emotional state and reported impairment enhances the interpretation of cognitive complaints. In cognitively normal older adults, complaints may be influenced by depressive symptomology, or may reflect changes in everyday life that seem to exceed expectations. Although these results do not generalize to a cohort with higher levels of cognitive impairment and dementia, using these measures together may add to the clinical utility of cognitive complaint assessments, specifically by allowing clinicians to look at subpopulations of complainers in relation to long-term outcomes. Chronic levels of depressive symptoms are related to cognitive complaints. This relationship is strongest for individuals without reported impairments. No Impairment (Mean CDR-SB = 0) R 2 = 0.226, Some Impairment (Mean CDR-SB > 0) R 2 = 0.030.  "}]
