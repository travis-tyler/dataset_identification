[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Center for Computational Biology (CCB) is a multidisciplinary program where biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinicians work jointly to combine modern mathematical and computational techniques, to perform phenotypic and genotypic studies of biological structure, function, and physiology in health and disease. CCB has developed a computational framework built around the Manifold Atlas, an integrated biomedical computing environment that enables statistical inference on biological manifolds. These manifolds model biological structures, features, shapes, and flows, and support sophisticated morphometric and statistical analyses. The Manifold Atlas includes tools, workflows, and services for multimodal population-based modeling and analysis of biological manifolds. The broad spectrum of biomedical topics explored by CCB investigators include the study of normal and pathological brain development, maturation and aging, discovery of associations between neuroimaging and genetic biomarkers, and the modeling, analysis, and visualization of biological shape, form, and size. CCB supports a wide range of short-term and long-term collaborations with outside investigators, which drive the center's computational developments and focus the validation and dissemination of CCB resources to new areas and scientific domains.\nThe Center for Computational Biology (CCB), one of the National Centers for Biomedical Computing (NCBCs), is focused on developing and applying tools for 'Computational Atlases', a framework that goes beyond traditional paper or digital atlases by providing computational methods to map bioimaging and related data from multiple subjects into common coordinate systems for group comparisons. The concept of an atlas is naturally adaptable across different kinds of populations, and atlases can reflect multiple modalities of information, including wide ranges of scale and time. Atlases can incorporate complex mathematical models of biological features, statistical methods for analysis and inference on populations, and an increasing spectrum of scientific disciplines. CCB integrates all of these information perspectives using cutting-edge mathematical models, optimized algorithms, and advanced computational infrastructure.\nThe Computational Atlas must incorporate accurate registration, 1 shape extraction, modeling and analysis, 2 voxel 3 and tensor based morphometry, 4 and spatial-temporal statistics 5 in order to understand the sometimes subtle, distributed, and dynamic changes associated with normal and pathological biological processes of the brain. A powerful example of the CCB computational atlasing efforts is the development of a 'Manifold Atlas', an integrated biomedical computing environment that combines a workflow framework with new facilities for statistical inference on biological manifolds.

For example, the surface of a brain structure such as the hippocampus is a two-dimensional manifold, while its volume is a three-dimensional (3D) manifold. In neuroimaging, manifolds are used to describe brain structures, 6e9 opening the door to mathematical and computational brain mapping methods for analyzing connectivity, development, and function. For example, using manifolds permits development of new registration methods, such as the Diffeomorphic Neuroanatomical Registration Framework described below. Brain features have been modeled as Riemannian manifoldsdmanifolds that include a metric, thereby providing geometric structure and permitting definition of geodesics (shortest paths) and curvature. CCB uses Riemannian manifolds to represent parametric surfaces 10 and to define flows between them (eg, Ricci flows and Riemannian fluid flows), 11 12 as well as for shape analysis (eg, spectral embedding) and analysis of high-dimensional diffusion imaging datasets. 13 Shape manifolds are also used in biomedical analysis of brain structures. The most basic shapes are 'curves' (such as tractographic and sulcalegyral curves), 'surfaces' (such as the outer boundary of the cerebral cortex), and 'volumes' (such as subcortical structures and cortical regions). Shape manifolds can be augmented into higher-dimensional manifolds with biological data such as tissue density and gene expression, as well as 'flows'dwhich can characterize the evolution of shapes over timedand therefore represent important biomedical patterns such as neurodevelopment, brain activation, and disease progression.\nAtlases play fundamental roles in computational biology, both as unified mathematical models and as intuitive computational environments. By its nature, the CCB manifold atlas has a visual representation, which is vital for many types of biological information, and it includes an array of related maps, each of which associates features to points in some coordinate space. Any parameterized set of data may be viewed as a map. An example is a brain map, which associates brain features with 3D or four-dimensional (4D) coordinates. Biological sequence maps are also examples, mapping molecular information with onedimensional linear coordinates. Combining these maps makes it possible to answer queries that cut across scales and modalities. The CCB focus is on computational biology of the brain; the brain's complexity is so great that a common computational framework is vital."}, {"section_title": "TOOLS", "text": "The new CCB 'biomorphometry tools' combine methods from differential geometry, Bayesian theory, and statistics on manifolds (figure 1). The resulting biological inferences permit complex analysis of multimodal information about biological structure. We have also developed methods such as 'manifold learning'."}, {"section_title": "14e16", "text": "Statistical inference on biological manifolds can be used for undertaking a variety of tasks: (1) mathematical definition and representation of biological structures; (2) defining an abstract manifold consisting of such representations, incorporating both differential geometric and manifold-learning methods wherever suitable; (3) defining metrics that measure distances on and between manifolds; (4) constructing biological atlases on manifolds using (1)e(3) above; and finally (5) performing population-based statistical analysis of biological parameters represented on manifolds. The aims of the CCB yield a set of end-to-end analytical workflows (see Pipeline below) that permit fusion of features extracted from structural and diffusion images, followed by analyses that answer families of important biological questions introduced by various driving biological projects (DBPs). The CCB Atlasing Toolkit, a suite of workflow modules for atlasing with biological manifolds, includes Pipeline protocols integrating data services, parallel computation resources, analytical packages, workflow processing, and best practices (such as the protocols embodied in workflows in the Pipeline Library and the CCB Workbench)."}, {"section_title": "DRIVING BIOLOGICAL PROJECTS", "text": "The CCB promotes and nurtures collaborations with outside groups using two complementary mechanisms to initiate, manage, and advance collaborative projectsdlong-term DBPs and short-term pilot collaborative projects.

Some of these include number of publications, quality of software tools, impact of supported collaborative research projects, caliber of the trainees. Also relevant are the applications of the techniques and models to new domains and problems. Below we include some specific products that resulted from the CCB research and development efforts.\nSince 2004, CCB investigators have published 812 manuscripts, including peer-reviewed journal articles, books, book chapters, and conference proceedings and abstracts.

Creating a successful center requires this level and duration of support to fully realize its goals as stipulated by the program. Furthermore, these are cooperative agreements, and as such the activities and directions of the centers are strongly influenced and in some instances specifically guided by NIH program staff. The challenge then is how to continue this kind of program within a model that requires traditional peer review, with all its shortcomings. Evaluations delivered by committees with incomplete knowledge of the topical areas for each center is a formula for a random outcome. Grouping all NCBC applications into one or two review panels cannot possibly do justice to the diversity of science represented in this program. The challenge faced by CCB is its very existence.
