[{"section_title": "", "text": "This paper draws on new data from four recent surveys, and outlines national and state indicators on three key questions concerning progress in science and mathematics education: (1) Are students receiving more instruction in science and mathematics now than 10 years ago? (2) Has the supply of qualified teachers in science and mathematics improved? and (2) Are students learning more science and mathematics? Data and findings from the national transcript studies of high school T7aduates conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) assessments in science and mathematics, the Council of Chief State School Officers' State Indicators of Science and Mathematics Education, and the NCES Schools and Staffing Survey were used to address these questions. The analyses show that some improvements have been made in all three areas. High school course enrollments in science and mathematics have risen significantly. Scores on the NAEP science and mathematics assessments have increased since 1982, particularly for students at ages 9 and 17; however, the level of student proficiency is still too low. In mathematics, U.S. students score below the level of proficiency that is expected for their age and grade level. There is wide variation by state in course enrollments and student achievement. Most states have not experienced shortages of science and mathematics teachers but this general picture can mask shortages of teachers with strong preparation in science and mathematics as well as greater teacher shortages in school with more poor and minority students. (45 references) (KR)  , 1984). Other data showed that many wellqualified science and mathematics Leachers were leaving teaching, few new graduates in science and mathematics were going into teaching, and many science and mathematics teachers would be retiring in the 1990's (Aldrich, 1983;Darling-Hammond, 1984 States took the lead in responding to ity_atimmillia and other national commission reports (National Governors Association, 1986). States increased course crock requirements for graduation (particularly in mathematics and science), raised standards for teacher preparation, mandated teacher tests for certification, set higher levels for teacher pay, developed state curriculum guicklines and frameworks, and established new statewide student assessments (3oertz, 19843;CCSSO, 1989). Studies of State Reforms. Debate has arisen concerning the effects of the state policy initiatives on education reform at the district, school, and clauroom levels. One argument is that the state policy changes do not have substantial or lasting effects on how schools are organized, on the curriculum that is actually taught in classrooms, or on how teachers teach (Fuhrman et al, 1' tx;ruestone, et al. 1989;David, et 4 1990). Another position is that state policy reforms did increase the amount of time spent on core academic subjects and improved student learning of basic skills, but that teaching and learning of higher order th;nking skills were not advanced (Clune et al. 1989;ETS Policy Information Center, 1990). Some state policymakers argue that, while there is evidence that state reforms have produced improvements in science and mathematics education, more need, to be done. (Connecticut Department of Education, 1989;Honig, 1990;California Department of Education, 1991). Much of the debate about effects of state policies is based on analyses of education reforms iv one state or a small number of states. National and state-by-state data are now available for assessing state policy reforms. This paper summarizes some of the evidence concerning key indicators of change in science and mathematics education. Three quesdons are addressed: (1) Are :curlews receiving more instruction in science and mathematics now than 10 years ago? Has the supply of qualified teachers in science and mat! .ematicc unproved? Are students learning more science and mathemaLics? (2) Data and findings from four sources are used to address these questions: National transcript studies of high school graduates conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the National Assessment  , 1984;. The number of states mandating or recommending a specific amount of time for science and mathematics instruction in elementary grades increased to 26 states by 1987 . One way of measuring the effect of this policy approach for improving science and mathematics is to determine the extent of change in student course taking in science and mathematics. Rates of course enrollments by course level indicate the proportion of students advancing through the secondary science and mathematics curriculum. The rate of course taking in science and mathematics is also an important indicator because of the relationship between coursetaking and student learning in these subjects. Research with large national surveys and international surveys (e.g., National Assessment of Education Progress, National Longitudinal Study, High School and Beyond, Second lEA Mathematics Assessment) demonstrates that there is a direct, positive relationship between the amount of elementary instructional time and secondary course takinfs in science and mathematics and the rate of student learning in these subjects (Jones, et aL, 1986;Dossi, et al., 1988;Mullis, et aL, 1988;Rock, et aL, 1985;McKnight, et al., 1987;National Center for Education Statistics, 1991b). Walberg conducted a quantitative synthesis of 3,000 studies and identified instructional time as one of the nine *productive factors* in learning in schools (1984 In the 1989-90 school year, 38 states collected and reported data on enrollments in science and mathematics of public school students in grades 9-12. States reported the data to CaS0 using common reporting categories which provide the basis for valid state-to-state comparisons. CCSSO researchers used statistical analyses to calculate national estimates from the state data. The science and mathematics indicators were developed through support of the National Science Foundation, Office Li Studies, Evaluation, and Dissemination. 3 students taking algebra 2. In Montana, 65 percent of students take algebea 2 while in Hawaii only 33 percent take mathematim at this level. As of 1989-90, 20 of 38 states reported more than 50 percent of students take algebra 2. The proportion of students taking chemistry by the time they graduate varies from 62 percent in Connecticut to 26 percent in Idaho. As of 1989-90, 11 of 38 states reported more than 50 percent of students taking chemistry (Blank and Da)kilic, 1990 (Kolstad and Thorne, 1989) shows that the rate at which &ls take advanced mathematics and physics increased about three percent during the 1980 's. o Participation in science and mathematics differs widely by student race/ethnkity. Data from the national transcript study in 1987 show that science and mathematics enrollments are highest for Asian students and lowest for African-American and Hispanic students. For example, the percentage of students taking algebra 2 were: Asian--67 percent, white 52 percent, African-American-32 percent, and Hispanic-30 percent. The percentage of students taking chemistry were: Asian-70 percent, white-48 percent, African-American-30 percent, and Hispanic-29 percent (Kolstad and Thorne, 1989 a Lars e high school enrollments in lower level mathanvdcs courses. In the fall ti 1989, 84 percent of all studcits in grades 9-12 were taking a course in mathematics. Over one-fourth of the students (27%) were taking a course at a level prior to algebra 1, ie., general mathematics, vocational/business mathematics, or pre-algebra (Blank and Dalldlic, 1990). Thus, to meet state graduation requirements, many students are taking mathematics courses which are generally not in the high school mathematics curriculum. o States with higher requirements have more overall course taking in schnsce and mathematics and slightly more upper level course taking. The data on course taking confirm that the amount of science and mathematics instruction did incrrase in the time period after states set higher graduation requirements. Were increases the result of changing state requirements? The 1990 CCSSO data show that states requiring 2.5 to 3 credits (13 states in mathematics, 6 states in science) had au average of 10 percent higher enrollments overall in mathematics and science than states requiring two credits (34 states mathematics, 38 states science). The high-requirement states have two to four percent more students taldng upper level science and mathematics courses (e.g., chemisuy, physics, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry) (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990). Thus, the cross-sectional data from 1989-90 show that students take more courses in states with higher requirements. However, they do not necessarily take higher level courses. Data show there is a weak relationship between state requirements and enrollments in upper level science and mathematics courses. This issue will be studied further as state trend data are available through CCSSO. In sum, course taking data indicate that American high school students are now taking more science and mathematics courses in high school at all levels, and the data suggest that state policies are related to the 2 The average number of credits earned in mathematics increased from 2.4 in 1982 to 2.98 in 1987 (these statistics included lower level courses such as general mathematics and pre.algebn), and the avenge number of credits in science increased (rom 2.19 in 1982 to 243 in 198Z ivtich is an increase of half a credit in each subject (Noland and Thorne, 1989). 4 increased enrollments. However, the rates of increased course taking are smaller for more advanced courses such as chemistry, physics, trigonometry, and calculus."}, {"section_title": "Has the Supply of Qualified Teachers in", "text": "Science and Mathematics Improved? Central to policy reforms in the 1980's many states began initiatives aimed at improving the supply and quality of teachers. State policies increased incentives for entering and staying in teaching. For example, many states raised the minimum pay scale for teachers, and about half established alternative certification policies (CCSSO, 1989). States also developed loan and scholarship programs in critical teaching fields. At the same time, states raised standards for becoming a teacher. For example, by 1987 all states had specific state requirements for the amount a subject area preparation for certification of science and mathematics teachers (Blank and Espenshade,1 ). In addition, 36 states mandated written tests of teacher knowledge for certification (ETS Policy Information Center, 1990-These policy initiatives responded to predictions that supply of qualified teachers was declining and existing teachers wore insufficiently prepared, particularly in science and mathematics. Now, as we enter the 1990 's, it is important to assess whether the condition of the teaching force in scier.ce and mathematics has improved and whethei predictions of severe shortages in the 1990's are still likely. One of the major objectives under Goal 4 on science and mathematics is to \"increase by 50% the number of teachers with a substantive background in science and mathematics\" (National Governors Association, 1990). Two national panels have recently outlined the need for improved data on teacher supply, demand, and quality (National Research Council, 1990;NEGP, 1991 "}, {"section_title": "Current Teacher Supply in Science and Mathematics", "text": "In 1989-90, there were approximately 111 thousand teachers of mathematics and 102 thousand teachers of science in public high schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990). This compares with 10.8 million students in grades 9-12 enrolled in public schools, (NCES, 1990), or an average of 107 students per mathematics teacher and 116 students per science teacher? Considering these overall numbers of students and teachers, what data are available to tell us if the supply of teachers for our schools has improved or declined? A first level of analysis is whether school districts are able to hire teachrts to put in science and mathematics classrooms, Le, the availability of new or continuing teachers, without considering teacher quality. o Low attrition rate of teachers. The supply of teachers did not decline during the 1980's due to high attrition. The attrition rate of teachers is now relatively lowabout 5 percent per year for science and mathematics teachen as well as for all public school teachers (Bobbitt, 1991). However, attrition rates are higher for teachers in the physical sciences, due to more professional opportunities outside of teaching that offer significantly higher pay (Murnane, et al, 1988 teachers and approximately n percent of science teachers were over age 50, while 21 percent of all high school teachers were over age 50. Thus, as a national average, science and mathematics teachers will not be retiring more rapidly than other teachers. However, the proportion of science and mathematics teachers over age 50 varies by state from 10 percent to over 30 percent. A shortage of science and mathematics teachers can be anticipated in a few states that have much higher percentages of their teaching force over 50 than other states. These states include Minnesota, Delaware, California, Michigan, and Illinois (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990). Projections by NCES show that attrition rates will rise to almost 10 percent after 1995 due to increasing retirement (NCES, 1989 (Rollefson, 1991). In some districts, over half of new hires were from the \u00b0reserve poor of teachers who 3 Students per teacher averages adjusted by the number of parttime teachers of science and mathematics. left teaching and returned (NRC, 1990, Kirby, et al, 1991. Hiring from the reserve pool went up sharply in the 1980's. At the same time, efforts in the 1980's to encourage more science and mathematics teachers appear to have worked because the number of new certified college graduates in science and mathematics teaching increased (Lauritzen, 1990). The number of 1988 college graduates with majors in mathematics education was more than twice the number in 1982 (2,250 vs. 1,000), and the number of graduates with parttime majors in science education doubled in the same period (2,200 in 1988 vs 950 in 1982) (NCES, 1985(NCES, . 1990). o Shortage of chanistry and physks teachers. National data for the 1987-88 school year show that only one percent of all teaching positions veze unfilled (NCES, 1991a). Howevrx, school principals report that physics and chemistry teachers are harder to hire than teachers in any other field (Weiss, 1987). According to state data in 11 states, there are more high schools than the total number of assigned chemistry teachers, and in 28 states there art more high schools than the total number ef assigned physics teachers. The number of assigned physics teachers is less than ixie-balf the number of high schools in Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Utah (Blank and Da Mc, 1990)."}, {"section_title": "Supply of Qualified Science and Mathematics Teachers", "text": "To address the question of whether there is au adequate teacher supply also requires application of a criterion of a 'qualified\" teacher in science and mathematics. For example, the criterion used by the National Education Goals Panel is the proportion of science and mathematics teachers in each state vnth a college major in their assigned field of teaching (NEGP, 1991). Another definition of qualified has been based on the standards established by the professional science and mathematics teacher associations (Weiss, 1989;National Science Board, 1989). A definition often used by states is whether a teacher is state-certified in the assigned teaching field (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990 varies by state from 20 percent (Louisiana) to 62 percent (Kentucky), and in science from 31 percent (Louisiana) to 73 percent (Minnesota, Missouri) (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990;National Education Goals Panel, 1991). "}, {"section_title": "Equity in the Teaching Force", "text": "Another consideration in analyzing the supply of science and mathematics teachers is equity, i.e., the extent to which gender and racefethnicity of teachers matches the characteristics of siudents. Oakes (1990b) found that the rate of participation of female and minority students in science and mathematics courses is related to the presence of female and minority teachers.  Blank and Dalkilic, 1990 varies by state from 10 percent (Michigan, Minnesota, Utah) to 49 percent (Alabama) (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990). o Shortage of minority teachers in all science and mathematics fields. State data on the race/ethnicity of high school science and mathematics teachers show that there is a wide disparity between the supply of minority science and mathematics teachers and the number of minority students in virtually all states. The proportion of minority teachers are: mathematics-11 percent, biologyW percent, chemistry-7 percent, and physics-5 percent, while 11 percent of all high school teachers are from minority gaups (Blank and Dalkilic, 1990). The student population in our public schools is 32 percent minority. Table 4 (attached) summarizes the state-bystate dats on minority teachers and minority students. From 1982 to 1987 the percent of all public school teachers that are from minority groups increased two percent (from 8 to 10 percent), and the proportion of teachers who are African-American declined by one percent (NCES, 1990 such as from higher enrollments in high school and mathematics. The data have addressed teacher supply and shortages in high school science and mathematics, but shortages of qualified teachers may be more acute at the middle school/junior high level. Also, recent research has found that the average elementary classroom teacher has poor preparation in science and limited preparation in mathematics (Weiss, 1989). Finally, the indicators of \"qualified teachers\" do not measure actual teaching skills or practices, rather they measure the teacher's preparation for teaching in their subject. The National Education Goals Panel has recommended the collection and reporting of more detailed information on teachiLg skills and practices. In sum, the current data on science and mathematics teachers lead to three general findings: first, some indicators of teacher shortages have improved since the early 1980's; second, teacher shortages vary by specialty within science and mathematics and by state; and, third, the critezion of a \"qualified teacher' needs to be specified to determine shortages of science and mathematics teachers. We also know that shortages are greater in certain types of school districts and schools. o Increased achievement of African-Americans in science and mathematics.' Although the achievement levels of African-American students continue to average below the level of white students, the gap in achievement between African-Americans and whites has been reduced in both science and mathematics since 1982. As shown on page 9, the scores of African-Americans in science improved significantly at ages 9, 13, and 17 in the 1980s, with the largest gain at age 17 of 18 points. African-American students' scores in mathematics also increased significantly at all ages, with 17 point increase at age 17 (NCES, 1991c). Smith and O'Day use the NAEP trend data to show that there has been considerable progress toward the goal of equality of educational outcomes since 1966, even though there is still much more progress needed (1991). Achievement Trends in NAEP for African-American Students NCES, 1991 Trends in Academic Proms o Student proficiency in mathematics Improving, but still low. The National Education Goals Panel reported the 1990 NAEP mathematics scores in its first report in September 1991, and concluded that at grades 4, 8, and 12, less than 20 percent of students demonstrated 'competency in mathematics for their grade level (1991). NAEP trend data are reported by proficiency levels, and 1990 results indicate that the majority of students are proficient at a level of mathematics that is below what could be expected for their age and grade? However, the trend data also show that mathematics proficiency has improved at all gade levels, with the most improvement at age 9. The trends by age and proficiency level are shown on page 10. o Among 17 year olds, only 7 percent scored at or above the mathematics level indicating proficiency with algebra and geometry and multi-step problem solving (i.e., prepared for advanced mathematics beyond high school). From 1982 to 1990 the percentage of students at this level increased only one percent. The percent of 17 year olds at or above the next lowest levelproficiency in fractions, decimals, percents and simple algebra and geometry--increased from 49 percent to 56 percent. o At age 9 (about 4th grade), 28 percent of students scored at or above the proficiency level of numerical operations with multiplication and division and beginning problem solving, which was a 9 percent increase since 1981 At the next lowest level proficiency in additive numerical operations and problem solving with whole numbers-82 percent of the nine year olds were proficient, which was an 11 percent increase from 1982 (NCES, 1991c). o State-by-state mathematics results show wide variation in learning. In 1990, NAEP conducted a Trial State Assessment of public school students in mathematics at grade 8. The results provide the first state-by-state comparisons on mathematics proficiency of U.S. eighth graders (NCES, 1991b). The 1990 results showed wide variation in mathematics knowledge and skills within and between states. The percentages of students scoring at the proficiency level of reasoning and problem solving with fractions, decimals, percents, and simple algebra and geometry (300 scale level), varied by state from 24 perccat of grade students took fou7 years of high school mathematics. The average achievement score for these students was 36 points higher than students who had taken less than three years of high school mathematics, or almost the equivalent of one level on the proficiency scale (NCES, 1991b). The 1990 results demonstrated a strong positive relationship between level of course taking in mathematics and mathematics achievement at both 8th and 12th grades."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Findings", "text": "States undertook many policy initiatives in the 1980's with the goal of stimulating improvements in the quality of education. Recently educators, scholars, and policymakers have questioned the effects of the state reforms on changing education in schools and classrooms. Students are taking more science and mathematics courses in high school at all levels, and the data suggest that state policies are related to the increased enrollments. However, the rates of increased course taking arc smaller for more advanced courses such as chemistry, physics, trigonometry, and calculus. Trend analyses of NAEP assessments in science and mathematics show that proficiency scorm have increased somewhat since 1982. The average achievement of 17year-olds increased significantly in science and mathematics, and the achievement of 9-year-ohls increased significantly in mathematics. The rate of improvement in NAEP proficiency scores has been greater for African-American students than for white students in science and mathematics, and the gap in achievement has been reduced. The NAEP achievement results showed a strong, positive relationship to the amount of coursework in science and mathematics.
