Using an advanced support vector machine (SVM) approach, we developed a multimodal classifier for predicting brain amyloidosis. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the ADNI1 MCI cohort received PiB-PET scans. Therefore, we took advantage of the strong agreement between CSF Ab 42 #192 pg/mL and PiB SUVR $1.5 thresholds and used ADNI1 MCI subjects with CSF Ab 42 data but no PiB-PET biomarker data (n 5 151) to develop our classification methodology, which was then tested in the smaller cohort of ADNI1 MCI subjects with PiB-PET data (n 5 60). We also assessed the utility of our biomarker signature to predict subsequent clinical progression to AD at 24 and 36 months in all 211 subjects. METHODS Subjects. Data used to prepare this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations; subjects have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. For up-to-date information, see www. adni-info.org. ADNI1 enrolled approximately 400 subjects with amnestic MCI, 200 with mild AD, and 200 normal control subjects, aged 55 to 90 years, between 2005 and 2008. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The clinical description of the ADNI1 cohort was recently published. 5 The full list of inclusion/exclusion criteria may be accessed online at http://www.adni-info.org/Scientists/ADNIGrant.aspx. ADNI1 enrolled 398 subjects with MCI. The 151 subjects with MCI who provided peripheral blood and CSF, but not PiB-PET data, were selected for inclusion in our training sample. Conversely, the 60 subjects with MCI who provided peripheral blood and PiB-PET imaging constituted our testing sample. MCI progressors were defined as subjects with MCI who progressed to AD at any point of their follow-up. Nonprogressors were defined as subjects with MCI who at the respective 24-month and 36-month visit were still diagnosed as MCI.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. ADNI study sites received approval from their institutional ethical standards committee on human experimentation. Written informed consent was obtained from all research subjects participating in the study or their surrogates when applicable.\nFeature selection. We selected the following well-established cognitive measures for inclusion in the classifier models: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 6 the most frequently used brief cognitive screening instrument; Trails B, 7 an easy-toadminister measure of executive function; and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) delayed recall, 8 a sensitive word list verbal memory measure.\nWe selected the following peripheral blood proteins for inclusion in our models: ApoE, a protein involved in cholesterol and Ab metabolism; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose circulating levels are altered in AD 9 ; tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), a proinflammatory and apoptotic marker elevated in AD 10 ; interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), the receptor molecule for IL-6-a proinflammatory cytokine; interleukin 13 (IL-13), a cytokine associated with Ab burden in AD 11 ; and clusterin (ApoJ), a lipoprotein involved in Ab fibril formation and clearance. 12 Many studies have demonstrated aberrant levels of each of these proteins in peripheral blood in AD, and have found associations between their concentrations and subsequent cognitive decline and/or imaging changes. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] We applied log 10 transformation to normalize the distribution of all ADNI1 plasma protein variables.\nWe also included APOE e4 genotype and hippocampal volume. APOE, the most established genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, 26 can be reliably determined from peripheral blood samples. Hippocampal atrophy, the most established structural imaging biomarker of AD, is readily detectable in the MCI and even the presymptomatic stages of AD. [27] [28] [29] [30] PiB biomarker data. Description of PiB-PET acquisition may be found at http://www.adni-info.org. We downloaded the PiB SUVR measures from the University of Pittsburgh from the ADNI Web site in October 2008. Each subject's PiB SUVR image was sampled with an automated 14 region-of-interest (ROI) template including 9 cortical (anterior cingulate, frontal, sensorimotor, lateral temporal, mesial temporal, parietal and occipital cortex, the occipital pole, and the precuneus) and 3 subcortical (anterior ventral striatum, thalamus, and subcortical white matter) ROIs in addition to the pons and the cerebellum. We derived mean cortical PiB SUVR by averaging the 9 cortical ROI measures. SUVR estimation was done blindly. PiB data were acquired at various time points relative to the baseline MRI. Fourteen subjects had their PiB scan at the time of their ADNI baseline assessments, 40 subjects at the 12-month, one subject at the 18-month, and 5 subjects at the 24-month follow-up assessment. We paired PiB data with the corresponding demographic and hippocampal volumetric variables from the same visit. Plasma protein measures were derived at baseline, and therefore preceded PiB scans in some cases.\nFluid biomarker data. We downloaded the baseline CSF Ab 42 data from the ADNI Web site (http://adni.loni.usc.edu) in October 2008. The CSF collection and transportation protocols and procedural details on CSF Ab 42 measurements are provided at http://www.adni-info.org and in a recent ADNI publication. 3 Plasma collection, proteomic platforms, and assays are described in detail in reference 10.\nHippocampal segmentation. We downloaded and linearly registered the preprocessed baseline 1.5, 3-dimensional T1-weighted scans to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping 53 brain template 31 using a 9-parameter transformation. 32 We resampled the images to an isotropic space of 220 voxels along each axis resulting in a final voxel size of 1 mm 3 . The hippocampi were segmented with our recently developed and validated automated machine-learning hippocampal segmentation technique (AdaBoost), which uses adaptive boosting 33 as previously described. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Hippocampal volumes were extracted.\nStatistical methods. Our analyses were performed retrospectively. We examined the baseline differences in subject demographics, cognitive performance, hippocampal volume, and blood protein measures in the CSF training, PiB-PET testing, and MCI progressor/nonprogressor cohorts using 2-tailed t tests for continuous variables and x 2 tests for categorical variables. Support vector machine classifier. SVMs are a popular machine-learning algorithm. SVMs have been particularly successful in biological classification, because nonlinear kernels introduced to the algorithm allow for nonplanar, multidimensional surfaces to classify patterns of data. We optimized the radial basis function kernel and the SVM cost parameter through grid search using the e1071 package in R (http://cran.r-project.org). Because noncontributory features degrade the classification, we allowed our classifier to rank all features and to iteratively remove those with lower weights until it finds the set of features that yields maximal classification accuracy.\nWe trained the SVM algorithm in all ADNI1 subjects with MCI who had available baseline protein and CSF Ab 42 data but no PiB-PET imaging (n 5 151). The outcome variable was CSF Ab 42 # or .192 pg/mL. The CSF training classifier also included age, sex, and education. Cross-validation used the leave-one-out (LOOCV) approach. We computed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the classifier's prediction performance.\nOur PiB classifiers used the subjects with MCI who had available protein and PiB-PET data (n 5 60). We ran 2 PiB classifiers: the first one was run with the fixed tuning parameters from the CSF training classifier (PiB testing-without-tuning classifier) and the second where the PiB classifier was allowed to tune its cost and gamma parameters for optimal classification while using LOOCV (PiB testing-with-tuning classifier). The reason for allowing self-tuning while still restricting ourselves to the variables chosen by the CSF training classifier was to further refine the variable list to the ones that are most useful for predicting PiB positivity.\nOur primary goal was to identify a clinical biomarker signature of brain amyloidosis in the ADNI1 MCI cohort. The PiB testing-without-tuning classifier results were used assigning level-of-evidence statement because the classifier resulting from PiB testing-with-tuning has incorporation bias. The PiB testing-without-tuning results were assigned as Class II level of evidence, while the PiB testing-with-tuning results were assigned Class IV level of evidence.\nNext, we explored how well the CSF training and the PiB testing-with-tuning classifier features performed when predicting future progression from MCI to AD at 24 and 36 months. We ran these classifiers once with fixed parameters and a second time while allowing self-tuning for optimal performance while using LOOCV. Tuning allowed us to detect the optimal classifier performance without restricting ourselves to parameters that worked for predicting closely related but obviously not identical measures (high PiB and low CSF Ab 42 ).\nAll classifiers were further subjected to selection bias correction using permutation analyses. The permutation method empirically evaluates the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. We ran 10,000 permutations of the dependent variable (clinical diagnosis) against the sets of individual biomarker characteristics for each individual classifier and defined a final single corrected p value for each ROC.\nWe computed sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for specific biomarker cutpoints and computed normal approximation confidence intervals (CIs) for those parameters.\nAll classifiers were rerun after excluding APOE e2 carriers (CSF sample n 5 11; PiB sample n 5 3). The results can be seen in The groups showed significant differences in cognitive performance and genotype distribution: the CSF Ab 42 #192 pg/mL group had poorer AVLT and higher Trails B scores and higher proportion of APOE e41 subjects compared with the CSF Ab 42 .192 pg/mL group.\nPiB testing sample. Baseline demographic and biomarker comparisons between the MCI group with PiB SUVR $1.5 and the MCI group with PiB SUVR ,1.5 are shown in table 1. Significantly poorer MMSE scores were seen in the PiB SUVR ,1.5 group while AVLT and Trails B were similar in the 2 PiB groups. Plasma ApoE and CSF Ab 42 levels were significantly lower in subjects with MCI who had PiB SUVR ,1.5; these subjects were also more likely to be APOE e41.\nDemographic comparisons of the CSF testing and PiB training samples. We found no significant differences in age, education, sex, APOE genotype, MMSE score, hippocampal volume, and plasma protein levels between subjects with MCI with CSF Ab 42 #192 pg/mL and those with PiB SUVR $1.5. Subjects with MCI who had CSF Ab 42 #192 pg/mL performed significantly worse on the AVLT and on Trails B relative to subjects with MCI who had PiB SUVR $1.5.\nDemographic and biomarker variables were similar between subjects with MCI with CSF Ab 42 .192 pg/mL and those with PiB SUVR ,1.5 except for marginally lower MMSE scores and plasma IL-6R levels in the subjects with MCI from the CSF sample.\nA subset of 29 subjects had both PiB-PET and CSF Ab 42 data, which allowed us to compute the accuracy with which CSF Ab 42 predicted PiB SUVR $1.5. Twenty of the 21 subjects with PiB SUVR $1.5 also had CSF Ab 42 #192 pg/mL (sensitivity 95%). Seven of the 8 subjects with PiB SUVR ,1.5 also had CSF Ab 42 .192 pg/mL (specificity 88%). The overall predictive accuracy of PiB SUVR from CSF Ab 42 was 93%.\nMCI progression to AD. The baseline demographic and biomarker comparisons between subjects with MCI who progressed to AD vs those who did not at month 24 and month 36 can be seen in table 2. At baseline, MCI progressors showed significantly rank order). The permutation-corrected classifier significance was p , 0.00001. Taking into account that CSF #192 pg/mL is found in 74% of ADNI subjects with MCI, our classifier achieved sensitivity 5 92%, specificity 5 65%, positive predictive value (PPV) 5 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 5 74%. Results are shown in panel A of the figure and table e-2. APOE genotype alone achieved accuracy of 76% and AUC 5 0.7 (95% CI 5 69%-83%).\nPiB testing-without-tuning classifier. We rigidly entered the 9 features and the optimized cost and gamma parameters selected by the CSF training classifier in the PiB testing classifier. The classifier achieved an AUC of 0.78 in predicting PiB-positive (PiB SUVR $1.5) and PiB-negative (PiB SUVR ,1.5) cases. Taking into account that a positive amyloid PET scan is found in 63% of ADNI subjects with MCI, our classifier achieved sensitivity 5 68%, specificity 5 78%, PPV 5 84%, and NPV 5 59%. The ROC curve is shown in panel C of the figure. At fixed 80% sensitivity, the classifier showed 65% sensitivity. The permutation-corrected classifier significance was p 5 0.19. APOE genotype alone achieved accuracy of only 28% and AUC 5 0.78 (95% CI 5 17%-39%).\nPiB testing-with-tuning classifier. Because we developed a classifier model using a proxy measure for brain amyloidosis (CSF Ab 42 ) that is highly correlated but not identical to the true measure of brain amyloidosis (PiB-PET), we reran the PiB testing classifier using the 9 features selected by the CSF training classifier while allowing the classifier to rank and select from these features and fine-tune its parameters for optimal classification. Using LOOCV, this classifier achieved an accuracy of 83% (95% CI 5 74%-93%) and an AUC of 0.78. Taking into account that a positive amyloid PET scan is found in 63% of ADNI subjects with MCI, our classifier achieved sensitivity 5 79%, specificity 5 83%, PPV 5 89%, and NPV 5 70%. The ROC curve is shown in panel B of the figure. The features selected by the final model (in rank order) were APOE genotype, MMSE, Trails B, IL-6R, and clusterin (see table e-2). The permutation-corrected classifier significance was p , 0.00001. APOE genotype alone achieved accuracy of 77% and AUC 5 0.7 (95% CI 5 66%-88%).\nDisease-progression classifiers. We further explored how well the set of 9 variables selected by the CSF training classifier could predict progression from MCI to AD at 24 and 36 months. Running the stringent model using fixed parameters from the CSF training classifier resulted in an AUC 5 0.72 at 24 months and AUC 5 0.76 at 36 months. Neither classifier produced acceptable accuracy. The ROC curves are shown in panels E and G of the figure.\nOnce we allowed the disease-progression classifiers to rank and select features and fine-tune their parameters for optimal classification, their performance marginally improved. The 24-month diseaseprogression classifier achieved an AUC 5 0.74 and accuracy of 73% (95% CI 5 68%-78%) and the 36month disease-progression classifier an AUC 5 0.77 and accuracy of 74% (95% CI 5 69%-79%). The 24-month disease-progression classifier selected (in rank order) AVLT, Trails B, APOE genotype, and IL-6R. The 36-month disease-progression classifier selected (in rank order) AVLT, APOE genotype, and Trails B. The permutation-corrected classifier significance for both classifiers was p , 0.00001. The results are shown in panels D and F of the figure and table e-2.\nDISCUSSION Our data suggest that plasma, imaging, and cognitive measures can be used to potentially predict brain amyloidosis with modest accuracy and confirm the AD relevance of IL-6R and clusterinthe 2 plasma measures that proved useful for this classification. The LOOCV used by the CSF training classifier is criticized by some for its perceived tendency to inflate the classifier's performance. A true cross-validation should in theory use nonoverlapping samples. Here, we used the PiB sample as our validation sample. Both the rigidly run and the tuned PiB testing classifiers achieved acceptable but modest accuracies.\nFor identification of subjects with MCI at greatest risk of disease progression to dementia, the selftuning classifiers achieved reasonable but modest predictive accuracy. Of note, some but not all of the variables that showed between-group differences (see table 2) were selected. MMSE, for instance, was not chosen, but more challenging tests (AVLT and Trails B) were. IL-6R was the only plasma protein measure that was included.\nSeveral strengths and limitations of this study should be acknowledged. ADNI-the premier longitudinal biomarker study in AD-continues to provide researchers with clinical, cognitive, and biomarker samples free of charge. ADNI uses unified subject assessment, MRI, PiB-PET, CSF, and peripheral blood collection protocols and meticulous data quality control across the sites. Because ADNI uses rigorous exclusion criteria typical of clinical trials, our results have direct implications for clinical trials but may be less applicable to outpatient diagnostic assessments. The lack of a sizable MCI cohort with PiB-PET imaging that would have allowed a true classifier development and more extensive cross-validation is a limitation of this study. There is some etiologic/pathologic uncertainty in the MCI stage because at least 30% of subjects with amnestic MCI have been found to harbor non-AD pathology. 39 However, it is precisely this etiologic heterogeneity that we are trying to overcome with our analyses. We only assessed the classifier performance with the most widely accepted PiB SUVR cutoff of 1.5. If higher levels of clinical trial cohort enrichment for brain amyloidosis, and hence improved cost-effectiveness, are sought, the use of a higher PiB SUVR cutoff value might prove valuable to further reduce the proportion of false-positive cases. Finally, similar to any other microarray technology, proteomic microarray analyses have inherent technical limitations. An important source of variability for this type of technology is assay time/batch differences between the samples. This could result in future validation issues. Although the biological significance of our plasma analytes has been previously documented, our findings will need to be independently replicated. stabilizing microtubules to treat Alzheimer's disease, Method of detecting abnormally phosphorylated tau, Method of screening for Alzheimer's disease or disease associated with the accumulation of paired helical filaments, Compositions and methods for producing and using homogeneous neuronal cell transplants, Rat comprising straight filaments in its brain, Compositions and methods for producing and using homogeneous neuronal cell transplants to treat neurodegenerative disorders and brain and spinal cord injuries, Diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease by detection of multiple MRNAs, Methods and compositions for determining lipid peroxidation levels in oxidant stress syndromes and diseases, Compositions and methods for producing and using homogeneous neuronal cell transplants, Method of identifying, diagnosing, and treating alphasynuclein positive neurodegenerative disorders, Mutation-specific functional impairments in distinct tau isoforms of hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17: genotype predicts phenotype, Microtubule stabilizing therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, and Treatment of Alzheimer's and related diseases with an antibody.
