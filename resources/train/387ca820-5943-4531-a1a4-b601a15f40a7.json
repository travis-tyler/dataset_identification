[{"section_title": "PREFACE", "text": "Each year in December the Vice President for Research provides the Annual Research Report for the Board of Regents, summarizing the University's research metrics for the past year, documenting the trends in research productivity and benchmarking the University's performance and ranking among its peer group. This later metric, based on the ranking data published by the National Science Foundation for R&D expenditures for the nation's research universities, is the most commonly recognized basis for comparison among research intensive universities depending as it does on the compilation and analysis of responses to a standardized national survey tool. As such, analysis of the University's performance on the basis of the annual NSF R&D expenditure report has been a prominent feature of the annual report to the Board and a basis for measuring progress toward the U's aspirational goal to be one of the top public research universities in the world. In the first revision to the NSF Higher Education Research and Development Survey in years, the NSF last year made several significant changes to the Survey. One notable change that will have an impact for the U and the assessment of its performance relative to its peer group is the NSF's decision to split out the research data for university systems into statistics for each individual research institution in the system. As a consequence, the data for the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and that for each coordinate campus will henceforth be reported separately. As a result of the widespread changes introduced in the NSF Survey this past round and a correspondingly longer verification process for data submitted by the nearly 700 universities included in the Survey, NSF will not publish the official Survey results for FY2010 until sometime after the new year -postponing the traditional October-November publication date. As a consequence, we do not have access to the official data we routinely use in our December Annual Report to the Regents. Given the heavy reliance on this data set for analyses included in our Annual Report we have elected to deviate from our standard practice of providing the Board with a printed hardcopy of the Annual Report, preferring to commit the final report to print only after the official NSF Survey data are published. Although we do not have confirmed statistics for the other academic participants in the NSF Survey, we have our own NSF Survey expenditure and award data and have access to similar data submitted by other AAU universities through AAU's data exchange program. While these data are not \"official\" and changes have been known to occur between submission to the data exchange and publication of the Survey results, we are confident that the available data will provide reasonable surrogate measures to permit our traditional comparative analysis pending availability of the official Survey results in early 2012. In addition to my traditional rejoinder that no single measure or set of currently available measures can accurately or even reasonably capture the full measure of a great research university, the Regents are also cautioned to be mindful of the preliminary nature of the results and analysis included in this report."}, {"section_title": "SPONSORED RESEARCH AWARDS", "text": "University of Minnesota faculty and staff competed successfully for $769 million in sponsored research awards in FY2011 ( Figure 1). The award total was down $53 million (7%) from the total for FY2010. Grant support from ARRA funding declined as expected, netting $57 million less in 2011 than in 2010. After factoring the impact of declining ARRA funding on the award total, non-ARRA awards were actually $4 million greater than for FY2010. Figure 2 and 3 display sponsored award data by source and collegiate unit, respectively. The sources of funding have remained relatively constant over the past with federal agencies, dominated by NIH and NSF, accounting for 72% of all sponsored research. Overall distribution of awards across collegiate units is similarly consistent, though significant declines in funding to the Medical School, College of Science and Engineering and School of Public Health account for the majority of the decline in awards in the past year. Much of this decline, in turn, reflects the overall decline in ARRA funding. Award growth of 10% or more were recorded by the College of Education and Human Development, College of Biological Sciences and the College of Liberal Arts.

Despite some year-to-year variations, the proportion of funding from the major source categories has remained relatively stable over the past decade, with the introduction of ARRA fund in 2009 being a notable exception. The significant impact of ARRA funding is evident in the very sizeable growth in awards total registered in FY2010. As noted in last year's Annual Report, some disruptions in award disbursements from federal agencies occurred as they scrambled to deal with the short fund distribution time limits imposed by the America Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This resulted in delays in issuance of some 2009 award notices, contributing in part to the drop in awards recorded in that fiscal year. When this anomaly is taken into account, awards show a steady upward trend over the past 8 years.  Table 2 lists the ranking of the top 20 public research institutions in the United States according to the three metrics we have reported to the Board over the past seven years. The universities included in the Table  are listed in rank order according to preliminary NSF Survey research expenditures for 2010 (see Preface). Each institution's corresponding 2010 rank according to the Center for Measuring University Performance (Arizona) and the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Research Universities are also listed.

The University of Minnesota retained its eighth-place ranking among public research universities in FY2010. Figure 5 presents the research expenditure data for the top twenty public research universities for FY2010. It is important to note that the research expenditure data for the University of Minnesota represents only the research expenditures for the Twin Cities campus. Unlike previous years in which the U's total represented the aggregate research contributions from all campuses in the System, the revised Survey methodology now considers each campus individually. The FY2010 total for the University of Minnesota System would be $808 million rather than the $786 million reported in Figure 5 had the traditional methodology been utilized in FY2010.
