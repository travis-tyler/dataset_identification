The clinical implication of this is that repeated cognitive testing is essential to identify those individuals with progressing cognitive decline, and hence at the greatest AD-risk (Albert et al., 2011) .\nRepeated cognitive testing can lead to incorrect conclusions if an individual's performance is compared against the same normative data on two occasions, because an increase in performance is expected for a number of cognitive tests due to the exposure to the same test in a previous occasion. This phenomenon, known as practice effects (Duff, 2012) , has been documented in several populations including MCI (Calamia et al., 2012) . Practice effects on memory tests have been reported in individuals with aMCI within the same session (Duff et al., 2012) and over periods of one week (Duff et al., 2017a) , eighteen months (Campos-Magdaleno et al., 2017) and even 5 years (Gavett et al., 2016) , and have proven useful to identify individuals with aMCI who will show larger cognitive decline after one year follow-up (Duff et al., 2011) . However, some researchers have reported no practice effects in individuals with aMCI over different periods (Darby et al., 2002; Schrijnemaekers et al., 2006) , so their utility remains controversial.\nPractice effects have been associated with APOE \u03b54 genotype (Machulda et al., 2013; Zehnder et al., 2009) and with brain metabolism, which in turn have been associated with the AD-risk. It is known that APOE \u03b54 carriers, mostly those carrying two copies of M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 the allele, have an increased AD-risk compared to APOE \u03b54 non-carriers and carriers of APOE \u03b52 and \u03b53 alleles (Elias-Sonnenschein et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2014) . In one study on practice effects (Machulda et al., 2013) , APOE carriers failed to sustain their initial practice effects over one year, with a level of performance similar to baseline after approximately 6 years of follow-up. Regarding brain metabolism, although data on the accuracy of FDG-PET are highly variable (Smailagic et al., 2015) , FDG-PET has been suggested as a more sensitive tool than cognitive scores for predicting AD in aMCI (Herholz et al., 2011) . FDG-PET has been associated with practice effects on tests of visual and verbal memory, with more brain hypometabolism being associated with worse cognitive performance and lower practice effects (Duff et al., 2015 (Duff et al., , 2014 . However, the associations between practice effects and the AD-risk, and also the differential predictive value of AD for practice effects, APOE genotype and brain metabolism was not analyzed in either of these previous studies.\nIn the present study, we aimed to analyze whether practice effects in aMCI over two successive assessments can help to identify individuals at the greatest AD-risk, and also to compare the predictive value of practice effects with APOE genotype and brain metabolism measured with FDG-PET. We expected that individuals with aMCI who did not show practice effects would have the greatest AD-risk compared to those with aMCI who did show practice effects (Duff et al., 2011; Hassenstab et al., 2015) . Due to the lack of previous comparisons among practice effects, APOE and FDG-PET, we could not make a priori hypotheses about a superior predictive value for any of the variables analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Sample data", "text": "Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) were used in this study. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a publicprivate partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nThe Normal cognition group (NC) included 394 participants (48.2% females) aged 56 to 89 years with no depression or metabolic diseases, no cognitive complaints, a Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score = 0, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score equal or higher than 24, normal education-corrected Logical Memory (LM) delayed recall scores, and no significant impairments in activities of daily living. In the aMCI group (Petersen et al., 1999) , 816 participants (40.8% females) aged 55 to 91 years with no metabolic diseases had subjective cognitive complaints, MMSE score \u226524, CDR score = 0.5 (mandatory memory box score \u22650.5), abnormal education-corrected LM delayed recall scores, general cognition and functional performance largely intact, and did not meet criteria for dementia. Five participants (0.6%) had mild depressive symptoms. All participants underwent physical and neurological examinations, screening laboratory tests, and provided blood samples for DNA and APOE testing.

Then, baseline AVLT scores, the intercept, beta coefficient and standard error of the regression equation were used to predict six-months AVLT delayed recall scores in each aMCI participant. Predicted retest scores were subtracted from observed retest scores, and this discrepancy was divided by the standard error of a predicted score for a new case [(T observed -T predicted )/S n+1 ] according to Crawford and Garthwaite (2007) .\nThe standardized discrepancy was compared against a t distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2007) , which is preferred over a normal distribution because it treats the sample used to build the regression equation as a sample and not as a population, and it has a lower rate of type I error compared to a z distribution (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2005) . However, as the sample used to build the regression equation was large, p-values associated with discrepancies were similar to those obtained using a normal distribution (data not shown).\nThe p-value associated to the t n-2 statistic can be interpreted as the percentage of individuals from the sample used to build the regression equation showing a similar or more extreme discrepancy (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2007) , which could be interpreted as a percentile from a distribution of discrepancies. Based on statistical cut-off points used in the literature to define objective cognitive impairment, we used the bottom 10%, 7% and 5% of the NC group, which correspond to z-scores of approximately -1.28, -1.5 and -1.64 respectively for a one-sided test.

Participants glucose levels were measured two hours after the last ingestion, and FDG-PET scans performed 30 minutes after intravenous administration of [ 18 F]-FDG if blood glucose level was <180 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L). The variable FDG from the ADNIMERGE file was analyzed, which indicates the baseline average FDG uptake of angular, temporal and posterior cingulate gyri.\nIndividuals with AD have lower values than MCI and NC, so higher values of FDG-PET indicate higher cerebral metabolism (Landau et al., 2011) . To facilitate interpretation of the results from a regression model (see Section 2.5), FDG-PET values were multiplied by 100 for values to show the difference in the AD-risk for one unit increase in FDG-PET metabolism. Using this scale is also easier to interpret than using exponentiated values. The aMCI sample decreased to 627 participants due to missing (Richardson, 2011) . Sex ratio was compared with a chi-square test.\nThe AD-risk was compared with hazard ratios (HR) from a multivariable backward stepwise Cox proportional regression model. The first step included age, sex and education as demographic variables. The second step included PE+ and PE-groups, with baseline AVLT and MMSE scores as covariates. Including baseline AVLT scores allowed us controlling whether the AD-risk for PE-and PE+ groups was above and beyond baseline AVLT-DR scores, as in previous research (Duff et al., 2017b (Duff et al., , 2015 (Duff et al., , 2011 Gavett et al., 2016; Hassenstab et al., 2015) .

The AD-risk among APOE negative individuals is three times as high for individuals not showing practice effects, and is also higher than the risk estimate for aMCI at baseline. Among individuals with at least one APOE allele, those not showing practice effects have the greatest AD-risk, with a risk estimate twice as high as that for aMCI diagnosis at baseline.

We found that individuals with aMCI who did not show practice effects as expected based on a healthy comparison group had a significantly higher AD-risk, and also that the risk estimate for practice effects was higher than that for FDG-PET data and similar and more precise than that for APOE genotype.\nOur results partially agree with previous research analyzing practice effects in aMCI.\nContrary to what has been previously reported using verbal (Duff et al., 2008) and visual memory tests (Duff et al., 2007) , we did not find significant improvements on AVLT delayed recall scores at retest in the aMCI sample. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be related to the test-retest interval, which is inversely related to practice effects (Calamia et al., 2012) . Whereas the studies by Duff et al. (2008 Duff et al. ( , 2007 analyzed practice effects during 1-week and 2-week period, a 6-month period was used in this study. However, factors other than the length of follow-up must be considered, as practice effects have been reported for periods of 18 months after baseline assessment (Campos-Magdaleno et al., 2017) . A possible explanation is that the large sample size in this study mitigated statistical characteristics of cognitive performance such as regression to the mean, which has also been associated with practice effects (Duff, 2012) . The most important finding, however, is that more than 65% of individuals with aMCI showed practice effects when methods other than raw scores were used to define practice effects. Despite there being up to a third of M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 15 individuals with aMCI showing higher retest scores relative to baseline, 25% of the aMCI sample did not show significant practice effects. It is thus important to identify the frequency of test-retest changes in raw scores to more reliably identify practice effects.\nThis work used the regression-based reliable change index with that purpose, and used a t n-2 distribution to identify the distribution of discrepancies between observed and predicted scores. This procedure has been suggested to more reliable identify true change compared to a z distribution, specially for small samples (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2007) . This work is the first that analyzes practice effects for three different cut-off points along the distribution of discrepancies, and the one reporting that the estimate of the AD-risk in aMCI is similar for the lower 10%, 7% and 5% distribution of discrepancies between observed and predicted raw scores.\nThe main finding is that cognitive data, assessed through practice effects, were at least as useful for predicting AD over 6 years as genetic and biomarker data, results that were replicated when FDG-PET missing values were imputed using variables associated with missingness. Although practice effects were related to genetic data as previously reported (Duff et al., 2017b; Machulda et al., 2013) , with the PE-group being more likely to have at least one copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele, the lack of practice effects outperformed FDG-PET in the identification of individuals at the greatest ADrisk, and showed a similar and more precise risk estimate than APOE genotype. This results are in line with those reported by Hassenstab et al. (2015) , who found that APOE was not significant to predict worsening of clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment, and cannot support that FDG-PET are more sensitive than cognitive scores M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 16 for predicting AD in aMCI (Herholz et al., 2011) . Duff et al. (2015) suggested that practice effects can be a proxy of certain biomarkers, and our data add that practice effects and biomarkers might be a useful combination to identify individuals at the greatest AD-risk during a 6-year follow-up. However, risk estimates for APOE and FDG-PET may be biased due to the association of these two variables in the ADNI database (Landau et al., 2013) . Our results are also in line with the findings reported by Machulda et al. (2013) , who found that APOE carriers' performance was similar to baseline after an average follow-up period of 6 years. Thus, future works will replicate whether practice effects are similar or even superior to genetic and biomarker data for predicting progression to AD in different follow-up periods.\nAlthough promising, these results have some limitations. The ADNI project included only one cognitive test to define cognitive impairment in aMCI. Recent diagnostic approaches have reported both NC and MCI misdiagnoses when cognitive impairment is defined using several tests (Edmonds et al., 2015; Oltra-Cucarella et al., 2018) . Second, to avoid circularity between test-retest regressions and risk analyses, we used a simple regression to predict retest AVLT-DR scores using baseline AVLT-DR scores without including other covariates. The use of a simple regression could have an impact on the discrepancy between observed and predicted scores, with multiple regressions providing a larger discrepancy (Duff et al., 2017a) . However, the calculation of the standard error for a new case after conducting multiple regressions is computationally much more complicated than for simple regressions (Crawford et al., 2012) , so using a simple regression may be more feasible to estimate the AD-risk in clinical practice where correlations between predictors are seldom available. The small and negligible differences between NC and MCI on age and education suggest that Our results have important clinical implications that must be highlighted. The most recent criteria for MCI due to AD include biomarkers to define levels of certainty that MCI is a prodromal stage of AD (Albert et al., 2011) . Our results show that practice effects can provide an estimate of the AD-risk over and above biomarker and genetic data, even if raw scores (particularly extreme low scores) increase at the second assessment in a proportion of individuals. Our findings could also be useful for interpreting the results of clinical trials (Brooks and Loewenstein, 2010) , as it has been shown that it is important not only to identify changes in raw scores over a 6 months period but also to identify whether negative discrepancy between observed and expected scores are uncommon in healthy individuals who do not progress to AD.\nShowing a negative discrepancy at the bottom 10% of healthy individuals must warn about the increased AD-risk in individuals with aMCI. This would help to reduce the possibility that practice effects mask treatment effects (Goldberg et al., 2015) , would help to identify eligible individuals for intervention trials, and also to interpret the presence of increased retest scores in those receiving cognitive or pharmacological MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination.
