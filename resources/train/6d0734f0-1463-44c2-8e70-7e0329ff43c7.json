[{"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "Addressed to institutional researchers, this report from California's Chabot College presents information on National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data sets. Included is a discussion on how these data sets can be used to create peer groups of U.S. colleges, and to produce statistics on major student variables for each of these groups. Ideas are presented on how to obtain, and work with NCES data sets, and what resources are needed in terms of time, hardware, software, supplies, and funds. Three major chapters review the usefulness of two data sets: the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS). The conclusion summarizes the value and accessibility of these data sets, and helps institutional researchers evaluate whether they have the inclination or resources to work with either of the sets, or if published materials are better alternatives. The report contains 21 tables. The appendices contain lists of IPEDS and BPS variables used, supporting tables, and additional sources of help in using the NCES data sets. ( At Chabot College, Cieny Carney and Precious Chambers of the Grants Development Office gave me both moral and logistical support in preparing the grant. Their support and celebration of campus grant writers, no matter what the outcome, makes even the grant-writing process rewarding. Mike Calegari of the Chabot Business Office, championed the grant through the many financial and bureaucratic hoops needed to set up a working grant account. And finally, I could not have accomplished all that I did on this grant during the academic year without the gracious and steadfast support of my boss, Donna Marie Ferro, Dean of Matriculation and Academic Standards. She both encouraged me to apply for the grant, and understood when I had to work on it."}, {"section_title": "Disclaimer", "text": "Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Association for Institutional Research, the National Center for Education Statistics, or the National Science Foundation.

Comparative information is becoming mandatory for institutional research reports.1 National peer group statistics address the need of researchers to offer a more meaningful national comparison for their college's student characteristics and outcomes than a national average. This research project was funded by the Association for Institutional Research (AIR), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the AIR grant program called Improving Institutional Research in Postsecondary Educational Institutions, and is addressed to institutional researchers. The major questions answered by this report are how useful and how accessible these NCES data sets are to institutional researchers, particularly those in community colleges where student populations vary substantially and the research staff and funding are low. To be useful, researchers must be able to produce comparable statistics on relevant variables from these data sets. This report will discuss whether the data sets contain variables that can be used to create peer groups of colleges and that reflect common IR student characteristics and outcomes used in community colleges. To be accessible, the resources and skills needed to work with these data sets must be within the range of the average institutional researcher in a small office. This report will discuss how to obtain and work with the data sets, and what resources are needed in terms of time, hardware, software, supplies, and funds. It will also help researchers evaluate whether the effort is worth it in their situation, or whether the published materials are better alternatives."}, {"section_title": "Overview of data sets used", "text": "Two NCES data sets were used to find variables for peer groups and ER variablesthe Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS).2 For institutional-level variables that could define peer groups, IPEDS was used.

See Appendix D for information sources on all NCES data sets. institutions in the U.S. and is collected each year. Data is collected from colleges on fall enrollments, completions, institutional characteristics, faculty salaries, and finance, and is stored in five files of the same names. The 1990 files were used for this report because BPS students started in 1989-90, and the 1990 IPEDS files contain both 1989 and 1990 information about their institutions . For student-level variables that could provide student characteristics and outcomes, BPS was used. This data set is a longitudinal study of a national sample of students in their first year of college in 1989-90 in all types of postsecondary institutions. These students were followed through 1994, whether or not they stayed in college. The students in this study were obtained from a 1989-90 cross-sectional study, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), that surveyed a national sample of students at all levels in all types of postsecondary institutions in 1989-90. NPSAS was conducted in 1989-90 and again in 1992-93, and its major purpose was to determine how students funded their college education. BPS took the students in the 1989-90 NPSAS who were in their first year of college that year and followed them. BPS is an institutional researcher's dream data setit contains a wealth of variables on postsecondary student characteristics and outcomes. With its origin in NPSAS, BPS is especially strong on the details of financial status, financial aid, and family data, but it also includes a range of other student characteristics as well as many longitudinal student outcomes such as persistence and transfer. In addition, BPS also contains some institutional variables from IPEDS."}, {"section_title": "Report organization", "text": "This report contains three major chapters. Chapter II addresses the usefulness of the IPEDS data set for creating peer groups among community colleges by exploring the IPEDS files for appropriate variables. The process of identifying peer groups is illustrated with the search for peer group variables that are meaningful to California community colleges. Chapter DI reviews the usefulness of the BPS data set for identifying key institutional research variables on student characteristics and outcomes by presenting data on many of these variables, by sector and by peer groups within the community college sector. Chapter IV addresses the accessibility of the data sets by describing the process of obtaining and using both the public-use and restricted-use data sets. The conclusion in Chapter V summarizes the conclusions about usefulness and accessibility and helps institutional researchers evaluate whether they have the inclination or resources to work with either of these types of data sets. The appendices contain lists of variables examined or used from each data set, some supporting tables, tables of standard errors, examples of estimating complex standard errors and performing t-tests, and lists of NCES names and addresses for ordering and obtaining help with the data sets. Peer groups of postsecondary institutions are usually chosen in order to compare and evaluate institutional characteristics such as budget levels, faculty salaries, or program offerings to those of similar colleges.3 The purpose of these comparisons is to determine whether the original college is in the normal range of these characteristics, or is higher or lower than its peers. In order to make these comparisons as valid as possible, the peer group must be chosen very carefully so it reflects the uniqueness of that college.4 To accomplish this, as many quantitative and qualitative variables as possible are taken into account when defining the college and its peer group. In order to make distinctions as fine as possible, variables are sometimes evaluated with complex statistical methodologies, such as factor and cluster analysis.5 Although the final analysis may result in only a few peer institutions, potential peers can be drawn from the entire population of postsecondary educational institutions in the U.S. Thus, colleges often start with the IPEDS data set as a source of those institutional-level variables.6 They often add other quantitative variables from other sources such as the U.S. Census or local population and geographic data. Then the final group of peer institutions is usually selected or approved by high-level administrators after more qualitative criteria, such as the mission and vision of the colleges, has been used to further refine the peer group. At that point, the colleges not selected for the peer group are of no concern. In this study, the purpose of choosing peer groups in this study was also to provide comparison groups for evaluating institutional-level student characteristics. However, in contrast to the creation of one peer group for a particular college, the goal was to categorize all the public two-year community colleges into several peer groups that would be meaningful to the entire range of California community colleges. In this way, it is closer to a 'classification-based group' than a true peer group.? In addition, the variables used to create peer groups had to be easily accessible by institutional researchers with limited time and resources. Therefore, data that were readily available and relevant to all colleges had to be used, and qualitative information could not be considered. The process of identifying these peer groups was less complex than the usual peer group analysis because the student characteristics to be estimated were obtained from a national sample of postsecondary institutions and students in BPS rather than from the entire population of institutions in IPEDS. Although WEDS contains variables that can be used for peer group formations for all colleges in the U.S., the peer group analysis of the student characteristics in this study was limited to the student data from the sample of colleges that were also in BPS. Consequently, small sample sizes of colleges and students in BPS, especially in any one sector such as community colleges, necessitated the formation of only two or at the most three peer groups. With more than three groups, large margins of error for the estimates of the student demographics and outcomes would make any differences between the peer groups meaningless. Thus, although several variables in IPEDS were found to be salient for California community colleges and could theoretically be combined to form peer groups, only one variable at a time could realistically be used to differentiate two or three peer groups. Peer group variables in IPEDS WEDS files contain the basic quantitative descriptors of postsecondary institutions. WEDS consists of five files with information on fall enrollments, completions, institutional characteristics, faculty salaries, and finance. In addition, NCES has created a sixth file, called the Analysis file, which contains the most commonly used variables from each file.8 Table 1 lists the WEDS variables that were either found in the peer group literature, suggested by NCES staff, or had ?Based on classifications in Teeter and Brinkman, op. cit. However, the broader term 'peer group' will be used throughout this report. 8For a discussion of some difficulties in using the Analysis file, see the section on time requirements for public-use files in Chapter N."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "potential for use in identifying peer groups among community colleges.9 These variables are listed based on whether they are included in the BPS file or are found only in IPEDS files, and whether they were tested in this study or not. Some of these variables, such as sector, level of offerings, funding control, accreditation, and admissions requirements are useful for classifying colleges of all levels, but do not differentiate among community colleges very well, so they were not tested. However, 'sector' was used in order to compare the public two-year colleges as a group with the four-year public and private colleges.10 Other variables listed here are potentially relevant to community colleges, but were not tested as part of this study for various reasons. Some variables (fees/tuition, student services, number of campuses) did not have enough variation or relevance that would distinguish different types of community colleges, while others (program offerings by CIP) had too many categories. Some variables (number of programs, categorical expenditures, research expenditures) had missing data in IPEDS, and for others (PM size, rural/urban, other expenditure and faculty variables), the data was not accessible to this researcher at the time of the study due to difficulties identifying the values or extracting them from the dataset.11 The variables listed in table 1 as \"tested in this study\" were both accessible and had enough variation to have potential for differentiating community colleges, especially those in California. The search for peer group variables for the community colleges"}, {"section_title": "IPEDS variables in BPS", "text": "In order to identify peer groups that were meaningful to California community colleges, the main criteria for peer group variables was that they would create national peer groups with different levels of racial-ethnic diversity. Racial-ethnic diversity is very salient to the California community colleges because students of color are now a majority of the community college student population in the state. Consequently, in looking for peer groups on a national level, many California colleges look for colleges with as much racial-ethnic diversity as their college. Therefore, the institutional peer group variables in BPS and IPEDS were tested using race-ethnicity as the BPS student-level variable that would be differentiated by the peer groups. First, the IPEDS variables found in BPS were tested as peer group variables. If these could distinguish among community colleges, then there would be no need to use the separate IPEDS files. BPS contained the variables of sector (control and level), enrollment size, region, state, calendar system, and admissions requirements. Since there was little variation in the calendar system in California or the admissions requirements among public two-year colleges in IPEDS, these variables were not tested. Tables 2 through 5 show the race-ethnicity distribution among the students from colleges grouped by sector, enrollment size, region, and state. Examining the three major sectorspublic four-year, private four-year, and public two-yeartable 2 shows that racial-ethnic diversity is somewhat higher among public two-year colleges, with white students at 77 percent of the enrollment vs. 82 to 85 percent in the four-year sectors. However, this means that only 23 percent of community college students were people of color, which is far below their representation of over 50 percent of California community college students. It was hoped that more diversity would be found by focusing on different types of community colleges. Table 3 shows five levels of enrollment size among community colleges, and here the diversity is somewhat higher in the largest colleges. However, white students are still the majority at 63 percent.  Tables 4 and 5 show that the student samples in the Far West region and California do indeed reflect the actual diversity of community colleges students in these areas, with 52 and 47 percent white students respectively. However, these tables also show that none of the other likely regions and states match that diversity.  This could lead to the conclusion that states are their own best comparison group for the IR variables in BPS, especially in the case of California. However, there are several problems with that solution. Most importantly, the sample sizes in BPS are too small within the states and regions to use those characteristics for peer groups. Appendix tables B1 and B2 provide the standard errors for tables 2 through 5, and they show that as the sample gets smaller, standard errors increase from 8 20 2.29 to 4.86 to 9.42 for the percentage of white students, making differences between the peer groups meaningless. Consequently, if colleges wanted to use their own state as a comparison, they would be better off getting the actual data from their state rather than just asample.12 In addition, the purpose of using BPS and IPEDS is to find peer groups on a national level that are different from the state comparisons. Therefore, in order to provide these national comparisons, the search for peer group variables was continued in the IPEDS file."}, {"section_title": "IPEDS variables in IPEDS only", "text": "In order to use the IPEDS variables that were only in IPEDS to create peer group variables for the students in BPS, these variables needed to be selected and merged onto the BPS file. The summary section on working with restricted-use data sets in Chapter IV outlines how this was done. The variables that were selected as potential community college peer group variables were enrollment size (to check its consistency with the IPEDS data in BPS), percentage of full-time students, percentage of first-time first-year students, and racial-ethnic diversity (percentage of students of color in enrollments and among first-year students). These variables were categorized into two or three major groups. Of 1,221 public two-year colleges in IPEDS, 218 were in the BPS sample, and 889 students were sampled in these colleges. Table 6 shows the percentage distributions of the peer group variables for the 1,221 public two-year colleges in IPEDS and for the 889 weighted students in BPS.13 These variables were chosen because they are factors that reflect student characteristics or affect student outcomes. Enrollment size indicates the number of students on campus regardless of 1-b, and it reflects the academic and physical capacity of the college as well as the size of the campus community from a student perspective. Percentage of full-time students is a complement to enrollment size, in that it measures the type of students and intensity of their use of the campus. More full-time students indicate that more students are pursuing transfer, degree, or certificate 12th California, the Chancellor's Office of the California Community Colleges maintains a statewide database of major IR student characteristics and outcomes from mandatory data provided by all the colleges. The Chancellor's Office provides summary reports based on these data. 13The high percentage of missing among these IPEDS variables illustrates one problem with some variables in this data set. When these IPEDS variables were merged onto the file of BPS schools (a subset of the IPEDS schools), similar percentages of schools were still missing these values. However, as shown in table 6, when the BPS school file with new IPEDS variables was merged back onto the BPS weighted student file, the highest percent missing was 9 percent, so the effect of missing values on the estimates was within reasonable limits. In addition to missing values in some IPEDS variables, out of the 218 public two-year schools that were in the BPS sample, only 208 were found in the 1990 IPEDS data set, so these missing schools contributed some missing values. In addition, only 178 of the 208 schools were actually classified as public two-year colleges. NCES staff and IPEDS consultants stated that these mismatches between IPEDS and BPS were to be expected for three reasons: 1) the 1987-88 IPEDS file had been used for the 1990 NPSAS/BPS sampling, 2) colleges change categories over time, and 3) about 5% of the schools in WEDS are misclassified by level/control (E-mail correspondance with A. Malizio, D. Carroll, and L. Berkner, Oct 31-Nov 5, 1996.) 9 10 22 programs rather than taking just a few courses. The percentage of first-time first-year students (freshmen) can also reflect the type of students and college programs. More freshmen may mean fewer continuing students, which may indicate more students with short term goals. Alternatively, the college may be transferring students soon after the first term. The percentage of racial-ethnic diversity, both in enrollments and among first-time first-year students measures the cultural variation in the college population. Diversity in enrollments and among first-time students was so similar that the more inclusive diversity in enrollments was chosen. Other variables were considered. The percentage of women did not have enough variation to create categories. Other variables examined were number of AA degrees, percentage of AA degrees out of enrollments, and percentage of women and of racial-ethnic groups among the AA degrees.14 However, besidds the little variation in these variables and the small sample sizes in the gender and race-ethnicity of degrees, these variables were rejected because they were outcome measures, rather than descriptors of the general institutional inputs and characteristics that might lead to student outcomes. Cross tabulations and chi square analyses were conducted on the selected variables in table 6 for all the public two-year colleges in IPEDS. The goal of these analyses was to identify variables that were related to each other but described different aspects of the colleges. The results, shown in appendix table B4, showed that enrollment size in three categories, percentage full-time in two categories, and percentage first-time in two categories were all highly associated with each other at the p<.00001 level. In addition, enrollment size and percentage full-time were associated with levels of diversity (in three and two categories) at the p<.001 level, and percentage first-time was not associated with diversity. Since diversity in enrollments, enrollment size, and percentage full-time were mostly closely related, they were chosen as the major peer group variables to be tested with the BPS student characteristics. Again, due to the salience of racial-ethnic diversity for California community colleges, the BPS student-level variable of racial-ethnic diversity was used as the criteria for how well these institutional variables differentiated among community colleges with different levels of diversity. Not surprisingly, using the student racial-ethnic data, levels of diversity differentiated the most among colleges in the area of racial-ethnic diversity. 14These tables can be found in appendix table B3. Table 7 shows the race-ethnicity distribution for schools at three different levels of diversity. Even though the peer group with the highest level of diversity is only 35 percent or more students of color, only 31 percent of students at these colleges are white, while 69 percent are students of color, so this category does identify diverse colleges. Due to low sample sizes, it was apparent that two categories would be better than three categories for peer variables. Therefore, table 8 shows the race-ethnicity distribution for schools at only two different levels of diversity. With the highest peer group category of diversity at 20 percent or more, these colleges still had 49 percent students of color, which is close to the California average of 51 percent.   Tables 9 and 10 show the race-ethnicity distribution for schools in the enrollment size and percentage full-time categories. While the race-ethnicity differences are not aspronounced with these variables, they do reflect some variation in diversity. Since these variables were associated with diversity, they take diversity into account while expressing college characteristics that might be more salient than diversity to some colleges. Therefore, all three of these peer group variables were used in estimating student characteristics and outcomes.15  "}, {"section_title": "25 Conclusion", "text": "While regional and state groups may be the best comparison groups for many community colleges, sample sizes in BPS necessitate finding peer group variables that can group all community colleges nationally into only two or three groups. Not surprisingly, the percentage of students of color differentiated most among colleges in terms of the race-ethnicity of the students. Therefore, this diversity variable in two categories (above and below 20 percent students of color), was chosen as the best peer group variable for California and other community colleges for whom diversity is important. However, several other variables emerged as correlated to diversity levels that might be important to other community colleges. These were the percentage of full-time students in two categories (above and below 35 percent) and enrollment size in three categories (under 2,500, 2,500-9,999, and 10,000 or over). Due to sample sizes, it was not possible to combine these three variables to create more refined peer groups. Therefore, tables of major BPS student characteristics and outcomes are shown and discussed separately for peer groups based on categories of diversity, percentage full-time and enrollment size. Community colleges are encouraged to use the peer group category that is most salient for them."}, {"section_title": "III. Usefulness Finding IR student characteristics and outcomes variables in BPS", "text": "Common student variables used by community colleges One of the major components of institutional research reports in community colleges, and in most other colleges, is the reporting of the demographics, enrollment patterns, and outcomes of the students in that college.16 Having comparable data on these student characteristics and outcomes for peer group colleges increases the meaningfulness of the college data.17 The purpose of this report is to provide those peer group comparisons for community colleges on the most commonly-reported student characteristics and outcomes that are also found in the BPS dataset. The student characteristics reported by most colleges are basic demographics (gender, raceethnicity, age, disability, city or high school of origin, current residence) and enrollment status (new, transfer, or continuing student, full-time/part-time status, day/evening, current educational level, major, educational goal).18 Some colleges also collect and report information on student and family income, student financial dependency status, parents' educational level, marital status, religion, hours of paid work, current occupation, and future aspirations.19 The major student outcomes reported in community colleges are the course retention, success, and withdrawal rates, persistence rates, numbers and rates of transfers, degrees, and "}, {"section_title": "IR student characteristics and outcomes variables in BPS", "text": "The BPS dataset contains most of the commonly-reported student characteristics and outcomes variables. With its base in NPSAS, it is especially strong on the details of financial status, financial aid, and family data. However, because BPS is a longitudinal study, it also contains many variables on persistence and transfer. Table 11 lists the student variables available in BPS that institutional researchers would be most interested in.21 The major demographics and enrollment status variables are on this list, with the exception of day or evening attendance and the city and high school of origin. The strongest student outcomes variables are the persistence variables, but degree and transfer attainment are also available. While grades are included, they do not include withdrawals, so they are not comparable to community college success/withdrawal rates. However, most of the basic institutional research student characteristics and outcomes can be estimated with the BPS dataset.  Tables 12a through 16b present estimates of the major student characteristics and outcomes found in BPS for public two-year colleges. First, in order to provide a comparison for community colleges, these estimates are shown for the three sectors of interestpublic four-year colleges, private four-year colleges, and public two-year colleges. Then, these tables show the same estimates for public two-year colleges only, divided into two levels of diversity (percentage of students of color), three categories of enrollment size, and two levels of percentage of full-time students. Significant differences between categories are noted. Standard errors are shown in corresponding appendix tables C12a to C16b. Standard errors for sector and enrollment were calculated using DAS. Standard errors for diversity and full-time status were estimated using design effects.

Compared to public or private four-year colleges, community colleges have smaller proportions of white students and much smaller proportions of students age 19 years or less (table 12a). In addition, community college students are much more likely to be from the lowest SES quartile, and much less likely to be from the highest SES quartile (table 13a).

Accessibility How to obtain and work with NCES Data sets", "text": "Types of data sets available IPEDS public-use files All of the IPEDS files are public-use files, which means that they are easily accessible to the public on request either on CDs or as files on the World Wide Web.22 WEDS consists of yearly raw data on the population of all postsecondary (PSE) institutions in the U.S. Since 1990, NCES has provided the IPEDS files each year on free CDs that contain the raw data, dataretrieval and analysis software, technical and user manuals, and summary reports. These files are also available on the Web. Each IPEDS data set consists of five files, some from the latest year (the year on the title of the data set), and some from the previous year, depending on the type of data collected. Three of the filesInstitutional Characteristics, Faculty Salaries, and Fall Enrollmentscontain data from the latest year, while two of the filesFinance and Completionsconsist of data from the previous year. These files are all linked by an institutional ID. In addition, NCES has created a sixth file of all the PSE institutions, called the Analysis file, which contains the most commonlyused variables from each file.23"}, {"section_title": "NPSAS and BPS", "text": "The NPSAS and BPS data sets are available as either public-use files or restricted-use files. The NPSAS data set consists of a cross-sectional sample of all PSE students in the U.S., including both undergraduates and graduates. These data were collected in 1989-90 and again in 1992-93. The BPS sample of all first-year/first-time undergraduate PSE students in the U.S. is a subsample of the 1989-90 NPSAS. The BPS sample then became a longitudinal data set, and data were collected on these students every year or so for four years. The data from each wave are available either as separate files or as one cumulative file. Both the NPSAS and BPS samples are national samples, which means they do not provide adequate sample sizes for individual state analysis.24 22See Appendix D for ordering and downloading information. 23For a discussion of some difficulties in using the Analysis file, see the section on time requirements for publicuse files in this chapter. 24The NPSAS and BPS files are on separate CDs, but the process of working with them is the same, so they will be discussed together in this report. NPSAS and BPS public-use files NPSAS and BPS public-use files come with software that can generate most of the possible frequencies, cross tabulations, and correlation matrices in these data sets. However, access to the raw data is not provided. By not providing the raw data, NCES not only protects the privacy of the respondents, but makes the data analysis process easier for the users. Like IPEDS, these public-use files are available on request either on CDs or on the Web. The files include the data, which can only be accessed by the enclosed data analysis software, called Data Analysis System (DAS), the user and technical manuals, and summary reports. The advantages of using the public-use files is that DAS is easy to learn and use. Almost immediately, a researcher can produce weighted frequencies, percentages, means, or correlations on the total sample or on subsets such as public two-year colleges, using any variable as a control variable. DAS can be used to create tables of any specifications, print out the tables, and provide the estimated population sizes and standard errors. Since the NPSAS/BPS data sets have a complex sampling design, the standard errors need to be calculated in a way that takes this design into account, and DAS provides these accurate standard errors. The limitations of using the public-use files are that actual sample sizes and totals cannot be seen, variables from other data sets such as IPEDS cannot be added to the data sets, and variables cannot be recoded, combined, or created.25 For that type of access to the raw data, the restricted-use files are necessary."}, {"section_title": "NPSAS and BPS restricted-use files", "text": "The restricted-use files are provided on CDs and consist of the raw data, an electronic codebook (ECB), SAS and SPSS programs for reading the data, technical and user manuals and summary reports. The advantages of using these files are that researchers can manipulate the raw data in such ways as recoding/combining/creating variables, obtaining all frequencies and statistics, examining the sample sizes, and matching the file to IPEDS data on the sampled institutions. However, this freedom to use the raw data incurs several costs in time and effort. First, in order to ensure the protection of privacy of the respondents, it is necessary to develop a security plan and obtain a restricted data license from NCES. It takes time to set up and document a security plan and obtain the license. Details of this process are provided later in this chapter under the section on how to obtain restricted-use data. Learning to use the ECB is another time investment. The ECB must be used to choose variables and provide frequencies, a codebook, and SAS or SPSS programs to read the data. In BPS, variable information is found only in the ECB rather than in printed or computer text files, so variables must be reviewed on the computer screen before selecting for inclusion in a custom codebook. Since BPS has hundreds of variables to choose 250ne exception is that consecutive values of discrete or continuous variables can be recoded by grouping into smaller groups and re labeling. 45 32 from, this codebook, and the printing costs associated with it, can become rather large.

Therefore, all users have to start on a DOS or Windows machine in order to identify the variables and file layout, although the Macintosh users can return to their computers for the analysis step. On the DOS/Windows computer, the ECB software provides a view of all the variables, their labels, and unweighted frequency/percentage distributions. By selecting variables from this 33 long list, the user can ask ECB to create a codebook of these variables for reading or printing. ECB will also create an SPSS or SAS program to retrieve those variables from the CD for analysis. DOS/Windows users can then run these SPSS or SAS programs, which will access the data file on the CD. Macintosh users can copy the codebook and SPSS files onto a floppy disk and transport it to their Mac. There, they can read or print the codebook and edit and run the SPSS programs, which will access the data file on their CD.

The convenience of reading the IPEDS data directly from the CD into the Macintosh SPSS program was more compelling than using the IPEDS software, especially since this raw data would be merged onto the BPS file. However, this researcher found that it takes more time to use the IPEDS files with a Macintosh, because the variable layouts of all six files must be examined on the screen or in print, and then SPSS programs must be generated from the layout information (although not completely from scratch since the variable formats and variable and value labels can be copied from these files into SPSS programs).

A preliminary examination of the BPS or NPSAS variables in the restricted-use file can be conducted on the public-use files using the software DAS (Data Analysis System). This task must be conducted on the computer screen of a PC. DAS displays the entire list of variables, and provides definitions and explanations of the sources of the variables and their unweighted percentage distributions on request. Variables and weights can then be selected to form the rows, columns, weights, and control variables for tables of percentages and means or for a correlation matrix for linear regression.

Actual sample sizes are not shown, but the results for any given estimate are suppressed if the sample size of that cell is less than 30.

The software provided with the restricted-use files, ECB (Electronic Codebook), displays a list of all the variables and weights in the files. The user can then scroll down the list and request the frequencies and percentages of the unweighted sample for each variable. The variable can then be tagged for inclusion in a codebook (variable names and value labels) and an SPSS or SAS program. While a preliminary group of variables can be selected in the first session, and then another group can be selected at another session, it is best to select all potential variables the first time, so that the different codebooks and the SPSS /SAS programs produced from each session do not need to be merged. In addition to student variables, the weights must also the chosen at this time for the SPSS/SAS program. In BPS, there are four potential weights to use, and it is best to select all of them until it can be determined which is the best to use for your purposes (see section in this chapter on choosing weights).

Weights for each student reflect this complex sampling and are necessary in order to accurately estimate the population characteristics of the postsecondary students in the sample. In addition, since BPS is a longitudinal study that includes several waves of interviews and some attrition, different weights must be used depending on whether the estimates of interest are considered cross-sectional, longitudinal, or retrospective during the different years of the study. For a clear description of these weights, see Appendix C of the BPS Statistical Analysis Report.31 Both that report and this study used the weight, BPS94AWT, which is both cross-sectional and retrospective and is the primary weight for students who started in 1989-90 and were still alive in 1994.

However, the DAS tables can also be used as a check for accuracy, particularly since the user can select the same weight to use in DAS that has been selected for the restricted-use analysis. In order to produce the correct SRS standard errors for use in estimating the complex standard errors (see next section), the weights for each case must be normalized. Normalized weights apply the same proportional weight to each case, but these weights have been reduced proportionately so that the cases sum to the actual sample size rather than to the estimated population. This is necessary because the population size would produce standard errors that would be artificially low. The following formula for normalizing the weights must be applied to each case: Normalized weight = (sample size / sum(weights) ) x (weight of case) The formula shows that the actual sample size is divided by the sum of the weights and then this result (which is the same for each case) is multiplied by the case's weight (which is different for each case)."}, {"section_title": "Estimating standard errors", "text": "Another result of the complex sampling design of NPSAS and BPS is that standard errors of estimates, needed for any confidence intervals or tests of differences between estimates, cannot be calculated in the usual wayas if the sample was a simple random sample (SRS). Instead, advanced statistical methods that take the sample design into account, such as a Jackknife replication technique or the Taylor series method, must be used to calculate the correct standard errors. The Taylor series method is built into the DAS software in the public-use files, so any tables produced by DAS include the correct standard errors. For restricted-use data users, replicate weights are included on the restricted-use data set for use with the Jackknife technique. However, most users do not have the time or training to perform this technique, and they must find a way to estimate the correct standard errors for any analyses that cannot be duplicated by DAS. Special software is available for this task. SUDAAN is a commercially available product developed and sold by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in North Carolina. WesVarPC (for Windows systems) is freeware that can be downloaded from Westat's Web site (www.westat.com). WesVarPC is used to create balanced repeated replicate weights using the replicate codes in the data file. In addition, SPSS will soon distribute (sell) a fancier version of WesVarPC as a standalone program separate from the general SPSS program. If obtaining special software is not an option, another alternative is to use design effects with the SRS standard errors to approximate the correct standard errors.32 For each estimate "}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "(proportion, mean, regression coefficient), the design effect expresses the ratio of the standard error for a complex sample to the standard error for a simple random sample. Therefore, the SRS standard error can be multiplied by the design effect to produce the correct standard error for a complex sample. SRS standard errors can be obtained from the usual software or calculated in a spreadsheet.33 However, before calculating the SRS standard errors, the weights must be normalized. See the previous section on normalizing weights. The design effects can be obtained from the published tables in the technical reports.34 Unfortunately, design effects are provided only for the major variables and categories. In the BPS Technical report, design effects were provided only for public two-year students on the three values of persistence/attainment and the four values of highest level of education. These design effects ranged from 1.1 to 1.9.35 In this study, some of the student characteristics and outcomes cross tabulations (those by sector and by enrollment size) could be duplicated in DAS, and the DAS standard errors were used. For the other cross tabulations (those by diversity and percentage full-time) that could not be duplicated in DAS, the correct standard errors were estimated using the SRS standard errors and approximated design effects. Design effects were approximated by borrowing the design effects from the estimates produced in DAS for public two-year colleges by enrollment size, and applying them to the same variable for public two-year colleges by diversity and percentage full-time level. These design effects were calculated for each enrollment category by taking the ratio of the correct standard error to the SRS standard error. Then the design effect from the enrollment category with the same sample size as the diversity or full-time status category was multiplied times the SRS standard error in that category. The resulting standard errors are not perfectly accurate, because design effects differ depending upon the subgroup, the type of variables, and the range of the estimates, which are not equivalent for the different peer variables. However, they inflate the SRS standard errors enough to provide a reasonable basis for tests of difference for most institutional research purposes. Examples of calculating standard errors using design effects are provided in appendix table Cl. The design effects from the DAS results ranged from .8 to 2.2, with a mean of 1.2. Since this range and mean includes the published overall design effects range of 1.1 to 1.9, this design effect mean could probably have been used for all the estimates for a rougher approximation.

If the difference is significant, then that means that this level of this particular student characteristic or outcome has a high chance of being different in the two types of colleges. These tests are usually applied when the differences are substantively different, i.e. one would not test for a difference of less than six percentage points even if it might be statistically significant, because such a difference would not mean much to colleges. One way to test for differences between proportions is to calculate the Student's t statistic, which uses the standard errors to test if the difference is significant. When the estimates are independent, such as the estimates in this study of students in different types of colleges, the t statistic is calculated with the formula t = (pl-p2)/SQRT((se1)2+(se2)2) and the two-tailed t distribution is used to determine significance.Since the t distribution approximates the normal curve after a sample size of 120, and all the subgroups in this study were 250 or more, the near-normal values of 1.98 and 2.62 were used to indicate the level of significance of less than .05 and .01 respectively.36 One more statistical adjustment needs to be made if tests for difference are performed for more than one estimate in a \"family\" of estimates. A family consists of all the values in each dependent variable, in this case the student characteristic/outcome variables, that are estimated in all of the categories of the independent variables, in this case institutional variables such as enrollment or diversity. The more tests that are conducted in each family, the higher the likelihood that a test will be significant just by chance. Therefore, a technique is suggested in the BPS Statistical Analysis Report that makes the test harder to attain significance if more than one test is performed in a family.37 Starting with the acceptable level of significance of p < .05 for one comparison in a family, that level is divided by the number of comparisons, so that if 2 comparisons were made in the four-level SES quartiles family, then .05/2 = .025 would be the acceptable level of significance. If five comparisons were made, then the level of significance would be .05/5=.01. Since more than 5 comparisons were rarely made in any family in this study, the significance level of p < .01 was used for all comparisons.

The BPS data set contains so many student characteristics and outcome variables that the researchers will find variables relevant to their own college. In addition, BPS and NPSAS contain major IPEDS variables, so student variables can be estimated for common institutional characteristics, such as sector and enrollment size. Are NCES data sets accessible to institutional researchers? IPEDS IPEDS files are very accessible in that they are very easy to obtain and to use. Either a DOS/Windows or Macintosh operating system can be used to access the data. However, in order to use the NCES software to access IPEDS, a DOS/Windows system is required. WEDS is easiest to use if one is examining institutional characteristics separate from other data sets. However, these data can be merged onto student data in other data sets, but this can be done only if one is using a restricted-use data set for the student data.\nThe public-use files of BPS/NPSAS are very easy to obtain and use, although a DOS or Windows operating system is necessary. The software provided with these files can produce estimates of the many student variables by sector or other institutional factors, including the correct standard errors and weighted sample sizes. It also provides correlation matrices that can be used to run regression analyses. However, variables cannot be recoded except for consecutive values, WEDS or other data cannot be merged onto these data sets, and other more exploratory analyses cannot be performed. The restricted-use files of BPS/NPSAS are hard to obtain and to use, but can be used by either DOS/Windows or Macintosh operating systems. A restricted data license must be obtained, security must be maintained, and researchers must learn more about the data set and the sampling 45 5 9 design and be much more involved in programming in order to produce accurate estimates. However, it is worth it to researchers who have the characteristics outlined in the next section. Who should use the restricted-use and public-use data sets? NCES has done an impressive job of making the national educational data sets easily accessible to researchers by providing them at three distinct levels of availability as raw data, as customized tables, and as published (paper and electronic) tables. With these options, institutional researchers can find the level that best suits their purposes and resources. Institutional researchers and institutional research offices with the following array of interests and resources will best enjoy working with the restricted-use data sets. First, they must have the time and resources to devote to the many programming and analysis decisions and tasks. (See the section in Chapter IV on time and other resources.) Second, they must enjoy working with raw data, creating tables tailored to their own needs, and conducting their own unique analyses. (See the section in Chapter IV on working with restricted-use data files.). This is the benefit of working with these data sets, so this is the aspect that should be enjoyed. Researchers who want to develop their own tables geared to their own sector or type of college but do not have the time or resources for working with the restricted-use files will enjoy using the DAS software on the public-use files. DAS produces tables and standard errors for most variables or subgroups of interest, as long as the sample size does not fall below 30. What are the alternatives? The alternatives to working with either of the data files are to use the published reports and tables on these data sets. In this case, the researcher will be limited to the list of variables included in the report, which is much smaller than the complete list of variables. In addition, the published reports do not tend to divide up the sample farther than by sector, so within-sector subgroups cannot be found, especially for public two-year colleges. Ironically and luckily, one of the best ways to get these reports is to order the public-use data file on a CD or to download it from the Web. Then, the report and published tables may pique researchers' interest enough to try using the DAS software to generate their own custom tables. And who knows? A successful DAS experience might encourage a foray into the world of restricted-use data sets as well."}, {"section_title": "46", "text": "Oppendix El            Table C14b.
