[{"section_title": "", "text": "Recent economic conditions have raised concerns about the fnancial health of the U.S. farm sector. After peaking around 2012, farm sector income has declined while farm debt has continued to rise. Farm real esate is no longer rapidly appreciating in value, and land prices have declined in some regions. Interes rates have trended upward in recent years-increasing the cos of borrowing for some farmers. If commodity prices were to decline in the near future, some farmers would fnd it difcult to meet their loan obligations while also paying for production expenses. Recent ERS research examined farm-level data from the USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to determine how current economic conditions in the agricultural sector compare with those in pas periods of fnancial sress. The sudy identifed which types of farms are fnancially vulnerable, and which would be likely to face the mos challenges if commodity prices declined further. The sudy looked at multiple measures of a farm's fnancial health, including repayment capacity, liquidity, and solvency. Lenders often use these measures to assess the fnancial sability and performance of farm operations. To gain insight into how farms would be afected if farm income continued to decline in the years ahead, the sudy simulated the efect of a further decline in gross cash farm income (GCFI) on the share of farms in extreme fnancial sress, which is defned as having a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 55 percent and not having enough household income to meet current loan payments. A high debt-to-asset ratio implies a limited ability to pay loan obligations through the sale of assets and hence a greater risk of default."}, {"section_title": "Repayment Capacity", "text": "The term debt coverage ratio (TDCR) is often used to measure a farmer's loan repayment capacity. TDCR is the income that a household has available to pay its debt divided by the total principal and interes on its term debt (debt that has a set payment schedule). A larger TDCR indicates a bigger margin to cover loan payments. A TDCR less than 1.0 indicates the farm household is in a repayment capacity \"red zone\" and does not have sufcient income to meet its loan payments. The fgure below shows how the percentage of farms in the red zone has evolved for three size categories: small farms with annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) less than $100,000, medium farms with annual GCFI between $100,000 and $500,000, and large farms with annual GCFI greater than $500,000. Over the las 20 years, the shares of medium and large farms with a repayment capacity in the red zone have exceeded the share of small farms in that zone. On average, households that operate small farms earn mos of their income of the farm and have relatively little farm debt."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": "Download higher resolution chart (2539 pixels by 2432, 300 dpi) In the years following the 2012 peak in net cash farm income, the share of medium and large farms in the red zone increased. The increase was particularly seep for large farms-from 8.1 percent in 2012 to 12.4 percent in 2017. In contras, small farms remained largely insulated from the downturn in the agricultural economy. Indeed, the share of small farms in the red zone fell slightly over this period. Because small farm households rely relatively more on of-farm income, the improved performance for small farms is likely due to the srengthening nonagricultural economy over this period. As the farm economy worsened and the nonfarm economy improved, small farms experienced a relatively small increase in farm debt (because they have smaller farms that require less capital) and a relatively large increase in household income (because they earn a larger share of their income from nonfarm sources). In 2017, the shares of medium and large farms in the red zone were slightly above their respective 1998-2017 averages. However, for these farms, the repayment capacity is sronger than it was in 2002-the year with the lowes aggregate net cash farm income since 1996. Specifcally, the 2017 shares of medium and large farms in the red zone was about 2 percentage points below the 2002 shares.\nDownload higher resolution chart (2539 pixels by 2073, 300 dpi) Since reaching record highs in 2012, working capital for farms of all sizes has fallen as farm incomes have fallen and farmers depleted their savings and inventory to cope with lower revenues. Working capital for small, midsized, and large farm operations fell by 75 percent, 50 percent, and 43 percent, respectively. Despite these large declines, working capital remains close to long-run average levels for midsized and large farms, and subsantially above 2002 levels, which were the lowes levels since 1996. For small farms, working capital is about half the long-run average but about double the 2002 level. Because of-farm income accounts for mos household income for small-scale farmers, a low level of working capital is less indicative of imminent fnancial sress for these farm households.\nDownload higher resolution chart (2539 pixels by 2209, 300 dpi) Since 2012, the shares of midsized and large farms in the solvency red zone have increased and are now above their respective 1996-2017 averages. Large farms saw the greates increase, with the share in the red zone rising from 7.6 percent in 2012 to 13.5 percent in 2017. In contras, in 2017, the share of small farms in the red zone is essentially the same as it was in 2012. While the share of midsized and large farms in the red zone has increased in recent years, the current share remains below the peak levels in 2002."}, {"section_title": "Liquidity", "text": "Liquidity refers to a business's capacity to meet its short-term obligations without disrupting its normal operations-that is, how well a business can cover current liabilities (due within 1 year) using current assets (those which can be easily converted into cash within 1 year). Farmers face a number of recurring business coss, including input expenses, rents, and debt obligations. Current assets that can be quickly liquidated to pay for these recurring coss include savings in banks, certain types of livesock, and sored crops. Farm businesses require liquidity to be able to cope with a bad harves or low commodity prices. Farmers without sufcient liquidity may be forced to sell noncurrent assets, such as real esate or farm equipment, or may have to take out new loans. Working capital (current farm assets minus current farm liabilities) is a commonly used measure of liquidity related to the size of a farm business. Larger operations generally require more working capital than smaller operations. In low-income years, farmers may draw down their working capital to pay their normal business expenses. In high-income years, working capital may be accumulated."}, {"section_title": "Solvency", "text": "Solvency refers to the ability of an operation to meet its long-term fnancial obligations and remain in business. The debt-to-asset ratio-total farm debt divided by total farm assets-is a measure of solvency that is often used by lenders as an indicator of bankruptcy risk. Farms with a high debt-toasset ratio generally have less ability to cover potential fnancial liabilities through the sale of assets, leading to a greater risk of default. The fgure below shows the share of operations in each farm size category that are in a solvency red zone-that is, a debt-to-asset ratio above 55 percent. Many farmers borrow to expand their scale of production. As a consequence, larger farms tend to have a higher debt-to-asset ratio than smaller farms. This relationship with scale extends to the share of farms in the debt-to-asset red zone: from 1996 to 2016, an average of 9.2 percent of large farms were in the red zone, compared to 6.5 percent of midsized farms and 2.9 percent of small farms."}, {"section_title": "Which Farms Would Be Vulnerable If Farm Income Were To Fall?", "text": "If farm incomes were to decline in the years ahead, more farmers would fnd it difcult to meet their debt obligations. Repayment capacity would decline, and more farmers would draw down their working capital sock. Some farmers without sufcient working capital may be able to obtain new loans to fnance their production expenses, or they may be able to resructure their loans to reduce their debt payments. However, some of those who are unable to borrow or resructure their debt may have to sell their land, equipment, or other farm assets. The mos fnancially sressed farms may be forced to sell their operations or fle for bankruptcy protection. To identify the types of farms that could be the mos vulnerable to a further decline in farm income, ERS researchers esimated which farms in 2017 (the mos recent year for which ARMS data were available) would be under \"extreme fnancial sress\" if there were a 10-percent or 20-percent decrease in gross cash farm income holding everything else consant, including input expenses. To put these numbers in perspective, gross cash farm income declined 11.7 percent from 2012 to 2016. ERS researchers defne \"extreme fnancial sress\" as being in both the repayment capacity and solvency red zones (a TDCR less than 1.0 and a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 55 percent). Such farmers would not have enough household income to meet their principal and interes paymentsand thus would be unlikely to be able to obtain new loans. Note: \"Extreme fnancial sress\" is defned as having a term debt coverage ratio (TDCR) less than one and a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 55 percent. GCFI = gross farm cash income. A \"beginning farm\" is one in which all farm operators have 10 years or less farming experience on any operation. A \"young farm\" is one in which the principal operator is below age 40."}, {"section_title": "Large farms would see bigges increase in extreme fnancial sress if gross income falls", "text": "Source: USDA, Economic Research Service and USDA, National Agricultural Statisics Service, 2017 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. In 2017, only 1.1 percent of all farms were in extreme fnancial sress (table). However, the likelihood of being in extreme fnancial sress increases with farm size. Only 0.5 percent of small farms were in extreme sress in 2017, compared to 3.1 percent of midsize farms and 3.7 percent of large farms. While the shares of midsize and large farms in extreme fnancial sress in 2017 were fairly similar, the share of farms in sress would increase more for large farms if farm revenue were to fall. For example, if gross cash farm income were to decline 20 percent, the share of large farms in sress would increase to 6.7 percent, compared with 4.9 percent for midsize farms. For midsize and large farms, the shares in this scenario would be the highes since at leas 1998. The disproportionate increase in fnancial sress for larger farms sems from the role of of-farm income: large farms have relatively less of-farm income than midsize or smaller sized farms with which to compensate for a downturn in farm income. Consequently, more large-scale producers are likely to have a TDCR that falls below 1.0 when their sales decline. Farms would be afected diferently by a decline in gross farm income depending on their commodity specialization. Dairy farms, as well as hog and poultry farms, are more likely to be in extreme fnancial sress, compared to other farms. If gross income were to fall by 20 percent, the share of grains/oilseeds, hog, poultry, and dairy operations in extreme sress would increase between 1.7 and 3.6 percentage points. Dairy farms, which would see the bigges increase in the share of farms in extreme fnancial sress, tend to be relatively capital-intensive and highly leveraged operations and, therefore, more vulnerable to a decline in farm revenues. Dairy farms would also be more vulnerable because dairy farm households earn relatively little income from of-farm sources. That table also shows the share of farms in extreme fnancial sress broken out by operator age and farming experience. Farms with young operators (below age 40) and beginning operators (10 years or less farming experience on any operation) tend to be smaller in scale. Despite this, the shares of young-operator farms (3.2 percent) and beginning-operator farms (1.5 percent) in extreme fnancial sress in 2017 are larger than the share of all U.S. farms (1.1 percent). Young or beginning operators may be more vulnerable to fnancial sress because they are more likely to borrow and have a higher debt-to-asset ratio. If sales were to decline by 20 percent, the shares of young and young-beginning farms in extreme fnancial sress would increase to 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. The share of all beginning farms in fnancial sress would increase to 2.4 percent."}, {"section_title": "Financial Stress Concentrated on Certain Types of Operations", "text": "In recent years, U.S. farm sector income has fallen from near record highs, and farm real esate is no longer rapidly appreciating in value. The economic slowdown in the sector has made some types of farms more vulnerable to fnancial sress. Farm-level indicators of repayment capacity and leverage indicate that larger farms (those with at leas $100,000 in annual gross income) are more likely to be in fnancial risk than smaller farms. Larger farms may be more fnancially vulnerable than smaller farms because they derive a greater share of income from the farm and earn less income of-farm. It is possible that if farm income goes down, operators of large farms would be more likely to need to borrow more to meet their expenses-that is, they could not as readily cover their production losses with their of-farm income without borrowing. While the measures of fnancial sress for larger operations have worsened since 2012, the indicators of repayment capacity and solvency indicate that mos of these large farms are not in \"red zones\" that indicate fnancial sress. In addition, the fnancial measures are currently near their 1996-2017 average levels and are lower than recent peak levels in 2002. If gross cash farm income were to fall by 20 percent from 2017 levels, the share of all farms in extreme fnancial sress would increase about 0.5 percentage points. However, certain types of farms could see larger increases. The share of farms in extreme fnancial sress would increase the mos in percentage-point terms for large-scale farms, for farms with a principal operator under age 40, and for dairy farms.
