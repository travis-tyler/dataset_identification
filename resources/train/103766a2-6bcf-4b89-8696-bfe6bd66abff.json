[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: We analyzed the effects of the top 20 Alzheimer disease (AD) risk genes on graymatter density (GMD) and metabolism. Methods: We ran stepwise linear regression analysis using posterior cingulate hypometabolism and medial temporal GMD as outcomes and all risk variants as predictors while controlling for age, gender, and APOE \u03b54 genotype. We explored the results in 3D using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8.\nResults: Significant predictors of brain GMD were SLC24A4/RIN3 in the pooled and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); ZCWPW1 in the MCI; and ABCA7, EPHA1, and INPP5D in the AD groups. Significant predictors of hypometabolism were EPHA1 in the pooled, and SLC24A4/RIN3, NME8, and CD2AP in the normal control group. Discussion: Multiple variants showed associations with GMD and brain metabolism. For most genes, the effects were limited to specific stages of the cognitive continuum, indicating that the genetic influences on brain metabolism and GMD in AD are complex and stage dependent."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by short-term memory loss in the early disease stages and progressive cognitive and functional deficits as the disease advances. The clinical symptoms result from the deposition of two toxic proteins, b-amyloid (Ab) and tau, which give rise to neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively [1] . The clinical appearance of AD is the direct result of neuronal dysfunction and death, which is manifested by brain atrophy and hypometabolism.\nBrain imaging is increasingly used to measure ADassociated changes in vivo. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), a novel Food and Drug Administration-approved imaging technology, uses selective Ab tracers to visualize brain amyloidosis and can reliably detect the presence of neuritic plaques in the symptomatic and presymptomatic stages. Brain atrophy is best evaluated with longitudinal studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The atrophic changes are first noticeable in the medial temporal lobe, eventually spreading through the remainder of the brain as the disease progresses [2] . Contributing to the neuronal death, brain hypometabolism, a decrease in the brain metabolic activity, can be visualized using F 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET or single photon emission tomography. The hallmark pattern in AD is early hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and parietal lobes with spread to the frontal lobes as the disease progresses [3] .\nSeventy to eighty percent of sporadic AD can be attributed to genetic risk [4, 5] . Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered more than 20 AD gene variants that confer genetic risk [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Among these variants is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which is the most established genetic risk factor for AD. Individuals with a single APOE \u03b54 allele have a threefold increase in AD risk, whereas homozygotes have a 12-fold increase [12] . apoE is a major protein component of chylomicrons and is highly expressed in both liver and brain, where it plays a role in lipid metabolism and is thought to be involved in the breakdown of Ab, both inside and outside of cells. The apoE4 protein is less effective in clearing Ab, providing a possible explanation for the increased risk of amyloid buildup [13] . With the help of imaging studies, APOE \u03b54 allele was found to be strongly associated with brain amyloidosis [14, 15] , atrophy [16] , and hypometabolism [17, 18] . These data indicate that valuable observations related to gene function can be gathered with imaging phenotypes.\nMany of the remaining top 20 AD variants have also been implicated in brain metabolism and neurodegeneration. Several SORL1 variants, EPHA1 rs11771145, and CR1 rs6656401 were found to be associated with hippocampal atrophy and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease [19, 20] . Additionally, various research groups have shown that ABCA7 rs3764650, MS4A6A rs983392, MS4A6A rs610932 and rs11230161, BIN1 rs6733839 and rs744373, CR1 rs1408077, CR1 rs6656401, CR1 rs3818361, PICALM rs3851179, CLU rs11136000 and rs2279590, CD2AP rs10948363, and CD33 rs3865444 are all associated with MRI-measured brain atrophy on MRI [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . BIN1 rs7561528 was found to be significantly associated with both hippocampal volume and FDG PET brain metabolism [28] . The studies mentioned have unquestionably contributed to the field of imaging genetics and AD research as a whole, but many of these studies have either analyzed the effect of a single gene variant at a time [19] [20] [21] [22] 24, 26, 27] or investigated the association between a polygenic risk score with the imaging trait, which does not allow us to interpret the individual contribution of genetic variants [23] . The commonly used univariate imaging genetics approach ignores the fact that in any given human subject, many of these risk variants are simultaneously present, and the genetic contribution of each variant should be investigated in the presence of the rest and not in isolation. In addition, these studies have investigated the effects in the pooled samples consisting of asymptomatic individuals, of whom only a portion harbor AD pathology, as well as symptomatic individuals who are in different stages of the disease. Such an approach would miss any stage-specific associations that might occur for genes that influence the timing and course of development of disease traits (e.g., early vs. late neurodegeneration or amyloidosis, early vs. late impairment in a specific cognitive domain) and explain, at least in part, AD heterogeneity.\nUsing a multivariable approach across the disease spectrum allows for accurate modeling of this complex polygenic disease that is constantly evolving. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the associations of all wellvalidated AD risk variants from recent large-scale GWAS studies with two markers of neurodegeneration-brain gray matter density (GMD) and brain glucose metabolism. Our goal was to establish the relative contribution of the top 20 AD risk genes to changes in GMD and metabolic dysfunction. We hypothesized that we would find gene variants that show a profound effect on these two neurodegenerative phenotypes and that some variants will show associations in a stage-specific manner."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "We sourced our study data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni. usc.edu). ADNI is an international longitudinal study with approximately 50 sites across the United States and Canada that was launched in 2003. ADNI's goal is to track the progression of AD using clinical and cognitive tests, MRI, FDG PET, amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood biomarkers (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/study-design).\nADNI has undergone three study cycles: ADNI1, ADNI GO, and ADNI2. Our study population was composed of participants from all three stages [29] . The MRI and FDG PET analyses included all subjects with GWAS and baseline MRI or FDG PET data that were successfully preprocessed. A total of 1564 ADNI subject had baseline MRI and GWAS data. Of those, 65 failed in the MRI preprocessing steps and were excluded from our structural analyses. Our final MRI cohort consisted of 441 cognitively normal (NC) subjects, 764 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 294 dementia subjects (total N 5 1499). As not all ADNI1 subjects received FDG PET, our FDG PET cohort was smaller and consisted of 381 NC, 634 MCI, and 243 dementia subjects (total N 5 1258). There were 59 subjects with available FDG PET data whose MRI scans failed in the preprocessing steps as described previously. These subjects were included in our FDG PET analyses.\nThe clinical characteristics of the ADNI cohort were described previously [30] . Diagnosis of AD was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association criteria [31] . AD subjects were required to have Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [32] scores between 20 and 26 and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5-1 at baseline [33] . Qualifying MCI subjects had memory complaints but no significant functional impairment, scored between 24 and 30 on the MMSE, had a global CDR score of 0.5, a CDR memory score of 0.5 or greater, and objective memory impairment on Wechsler Memory Scale-Logical Memory II test [34] . NC subjects had MMSE scores between 24 and 30, a global CDR of 0, and did not meet criteria for MCI and AD. Subjects were excluded if they refused or were unable to undergo MRI; had other neurological disorders, active depression, or history of psychiatric diagnosis, alcohol, or substance dependence within the past 2 years; less than 6 years of education; or were not fluent in English or Spanish.

Our decision to include gene variants was based on the AD GWAS studies that discovered these variants to date [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Genes previously associated with the defining AD pathologic hallmark-amyloid pathology were also included in our study [35] [36] [37] (Supplementary Table 1 ). The total number of variants selected was 36.\nABCA7 rs3752246, BIN1 rs6733839, CASS4 rs7274581, CD2AP rs9349407, CELF1 rs10838725, INPP5D rs35349669, PTK2B rs2883497, SORL1 rs11218343, and SORL1 rs1131497 were not genotyped on either ADNI GWAS array and needed full imputation. The following variants were only genotyped on one of the platforms and needed partial imputation: NME8 rs2718058 in ADNI1 and CLU rs933194, DSG2 rs8093731, MEF2C rs190982, and ZCWPW1 rs1476679 in ADNI-GO/2 (Supplementary Table 2 ). The imputation procedures have been previously described [38] . Imputation was performed using MACH and minimac methodology and the 1000 Genomes project (www.1000genomes.org) as the reference panel. The accuracy threshold was set at r 2 5 0.30.\nWe assessed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the -hardy option in PLINK. In the test, we used a quantitative phenotype (global cortical metabolism) and a casecontrol phenotype. Our results indicate that all 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not show any evidence of deviation from HWE (P-value . .01). The accepted significance threshold for declaring SNPs thought to be in HWE is P-value , .001.\nNine of our 20 genes were represented by more than one SNP. Given that such variants could be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and introduce colinearity bias, we performed LD analyses followed by Cohen kappa (k) statistics (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 1) . When variants providing identical information (those with high LD and high k) were detected, we chose the SNP with the smallest amount of missing data. This reduced our variants from 36 to 27.\nWe assessed the allele frequencies for each gene variant. SNPs were coded by minor allele dosage except for the following: ABCA7 rs3764650 GG/GT versus TT, CASS4 rs7274581 CC/TC versus TT, CLU rs9331949 AG/GG versus AA, DSG2 rs8093731 TT/TC versus CC, FERMT2 rs17125944 CC/TC versus TT, and SORL1 rs112183431 CC/TC versus TT where the minor allele homozygote frequency was less than 2%."}, {"section_title": "MRI and FDG PET data acquisition and analyses", "text": "The MRI acquisition and preprocessing protocols can be found on www.adni-info.org.

Seven hundred eighty-five subjects had 3T scans available, and for the remaining 715 subjects, we used 1.5T data. MRI field strength was included as a covariate in all MRI analyses. We analyzed all scans using voxel-based morphometry in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8), as described previously [43, 44] . Scans were downloaded from the ADNI site in NifTI format, coregistered to MNI space, bias corrected, and segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid compartments using SPM templates. GM maps were converted to 1 ! 1 ! 1 mm voxel resolution and smoothed using 10-mm full-width half maximum Gaussian kernel yielding GM density data. Total intracranial volume (ICV) and baseline mean medial temporal lobe thickness measures were extracted for each subject using FreeSurfer version 5.1, as described previously [45, 46] . The medial temporal region of interest included the entorhinal, fusiform, parahippocampal, and temporopolar cortical areas.\nThe FDG PET acquisition and preprocessing protocols can be found on www.adni-info.org. PET scanners and related equipment across sites were held to the same qualifications, calibration, and normalization standards, as described in detail [47] . We downloaded preprocessed FDG PET data from LONI IDA (https://ida.loni.usc.edu). These scans were already averaged, aligned to a standard space, resampled to a standard image and voxel size (2 ! 2 ! 2 mm), smoothed to a uniform resolution as previously described [47] . The downloaded images were aligned to each corresponding MRI image on a subjectby-subject basis in MNI space using SPM8, as previously described [46] . Each scan's intensity was scaled to the pons to create standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) images.

First, we performed stepwise linear regression with all 27 AD risk variants as predictors and age, gender, education, and APOE \u03b54 allele dosage as covariates in the pooled sample and then in each diagnostic group. We used medial temporal GMD or posterior cingulate SUVR, respectively, as outcome measures. Additional covariates were the diagnosis in the pooled analyses and magnetic field strength and ICV in all MRI analyses. The decision to exclude variables in the stepwise regression models was based on the Akaike information criterion using the critical P-value of .157 [50] .

There were no significant differences in age, gender, education, MMSE, and APOE \u03b54 allele dosage distribution between carriers and noncarriers or by allele dosage for any of the genotypes except the following: DSG2 minor allele carriers were more likely to be male (P 5 .028 in the FDG sample) and less likely to be APOE \u03b54 carriers (P 5 .04 in the MRI sample); EPHA1 rs11767557 minor allele carriers were less likely to be APOE \u03b54 carriers and had significantly higher MMSE scores in the FDG sample (P 5 .037 and P 5 .047, respectively); SORL1 rs11218343 minor allele carriers were less educated and more likely to be male in both samples (MRI: P 5 .01 and P 5 .008, and FDG P 5 .008 and P 5 .026, respectively), and ZCWPW1 risk allele carriers were significantly less educated and had higher MMSE scores in both samples (MRI P 5 .0012 and P 5 .034, and FDG P 5 .025 and P 5 .034, respectively).

In the dementia group, we found the opposite association. APOE \u03b54-negative dementia subjects had greater cortical loss of GMD than APOE \u03b54-positive subjects, indicative of greater cortical neurodegeneration. APOE \u03b54 was associated with widespread hypometabolism in the MCI group (Fig. 1 bottom) .

In our MRI analyses, we found no genetic influences on GMD in NC.

In our FDG PET analyses, the only significant associations were seen in the NC control group for SLC24A4/RIN3 rs10498533, NME8 rs2718058, and CD2AP rs9349407. The reported associations of ABCA7, ZCWPW1, and INPP5D with GMD, and CD2AP with brain metabolism, are novel.\nMany of our variants displayed stage-specific associations, which is likely due to the nature of AD pathological biomarker changes from the presymptomatic stage to dementia. These stage-specific associations are in agreement with the biomarker progression as proposed by Jack et al. [51] . Jack's biomarker progression model postulates that neurodegenerative changes begin in the late asymptomatic stages as NC individuals start to transition to MCI and that FDG PET abnormalities precede brain atrophy [51] . Both neurodegenerative biomarkers become progressively more abnormal over the course of the disease. Our findings agree with this model. Our results indicate neither significant nor trend-level associations with GMD in the NC group, but significant associations were detected in the MCI and dementia stages. We also see a modality effect progression that fits with the Jack model. SLC24A4/RIN3 shows significant association with brain metabolism in the presymptomatic stages and associations with GMD in the MCI group.\nRecent analyses from our group on the top 20 AD genes and brain amyloidosis revealed that, after APOE \u03b54, ABCA7 had the strongest effect on brain amyloidosis, with the effect being most pronounced in the MCI stage [52] . In the present study, we observe a strong association of ABCA7 with GMD in the dementia group. These associations also seem to follow the biomarker progression, as Ab deposition begins in the presymptomatic to early MCI phase and global decreases in GMD begin in late MCI to dementia phase. Associations of ABCA7 with both brain atrophy [21] and amyloidosis [35] [36] [37] have been previously reported.\nIn a similar manner, our previous work showed that EPHA1's strongest effect on brain amyloidosis is in the prodromal phase [52] . In the present study, our MRI results show a significant association with GMD in the dementia stages only. To date, two additional studies have described EPHA1 associations with brain atrophy [53, 54] and one also detected an association with brain metabolism as we did here [53] .\nNext, we found it pertinent to briefly review the literature on the function and central nervous system associations for each of the genes in our models.\nATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) encodes a 2146-amino acid member of the ABC transporter family comprised of proteins involved in lipid transport [55] . ABCA7 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and in microglia [56] . Loss of function of endogenous ABCA7 increases b-secretase cleavage of APP to Ab in brain lysates and in murine models [57] . Fifteen ABCA7 loci were recently evaluated for associations with cerebrospinal fluid Ab and tau levels, brain atrophy, and brain hypometabolism. Several ABCA7 variants had significant associations with amyloid deposition, although an association with brain atrophy was not reported there [58] . However, another group has previously found such an association in a different independent imaging genetic cohort [21] . Additionally, one rare missense mutation variant of ABCA7 (rs7297358) was found to be protective for AD [59] . Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; pFWE-corr, family-wise error-corrected P-value; qFDR-corr, false discovery rate-corrected q-value; kE, cluster size; p uncorr , uncorrected P-value; T, T statistic; DEM, dementia.\nNOTE. Bold text indicates a significant P value (P ,0.05).\nThe CD2-associated protein gene (CD2AP) encodes a 639-amino acid scaffolding protein that is named by its association with the T-cell and natural killer cell adhesion molecule cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2). CD2AP is a cytokinetic regulator that might be influencing neuronal survival by reducing the potency of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor [60] . In cell culture, CD2AP suppression results in lower levels of APP, less Ab release, and a lower Ab 42 /Ab 40 ratio while having little to no effect on Ab deposition [61] . CD2AP knockdown significantly increases Ab protein levels, whereas APP remained at a similar level to the wild type [62] . Recent research in CD2AP knockout mice shows that CD2AP's association with LOAD risk may be at least in part due to an effect on the cerebrovascular unit [63] . To our knowledge, there are no reported imaging associations of CD2AP to date.\nEPH receptor A1 (EPHA1) belongs to the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases. EPHA1 codes for a 976-amino acid protein with a single kinase domain [64] . EPHA1 is highly expressed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG000001469 04-EPHA1/tissue) and plays a crucial role in cortical and axonal development [65, 66] . EPHA1 directs contactdependent bidirectional signaling by binding the membrane-bound ephrin-A family of ligands [67, 68] . As already discussed, EPHA1 has been previously associated with brain atrophy and brain metabolism [53, 54] . Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase D (INPP5D) encodes a 1888-amino acid protein that plays a role in a number of inflammatory pathways and in regulation of cytokine signaling [69, 70] . INPP5E, a closely related gene to INPP5D, is a crucial regulator of autophagy [71] . Autophagy has been shown in many instances to be dysregulated in AD [72] [73] [74] . INPP5D may also play a role in suppression of cytokine release from microglia or astrocytes [75] . INPP5D has been significantly associated with several central nervous system pathologies, including macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis [76] . NME family member 8 (NME8) encodes a 588-amino acid protein kinase. Until recently, NME8 was associated with nonneurologic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia [77] and osteoarthritis [78, 79] . In a recent ADNI study, however, NME8 rs2718058 was shown to have a neuroprotective effect against hippocampal atrophy and brain hypometabolism [80] .\nSolute carrier family 24 (sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger) member 4 (SLC24A4)/Ras and Rab Interactor 3 (RIN3) are indicated in AD together because the candidate polymorphism lies between both genes on chromosome 14q32.12. SLC24A4 encodes a 622-amino acid potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger [81] . SLC24A4 appears to take part in lipid metabolism [82] . SLC24A4 CpG methylation sites were also associated with Ab burden and tau pathology [83] . In a recent study, SLC24A4 knockout mice showed brain glucose hypometabolism [84] . Interestingly, we found a similar effect in NC.\nRIN3 encodes a 985-amino acid guanine exchange factor for RAB5B and RAB31 and plays an important role in the transport of early endosomes [85, 86] . In a transgenic model, a mutation in APP was shown to contribute to early endosomal abnormalities and enlargement, which leads to loss of cholinergic neurons [87] . RAB GTPase expression is increased in MCI subjects and in aging brains [88] . RIN3 also interacts with BIN1, which has recently been linked to tau pathology [89] . To our knowledge, there are no reported imaging associations of RIN3 to date.\nZinc finger CW-type and PWWP domain containing 1 (ZCWPW1) codes for a 648-amino acid protein that has recently been identified as a risk variant for late-onset AD [90] . Zinc fingers including ZCWPW1 are crucial components of epigenetic regulation [91] [92] [93] . To our knowledge, there are no reported imaging associations of ZCWPW1 to date. Table 4 Family-wise error (FWE) and false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected cluster-level analyses and within-cluster peak effects for genetic variants identified in the exploratory FDG PET analyses Diagnostic group The APOE \u03b54 allele dosage effect on cortical GMD warrants some discussion. Structurally, we found the expected negative association of APOE \u03b54 allele dosage with GMD in NC and MCI with a strong predilection for the medial temporal lobe. In the dementia group, however, APOE \u03b54-negative individuals showed more profound atrophy than APOE \u03b54 carriers with a broad neocortical distribution. Given that a far greater proportion of APOE \u03b54-negative dementia subjects were amyloid negative (94% vs. 28% of the amyloid-positive dementia subjects, P , .0001), one could safely conclude that the profound cognitive decline of many of these subjects is due to other neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the finding greater atrophy in APOE \u03b54 noncarrier dementia subjects in extra-hippocampal locations is not surprising.\nSeveral strengths and limitations of our work are worth noting. The major strength of our study is our multivariable approach. This allows us to more accurately model the associations with AD biomarkers as they exist in vivo. Using ADNI is another strength as the ADNI protocol includes a rigorous clinical, biomarker, and genetic characterization for all enrolled subjects. By standardizing their data collection and processing strategies, ADNI minimizes between-site variations as much as possible. ADNI is a multisite study modeled by clinical trials. As such, ADNI uses more stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria typical of clinical trial methodology. Hence all observations made here need to be further replicated in the general population. Another limitation is that our study design is a cross-sectional analysis. From our data alone, it is not possible to reliably draw conclusions about changes in metabolism or atrophy over time. We do, however, intend to address this in future studies by taking a longitudinal approach to our work. Despite this limitation, this study has identified several key genes that may exert their effect in specific stages, which need to be examined in future research.\nIn conclusion, we found several AD risks and protective loci that may play a key role in GMD and brain metabolism. We also noted stage-specific associations for certain variants, which may follow a specific progression of AD biomarkers throughout the disease. Importantly, many of these stage associations take place in the context of the proposed biomarker timeline."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Systematic review:", "text": "Our goal was to analyze the effects of the top 20 Alzheimer disease (AD) risk genes on brain gray-matter density (GMD) and metabolism. We assessed relevant literature by searching PubMed and Science Direct for studies describing imaging genetics associations in AD.\n2. Interpretation: SLC24A4, ABCA7, and EPHA1 have significant stage-specific associations that followed the predicted biomarker pathway. We discovered novel associations of ZCWPW1, INPP5D, and ABCA7 with brain GMD and CD2AP with brain metabolism.\n3. Future directions: Future longitudinal studies of the observed associations will aptly measure defined changes over time. This approach will be critical in accurately modeling the genetic effects on disease progression."}]
