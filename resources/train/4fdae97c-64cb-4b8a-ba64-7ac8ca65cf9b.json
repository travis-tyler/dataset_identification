Conversely, sustained elevations in BP can impose a substantial mechanical stress on the cerebrovascular beds and subsequently cause vascular remodeling and dysfunction. 3 In daily life, BP fluctuates considerably and presents prominent circadian rhythms. 4 Thus, a snapshot measurement of BP in the routine clinic setting is unlikely to represent the overall impact of BP on the brain. 5 Indeed, elevated BP not only while awake but also during sleep has been linked to brain structural deteriorations [6] [7] [8] and cognitive dysfunction. [9] [10] [11] [12] Nevertheless, the potential effects of changes in BP circadian rhythms on brain Ab deposition are yet to be understood.\nAmnestic mild cognitive impairment (aM-CI), often a prodromal phase of AD, may represent a critical time window to prevent or slow AD progression. 13 Therefore, it would be important to identify modifiable risk factors in these individuals. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to investigate whether cortical Ab deposition is associated with circadian BP patterns, as assessed by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring (ABPM); and (2) to determine whether dynamic cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation is altered and whether these changes are associated with cortical Ab deposition.\nMETHODS Participants. Forty participants with aMCI were recruited through a community-based advertisement and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Alzheimer's Disease Center. The diagnosis of aMCI was based on Petersen criteria, 14 as modified by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project (http://adni-info.org). Specifically, a global Clinical Dementia Rating scale of 0.5 with a score of 0.5 in the memory category, objective memory loss as indicated by education-adjusted scores on the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Amyloid burden with age and apolipoprotein E4 status was positioned using laser guides. A 2-minute scout scan was acquired to ensure that the brain was completely in the field of view without rotation in either the transverse or sagittal planes. At 50 minutes postinjection, 2 frames of 5-minute PET emission scan and a 7-minute transmission scan were acquired in 3D mode using the following parameters: matrix size 5 128 3 128, resolution 5 5 3 5 mm, slice thickness 5 2.42 mm, and field of view 5 58.3 cm. The emission images were processed by iterative reconstruction, 4 iterations and 16 subsets with a 3-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) ramp filter. The transmission image was reconstructed using back-projection and a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian filter for attenuation correction. 15, 16 Image processing. Each participant's PET image was spatially normalized to a florbetapir uptake template (2 3 2 3 2 mm 3 voxels) using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) and in-house MATLAB (MathWorks, Sherborn, MA) scripts, and visually inspected for registration quality. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was computed using mean cerebellar uptake as a reference. Three regions of interest relevant to AD pathology were selected a priori: posterior cingulate, precuneus, and mean cortex. 17 The mean cortical SUVR was calculated by taking an average of the posterior and anterior cingulate, precuneus, temporal, dorsolateral prefrontal, orbital frontal, parietal, and occipital SUVRs. 15 Ambulatory BP monitoring. ABPM was performed for $24 hours using a noninvasive oscillometric BP monitor (SunTech Medical Instruments, Morrisville, NC). 18 Each participant wore a brachial cuff on the nondominant arm. Measurements were made every 30 minutes during the participant's individually scheduled awake period and every 60 minutes during the scheduled sleep period. The ABPM data are reported as an average of 24-hour, awake, and sleep periods. Awake and sleep BP were calculated according to the standard clinical guideline. 4 To quantify the relative magnitude of BP changes from awake to sleep period, we calculated sleep BP dip using the following formula 7 :\nWe analyzed the dipping status of sleep BP using continuous and categorical variables. The dippers were characterized as having falls in sleep systolic BP (SBP) $10%, whereas nondippers had falls in sleep SBP ,10%. 7, 19 Dynamic CBF regulation assessment. Dynamic CBF regulation assessment was conducted in an environmentally controlled laboratory. After collecting a 5-minute baseline, a repeated sitstand maneuver was performed for 5 minutes with a duty cycle of a 10-second sit and a 10-second stand (i.e., 0.05 Hz). The purpose of this maneuver is to nonpharmacologically induce oscillations of BP using a movement relevant to daily life, while recording dynamic changes in CBF. 20 CBF velocity (CBFV) was measured from the middle cerebral artery using a 2-MHz transcranial Doppler (TCD) probe (Multi-Dop X2; Compumedics/ DWL, Singen, Germany). Beat-by-beat changes in CBFV and BP at the level of heart using finger plethymography (Finapress; Ohmeda, Boulder, CO) were continuously and simultaneously recorded and stored for offline analysis (Acqknowledge; BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA).\nTo quantify the cerebral dynamic pressure flow (CDPF) relation, transfer function (TF) metrics (i.e., gain, phase, and coherence) were calculated in the frequency domain. 21 First, all hemodynamic data were averaged over each cardiac cycle to obtain beat-by-beat mean values. Second, the beat-by-beat values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CBFV were linearly interpolated, resampled at 2 Hz, and detrended by a third-order polynomial curve fitting. These data were subdivided into 256-point segments with 50% overlap, and a Hanning window was applied for Fourier spectral analysis. TF gain represents a magnitude response of CBF to dynamic changes in BP and was calculated using both the absolute (cm/s) and relative (%) units. 22 TF phase represents a temporal relation between changes in BP and CBF, while the coherence function reflects strength of their linear correlations (0 5 no correlation and 1 5 perfect correlation).\nAlteration of circadian BP patterns may lead to cerebrovascular remodeling, such as arteriolar hypertrophy, 3 which may cause cerebral vasoconstriction accompanied by the elevated vascular resistance, and have significant impacts on the TF metrics via a Windkessel effect, as suggested in our previous studies. 23 The TF metrics were computed at 0.05 Hz. In addition, cerebrovascular resistance index was calculated by dividing MAP by CBFV.\nAPOE genotyping. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained via IV blood draw and centrifugal Ficoll-based separation. PBMCs were cryopreserved in the media containing 50% human serum on the day of collection. For genotype analysis, 1 million cells were thawed and DNA extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen; Venlo, Netherlands). APOE genotype was identified using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA). APOE genotype data were available from 35 participants.\nStatistical analyses. The nonparametric statistical analyses were used according to the result of normality check performed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and the visual inspection of histograms and Q-Q plots. The changes in BP from awake to sleep period were examined by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Spearman correlation examined simple correlations among continuous variables. Group differences in categorical and continuous variables were examined by the x 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively. Analysis of covariance using general linear model and partial correlation analysis were performed on rank-order variables with an adjustment for covariates. The covariates were determined by the significant correlates of cortical SUVR in this sample. All data are reported as mean 6 SD. Statistical significance was set a priori at p , 0.05 for all tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL).\nRESULTS Table e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at Neurology.org presents basic characteristics of all participants. All participants were physically healthy and had a normal or controlled BP. Despite the diagnosis of aMCI, MMSE scores were within the normal range, suggesting an early phase of mild cognitive impairment. The APOE4 carriers were all heterozygotes and accounted for 34% of the sample. The older participants with aMCI showed higher SUVRs in the posterior cingulate, the precuneus, and the mean value of the overall cortex, whereas the APOE4 carriers demonstrated a trend toward higher levels in the precuneus and mean cortical values than the noncarriers (figure 1).\nFrom awake to sleep period, SBP (figure 2A) and diastolic BP decreased. Table e-2 presents simple correlations between amyloid SUVRs and BP measures. After adjustment for age, the magnitude of sleep SBP dip remained to be negatively associated with the higher levels of the posterior cingulate SUVR ( figure 2B) . These results were further confirmed by the group comparisons between the dippers and nondippers (table 1). Of note, the nondippers were older than the dippers but similar in the APOE4 status. Interestingly, awake BP was similar between the groups, while sleep BP was elevated in the nondippers. Figure 3 displays the group-averaged SUVR maps of the dippers and nondippers. After adjustment for age, the posterior cingulate SUVR remained to be elevated in the nondippers. Figure 4 shows the estimated TF metrics of the CDPF relation in the dippers and nondippers. The nondippers demonstrated a diminished TF gain and elevated cerebrovascular resistance index compared DISCUSSION The primary findings from this study are twofold. First, patients with aMCI with an attenuated fall in sleep SBP had greater Ab burden in the posterior cingulate independent of age. Consistently as a group, the nondippers demonstrated higher levels of Ab deposition in the posterior cingulate than the dippers. Second, the nondippers exhibited a diminished TF gain of the CDPF relation, and moreover those individuals with a lower TF gain had higher Ab deposition in the posterior cingulate. Collectively, these findings suggest that brain Ab burden is related to elevated sleep BP and altered CBF regulation in patients with aMCI. Below we discuss the potential mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings.\nBrain Ab deposition increases with the aging process, which may reflect AD pathology. 15 In patients with aMCI, age was positively correlated with greater Ab burden, consistent with previous studies. 15 Physiologically, Ab in the brain is produced by the neurons and cleared by the 4 potential mechanisms: (1) paravascular drainage of the interstitial and CSFs, (2) direct transport across the blood-brain barrier, (3) enzyme-dependent proteolysis, and (4) endogenous autoantibodies. [24] [25] [26] Current evidence suggests that brain Ab deposition associated with age and lateonset AD are mainly attributed to a reduced clearance, which facilitates the aggregation of soluble Ab in the interstitial fluid and the formation of neurotic plaques in a concentration-dependent manner. 27, 28 The patients with aMCI with elevated sleep SBP were older than those with normal BP dipping; however, after accounting for age, those nondippers still exhibited greater Ab burden in the posterior cingulate. The age difference between the dippers and nondippers observed in the present study is consistent with the literature. 29 In contrast, the link between the elevated sleep BP and Ab provide new insights into the previous observations that nondippers have a higher risk of cognitive impairment and brain structural deteriorations. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Specifically, elevated sleep BP has been associated with ischemic brain injuries, 6 stroke incidence, 7 and brain atrophy. 8 Moreover, nondippers have been shown to manifest lower performance in memory, sensorimotor, and global cognition 9-11 and a higher risk of developing dementia 12 than the dippers.\nThere are a few mechanisms that may explain the relation between elevated sleep BP and brain Ab burden. First, cerebrovascular disease or dysfunction may contribute to Ab deposition in the brain. We found a diminished TF gain of the CDPF relation in the nondippers, which in turn was correlated with higher Ab burden in the posterior cingulate. Physiologically, these observations indicate the presence of elevated cerebrovascular resistance in the nondippers, which dampened the oscillations of CBF in the face of BP fluctuations. 23 Consistently, we found a higher level of cerebrovascular resistance index in the nondippers, suggesting BP-induced cerebrovascular remodeling and constriction. 3 The elevated cerebrovascular resistance may increase the risk of hypoperfusion, which has been shown to accelerate Ab deposition. 30 Moreover, significant dampening of CBF dynamics may also impair the paravascular clearance of Ab from the interstitial fluid. 31 Second, Ab clearance may be impaired by an enhanced sympathetic neural activity during sleep associated with attenuated reductions in BP dip. 32 A recent study in rodents demonstrated that sleep expands the volume of brain interstitial space, which facilitates Ab clearance via the paravascular pathway. 32 Furthermore, such sleep-induced clearance of Ab from the brain may be mediated by a suppression of adrenergic signaling. 32 In healthy individuals, sympathetic neural activity is reduced during sleep and decreases BP, which may promote Ab clearance from the brain. 33 In contrast, with advanced age or presence of cardiovascular disease, elevated sympathetic neural activity may not only increase BP but also impair Ab clearance from the brain during sleep. 32, 34 Third, AD and Ab deposition in the brain are influenced by the presence of hypertension. 35 This relation may be mediated by an Ab-induced activation of a1-adrenergic receptors, leading to cerebral vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in chronotropic control of the heart rate or cardiac output, which is related to brain perfusion. 36 The mechanism leading to the observed regional vulnerability of the posterior cingulate to Ab deposition in the nondippers remains unclear. However, it is well-known that this area of the brain functions as the neuronal hub of the default mode network and exhibits a higher metabolic rate than the cortical average. 37, 38 Therefore, the posterior cingulate has a higher rate of Ab production and manifests an earlier sign of Ab deposition. 17 In the context of the present study, Ab homeostasis may be disturbed by the disrupted neurovascular coupling due to elevated sleep BP and altered CBF regulation (e.g., hypoperfusion). 30 Consequently, the posterior cingulate may express an accelerated Ab deposition, which can subsequently increase the risk of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment associated with AD. 39, 40 This study is strengthened by the use of a multimodality method to investigate the effects of ambulatory BP profile and dynamic CBF regulation on cortical Ab deposition in patients with aMCI. First, 18 F-florbetapir PET was used to quantify the degree of Ab burden in the cortical areas relevant to AD pathology. 16 Second, the use of 24-hour ABPM allowed us to measure circadian rhythms of BP, which reflects the overall impact of changes in BP in daily life on the brain and also increases the reliability of BP measurement. 4 Third, to better understand the mechanism of the BP-Ab link, we assessed the CDPF relation, which revealed the potential role of altered CBF regulation in cortical Ab deposition. 21 There are several limitations that need to be discussed. First, this is a cross-sectional study, which limits the understanding of causality. Second, our sample size was limited, and only highly educated individuals with aMCI were enrolled. Thus, the generalizability of our findings awaits confirmation in larger samples. The relatively small sample size also posed a limitation in detecting the effect of APOE4 on the cortical SUVR in this study (i.e., only 12 participants were APOE4 carriers). Third, although TCD has a high temporal resolution to assess dynamic changes in CBF, it does not measure volumetric flow and is limited by the spatial resolution. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the altered cerebral hemodynamics observed at a relatively global level reflects regional differences. "}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": ""}]
