The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study).\nWith the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies.\nFor the 2 studies that collected data on A\u03b2 levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD \"A\u03b2-positive\" placebo group and compare them with an \"A\u03b2-negative\" group. For the study that did not include data on A\u03b2 levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-\u03b54 and by clinical progression.\nIn ADNI, A\u03b2-positive participants showed more decline than did A\u03b2-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "recently, the preclinical stage of AD has been postulated. This asymptomatic stage, believed to precede mild cognitive impairment by years, is characterized by accumulating amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration accompanied by very subtle cognitive decline detectable with sensitive neuropsychological tests and cognitive complaint measures. 1 Individuals with preclinical AD (ie, cognitively normal individuals with biomarker evidence of brain amyloid deposition) represent a group at high risk for decline and an ideal population for a \"secondary prevention\" trial aimed at delaying the emergence of the clinical syndromes of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 8 Drug development strategies in very early stages of the AD process initially focused on biomarkers that might efficiently demonstrate change-occurring years before the onset of symptoms. Examples of such candidate biomarker outcomes have included volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, 9 positron emission tomography (PET) with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose, 10 amyloid PET imaging, 11, 12 and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. 13 Although each of these proposed outcomes reflect disease progression, the impact of therapeutic interventions aimed at disease modification has been surprising. For example, antiamyloid immunotherapy may paradoxically accelerate brain atrophy as measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. 14 Until a reliable surrogate biomarker is validated, the field must rely on clinical outcome measures that reflect cognitive function. Studies have shown that cognitive performance, measured using tests ranging from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to word list learning tasks, may also show changes many years before the onset of functional decline. 2, 15, 16 Cognitive measures have important advantages over imaging and biochemical biomarkers: they are closely related to the core symptoms of disease progression and, at later stages, are sensitive to treatment effects. The US Food and Drug Administration has recently indicated support for the potential utility of cognitive composite measures as outcome measures in AD trials conducted at the preclinical stage. 17 We describe a composite cognitive performance measure, the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC is designed to serve as the primary outcome measure for trials conducted at the asymptomatic phase of AD. We describe, in particular, how the ADCS-PACC will be implemented in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study (hereafter referred to as the A4 study), which is being conducted by the ADCS in partnership with Eli Lilly. 18 "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The A4 Study Design", "text": "The A4 study will be a 168-week placebo-controlled \"secondary prevention\" trial of an anti-A\u03b2 treatment, aimed at slowing cognitive decline in cognitively normal older individuals who have elevated brain amyloid levels (ie, \"A\u03b2-positive\" individuals), based on florbetapir PET amyloid imaging. 18 The A4 study will include a natural history arm of \"A\u03b2-negative\" cognitively normal individuals followed up with longitudinal cognitive outcome measures collected at the same intervals. There are also 2 embedded substudies: (1) an ethics protocol to investigate the impact of disclosure of A\u03b2 status and (2) a novel outcome instrument development protocol to optimize the detection of early decline over the course of preclinical AD. Eligible participants will be 65 to 85 years of age at the time of screening, with a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-G) score of 0, an MMSE score of 27 to 30, and a Delayed Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa subtest of 8 to 15 for participants with 13 or more years of education, or with an MMSE score of 25 to 30 and a Delayed Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa subtest of 6 to 13 for participants with 12 or less years of education. A study goal is to include approximately 20% of participants from underrepresented minority groups.\nThe antiamyloid intervention for the A4 study is solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the midsequence of monomeric A\u03b2; this treatment was selected by the consensus of a panel of experts advising the A4 study team. A total of 1000 A\u03b2-positive participants will be randomly assigned to solanezumab or placebo. Identifying these A\u03b2-positive participants will require screening approximately 3000 cognitively normal older individuals by use of florbetapir PET amyloid imaging. This screening process will provide an opportunity to collect plasma biomarkers and imaging and neuropsychological data on a large number of A\u03b2-negative individuals representing a well-characterized \"gold standard\" cognitively normal control group."}, {"section_title": "The ADCS-PACC", "text": "The primary objective of the A4 study is to test the hypothesis that solanezumab, administered as a 400-mg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for 168 weeks, will slow cognitive decline compared with placebo in participants with preclinical AD. This objective will be assessed using a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of change in the ADCS-PACC score. The specific hypothesis of the A4 study is that there will be less of a decrease in the ADCS-PACC score at the end of the treatment period for participants treated with solanezumab than for participants treated with placebo.\nBased on a review of the literature for cohort studies in \"normal controls\" who progressed to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer dementia, we determined that a composite measure sensitive to change in preclinical AD would likely require assessment of 3 key domains: episodic memory, executive function, and orientation.

To estimate the rate of A\u03b2-mediated decline and inform the sample size justification for the A4 study, we examined several natural history data sets. With each data set, a group similar to the A4 study cognitively normal A\u03b2-positive target population is identified and compared longitudinally with a reference cognitively normal A\u03b2-negative population. Estimated group differences provide an upper bound on potential treatment effects in our target population. We also explore group differences between those who maintain a CDR-G score of 0 (\"CDR-G stable\") vs those who progress from a CDR-G score of 0 to a worse score (\"CDR-G progressor\").

We classify these cognitively normal participants as A\u03b2-positive participants, with a PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) above 1.5 and a CSF A\u03b242 level below 192 pg/mL, or as A\u03b2-negative participants, with a PiB SUVR below 1.5 and a CSF A\u03b242 level above 192 pg/mL.

Therefore, as a proxy for A\u03b2 status, we use the presence of at least 1 APOE-\u03b54 allele, although this is less predictive of decline than A\u03b2 markers. 26 We also compare participants who were CDR-G stable with those who were CDR-G progressors. This last group definition is based on postbaseline progression data and is bound to demonstrate larger group differences than the other analyses based on baseline covariates only. However, this analysis of postbaseline progression puts the scale of the composite in perspective relative to clinically meaningful CDR-G change.

The model includes effects for baseline ADCS-PACC score and age, which is known to be associated with A\u03b2 accumulation in brain. The MMRM treats time as a categorical variable and estimates group differences at each visit while making no assumptions about the shape of trajectories. We use the Akaike information criterion 41 to select the covariance structure between unstructured, compound symmetric, and autoregressive correlations of the order 1. From the final model, we report the difference between the at-risk population and the reference population at the final visit, which is typically the test statistic of primary interest in a clinical trial. We also report P values with an adjustment for simultaneous inference 42 and area between the curves using the trapezoid rule. 43 Power calculations assume an MMRM to estimate treatment effect at 36 months, 6-month visit intervals, 500 participants per group, 30% attrition, and a 5% \u03b1 level. We use the formula by Lu et al 44 implemented in the R package longpower 45 to project the smallest detectable effect. The formula accommodates general attrition patterns. We assume that attrition accumulates linearly to an overall 30% attrition rate at 3 years with 5% worse attrition in the active arm. We report minimum detectable effects on the raw scale (eg, ADCS-PACC units) and as a percentage of the mean decline in the at-risk group (eg, A\u03b2-positive individuals, APOE-\u03b54 carriers, or CDR-G progressors).

The Figure depicts the minimum detectable treatment effect for 80% power.\nUsing ADNI pilot estimates of variance and correlation (Table 3) , we project a minimum treatment difference of \u0394 = 0.525 to 0.607 units for 80% to 90% power. This is larger than the observed A\u03b2 group difference in ADNI at month 36 but is 0.525/1.239 = 42.4% to 0.607/1.239 = 49.0% of that difference at month 24.

Moreover, we found that decline on this composite was robust across cohorts, regardless of the exact measures used; however, in ADNI, we did not see significant changes from baseline, and the amyloid group difference was only significant at month 24. The inconsistencies between the various studies used in our retrospective analysis also present some limitations. The particular tests that comprised each study's entire battery, and their order of presentation, varied from study to study. In addition, none of the studies analyzed were treatment trials. Owing to these factors, the ADCS-PACC may behave differently in the A4 study.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, we project that the A4 study has about 80% power to detect a treatment benefit of 0.5 ADCS-PACC units over 3 years. A quarter standard deviation change in each component of the ADCS-PACC equates to a 1-point change in the ADCS-PACC total score. The ADCS-PACC is standardized according to the baseline distribution of 4 instruments with established face validity in more impaired populations. We believe 0.5 ADCS-PACC units is small enough to be a realistically attainable, yet large enough to suggest benefit to patients, including a reduction in later clinical deterioration.\nThe Item Response Theory approach applied to ADCS-PACC items did not improve power in ADNI, although a model with 16 items did achieve more consistent decline and A\u03b2 group separation in ADNI (eFigure and eTable in the Supplement). The logistic regression approach decreased the smallest detectable effect (percentage of A\u03b2 group difference) at 80% power by 6.5% when applied to same AIBL data that were used to obtain the weights. The weighting favored list and paragraph recall over MMSE and Digit Symbol Substitution. However, when these weights were applied to the other studies, it performed poorly. The smallest possible effect size was only 1.5% smaller than the logistic regression weights, and this required weighting Digit Symbol Substitution in the wrong direction. We have concerns about the validity of optimized weighting, particularly given that there is no information about treatment response for these items in the target population. It is conceivable, for example, that we would down-weight a particular item that would respond to treatment, but we have no information with which to assess this risk. At this point, we do not find strong evidence to support unequal weighting of the ADCS-PACC items.\nIdeally, the A4 study would be powered to detect a clinically meaningful effect. The term clinically meaningful effect is somewhat nebulous but presumably indicates an effect on symptoms of importance to the treated individual. In a 3-year study in the clinically normal target population for the A4 study, we will not necessarily observe the emergence of functional impairment seen in late mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, because a composite measure of memory, orientation, and executive function has face validity as an indicator of AD-related clinical progression, the recent US Food and Drug Administration draft guidance 17, 51 suggests that such a measure may serve as a primary outcome measure for the purpose of accelerated approval, with clinical meaningfulness supported by postmarketing study. The A4 study will include a number of secondary and exploratory measures to inform interpretation of the treatment effect on the primary measure. These include molecular, structural, and functional neuroimaging measures, CSF biochemical markers, and patient-and informant-reported measures of perceived global and specific cognitive function. Experience with such measures in longitudinal studies in the preclinical AD population is limited, and their sensitivity to treatment effects is unknown. However, they may clarify not only the pathophysiological impact of the antiamyloid intervention but also the implications of the cognitive effects."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The concept of preclinical AD, a stage of amyloid-mediated neurodegeneration before the emergence of clinical symptoms, 1, 8 represents an attractive target for disease-modifying intervention in AD. The relationship of longitudinal change in the ADCS-PACC to the presence of amyloid plaques in the brains of asymptomatic older individuals supports the notion that this measure may be useful in establishing favorable treatment effects. While much remains to be learned about preclinical AD, the enormity of the need for effective therapy requires the rapid initiation of trials. Presumably, the A4 study and other very early interventional studies will further elucidate the trajectory of cognitive decline during the preclinical stages of AD and facilitate the successful development of disease-modifying treatments."}]
