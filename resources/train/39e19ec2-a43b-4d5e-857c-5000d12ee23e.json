[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The options available to foreign-born individuals looking to work in the U.S. depend largely on their education. For the high-skilled, the H-1B visa is the largest temporary work program available in the U.S. (Doran, Gelber, and Isen 2016). The current immigration system places a yearly numerical limit, or cap, on H-1B visas. A growing literature exploits the drop in this cap, from 195,000 to 65,000 in fiscal year (FY) 2004, to study the effect that binding visa restrictions have on labor market outcomes (Kato and Sparber 2013;Shih 2016;Peri, Shih, and Sparber 2015;Mayda et al. 2018;Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado 2019). While both family-and employment-based visas figure prominently in the U.S. government's policy agenda, economists have focused their research primarily on employment visas. The alternative channel of access to the labor market and permanent residency through marriage to a U.S. citizen has received little attention in the literature. In contrast with other family-based visas, there are no limits to the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country and given work permits via marriage, and the wait from application to approval is usually a few months. Thus, marriage to a citizen is a viable option to work legally in the U.S. I investigate the impact of changes in visa restrictions on the likelihood of high-skilled temporary residents marrying a U.S. citizen, and find that restrictions on the H-1B visa significantly increased marriage to a citizen and access to the US labor market. Marriage to a citizen removes barriers to entry to the US: it has no skill requirements and provides near-immediate access to a permanent resident visa (i.e. a green card), and hence a work permit, usually considerably faster than other family-based visas. About one-fourth of all green cards awarded from 2000 to 2018 were obtained through sponsorship by a U.S. citizen spouse. 1 It does not suffer the quotas and time limits imposed by employment-based visas, nor the uncertainty of visa lotteries. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, there is no economic research on whether high-skilled temporary residents consider marriage to a citizen as a way to immigrate to the U.S. in response to visa restrictions. Researchers have examined how marriage to a citizen affects immigrants' integration into the labor market (Chi 2015;Meng and Gregory 2005), their earnings (Chi and Drewianka 2014;Furtado and Song 2015), and their labor force participation Theodoropoulos 2009, 2010). Azzolini & Guetto (2017) deals with how acquisition of citizenship affects the likelihood of marriage to a citizen, and Stevens et al. (2012) presents descriptive evidence on cross-nativity marriages among migrants to the U.S. However, there is no research on how visa restrictions may affect the marriage decision itself. This paper synthesizes the economic literature on the returns to marriage, the impact that migratory restrictions have on immigrants, and the self-selection of immigrants. To investigate the effect of visa restrictions on marriage to a citizen, I develop a measure of married to a citizen based on the time it takes to become a permanent resident. Foreign students who marry a citizen can become permanent residents within a year of marriage whereas those who marry a permanent resident or non-resident must wait significantly longer to get residency. I then use changes in the number of H-1B visas granted in 2004 and again in 2006 to identify the causal effect of visa restrictions on marriage to a citizen. I find that high-skilled immigrants are highly responsive to these policy changes. Individuals from countries bound by the H1-B visa cap and graduating in 2004 and 2005 were 18 percentage points more likely to be married to a U.S. citizen within a year, relative to those with substitute visas available. The expansion in 2006 is associated with an almost commensurate decrease of 26.5 percentage points relative to [2004][2005]. The magnitude and direction of these results are robust to changes to the composition of the treated and control countries, and to specific fields of degree or citizens of specific countries. I interpret this as a \"harvesting effect\": the cap-drop incentivized recent graduates to get married sooner, which mechanically reduced the pool of couples who were still unmarried by 2006. This, together with a lower incentive for couples to shorten their courtship period thanks to a significant expansion of visa availability, would explain the drop observed after 2006. Finally, I explore how high-skilled foreign graduates self-select into marriage to a citizen by using the ranking of the PhD graduate's program as a proxy for unobserved ability. I find that PhD graduates' response to each policy change depends on the ranking of their school. During the drop in the H-1B cap, individuals who graduated from the top 20 programs were the ones most likely to marry a citizen (28.5 percentage points). Moreover, I find evidence that this increase was not offset after the expansion in 2006, so that the overall increase from 2004 to 2009 was 20.4 percentage points for those at the top. Furthermore, those from schools ranked 51-100 became 23.9 percentage points less likely to marry citizens after 2004. This is evidence of positive selection into marriage to a citizen on the basis of observable quality of education, and the unobservable traits associated with it."}, {"section_title": "The H-1B and alternative work visas", "text": "Created as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, 2 the H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. It is one of the few nonimmigrant visas that allows holders to simultaneously work in the U.S. and seek permanent residency without the risk of losing their lawful status (also known as a dual-intent visa). The numerical limit of H-1B visas that could be granted, as well as the employers who could apply for them, has varied over time. In 2001 it was temporarily set to 195,000 and special rules were introduced that exempt employees of higher educational institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and government research organizations (hereafter referred to as academic institutions) from counting toward the cap. In 2004, the provision that had increased the limit in 2001 was allowed to expire, thus exogenously bringing the limit back to 65,000. The exemptions for academic institutions were left in place, however, and starting in 2006 a rule was introduced exempting the first 20,000 beneficiaries with U.S. postgraduate degrees from counting toward the cap (a rule also known as the Advanced Degree Exemption, or ADE). 3 Each year from 2004 to 2006, over 60,000 approved applications went to applicants with a master's degree or higher. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not provide information on the share of postgraduates from US institutions, but this was clearly a substantial expansion for them. Figure 1 shows the total number of H-1B visa petitions and approvals for new employment from 2001 to 2010, as well as the cap for each year. 4,5 From 2001 to 2003 the cap was not binding, but each year since the cap dropped in 2004 the number of petitions has exceeded the number allowed by the cap. These differences in availability of substitutes to the H-1B, together with the cap-drop in 2004, created a quasi-experiment that permits comparing outcomes of interest for citizens from countries bound by the H-1B cap (\"treated\") to those from countries with substitute visas available (\"control\"), 6 before and after 2006. However, it should be noted that neither of these substitute visas allow dual-intent, and so they are not perfect substitutes for the H-1B. 7 This is a strong reason for temporary residents from non-bound countries to still prefer applying for H-1Bs even while having alternative work visas at their disposal, and it is likely to bias the estimated effect of the cap-drop towards zero. Kato and Sparber (2013) were the first to take advantage of the fact that citizens from five countries had access to alternative work visas. The TN visa was created as part of the North America Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for citizens of Canada and Mexico. The H-1B1 visa was introduced in 2004, setting aside some H-1B visas for people from Chile (1,400) and Singapore (5,400). Finally, the E-3 visa was created in 2005 for Australian citizens, with a cap of 10,500 visas. Neither the H-1B1 visas nor the E-3 visas reached their caps during the period I consider in this paper. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of individuals that can work in the U.S. with TN visas, and they can be renewed indefinitely (Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado 2019). These alternative visas allow holders to work temporarily in the U.S. without having to apply for an H-1B, making them \"less bound\" by the H-1B cap, less likely to be affected by H1B policy changes than the rest of foreign citizens, and thus a suitable control group. Kato and Sparber (2013) use the quasi-experimental setting outlined above to study the effect this restrictive H-1B policy had on the flow and composition of undergraduate students seeking to study in the US and find that the new visa restrictions discouraged applicants who would be bound by the H-1B cap after graduation, particularly those in the top quintile of the SAT score distribution. Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado (2019) follow the same approach using data on recent graduates from U.S. institutions and find that, relative to graduates from countries with substitute visas, those from countries restricted by the cap became more likely to choose academic employers, which are exempt from the cap. Mayda et al. (2018) use a triple difference approach to report a significant reduction in new hires of all H-1B workers due to the more stringent cap restrictions. These previous papers show evidence of unintended consequences of this visa policy. In this paper I contribute by giving evidence of another one, I consider marriage to a citizen as an option that temporary residents may turn to when facing stronger visa restrictions. I develop a new measure of married to a citizen based on the time it takes to become a permanent resident and using it to investigate the extent to which temporary residents responded to more stringent visa conditions by marrying a U.S. citizen. I also contribute to this literature by considering the introduction in 2006 of 20,000 H-1B visas reserved for applicants holding graduate degrees from U.S. institutions as a second treatment, to study the effect of a contraction, as well as an expansion, in the available quota. Disentangling the consequences of these opposing changes is important for two reasons. First, I am interested in the effect the cap drop would have had in a world in which the ADE was not instituted. A weakening of restrictions in 2006 is likely to have mitigated the impact of the drop in 2004, at least for graduate students. Thus, previous literature that groups post-2004 into a single time period likely underestimated the pure effects of the cap-drop, which were experienced during 2004 and 2005 only. 8 Second, it presents an opportunity to study the consequences of a reversal in policy, a negative shock to the supply of high-skilled labor, followed by a positive one shortly afterwards."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "I use the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the related Survey of Doctorate More importantly, the SDR allows me to keep track of each respondent's marital status and four categories of \"citizenship or visa status\": native U.S. citizens, naturalized U.S. citizens, permanent residents (i.e. green card holders), and temporary residents. I keep all individuals employed at the time of survey, who declared being temporary residents at the time of PhD graduation. A critical issue is that the nationality or visa status of the respondent's spouse is not requested as part of the SDR or SED questionnaire. However, it can be identified indirectly from the data. Permanent residents can sponsor their spouses (and other relatives) to get green cards, but they are subject to yearly numerical limitations. Moreover, each country is only allowed a maximum 7% of the number of visas granted each year. This, coupled with past high demand, means that approved petitions for spouses of permanent residents became backlogged, meaning that even if someone's application was approved, they had to wait for a visa became available. From 2001 to 2009 relatives of permanent residents faced wait times of at least 4 years. Citizens of countries with high visa demand (e.g. India and China), would have to wait for over a decade before receiving a green card. Thus, if a person marries a non-citizen, they would have to wait a minimum of four years to receive permanent residency. In contrast, U.S. citizens can sponsor their spouses to become permanent residents immediately after marriage. There is no cap for the total number of these petitions that can be approved each year, and the time between application and approval was generally not longer than a year during the period I consider here. 10 This stark difference in wait times for green cards of spouses of U.S. citizens versus those of permanent residents allows me to identify individuals who married a citizen as someone who: i) was not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident at the time of PhD graduation; ii) was observed getting married in a subsequent survey year; and iii) became a permanent resident one to three years after they got married. 11 I restrict the sample to employed individuals who graduated from 2001 to 2009, and who were observed at least twice in the SDR, as marriage to a citizen cannot be detected for people observed only once. In order to investigate the characteristics of those who marry a citizen, I use a measure of the quality of the Ph.D. program. Ginther et al (2011) found that quality of a biomedical research department at an academic institution can be measured by the amount of National Institutes of Health research dollars received in a given year. I generalize this measure of department quality by using the Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD), 12 to quantify the total expenditures on research and development (R&D) by year, institution, and broad field of degree. I then rank Ph.D. programs by level of expenditure, and group them into five categories of rank. Table 1 contains weighted summary statistics on the sample for graduates from countries without substitute visas and thus bound by the H-1B cap (the treatment group), and those with substitute visas (the control group). Singapore is the only Asian country in the control group, so it is not surprising that the treated are much more likely to be Asian, and less likely to be white or Hispanic than those from countries with alternative visas. These mirror results for the sample used by Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado (2019). Treated PhD graduates are more likely to be married overall, but also more likely to be married to a citizen. They graduate at around the same age and are less likely to work in academic or research jobs. The bottom of Table 1 has the distribution of graduates by funding rank of their PhD institution. 13 It is noteworthy that those from countries bound by the cap are significantly less likely to graduate from institutions ranked in the top 20."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Strategy", "text": "The ideal experiment would compare a situation in which there is no policy intervention, and one in which the cap drops and everything else is held constant. For this reason, I am interested in estimating the effect the cap-drop would have had in a world in which no Advanced Degree Exemption (ADE) was introduced in 2006. In the absence of an ideal experiment, to isolate the immediate effect of the cap-drop I modify the empirical model used in Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado 2019 Namely, I fit the following model: (1) , , , = + + 1 + 2 + 1 ( \u00d7 ) + 2 ( \u00d7 ) where , , , is 1 if Ph.D. graduate from country who was a temporary resident when they graduated in year is married to a citizen in year > , and 0 otherwise. indicates the treatment group. It is 0 for temporary residents born in Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore, and 1 for everyone else. is 1 for cohorts graduating since consider non-labor market-related options for staying legally in the country. But, for the same reason, it is to be expected that these incentives diminished or reversed in 2006 and after. Table   2 compares the sample for these two time periods. Panel A reports the weighted share married to citizens for graduates from treated and control countries, before and after 2004. During 2001-2003 temporary residents from countries bound by the cap were 3.7% less likely to marry a citizen than those not bound by the cap, but this difference is not statistically different from zero. If we looked at 2004-2009 as a single \"post-treatment\" period, we would observe that the shares for graduates from treated and control countries were just as statistically different from each other after the policy came into effect as they were before. We may be led to conclude that a reduction of available visas as severe as the one experienced in 2004 had no significant effect. Panel B shows the same shares, but for three time periods: pre-treatment (2001)(2002)(2003), during the cap-drop (2004)(2005), and after the expansion in 2006. Temporary residents from countries bound by the cap who graduated during the cap-drop were more likely to marry citizens than those not bound by the cap. This resulted in a relative increase of 14.8 percentage points in the share married to citizens. As expected, the expansion in 2006 had the opposite effect, leading to a relative drop in the share married to citizens of 19.5 percentage points. However, these are comparisons of sample means, and so they cannot be interpreted as if comparing outcomes of individuals with similar characteristics, and do not control for changes in factors that may have affected marriage decisions over time. The following section details my strategy to get a better difference-in-differences estimate of the causal effect that these changes to the H-1B cap had on the probability of high-skilled temporary residents marrying a U.S. citizen.  The results in Table 3 suggest that the Advanced Degree Exemption effectively canceled out the initial effect the cap-drop had on the likelihood of Ph.D. graduates marrying citizens."}, {"section_title": "One possible explanation is that the cap-drop coupled with the ADE expansion in 2006 gave rise", "text": "to what Desch\u00eanes and Moretti (2009) call a \"harvesting effect\"; a situation in which a sudden, extreme event today precipitates an outcome for people already inclined to it and likely to experience it regardless. This \"displaces\" people who would have experienced the outcome tomorrow to experiencing it today, and results in a corresponding reduction in occurrences tomorrow such that the total number of occurrences over both periods is not affected. 14 Applied to the setting in this paper, sudden visa restrictions may have incentivized immigrant-withcitizen couples to push their marriage dates forward, resulting in a spike in the relative likelihood to marry citizens during the cap-drop. A redistribution of \"future\" marriages to earlier dates would have mechanically reduced the pool of couples who were still unmarried by the time the ADE was instituted. This, together with a lower incentive for couples to shorten their courtship period thanks to a significant expansion of visa availability, would explain the drop observed after 2006. 15 The results in Table 3 are comparisons of cohorts and has the risk of being driven by unobserved factors unrelated to the H-1B visa but nevertheless affecting the likelihood of marrying a U.S. citizen. I follow robustness checks similar to those in Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado (2019) and report them in Table 4.  Table 4 shows an estimated effect of the cap-drop of 13.9 percentage points after this adjustment. A test of equality of coefficients cannot reject the null hypothesis that this coefficient and the benchmark coefficient from Table 3 2and 3show estimates of the fullest specification from Table 3 first excluding all individuals employed in computer-related occupations, and then for computerrelated occupations only, respectively. The estimated effect of the cap-drop for computer-related occupations is more than twice the benchmark estimate for the whole sample from  a. Theoretical framework Borjas (1987Borjas ( , 1991 was the first to apply Roy's (1951) model to study the self-selection of immigrants. The Roy model posits that, ceteris paribus, an individual will decide to migrate if their expected earnings in the host country ( 1 ) are higher than those in the source country ( 0 ), net of migration costs ( ). 18 For each individual, potential log earnings in either country depend on their level of skills ( ): where is the level of observed skills for each individual, is the rate of return to observable skills in country \u2208 {0,1}, is the minimum earnings attainable by someone with no skills in country , and is a random variable capturing individual-specific productivity shocks resulting from unobserved characteristics (Borjas, Kauppinen, and Poutvaara 2018). The distribution of skills in the source country is given by = + , where \u223c (0, 2 ). Borjas et al. (2018) define \"time equivalent\" costs as = / 0 and the index function where \u0394 = [( 1 \u2212 0 ) + ( 1 \u2212 0 ) \u2212 ] is the difference in earnings for an individual with average skills, net of migration costs. The difference in earnings due to differences in unobserved characteristics is given by = ( 1 \u2212 0 ); where = + for \u2208 {0,1}. A person emigrates if and only if > 0. The probability that someone from the host country emigrates is given by Given that the distribution of the stochastic components of the model are assumed to be Normal, Borjas et al. (2018) derive that migrants will be positively (negatively) selected based on observable skills if the following correlation coefficient is positive (negative) Thus, immigrants are positively (negatively) selected when the rate of return to observable skills is higher (lower) in the host country. Selection based on unobservable skills is determined by the sign of the following correlation: where 01 = ( 0 , 1 ). Thus, immigrants are positively (negatively) selected on unobservable skills when the rate of return to unobservable skills is higher in the host country and if the unobserved characteristics are 'transferable' across countries so that 01 is sufficiently high. 19 This model predicts who wants to migrate to and stay in the host country, but it does not say which immigrants will be more likely to marry a citizen. Previous research shows that having better economic prospects is associated with a higher likelihood of being married for males (Oppenheimer, Kalmijn, and Lim 1997;Musick, Brand, and Davis 2012). For females, college education meant a lower likelihood of marriage for most of the 20 th century, but recent cohorts have behaved in opposite manner: college-educated females are now more likely to marry than those with less education (Goldstein and Kenney 2001;Cherlin 2010;Trimarchi and Van Bavel 2017;Musick, Brand, and Davis 2012;Ginther and Sundstr\u00f6m 2010). To the degree that a degree from a higher-ranked institution signals better education and better economic prospects, graduates from higher-ranked institutions should be expected to be more likely to find a partner that would marry them. Table 5 shows weighted average yearly earnings computed using restricted-use data from the 2010 and 2013 waves of the International Survey of Doctorate Recipients (iSDR). 20 In order to make earnings comparable over time and across countries of residence, earnings were converted to 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)-adjusted dollars. 21 A few things stand out from this table."}, {"section_title": "b. Earnings by Funding Rank of PhD Program", "text": "First, while the average earnings of graduates from programs ranked in the top 50 are always higher in the U.S. (though not necessarily statistically different) than those working abroad, the opposite is almost always true for graduates from programs ranked 51 or above, with the only exception being people who graduated between 2001 and 2003 from programs ranked 100 or above. Individuals graduating from lower-ranked institutions were at best indifferent between working in the U.S. and abroad, with some of them having markedly better outcomes abroad. 20 A sample also drawn from the Survey of Earned Doctorates with the intention of tracking graduates no longer residing in the U.S., and collected for the first time for reference year 2010. 21 I constructed deflators using two time series on Gross Domestic Product by country obtained from the World Bank: These comparisons, however, do not control for known characteristics that may affect the decision to marry, or the fact that by 2010 and 2013, the reference years for the iSDR, those graduating 2001-2003 had more years of post-PhD work experience than those graduating post 2006. In order to take these into account, I regressed log earnings on the same covariates as the fullest specification in Table 3. shows predicted log earnings of PhD graduates residing in their home country and of those residing in some other country abroad, relative to predicted log earnings of foreign PhD graduates working the U.S. As can be seen from this graph, with the exception of those graduating from programs ranked 51 to 100, those working outside of the U.S. receive around 20% lower earnings than those working in the U.S. Table 6 presents the results of estimating the fullest model from Table 3 for "}, {"section_title": "c. The Effect of Visa Restrictions by Funding Rank", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "d. Marriage and return migration costs", "text": "Another way to explain the results in Table 6 is by considering that there are also costs to return migration. If time-equivalent return migration costs are decreasing in skills, then it is possible that only people with very low or very high skills will find it more beneficial to stay in the U.S. Borjas (1987) and Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) show that \"time equivalent\" costs of migration do not play a role in deciding whether to migrate when either these costs are constant or if the costs are uncorrelated with skills. The costs to an individual being sponsored by their potential employer are zero because they are already in the U.S., and their sponsor is required by law to bear the full costs of applying for an employment visa as well as those for sponsoring the employee for a green card. If they were to marry a citizen, however, they may share the costs with their spouse. The costs of marriage licenses vary but are usually fairly low across states. For example, as of this writing, it can be as much as $120 in Delaware for out of state residents 22 , or as low as $25 in Prince George's County. 23 The fees to file for permanent residency are also fixed, but not negligible. 24 Thus, instead of thinking about migration costs, we can consider timeequivalent marriage costs. I follow Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) in assuming that timeequivalent costs are decreasing in ability 22 http://co.kent.de.us/clerk-of-the-peace-office/marriage.aspx. Accessed 6/3/2019. 23 https://princegeorgescourts.org/225/Marriage-License. Accessed 6/3/2019. 24 Of course, wedding ceremonies can be very expensive, but they are not required for civil unions, and thus they are unnecessary for obtaining legal status. but I interpret these as marriage costs instead of immigration costs. I define time-equivalent return migration costs similarly and assume that they are decreasing in skills as well A person prefers staying in the host country if ln 1 \u2212 > ln 0 \u2212 . Figure 3 plots both these curves to reproduce a graph similar to Figure 2 of Chiquiar and Hanson (2005). 25 Contrary to their example, however, the presence of return migration costs means that it is the high-skilled that are positively-selected and the low skilled are negatively-selected. This is because the earnings in the host country are high enough relative to marriage costs for the low skilled that those with skills below are better off staying in the host country. Those with intermediate skills ( < < ) face migrating costs that fall slower than marriage costs and so have higher expected net earnings from going back to their home country, while those with high enough skills face higher net earnings by marrying a citizen and find it better to stay in the host country."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper I investigate the impact of changes in visa restrictions on the likelihood of high-skilled temporary residents marrying a U.S. citizen. Using data from a census of all Ph.D. graduates from U.S. institutions, collected at the time of graduation, together with a survey that follows a subset of them over time, I developed a measure of foreign-born individuals who were married to a citizen. Based on this measure, I obtained a differences-in-differences estimate of the causal effect of the cap-drop in 2004 on the likelihood of Ph.D. graduates marrying a U.S. citizen. I find that high-skilled temporary residents reacted strongly to these policy changes by being more likely to marry citizens when visas became scarce and then reacting in the opposite direction after more visas became available. A central question for public policy is whether immigration policies attract and retain high-quality immigrants. Kato and Sparber (2013) find that the cap-drop in 2004 was associated with a decrease in the quality of undergraduate students, as measured by their SAT scores. This outcome has potential negative impacts for future economic growth, as studying in the U.S. is one of the main channels young foreign nationals use to later join the workforce. I was able to investigate a related question: how did the changes to H-1B visa policies affect the \"quality\" of This research has implications for US immigration policy and joins previous papers in giving evidence of unintended consequences of one specific pair of immigration policies. Previous papers analyzed how agents reacted within the labor market. This paper finds that under stronger employment visa restrictions temporary residents may seek legal means outside of the labor market, in this case marriage to a citizen, to bypass these restrictions and seize job security. Furthermore, even though there are no skill requirements for marrying a U.S. citizen, these policies effectively shifted the skill distribution of those marrying citizens toward the highest skilled, and those in computer-related occupations.
