[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The concept of use of mathematics can be defined as using mathematical concepts, processes and procedures in an appropriate way by associating them with the problem in the case of an unaccustomed problem that the student encounter in a real life or in a school environment. Baki (2018, p.94) explains that the processes of use of mathematics mainly serve two different purposes: to understand and interpret mathematics in itself or to solve the problems encountered in life. He also states that the basic skills needed in the process of use of mathematics are problem solving, reasoning, communication, prediction, making connections and calculating from the mind. Therefore, it can be said that the concept of use of mathematics is closely related to the aforementioned skills and problem-solving processes. Use of mathematics, one of the important skills required in the last century, is at the centre of mathematics teaching activities carried out in schools both in national and international curricula, and the main goal of school mathematics is expressed as the ability of pupils to use mathematics effectively in relation to their lives (NCTM [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics], 2000, p.4; MoNE [Ministry of National Education], 2018, p.11). Besides the above-mentioned importance, international studies show that students in Turkey are below the expected level in relation to use of mathematics in real life. PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) projects can be shown as examples for these studies. PISA is one of the world's largest educational research organized by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), and assesses the competence of 15-year-old students at the end of compulsory education in solving problems they encounter in school and out of school life (OECD, 2016) .\nAccording to the results of PISA exam in 2015, Turkey, could only take place 50th (MoNE, 2015) out of 72 participating countries. TIMSS is a survey research of the IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) to assess the knowledge and the skills gained by students at 4th and 8th grades in mathematics and science. The basic skills of the TIMSS exams focused on are expressed as knowing (35.00%), practice (40.00%) and reasoning (25.00%) and real life scenarios for observing such skills (MoNE, 2016) . Therefore, in TIMSS exams, it can be stated that mainly 40.00% of the students are evaluated for their ability to use mathematics in real life situations. When TIMSS results for students in 4th and 8th grade levels in Turkey are observed, it is seen that they could only take place as 36th and 24th, respectively, among 49 countries participating in the survey (MoNE, 2016) . The results of different studies in literature except for PISA and TIMSS also show that the students in our country perform below the expected levels in subject processes. Although these studies are limited, Yavuz Mumcu (2011 Mumcu ( , 2018 , Yavuz Mumcu and Cans\u0131z Akta\u015f (2016) and \u00d6zgen (2013) can be evaluated within this scope. Yavuz Mumcu (2011 Mumcu ( , 2016 , in her studies, investigated the twelfth grade students' and the undergraduate students' skills of using mathematics respectively. It was seen that the majority of the students in the mentioned studies could not use this skill in an adequate level for the solution of real life problems. In addition, Yavuz Mumcu (2018) carried out a study with the students (pre-service teachers) who were in the final year of mathematics department and were enrolled in the pedagogical formation program. As a result of this study, it was stated that pre-service teachers see mathematics as an inevitable tool for real life, but had difficulty in relating mathematics they had learned in schools with real-life. Regarding the subject, \u00d6zgen (2013) examined teacher candidates' ability to associate mathematics with daily life in terms of non-routine problems and revealed that teacher candidates showed very low performance in these processes. Thus, it can be stated that students and teacher candidates in Turkey have some difficulties in connecting mathematics with their lives and using it in necessary situations. Koca, \u015een and \u0130lhan (2002) evaluated the reasons of this situation and determined that the use of daily life situations in mathematics classes is below the average level in our country compared to other countries. Civelek, Meder, T\u00fczen and Aycan (2003) conducted a research about the problems encountered in mathematics teaching in our country and found that students did not know how to use mathematics in daily life and saw mathematics just as a lesson. Ubuz (2002) states that mathematics teachers and candidates feel a lack of a course on the use of mathematics in daily life in relation to high 699 school curricula. Therefore, depending on the results of these studies, it can be said that mathematics is not sufficiently integrated in teaching activities in schools and this is affecting students' performance of using mathematics negatively. Students who do not have enough knowledge about the fields and forms of using mathematics in real life from schools have difficulty in relating it with their lives and they may see it as an unnecessary course. This situation may cause them to develop negative attitudes and beliefs towards it and lead them to demonstrate low academic performance. However, studies show that there is a significant relationship between attitudes and beliefs towards mathematics and academic performance (Biggs & Tang, 2011; Carter & Norwood, 1997; Duman, 2006; Frank, 1990; Ma, 1997; Peker& Mirasyedio\u011flu, 2003; \u015eent\u00fcrk, 2010; Trigwell & Prosser, 1991; UnderhilI, 1988; Yenilmez & \u00d6zbey, 2006 ).\nScientific studies demonstrate that especially students in Turkey who do not have enough skills to relate mathematics with real life and using it correspondingly also have a general negative attitude and beliefs towards mathematics in affective manner: According to the results of PISA (2012) which is the most comprehensive study on the subject, 38.30% of students in Turkey believe that they will fail in math whether or not they study. In the study, 67.70% of the students stated that they were worried about their math lessons would be difficult and 69.40% expressed that they were worried about taking a low grade in math lessons. According to the same research results, most of the students have moderate level of anxiety and concern about math lessons (MoNE, 2015) . Studies (Civelek, 2003; cited in G\u00fclten, Ilgar & G\u00fclten, 2009; Paksu, 2008; Yavuz Mumcu, 2018) conducted on the beliefs of teachers, prospective teachers and students in Turkey towards mathematics reveals that teachers do not agree with the fact that mathematics is a tool that makes life easier. Also, prospective teachers believe that mathematics is only used as four operations in daily life and it is not used much in life apart from this, and students see mathematics only as a lesson which is necessary for them to get into a university in matriculation exam. At this point, it is necessary that this negative table of Turkey should be immediately improved in terms of equipping students with the necessary skills in mathematical knowledge. It is necessary for today's prospective teachers who will train the students of the future to understand mathematics in relation to real life and appreciate it in this context, to have a nontraditional perspective on teaching mathematics and to use mathematics as an effective tool in solving real life problems. It is thought that the \"use of mathematics\" course, which is designed for all these purposes, will significantly affect the attitudes and the beliefs of the prospective teachers towards mathematics positively."}, {"section_title": "The Aim of the Study", "text": "The aim of this study is to examine the effect of use of mathematics course designed as an elective course on the prospective teachers' attitudes towards mathematics and their beliefs on the nature, teaching and learning of mathematics and to explore the prospective teachers' opinions about the subject course.

Creswell (2012) describes a mixed embedded design as a research design where quantitative and qualitative data are collected simultaneously or sequentially, and where one set of data plays a supporting role. The second data set is usually collected to support the previous data set. Embedded experimental design was chosen for the present study from two types of embedded designs. In this design, qualitative data is embedded in an experimental method (real or quasi-experimental). Accordingly, quantitative data obtained in an experimental environment are supported by qualitative data (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011) .\nThe quantitative data of this study were obtained by using one group pre-test-post-test model among pre-trial experimental designs in order to observe the effects of using mathematics course on the attitudes and beliefs of pre-service teachers about mathematics (Ba\u015ft\u00fcrk, 2009) .

In determining the study group, criterion sampling method was used among the purposeful sampling methods (Patton, 1990) . The basic understanding of the criterion sampling method is the study of all situations that meet a set of predetermined criteria. The mentioned criterion or criteria can be created by the researcher or a previously prepared criterion list can be used. The criteria in this study is that the prospective teachers participating in the research have taken the course of use of mathematics. 35 (87.50%) of the prospective teachers in the study group are females and 5 (12.50%) of them are males. According to grade point average variable, 16 (40.00%) of the students' grade point average is between 3.00 and 4.00, 24 (60.00%) of the students' grade point average is between 2.00 and 2.99.

The SOF consists of an open-ended question as Express your general thoughts on what kind of contributions did the use of mathematics course have on you as a prospective teacher. Prospective teachers' grade point averages (GPA) were provided from the unit they were studying."}, {"section_title": "Mathematical Attitude Scale:", "text": "Developed by Duatepe and \u00c7ilesiz (1999) , the 5-point Likert type MAS consists of 38 items and four sub-dimensions in total. The interest/favour sub-dimension consists of 14 items, the fear/trust sub-dimension 8, the occupation and materiality sub-dimension 8 and the enjoyment sub-dimension consists of 8 items. The highest score that can be taken from the scale is 190 (38x5) and the lowest score is 38 (38x1). The highest scores that can be taken from the sub-dimensions are 70 (14x5) and 40 (8x5) and the lowest scores are 14 (14x1), and 8 (8x1), respectively. If the points that can be taken from the scale and its sub-dimensions are shown on a chart, it is seen that the scale total score average is 114 points and the sub-dimensions are 42 and 24 respectively (Figure 1 ). Beliefs Scale on the Nature, Teaching and Learning of Mathematics: The 5 point Likert type BSM developed by Kayan, Haser and Bostan (2013) is composed of 26 items and deals with the beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning in two sub-dimensions as traditional beliefs and constructivist beliefs. There are 6 items in the dimension of traditional beliefs and 20 items in the constructivist beliefs. The highest score that can be taken from the scale is 130 (26x5) and the lowest score is 26 (26x1). According to this, the highest score that can be taken from the scale in the traditional beliefs is 30 (6x5) and the lowest score is 6 (6x1). In constructivist beliefs, the highest score that can be taken from the scale is 100 (20x5) and the lowest score is 20 (20x1). If the points that can be taken from the scale and its sub-dimensions are shown on a table, it is seen that the average scale score of the traditional beliefs subscale is 18 and that of the constructivist beliefs dimension is 60 (Figure 2 ). The results on the reliability of the data collection tools used in the study are given in Table 1 . The reliability coefficients obtained in this study and the reliability values obtained in the original forms of the scales are given below. The reliability of scales was determined by calculating item-total score correlation coefficients and Cronbach (\u03b1) values for MAS and BSM respectively in original studies. For this study, Cronbach (\u03b1) values were used to determine the reliability of MAS and BSM. According to the data in Table 1 , it was accepted that the data obtained from the scales were quite reliable (Kay\u0131\u015f, 2018) ."}, {"section_title": "Process", "text": "Use of mathematics is an elective course taken by the prospective teachers in the study group 3 hours a week. Within the scope of this course, prospective teachers were divided into groups of four. Each group was asked to solve two of the daily life problems that the lecturer previously identified, and to pose similar problems themselves. According to this, the group that was responsible for each week primarily solved the problems they already handed out to the other prospective teachers in the class by connecting the situations with real life. The reason why the problems to be solved was distributed to the 702 prospective teachers was to give the opportunity to create their own solutions for the problems in question. The problematic situations that covered each week were animated by the students in the classroom and for the problems that could not be animated in the classroom were introduced to the students with videos where the prospective teachers animated the problem in a similar real life context. Apart from this, the abstract and complex situations in the problems were tried to be made as concrete as possible by the prospective teachers, and different materials and methods were used for this. After solving the problems, class members shared their different solutions with the group members, and the effectiveness of different solutions for the problem situation was discussed in the class. This process constituted the first part of the course. In the second part of the course, the class members were asked to solve the questions which were posed by the group members and were similar to the problems they had solved. These solutions were used as one of the student success evaluation methods for the course by the lecturer giving the course. PISA mathematics questions and Yavuz Mumcu (2011 Mumcu ( , 2016 studies were used for the problems solved within the scope of the course. One of the problem situations covered in the course is given below.\nThe above real life problem (Figure 3 ) is solved by the group members in the course of use of mathematics by taking advantage of the algebraic structure that Euler put forth about the nets formed by the nodes connected to each other on the plane. Accordingly, whether or not it is possible to come back to starting point on the condition of using every street only once in the figure above could be determined. The problem posed by the group members and an example solution of one of this problem is shown in the Figure 4 .\nWithin the scope of the study, data collection tools were applied as pre-test to the prospective teachers before taking the use of mathematics course in the first semester of 2017-2018 academic year. During the course of 14 weeks, all the prospective teachers were tried to ensure that they attended classes every week. At the end of the semester, the same data collection tools were applied as a posttest to try to find out whether or not there was a significant difference in the prospective teachers' attitudes towards mathematics and beliefs in teaching and learning of mathematics."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "SPSS 24.0 program was used in the analysis of data obtained from the study. In order to compare the pre-test and post-test results, whether the data obtained from the MAS and the BSM showed a normal distribution was first examined. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results showed that the results of the MAS and BSM data were distributed normally (p> .05). In the comparison of pre-test and post-test results of prospective teachers, dependent samples t-test were used. In addition, effect size (\u03b7 2 ) values were calculated so that the effect on the dependent variable of the implemented applications could be interpreted by making it more specific (B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zt\u00fcrk, 2008, p.69) . In interpreting the effect size values, .01, .06 and .14 were taken as reference points and were defined as small, medium and large, respectively (Gren, Salkind & Akey, 2000, p.159; K\u00f6kl\u00fc, B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zt\u00fcrk & B\u00f6keo\u011flu, 2006, pp.171-172) .\nAnalyses of the data obtained from the SOF were done using a content analysis technique that helped to examine written or visual documents in depth (Patton, 2002) . In this process, teacher candidates' answers were coded as C1, C2, and so on. It was decided that the answers could be gathered under two different themes: Personal Contributions and Professional Contributions, using the principles of Miles and Huberman (1984, p.23) to reduce the data, select important parts of raw data, focus on specific points, simplify, summarize and to transform. After deciding on the themes, the answers under the same theme were re-analysed and classified under different categories. Accordingly, responses under the theme of Individual Contributions were collected under 5 different categories as Contributions to The Relationship of Mathematics with Life, Contributions to the Problem Solving Skills, Contributions to the Mathematical Thinking Skills, Contributions to the Perception of Mathematics and Contributions to Self-efficacy Perception. Responses under the theme of Professional Contributions were grouped under two different categories: Pedagogical Contributions and Affective Contributions. While deciding on the names of the categories, more ideas of the faculty members, who are experts in the field of mathematics education, were used. Following this step, for deciding on the themes and categories of the answers, the percentage of consensus was calculated for the ideas of the three faculty members. For this, Miles and Huberman (1994) formula that the Percentage of Agreement = (Agreement) / (Agreement + Disagreement) was used. In this process, the situations where the same code was used by the faculty members were accepted as agreement, and the cases including different codes were accepted as disagreement. Then, the codings of the researchers were compared. As a result of the calculations, the average of the calculated percentages for the different categories in the study was calculated as .89. As this value is over .70 (Miles & Huberman, 1994) , it was accepted to be reliable. After this process, the answers of the prospective teachers were collected under certain themes and categories and interpreted with frequency (f) and total frequency (tf) values. Huberman and Miles (1994) recommend the use of frequency values in the interpretation of data to allow systematic approaches to be applied to qualitative data. Here, frequency represents the frequency of the expressions used by prospective teachers and total frequency represents the total frequency of the expressions in each category. Since there are a few possible cases in which a single teacher may use several different expressions, the expressions used by the prospective teachers were interpreted by expressing only the frequency values."}, {"section_title": "Findings Findings Obtained for the First Sub-Problem", "text": "The t test results of the dependent groups used to compare the scores obtained from MAS are given in Table 2 . According to data in Table 2 , it is seen that there is a statistically significant difference in the total attitude scores of the prospective teachers for mathematics in favour of the post-test (t 39 = -2.12, p<.05). When the subscale factors of MAS were taken into account, it was found that there was an increase in most of the sub-factor scores and the increase in sub-factor scores of fear / confidence (t 39 = -2.35, p <.05) and enjoyment (t 39 = -3.73, p <.05) is significant. Based on this evidence, it can be said that the course of use of mathematics had a significant and positive influence on the attitudes of prospective teachers towards mathematics. As a result of the analyses carried out for the effect size (\u03b72), the values are \u03b72 = .10 across the scale; \u03b72 = .12 in fear/confidence dimension; \u03b72 = .00 in the dimension of occupation/materiality and \u03b72 = .26 in the enjoyment dimension. Therefore, it can be said that the use of mathematics course had a moderate effect on students' general attitudes towards mathematics and their attitudes on the dimension of interest/favour, however it highly affected their attitudes in fear/confidence and enjoyment dimensions.\nIn addition, it was observed that the prospective teachers' arithmetic average (pre-test x=150.87 and post-test x=158.12) scores for the general MAS was higher than the general average of the scale (114). Similarly, average scale scores (pre-test x=52.90 and post-test x=55.07) calculated in Interest/Favour sub-dimension from the related sub-dimension average score (42), average scale scores (pre-test x=34.90 and post-test x=37.45) calculated in Fear/Confidence sub-dimension from the related sub-704 dimension average score (24), average scale scores (pre-test x=35.10 and post-test x=35.00) calculated in Occupation/Materiality sub-dimension from the related sub-dimension average score (24), average scale scores (pre-test x=27.97 and post-test x=30.60) calculated in Enjoyment sub-dimension from the related sub-dimension average score (24) was determined to be higher. It can be said that the attitudes of the prospective teachers towards mathematics for both pre-test and post-test were higher than the average values of the scale and in its subscales. According to data in Table 3 , it is observed that there are significant differences in prospective teachers' traditional (t 39 = 3.10 p<.05) and constructivist beliefs (t 39 = -5.15, p<.05) towards math. The use of mathematics course seems to have a significant effect in favour of pre-test in the traditional beliefs of candidates, and in favour of post-test in constructivist beliefs. Therefore, it can be said that the use of mathematics course has a positive and significant effect on the constructivist beliefs of prospective teachers towards mathematics and negative on traditional beliefs. As a result of the analysis of the effect size (\u03b72), the mentioned values were calculated as \u03b72 = .19 in the traditional beliefs dimension; and \u03b72 = .40 in the constructivist beliefs dimension. Therefore, it can be said that the use of mathematics course has a high effect on reducing traditional beliefs and increasing constructivist beliefs on the nature, teaching and learning of mathematics of prospective teachers.\nIt is also seen that the pre-test (20.70) and post-test (18.32) average scores of prospective teachers in the traditional beliefs subscale of BSM are higher than the average score scale (18) of the related subscale. Similarly, it is seen that pre-test (75.75) and post-test (86.75) average scores of prospective teachers in constructivist beliefs subscale of BSM are higher than average scale score (60) of the related subscale. This can be interpreted as the fact that prospective teachers are generally more likely to have constructivist beliefs than traditional beliefs."}, {"section_title": "Findings Obtained for the Second Sub-Problem", "text": "The data in Table 4 were obtained as a result of the analyses conducted in order to observe whether the course of use of mathematics had a significant effect on the prospective teachers' attitude scores towards mathematics according to the variable of grade point average.\nAccording to the data given in Table 4 , it is observed that there are different attitude scores of the groups according to the variable (GPA) and these differences are in favour of the final test, but they are not significant (t 23 = -1.77, p>.05; t 15 = -1.27, p>.05). In the case of subscales of MAS, there are insignificant differences in attitude scores of both groups in favour of pre-test in the occupation/materiality sub-dimension (t 23 = .10, p>.05; t 15 =.13, p>.05). Apart from this, there are significant differences in the attitude scores (t 15 = -2.56, p<.05) in the fear/confidence subscale of the prospective teachers whose grade point average is between 3.00 and 4.00 and in the enjoyment subscale of prospective teachers whose grade point average are between 2.00 and 2.99 (t 23 = -3.49, p<.05). Therefore, it was found out that the use of mathematics course has a positive effect on prospective teachers' attitudes in general and in addition to this it can be said that according to (GPA) variable, the prospective teachers in the upper group have more confidence in mathematics after the course and the prospective teachers in the lower group enjoy mathematics more after the course.\nThe data in Table 5 were obtained on the basis of the analyses conducted to examine the effect of the use of mathematics course on the prospective teachers' beliefs about mathematics and teaching and learning of mathematics according to the grade point average variable. When the data in Table 5 are examined, it can be seen that the average score values for traditional beliefs differ favourably for the pre-test, and the average score values for constructivist beliefs differ for the post-test for all groups that are formed according to the grade point average variable. As a result of the analyses made on the significance of the mentioned difference, it is seen that the belief scores of the prospective teachers who are in both groups (t 15 = -4.02, p<.05; t 23 = -3.58, p<.05) in the dimension of constructivist beliefs and prospective teachers whose (GPA) range between 3.00 and 4.00 (t 15 = 3.45, p<.05) in the traditional beliefs subscale differ significantly. Therefore, the use of mathematics course is found to have a significant positive effect on the constructivist beliefs about the nature, teaching and learning of the mathematics for both groups, and it has a significant negative effect on the traditional beliefs of prospective teachers with a grade point average of 3.00-4.00."}, {"section_title": "Findings Obtained for the Third Sub-Problem", "text": "Prospective teachers in the study used the expressions in Table 6 to state the contributions of use of mathematics course to themselves.\nExamining the findings in Table 6 , it is seen that the prospective teachers expressed that there were many contributions of the use of mathematics course in both their individual and professional sense.

In this direction, it was tried to develop the mathematical skills of prospective teachers in the context of problem solving as well as to see the usage areas of mathematics in their lives and to participate in these processes, with the activities performed within the scope of the course. It is predicted that with the development of mathematical skills prospective teachers' attitudes towards mathematics and their self-efficacy beliefs, and with different experiences their perceptions and perceives will change positively since in different studies in the literature (Chan, 2008; Dunlop, 2001; Tanner & Jones, 2002) it is stated that real life problems will improve the mathematical thinking skills of the students, and in these processes the students will see the role of mathematics in real life and give importance to mathematics.\nIt was observed that in this study conducted to observe the effects of use of mathematics course on the point of views, attitudes and beliefs of prospective teachers, the main aims were mostly achieved. It was found that the prospective teachers who took the use of mathematics course differed significantly and positively in their attitudes towards mathematics, and that prospective teachers enjoyed mathematics more after the course and more confidence in themselves by defeating their fears. This situation was supported with the data obtained from SOF. The concept of attitude is particularly important when it comes to mathematics education, as many researchers suggest that students' attitudes towards mathematics influence their mathematical success (Abebe, 2015; Bloom, 2012; Lim & Chapman, 2015; \u00d6l\u00e7\u00fco\u011flu & \u00c7etin, 2016) . Reyes (1984) suggests that developing a positive attitude towards mathematics is one of the most important goals of mathematics education. Different studies (Fox & Tobin, 1988; Kal, 2013 , Lamb & Dan\u0131els, 1992 Sar\u0131ta\u015f, 2002; Verschaffel, de Corte, Lasure, Van Vaerenbergh, Boagerts, & Ratincky, 1999; Y\u0131ld\u0131z, 1999) in literature related to the result obtained from this study mention about the positive impact of real life problems on attitudes towards mathematics. Therefore, it can be said that the results obtained from this study are in parallel with the literature. Different studies in the literature (Blumenfeld, Soloway, & Marx, 1991; Pajares & Miller, 1997) state that real life problems presented in the school will improve the self-efficacy belief levels of the students. In this study, there is no data collection tool to measure self-efficacy beliefs, but the data obtained from the SOF applied to the prospective teachers and the fear/confidence subscale of the MAS can be evaluated in this context. After the use of mathematics course, it was observed that prospective teachers had more confidence in mathematics and problem solving. According to the SOF data, it was also seen that some prospective teachers expressed that they also developed their self-confidence regarding the teaching profession. These results show similarities to the results of different studies in the literature. Mason and Scrivani (2004) suggest that learning environments that encounter nontraditional and open-ended questions have a positive effect on students' beliefs about themselves in mathematics. Diggs (1999) suggests that students are more confident in problem solving when they encounter real-life problems, and Umay (1996) notes that mathematics education approach which correlates it with real life from the first day of the education is of great importance in reducing the fear of mathematics. Therefore, it can be said that the results obtained from the study correspond with the studies in the field.\nThis study also showed that the use of mathematics course made prospective teachers to deviate from traditional beliefs and gain more constructive beliefs about mathematics and teaching mathematics. This result was also supported by the data obtained from the SOF. The expressions used in terms of the course by prospective teachers such as `I learned to teach my students mathematics with an approach based on real life, problem solving and mathematical thinking, I learned that teaching mathematics by relating to real life instead of memorizing it helps more me to understand the subject (G11)` support the findings obtained from SOF scale. Studies with similar findings include Higgins (1997), Pierce and Stacey (2006) , Ronis (2001) , Mason and Scrivani (2004) and Korkmaz (2010) . In these studies, it is stated that real life problems positively affect students' beliefs about mathematics and that students discover the answer of why they learn mathematics and realize the importance of mathematics in everyday life.\nThe changing beliefs of prospective teachers about mathematics teaching can be explained in relation to the teaching processes of the course apart from the activities. At the end of the activities carried out in the course, discussions were carried out with the prospective teachers about how the supportive practices in the classrooms could be done by emphasizing the relations of mathematics with real life and some general results were presented. Thus, changes in the beliefs of the prospective teachers about mathematics and problem-based teaching can be related to the situation in question. These results obtained from the study in this context are very important in terms of enhancing the quality of learning environments in which future prospective teachers will be formed. Traditional teacher-centred teaching methods in math classes will leave its place to individual learning, learning by exploring, problem solving and context-based learning by the prospective teachers who adopt constructivist teaching instead of traditional beliefs about mathematics and teaching mathematics and this situation undoubtedly, will provide having individuals who learn mathematics more sensibly and permanently. These students will approach mathematics with a different point of view and will not have too much difficulty in using it in their lives.\nAs a result of the analyses carried out to observe the effect of the use of mathematics course on different groups formed according to the grade point average variable, it was observed that the effect on the attitudes and beliefs of the prospective teachers with different academic achievement in general did not differentiate. One of the special cases out of this situation is that the confidence of the prospective teachers in the upper group in terms of academic achievement towards mathematics increased significantly more than the other group. The reason could be that the problem solving and creating activities carried out in the use of mathematics course helped to develop more of the mathematical thinking skills of the prospective teachers in this group or that these prospective teachers were more aware of this development. In different studies (Case, Harris & Graham, 1992; Deseote & Roeyers, 2002; Kruger & Dunning, 1999) , it is stated that there is a positive relationship between academic achievement and cognitive awareness and regulatory skills. Another special cases related to the results of the study is that the prospective teachers in the lower group significantly get more enjoyment from mathematics than the other group and the traditional beliefs about mathematics in the upper group decreased significantly as compared to the other group. It may be interpreted that prospective teachers, whose mathematics success is above a certain level, use constructivist beliefs 710 instead of traditional beliefs on mathematics. This could also imply that they benefited and induced more in a pedagogical sense from the course.\nAnother result obtained in this study stands out in the response of prospective teachers in SOF. One of the most frequently used expressions by prospective teachers for the use of mathematics course was that it helped to relate mathematics to real life. Today it is possible to find many studies on the importance and necessity of connecting mathematics with real life in the literature (Altun, 2008; Baki, 2008; Ceylan, T\u00fcrn\u00fckl\u00fc & Moral\u0131, 2000; Driscoll, 1984; Durmu\u015f & Karak\u0131r\u0131k, 2006; Erdem, 2011; Freudenthal, 1973; G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk, 2013; Hoerr, 1996; Inoue, 2008; MoNE, 2009; \u00d6zgen, 2013; Schliemann & Carraher, 2002; Umay, 1996; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, 2011) . Apart from these, Schliemann and Carraher (2002) consider relating mathematics to real life as an essential condition for an effective curriculum, Umay (1996) says that routine and isolated learning environments prevents students from reaching the desired level of success, and more importantly, leads to the development of prejudiced individuals against mathematics. Given the abstract nature of mathematics in particular, it becomes compulsory to associate mathematics with real life since students can make meaning only by relating abstract representations of mathematics with real life (Erdem, 2015) . In this context, it is necessary to design mathematics teaching environments in this direction and in relation to real life. The environments designed in this way will contribute to a more comfortable and more meaningful learning of mathematics for students.\nAnother important result obtained from the SOF used as a data collection tool in the study was related to problem solving and mathematical thinking skills. Prospective teachers most frequently stated that the use of mathematics course improved their problem-solving and mathematical thinking skills. This is very important in terms of educating qualified prospective teachers. Problem solving is now considered to be the most important cognitive activity (Jonassen, 2000) , and problem solving process enhances development of many skills such as using mathematical knowledge, hypothesizing and testing, controlling/verifying the accuracy of the result obtained, critical thinking, producing new solution ways, inductive/deductive thinking, abstraction and persuasion (MEB, 2013) . Hence, it was found that the use of mathematics course had different positive effects besides the hypotheses developed for the study regarding prospective teachers.\nThe attitudes and beliefs of the prospective teachers who are unaware of the relation of mathematics to real life will undoubtedly affect their learning environments negatively and it will cause them to educate students who do not have sufficient knowledge and skill to relate mathematics with real life. Therefore, it is very important to develop the knowledge and skills of prospective teachers in order to train students who have succeeded in relating mathematics learned in school with daily life. In this context, it is suggested to add new and different courses for relating mathematics with real life in teacher training programs as elective courses. In these courses, providing knowledge and skills for prospective teachers can be achieved in issues such as the use of mathematics and skills, mathematical practices, mathematical modelling and model eliciting activities, mathematical literacy and its place in the curriculum.\nThis study was developed in relation to an elective course in which prospective teachers learn how and where to use mathematics in life situations, how to develop mathematical skills in related processes, and how to relate mathematics to real life. Although the outputs of the course are very important in the context of cognitive and affective characteristics of the prospective teachers, this study is only limited to attitudes and beliefs of affective traits. Therefore, in future studies could focus on this subject by observing the effects of similar courses which are planned to be included in undergraduate curriculum, and the obtained results can be examined focusing on cognitive learning such as relational understanding and operational understanding. This study is limited to an application period of 14 weeks and 40 prospective teachers. In different studies on the subject, the effects of different types of real life oriented practices on attitudes and beliefs towards mathematics can be investigated. In addition, the number of national studies on using mathematics is quite limited. In this context, it is thought that the studies to be carried out on the subject will contribute to the literature.."}, {"section_title": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e S\u00fcr\u00fcm Giri\u015f", "text": "Matemati\u011fi kullanma kavram\u0131; \u00f6\u011frencinin ger\u00e7ek ya\u015famda veya okul ortam\u0131nda kar\u015f\u0131la\u015ft\u0131\u011f\u0131, daha \u00f6nceden al\u0131\u015f\u0131k olmad\u0131\u011f\u0131 t\u00fcrden problem durumlar\u0131nda; matematiksel kavram, i\u015flem ve prosed\u00fcrleri, problemle ili\u015fkilendirerek uygun bi\u00e7imde kullanma s\u00fcreci olarak tan\u0131mlanabilir.
