Adapted rank-based tests of discrimination reveal that the favorable teacher-reported relationship with students is not prompted by teachers favoring their own kind or discriminating against opposite-race students. I show that these estimates are driven by minority students reacting positively when they have a minority teacher but adversely once assigned to a white teacher, which is consistent with the role model effect.

The test score gap formed in primary school continues to middle and secondary education (Fryer and Levitt 2006) , turning into divergent postsecondary outcomes (Arcidiacono et al. 2012 ) and lifetime earnings (Chetty et al. 2014b ). Closing these minority-white achievement gaps is a potentially important factor in creating social equality. One debated policy recommendation is to take into account the classroom dynamics between students and teachers to adjust the achievement gap. Particularly, increasing the representation of minority teachers at all levels of the education system could probably raise academic outcomes for minority students (see, for example, Joint Center for Political Studies 1989; National Commission on Teaching and America's Future 1996; Clewell and Villegas 1998).\nThe U.S. teacher workforce remains quite racially homogeneous despite the more diverse student body. In the 2011-2012 academic year, 82 percent of the teacher workforce in K-12 public schools consisted of white teachers while 51 percent of students were white. Black and Hispanic students, respectively, accounted for 16 and 24 percent of the student body whereas the fraction of black and Hispanic teachers was 7 and 8 percent (U.S. Department of Education 2016). The lack of minority teachers is likely to impose a number of disadvantages on minority students, the population of which is projected to increase.\n1 Disadvantages include restricted exposure to teachers of similar cultures, the lack of role models, or even the possibility of discrimination against minority students.\nIn this paper, I present the first empirical evidence of the link between the classroom racial/ethnic interaction and teacher-perceived relationship with students and teacher evaluations of student noncognitive development in the early stage of the child's education.\nI test whether a minority student could have a more positive relationship with his/her teacher, develop better noncognitive, and cognitive skills if he/she is assigned to a minority teacher. 2 This is an important question since teacher-student relationship, especially in early years, could potentially affect students' current learning motivation, long-term behaviors and Besides showing the role of teacher race in the teacher-student relationship scale, this paper disentangles the mechanism behind the racial/ethnic interaction effect.\nParticularly, I implement the adapted rank-based test of discrimination of Anwar and Fang (2006) to test for any trace of taste-based discrimination from the teacher side. This is the first paper to conduct the test of discrimination in the context of elementary school education.\nThis paper is related to the literature of exploring the impact of same-race/ same-gender teachers on students' outcomes. A general consensus is the positive effect of such racial/gender interactions in the classroom on students' achievement. shows how female teachers could improve noncognitive outcomes among female students. The racial interaction between students and teachers has been documented to generate considerable gains among primary school children (Dee 2004 ), middle and high school students (Egalite et al. 2015) in terms of test scores, and among college students with regards to course taking, course grades, retention status, degree obtainment (Fairlie et al. 2014 , Lusher et al. 2018 ). Dee (2005) which examines how the racial dynamics influences teacher perception of student performance (frequency of being disruptive, inattentive, and doing homework)\nis the closest work to this paper. Dee (2005) however, could not disentangle the source of the racial interaction effect -whether the effect stems from the role-model effect (student behavior change) or from teacher bias.\nIn terms of methodology, I employ a model integrating both the student and the teacher fixed effects to minimize omitted variable bias. The incorporation of two levels of fixed effects can rule out systematic differences among students matched to different teachers regardless of their racial/ethnic background, and at the same time eliminates the effect of disparate teacher quality and/or classroom-specific shocks. I provide evidence against differential sorting from a falsification test which explores the \"influence\" of racial/ethnic interactions with teachers during the second-grade year on students' outcomes in kindergarten.\nI detect positive impacts of the racial/ethnic interaction on the teacher-student relationship.\nSpecifically, minority students are likely to have a closer and more positive relationship with the classroom teacher than white students (by 0.288 and 0.323 standard deviations of the closeness and positiveness scores) if the teacher has a minority status. There is no differential impact on teacher evaluations of student noncognitive skills nor student cognitive ability.\nI show further that effects on the teacher-student relationship are not driven by teachers favoring their own kind or discriminating against opposite-race students, but are prompted by minority students exhibiting better manners when they are matched with minority teachers.\nThere is also evidence that white students do not behave differently in either a minority or a white taught class.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the data; section 3 presents the estimation strategy. Main results and the falsification test are respectively reported in section 4 and section 5. Section 6 discusses mechanisms and tests of discrimination.\nSection 7 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview and variables", "text": "The analysis is based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 (ECLS-K:2011). This U.S. based dataset, drawn from many sources such as parent interviews, teacher/school administrator questionnaires, and directly administered assessment tests, consists of a nationally representative sample of children from kindergarten through elementary classes. The data were collected from the spring 2011 (when the majority of children were in kindergarten) to the spring 2013 (when most of them were in second grade).\nThe data contain both teachers' responses about their perceived relationship with the student and teacher subjective evaluations of the student's learning behaviors and academic ability. I respectively compute z-scores for each of the 7 underlying items for Closeness, each of the 8 underlying items for Conflict, take simple average of the z-scores and re-standardize the averages across kindergarten and second-grade years.\nMeasures of the child's learning behaviors are constructed from teacher evaluations of each of the student, taken from the teacher questionnaire. To assess student's learning behaviors, teachers were required to respond to 7 individual questions, phrased \"For the set of items below, please think about this child's behavior during the past month or two. Decide how often the child demonstrates the behavior described\". The final set of outcomes is student cognitive ability, captured by direct assessment tests in math and reading, assessments in executive functions (defined as \"interdependent processes that work together to regulate and orchestrate cognition, emotion, and behavior and that help a child to learn in the classroom.\", Tourangeau et al. 2017 ) and teacher's evaluation of each student's math and reading skill. Teachers were asked to respond to the following question \"How would you rate this child's academic skills in each of the following area, compared to other children of the same grade level\", on a scale of 1 -far below average, 2 -below average, 3 -average, 4 -above average, 5 -far above average. \"Each of the following area\" refers to math and reading separately. All assessments and evaluations were taken from the spring semester of each year."}, {"section_title": "Sample restrictions and summary statistics", "text": "The main explanatory variable of interest in this paper is the racial/ethnic match between students and teachers, therefore, I only keep observations with non-missing race/ethnicity information. I limit the analysis to white -black -Hispanic students and teachers, the three main racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. I only keep students who are in the sample during both kindergarten and the second-grade years. I focus on the kindergarten and second-grade year due to the potential threat of confounding factors during the first grade. Specifically, teacherstudent racial/ethnic interactions in the first grade still produces a relatively large \"influence\" on the teacher-rated teacher-student relationship scale during kindergarten. Although the \"effect\" is statistically insignificant, its magnitude is quite large. Details are provided in Appendix A. 9 These restrictions result in 9040 students and 6410 teachers, from a total of 1510 schools. 10 Also included in panel C is the indirect assessment of student cognitive abilityteacher subjective ratings of student math and reading skills.\nAs shown in panel D, I break down the sample of students and teachers their by race/ethnicity.\nThe majority of students are white (60 %) while the share of Hispanic and black students is 27 % and 13 % respectively. Looking at teachers, white teachers dominate the sample (84 %), minority teachers who are Hispanic and black only take up 11 % and 5 % respectively.\nThe racial component of teachers in my sample is close to the national share of each group in the K-12 teacher workforce. 11 It is evident from panel E that despite the more diverse student body, the teacher workforce remains quite racially homogeneous."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Methodology", "text": "To explore the effect of teacher race/ethnicity on the teacher-student relationship, student noncognitive and cognitive outcomes, I use the following regression model:\nwhere y ijt is the outcome for student i of teacher j in year (grade) t. teacher fixed effects, and ijt is the error term. This specification can overcome many threats to internal validity. Particularly, the inclusion of student fixed effects is intended to eliminate the possibility that students in a minority-taught class are systematically different from those in a white-taught class, regardless of the student's racial background. The presence of teacher fixed effects guards against the probability that students are assigned to teachers who have different teaching styles, evaluation standards, qualifications, etc. If there is a minority gap that exists in all classes irrespective of teacher characteristics, it is controlled for by student fixed effects. The coefficient estimate of interest is \u03b2 1 which measures the extent to which the minority gap in the outcome variables (i.e. the difference in the outcome between minority and white students) depends on whether the students are assigned to a minority or a white teacher. A positive \u03b2 1 indicates minority students receive more favorable outcomes relative to their white peers from being matched with a minority teacher. In the model including two degrees of fixed effects like equation (1), standard errors are clustered at the teacher level and student level.\nBesides relying on the within-teacher within-student comparisons, I include only teacher fixed effects, and looking at the impact of the racial/ethnic interactions on teacher-student relationship scores separately in the kindergarten and second-grade year:\nTeacher fixed effect is still represented by \u03b4 j . Apart from controls defined in equation (1), X i in equation (2) also includes student gender, and language spoken at home. The minoritystudent i dummy is added to equation (2) . 12 Standard errors in equation (2) are clustered at the teacher level.\nAn alternative to equation (1) is to examine how the teacher-student relationship, student noncognitive and cognitive outcomes are affected if a student is matched to a teacher sharing the same racial/ethnic group (for example, a white student with a white teacher, a minority student with a minority teacher):\nwhere same ij takes the value of 1 if there is a racial match and 0 otherwise. With the inclusion of only teacher fixed effects, one can also look at students from each racial/ethnic group (minority vs white) separately. The coefficient on the teacher race dummy captures the similar race effects. 13 Table 2 presents my estimates of the teacher race/ethnicity effect on the teacher-perceived relationship with students. In other words, \u03b2 1 , the racial/ethnic interaction, is reported."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Racial match and the student -teacher relationship scale", "text": "Panel A shows my preferred specification, i.e. equation (1) -including both student and teacher fixed effects. 14 I also implement the model involving only one level of fixed effects -the teacher fixed effects, i.e. equation (2) score and the negative relationship score as outcome variables, the coefficient estimate on the racial interaction is negative but is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, impacts on the possible reduction in the conflict/negative student-teacher relationship remain inconclusive. 15 Although the relationship scores are based on teacher's reporting, these effects can be driven by either teachers favoring one group of students and discriminating the other group (i.e. changes stemming only from teachers), or by students adjusting their manners, therefore, end up being on good terms with their teachers (therefore, their teachers are just reporting what is true of their experience, without any bias).\nTo investigate further the level at which student-teacher interactions are present, I show estimates from regressions where separate interactions across all detailed racial and ethnic groups are included. Student fixed effects absorb the interaction for one of the student groups (white students in this case); teacher fixed effects absorb the interaction for one of the teacher groups (white teacher in this case). Consequently, I end up with 4 of the 9 race/ethnicity interactions and all estimated interaction effects in table 3 are relative to the relationship scale for white students with alternative teacher types. For the teacher-student Closeness score and the teacher-student Positiveness score, I find a stronger effect for cross-race/ethnicity interactions. Minority students could have a favorable relationship with minority teachers of a different type. 16 Particularly, a black student tends to have a closer relationship with the classroom teacher than a white student by 0.68 standard deviations of the closeness score if they are assigned to a Hispanic teacher. A similar differential effect is observed between a Hispanic student and a white student assigned to a black teacher (For Closeness (Positiveness) score, the estimate is 0.485 (0.507) standard deviations). For own-race interaction, although positive impacts are detected between Hispanic students and Hispanic teachers, no such relationship is uncovered between black students and black teachers. 15 In Appendix "}, {"section_title": "Racial match and student learning behaviors, student cognitive ability", "text": "The estimated role of teacher race for student learning behavior is presented in table 4. The first two columns show the effect on the teacher-reported Approach-to-Learning score and the composite Learning index constructed from the seven items (column 3 through 9). I only present results for the specification incorporating both teacher and student fixed effects.\nAlthough the coefficients on the racial/ethnic interaction term for Approach-to-Learning score and the Learning index are positive, there is not enough statistical evidence for the effect on he student learning behaviors to be detected. for minority students, I execute a falsification test similar to those described in the next section where kindergarten teacher evaluation of the child's reading skill is regressed on the racial/ethnic interaction with the second-grade teacher, conditioning on student characteristics and teacher fixed effects (result table is not shown). The differential effect from this regression is 0.072. Compared to the actual effect of the racial match between the student and his kindergarten teacher on evaluations in kindergarten (which is 0.067), the falsification estimate (despite being insignificant) is too large to negate any spurious link between racial interactions and teacher evaluation of student reading skill. In other words, there is no relative gain in reading skill for minority students matched with minority teachers. In brief, there is no effect of the racial/ethnic interaction on the academic ability for minority students exposed to minority teachers."}, {"section_title": "Falsification Test", "text": "In sum, I find that minority students tend to have a more positive teacher-student relationship and exhibit a higher level of closeness with their teachers than white students when they are assigned to minority teachers. The teacher and student fixed effects specification is able to guard off most threats to omitted variable bias; however, it cannot eliminate relative sorting.\nIn other words, a level of caution should be exerted to interpret this estimated relationship as causal since, for instance, well-behaved minority kids may systematically sort into minoritytaught classes while well-behaved white kids do not. Unfortunately, there is no way to directly test for relative sorting. However, I can run a falsification test by examining the \"effect\"\nof the racial/ethnic match during second-grade year on the teacher-student relationship scale in kindergarten. The falsification test controls for student characteristics (race, gender, socioeconomic status, retention, special accommodation status, age, home language), and teacher fixed effects. If there were to be a spurious impact of the racial/ethnic interaction in the classroom on teacher-student relationship, I would see the coefficient estimate on the match in the falsification test statistically distinct from zero. and students on the teacher-perceived relationship with students."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms and Discussion", "text": "Now I turn to the explore the mechanisms behind the racial/ethnic interactions above. One key question is whether my estimates are driven by teachers or students behaving differently.\nTeachers may favor children of their own race and are biased against the opposite-race students (Casteel 1998; Zimmerman et al. 1995; Ferguson 2003) . Alternately, students might feel more comfortable, focused, and exhibit more positive behaviors once being assigned to same-race/same-ethnicity teachers (U.S. Department of Education 1997; Ladson-Billings 1994). In order to disentangle these two possibilities, I execute several tests of discrimination to see if teachers are showing bias against students with a different racial/ethnic identity."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "First, I run a regression of the teacher-student relationship scale variables (Closeness and Positiveness) on teacher fixed effects and the interaction between teacher effects and student race to test for the joint significance of all coefficients on the interactions. These interaction effects capture the variation in teacher-specific minority-white relationship gaps. Coefficients on these interactions are statistically distinct from zero (table B1 in , it means white teachers are also inclined to provide higher relationship score with minority students than minority teachers. If both conditions hold at the same time:\nin other words, if the ranking of the average teacher-student relationship scale by race of teacher is preserved, then it supports the notion of no discrimination from teachers. On the other hand, if it is true that \u03b3(W, w) > \u03b3(M, w) and \u03b3(W, m) < \u03b3(M, m), (rank order is not preserved) then either white or minority teachers are exercising some discrimination.\nResults of this test are given in table 7 for the teacher-reported closeness (panel A) and the positive relationship score (panel B). White teachers indeed have higher relationship score (both Closeness and Positiveness) with white students than minority teachers. This is significant at 5% level. I also observe white teachers hold a more positive relationship with minority students than minority teachers (-0.045 > -0.158; -0.101 > -0.211) and the difference is statistically different from zero. Table 7 supports the conjecture of no racial discrimination from teachers.\nThere is one caveat in interpreting the results from table 7. The Fang and Anwar (2006) test of discrimination rests on the assumption that white and minority troopers are faced with the same population of white and minority motorists. In my case, systematic differences may arise because white and minority teachers could be assigned to a different population of white and minority students. To eliminate these differences, I run a regression of relationship outcomes (both closeness and positiveness) on student race and year fixed effects. 18 The mean residuals from these regressions grouped by the race of teachers and race of students are presented in table 8. White teachers tend to have better relationship with white students than minority teachers (0.003 > -0.06; 0.003 > -0.063) and at the same time, white teachers hold higher relationship score with minority students than minority teachers (0.036 > -0.072; 0.035 > -0.071) and these differences are far from zero. In sum, table 8 also supports the hypothesis of no racial prejudice from teachers.\nResults from the three tests of discrimination show that teachers are not biased in their perceived relationship with students; therefore, the estimated link between the racial interactions and the teacher-student relationship scale is attributed to the student side. To put it differently, it is the students who react favorably when they are assigned to teachers sharing their race/ethnicity. The estimates documented in table 2 reflect the relative gain which could potentially be driven by either minority students responding positively to minority teachers or white students reacting adversely. In order to shed more light on the source of this relative gain, I focus on students from each racial group separately (white vs minority students) and run the following specification:\nwhere T jt is a vector of teacher characteristics (education, gender, whether the teacher is a high-quality teacher based on the state standard, whether teacher took the exam for national board for professional teaching certification standard). For minority students, OppositeRace j takes the value of 1 if the teacher is white and 0 otherwise. For white students, OppositeRace j takes the value of 1 if the teacher is minority and 0 otherwise. \u03b2 1 is the effect of being assigned to a teacher of the opposite racial/ethnic identity relative to being assigned to a same race/ethnicity teacher. \u03bb i stands for student fixed effects. Vector of student controls, X it , includes student retention status, special education status, socioeconomic measure, whether the student changes teacher during one academic year. Results are shown in table 9.\nPanel A illustrates minority students' propensity to have more conflict and a more negative relationship with white teachers while it is evident from panel B that the relationship between white students and minority teachers are indifferent from that with white teachers.\nBased on these results, the racial interaction effect is driven by minority students reacting negatively when matched with white teachers but positively when assigned to minority teachers.\nThis behavior of minority students is related to the concept of \"in-group favoritism\" where individuals coming from the same group respond to each other positively due to the perception of the shared culture but are likely to negatively react to outsiders (Tajfel and Turner 1979) .\nThe social interaction between in-group members and out-group individuals is documented Although the effect on neither students cognitive nor noncognitive ability is uncovered in this paper, it is worth noting that the quality of the teacher-student relationship may not affect current learning and skill formation but has a predictive power in children long-term behavioral and academic outcomes (see for example, Pianta and Nimetz 1991, Hamre and Pianta 2001). If we can get minority children exposed to minority teachers, there will be not only gains in the teacher-student relationship in the short run but also potential improvements in both cognitive and noncognitive measures for minority students in the long run. Because white students do not change their behavior to either white or minority teachers, increasing the representation of minority teachers is likely to benefit minority children without posing any harm to their white peers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Using the confidential version of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study K-2011, I provide the first empirical evidence of the causal link between the teacher-student racial/ethnic interaction and teacher-perceived relationship with students in kindergarten and early elementary school.\nBy making within-teacher within-student comparison, the empirical model overcomes most of the endogeneity problem. One potential threat to the internal validity of my estimates lies with relative sorting, which is tentatively shown by a falsification test not to be an issue in my context. I find that minority students tend to have a better relationship with teachers when the teacher is a minority. Specifically, minority students are likely to have a closer relationship with their teachers by 0.288 standard deviations (of the Closeness score) and tend to hold a more positive relationship with their teachers by 0.323 standard deviations (of the Positiveness score) when they are assigned to a minority-taught class. These positive impacts on the teacher-student relationship are discovered both across minority groups (Hispanic teachers and black students, black teachers and Hispanic students) and within the same minority group (Hispanic teachers and Hispanic students, but not between black students and black teachers). However, having a minority teacher does not seem to have any influence on the difference of learning behaviors, and cognitive ability between white and minority students.\nExamining the mechanisms behind the estimated link between racial interactions and teacherstudent relationship, I rule out the channel from the teacher to the student by conducting the test of discrimination. Both versions of the adapted rank-based test reveal that teachers are not biased in judging their relationship with their students. This implies that the source of the racial/ethnic interaction effects comes from students behaving differently when they are matched with teachers of different racial/ethnic identities. I am able to show that it is minority students who react adversely when they are assigned to white teachers but white students' behavior remains similar when the teacher is either white or minority. Given the crucial role of the teacher-student relationship in early school years, my results indicate that if we increase the representation of minority teachers in the education system (at least in the early stage), not only future academic but also future behavioral outcomes for minority students will be improved, helping narrow the white-minority gap.
