Arteriosclerosis and arterial stiffness increasing are the basic pathophysiological changes of vascular-related diseases, and also the predictor factors of future cardiovascular events. Arterial stiffness could be measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) [2] and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) suggested by Chinese guideline for early vascular disease detection (2011 s report) [3] . Our previous studies showed that PWV was positively correlated with pulse pressure and it was increased in hypertension patients with left ventricular hypertrophy [4, 5] . And our recent study showed that PWV is significantly higher in healthy subjects with a positive family history of hypertension [6] . CAVI was significantly higher in hypertension subjects with DM or CHD [7, 8] . In addition, there are some other parameters to evaluate arterial function such as flow mediated vascular dilation (FMD) [9] , ankle brachial index (ABI) [10] , carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [11] .\nPlasma biomarkers such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG),high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Homocysteine (Hcy), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been shown to be involving the development of arteriosclerosis. Our previous studies showed that there was positive correlation between CAVI, PWV and plasma lipids and Hcy in vascularrelated diseases [12] . HOPE study showed combing traditional risk factors with NT-pro BNP can provide the best clinical prediction of recurrent cardiovascular events in the secondary-prevention population [13] . And high-normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was independently associated with arterial stiffness in the general population without diabetes [14] . These studies suggest biomarkers could provide some information about the prediction role of future cardiovascular events. As above shown, arterial function lesion is the pathophysiological changes of cardiovascular disease, so if we could find the vascular function abnormality early, we could treat it early before cardiovascular diseases attack. This is very important to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or other serious cardiovascular diseases. So the early detection and treatment of high-risk patients has been enforced as a key strategy in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases to reduce the incidences of death and disability of cardiovascular diseases apart from the treatment of serious vascular events. Our team studies showed that arterial function evaluation was more important than arterial structure evaluation [15] . So we proposed the early vascular detection technology including many vascular function evaluation indexes such as pulse pressure, PWV, CAVI, FMD, ABI, CIMT [3] . And this technology was approved by Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China to be promoted to the whole China in 2004. Recently, we proposed new established vascular health classification (namely Beijing Vascular Health Classification) which assessed both the vascular functional and structural lesion changed [16] .\nRecently, we started a prospective study named Beijing Vascular Disease Patients Evaluation Study (BEST).

The mortality of cardiovas-cular disease was significantly higher in China than in other developed countries. And CHD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease have been remaining as the hot points in the world governments and academic circles. With the enhancing cognitive level of these diseases, we have known that the overall clinical progression of human arterial tree is the core link to bring about various important organ dysfunctions. The progression of arteriosclerosis is caused by various risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome and so on. These factors could cause macro-and micro-vascular complications, such as aortic atherosclerosis and retinal artery arteriosclerosis, leading to an increase of arterial wall thickness, endothelial dysfunction and calcification, finally leading to an increase of arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. And it is one of the earliest detectable manifestations of adverse structural and functional changes within the vessel wall [17] . Both Danish population study [18] and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) study [19] have showed the predictor role of arterial stiffness for cardiovascular outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors.\nA recent consensus concluded that hemoglobin A1c, microalbuminuria, C-reactive protein certain, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase, coronary calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, and ankle/brachial index can be used as clinical risk prediction measurement [20] . Furthermore, changes including total cholesterol, HDL-C, systolic blood pressure, daily smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, resting heart rate and physical activity accounted for 66% of the decline in coronary heart disease events [21] . Also MORGAM study confirmed adding NT-proBNP, C-reactive protein, and sensitive troponin I to a conventional risk model can improve 10-year risk estimation for cardiovascular events [22] . However, these models predicted the traditional risk factors instead of vascular itself and lack of recent vascular health assessment.\nAs previous stated, arterial function lesion is the pathophysiological changes of cardiovascular disease, so if we could find the vascular function abnormality early, we could treat it early before cardiovascular diseases attack. This is very important to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or other serious cardiovascular diseases. Thus, vascular disease can be prevented by early detection and there are also many risk prediction models which are of great importance in the primary practice [23] . However, these models predicted the traditional risk factors instead of vascular function itself and lack of recent vascular health assessment. Thus, the new classification combined the above non-invasive evaluation measurements together and assess the vascular health status comprehensively [16] . However, combined indexes could simultaneously detect abnormalities from multiple levels of structure and function, and make up shortcomings of single indicator in clinical applications. In addition, all indicators testing not only cause time consuming, but also increase the burden on patients, resulting unnecessary waste of medical resources. The BEST study was to select appropriate indicators and effective joint, and then establish vascular disease early detection system and scoring systems to predict the incidence of terminal events.\nThe present study design has the following strengths. First, it included all kinds of early noninvasive vascular function and structure indexes and biomarkers together to evaluate the systematic vessels comprehensively. Second, our research team put forward a new vascular health classification including all above detections, and the present study was designed to apply the new classification and confirm its great clinical significance. Third, the present study designation will provide a new concept of the prevention of vascular diseases, we should regard the cardiac, brain, kidney and peripheral vessels as a whole and assess comprehensively. Fourth, this study was supported by The Capital Health Research and Development of Special Project, and 2858 subjects were enrolled into our present study from June 2012 to June 2015, and all of laboratory and physiological tests were done in these subjects. So we got very integral baseline data. However, we also have some limitations about the designation. First, the detection of the whole vessels by ultrasound is highly dependent on the examiners although all detection will be done by the same person. Also the evaluation of vascular endothelial is by ultrasound, so it is dependent on the technique of the examiner. Second, because the study is conducted partly in the hospital, so the duration of related detection may vary according to different conditions. Third, the sample size may not meet the need for the establishment of a new prediction system, but will provide information on the application of the new classification. In addition, BEST study has been registered in Clinical Trial (https:// clinicaltrials.gov), and ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT02569268, however, the trial has completed, and we did not publish our methodology of BEST study before. However, our present study could provide more information about arterial function in the development of vascular diseases.\nIn conclusion, arterial function evaluation is becoming more important in recent research than structure evaluation. BEST study will provide vascular disease early detection system and scoring systems according to comprehensive vascular disease risk factors and vascular function."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of conflicting interests", "text": "No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.
