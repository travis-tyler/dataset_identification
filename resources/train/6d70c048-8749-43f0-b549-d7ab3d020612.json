"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Obtaining an undergraduate degree is often noted as a gateway that leads to new and unforeseen opportunities. Moreover, it has been a legislative sentiment that those who desire a college education are provided the opportunity to participate. This is perhaps evident partly due to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the G.I. Bill, and the Higher Education Act of 1965 and its reauthorization in 2008. However, with greater cuts in institutional budgets as a result of decreased appropriations and/or funding, there is an increased need for strategic target marketing and recruitment efforts (Bergerson, 2009). To accomplish this, particular attention to college choice or the decision making process in which prospective students decide whether to attend college is warranted-for understanding college choice provides a foundation for effective enrollment planning, student marketing, and recruitment (Paulsen, 1990). The study of college choice behavior of students indicates the ways in which environmental, institutional, and student characteristics affect a student's decision about whether to enroll in postsecondary education (Paulsen, 1990). In addition, comprehending choice has potential implications for institutional practice, policy, and research. Faced with the possibility of reduced enrollments, budget deficits, and increasing competition for students among institutions necessitates the ability to maintain and effectively forecast enrollment (Bergerson, 2009;Paulsen, 1990). In an attempt to facilitate matriculation, each institution seeks ways to make itself more attractive than the other. Some methods in which this is accomplished are by emphasizing uniqueness of academic curriculum, extracurricular activities, mission, or offering financial aid and scholarships. These techniques are employed because institutions want to influence the college choice process of prospective students. Various motivating factors influence students' decision to pursue postsecondary education. Likewise, multiple reasons or circumstances prevent them from attending. Salary earnings are perhaps the most obvious personal benefit for individuals to invest in higher education (Carter, 1999;Crissey, 2009;Perna, 2004). Crissey (2009) reported that higher educational attainment was associated with higher average annual earnings. In 2007, the median earnings ranged from about $19,000 for those with less than a high school diploma to over $60,000 for those with an advanced degree (Crissey, 2009). High school graduates earned approximately $27,000, while those with a bachelor's degree earned about $47,000. In addition to the personal/private benefits that materialize from obtaining a bachelor's degree or beyond, such as higher salary earnings, improved health and work environment, public benefits also exist for a society with an educated community. Societal benefits of higher education are increased national income and productivity, increased state workforce productivity, increased economic activity in the community, decreased need for welfare and Medicaid, increased government revenues, lower crime rates, and greater civic involvement (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999;Perna, 2004;Perna, 2006). Thus, it is a belief, for some, that both the government and its citizens should advocate and allocate resources to support the pursuit of higher learning. In the United States, however, it has not always been a common belief that a college education should be available to anyone who wanted it. For example, in the 1960s it was limited for people of color due to segregation laws and, and prior to the 1940s, it was reserved for White males and the elite, as higher education was primarily funded through student tuition with little assistance in the form of scholarships, fellowships, or government funds (Kinzie, Palmer, Hayek, Hossler, Jacob, & Cummings, 2004). Nevertheless, given America's change in ideology and minority population (both in college and within the country), an increased focus on matters of access and equity in higher education began to emerge in the 1970's and 1980's. Thus, researchers have concentrated on exploring the college choice experiences of students of color (Bergerson, 2009). Not only has there been an increase in enrollment of students of color (i.e., non-White students) in undergraduate education, there has also been an increase of these students in graduate education. Additionally, Black students have experienced the largest enrollment change in graduate school following White students (Nevill & Chen, 2007). However, despite the increases in the racial and ethnic diversity in graduate/ professional school enrollment, the closure in the gap of participation between students of color and White students have not materialized (Bergerson, 2009). For example, from 1994 to 2006, minority students (i.e., African American, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American) increased their graduate school participation by 79 percent, but only represented 21 percent of the overall enrollment (Ryu, 2009). Moreover, it is difficult to affirm that the increased enrollment of minorities, particularly of Black students, is proportionate to those who have aspirations of obtaining an undergraduate or even an advanced degree. For it has been a withstanding issue that Black students access to higher education, whether in enrollment at undergraduate or graduate school, or in academic employment has been confronted with obstacles (Deskins, 1994). Deskins further explained that: Increased minority participation in graduate education is an important national goal to be realized for social, economic, intellectual, and cultural well-being of all persons. It is for the collective benefit of society that the representation of minority group persons among those earning advanced degrees be increased (as cited in Carter, 1999, p. 5). Though an enhanced understanding of postsecondary participation concerns may not resolve all inequities, it could lead to new policy initiatives that would provide education in a more cost-effective/affordable manner and increase the nation's investment in educated workers (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999). Furthermore, addressing the post-baccalaureate enrollment choices of African Americans is a step toward improving recruitment practices and enhancing the diversity of an institution. Freeman (1998; found that Black students' participation in higher education can be categorized into factors such as academic/curricular, social/psychological, structural/societal, and economic/financial. Expanding on this notion and drawing from the economic model of human capital investment, Perna (2006) hypothesized that the decision to participate in postsecondary education is shaped by four contextual layers including: 1) the student's habitus; 2) school and community context; 3) higher education context; and 4) the economic and policy context. This section summarizes findings according to these contexts and other relevant areas (e.g., academic achievement, degree aspirations, financial constraints) that influence college choice.\nThe literature that examines students' plans to attend graduate school is not as often researched as the high school to college transition. Moreover, the literature that examines the issues that may influence Black students to participate in graduate education is reduced even further. Nonetheless, authors have noted that students' undergraduate college experiences and institutional characteristics shape various educational outcomes (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005), particularly college choice. For example, African American students who attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as undergraduates, tend to go to graduate school in greater numbers than African Americans who attend predominately White institutions (PWIs); and in similar respects, women who attend women's colleges also attend graduate school in greater numbers and have more positive affective development than women attending co-ed institutions (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Given some of the disparities and barriers to postsecondary education (undergraduate and graduate education), creating links between the issues and the processes in which students choose whether and where to attend college can contribute to increased completion rates across the many student populations higher education institutions serve (Bergerson, 2009). The purpose of this study is to identify the issues (i.e., financial aid, academic achievement, habitus, school and community, and higher education context) that may influence Black, 4-year degree holders decisions to advance to graduate education, and to determine if undergraduate institution type (i.e., attendance at an HBCU) influence college choice. Building upon prior research that has examined the predictors of African Americans' aspirations of pursing graduate opportunities (Carter 1999;Pascarella, Woniak, Pierson, & Flowers 2004), this study contributes to the graduate college choice research by examining the inhibitors and contributors of participation decisions of Black college students. However, to understand the progress that African Americans have made in their advancement into higher education, it is useful to consider the history of African Americans college participation (Wilson, 1998).\nResearch has recognized the increase in racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses, however, despite these increases, proportionate growth in the participation of students of color, particularly African Americans (both undergraduate and graduate), have not materialized (Bergerson, 2009). To ensure that more students of color are able to attain their goals, it is necessary to examine the practices (e.g., recruitment strategies, curriculum design, faculty-student interaction) and policies (e.g., financial aid, tuition, institutional appropriations) that aid and hinder enrollment choices. Moreover, understanding the graduate college choice process is essential for higher education researchers and professionals interested in increasing access and persistence in higher learning (Bergerson, 2009;Kallio, 1995). Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify the issues (i.e., academic achievement, financial, habitus, school and community, and higher education context) that may influence Black undergraduate students' choice to enroll in graduate education, and to determine if undergraduate institutional type (i.e., attendance at an HBCU) may influence enrollment choice decisions. Included in this chapter is the data source, a description of the population and sampling design, weighting, data collection, reliability and data quality, the variables in the study, the research questions, and proposed data analyses .\nThe present study is designed to investigate the factors that impact Black students' decision to enroll in graduate/ first professional school. Chapter 1 introduced the significance of college choice and summarized relevant literature. Chapter 2 reviewed a brief history of African Americans in U.S. higher education and reviewed the enrollment literature of undergraduate and graduate student populations. Chapter 3 outlined the methods of analysis and Chapter 4 analyzed and reported those results. Contents within this chapter will first discuss the primary findings of the analyses presented in Chapter 4, and it will be examined in reference to possible explanations of the discoveries and how they converge or diverge from previous literature. Next, implications of the research will be investigated and is followed by limitations of the study. Finally, recommendations for future research will be reviewed and the chapter concludes with a summary."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Relevant Research", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Influence of Academic Achievement", "text": "Researchers have noted that though various pre-college experiences influence college enrollment, the most significant may be academic achievement (Astin, 1982;Heller, 2001;Nevill & Chen, 2007;Perna, 2006). Students with high academic achievement levels are more likely to aspire to attend college (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999), and it is an important contributor to college choice as it affects students' abilities to maintain those high aspirations (Pitre, 2006). In one of his earlier studies, Allen (1992) reported that academic achievement is highest among Black students that report high educational aspirations, and that they have lower academic achievement at predominately White institutions (PWIs). Pascerella, Wolniak, Pierson, and Flowers (2004) found that high school grade point average (GPA) was positively associated with aspirations for a graduate degree among White students, however, had no effect for Black or Latino students. Nevertheless, achievement remains an essential college enrollment predictor, as parents, teachers, and counselors are more likely to support those aspirations of students who display higher levels of academic achievement (Pitre, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Background Characteristics", "text": "Apart from academic achievement, Nevill and Chen (2007) indicated that the variety of choices that students face after earning a bachelor's degree (e.g., marriage, employment) coupled with financial issues, affect educational plans. Family responsibilities may impose limitations on students' likelihood of applying and enrolling in a graduate degree program (Nevill & Chen, 2007). Redd (2006) found that students enrolled in a professional program (e.g., MD, JD) were likely to be unmarried and have no children. In addition, Nevill and Chen (2007) further noted that marriage at the time of the bachelor's degree decreased the likelihood of enrolling in graduate school. In addition to family responsibilities researchers have reported the differences in enrollment patterns among students across racial/ethnic and gender groups (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999;Pascarella, Wolniak, Pierson, & Flowers, 2004;Perna, 2004;Perna & Titus, 2005). Researchers conclude that African Americans' college participation is lower compared to Whites (Hurtado, Inkelas, Briggs, Rhee, 1997), partially because they possess fewer amounts of economic, human, cultural, and social capital valued in the college enrollment process (Perna & Titus, 2005). In regards to gender differences, Perna (2004) emphasized that higher percentages of women than men enroll in master level programs and below (23% versus 16%), yet a smaller proportion of women enroll in doctoral and first professional programs (2% versus 4%). Pascarella et al. (2004) suggested that being female and older tends to inhibit plans for a graduate degree. Nevertheless, for women, being Black increased the odds of enrolling in a professional degree program after controlling for financial and academic resources, cultural capital, and social capital (Perna, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Social and Cultural Capital", "text": "Cultural and social capital can influence expectations about graduate enrollment through the lens in which students view costs and benefits (Perna, 2004). Parents play an essential role as transmitters of cultural and social capital, and do so through their involvement in their children's education (Perna, 2006). Cultural and social capital is expressed through parents' educational attainment (McDonough, 1997), parental encouragement (Hamrick & Stage, 2004), and parental involvement (Perna, 2006;Perna & Titus, 2005;Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, Perna, 2008). Pascarella et al. (2004) found students whose parents had a college degree enter higher education at 30 percent higher rates than students who were first generational college students. In similar regards, Strayhorn (2009) concluded African American men who had parents with an advanced degree were more likely to enroll in graduate school than those who had parents with less education. Freeman (2005) maintains that in order for Black students to decide to enroll into college they need aspiration, academic ability, and support. Moreover, when parents support college aspirations, students have a greater likelihood to attend (Hamrick & Stage, 2004). Kao and Tienda (1998) noted that aspirations and expectations affect enrollment decisions of students, though some findings have been inconsistent (Perna, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Degree Aspirations", "text": "Research indicates that high aspirations may mitigate the negative effects of some variables, for example socioeconomic status (SES), on college attendance (Carter, 2002). Strayhorn (2009) states that those African American males who had higher educational aspirations at the point of B.A. receipt were more likely to enroll in or complete graduate school within 10 years. Additionally, Kim and Eyermann (2006) report students who had low degree aspirations as freshmen were less likely to plan to attend graduate school than students who had high degree aspirations (i.e., medicine or law). Hence, aspirations are an essential part of academic performance for Black students, as when aspirations are weakened, they experience less incentive to do well academically (Pitre, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of School and Community Context", "text": "Students' aspirations vary across school contexts and are further exposed through curricular choices (McDonough, 1997). Research shows that aspects of the school context shape college choice (Perna, 2006). Factors related to a student's undergraduate education, such as undergraduate major, selectivity of the undergraduate institution, and academic achievement, also contribute to students' likelihood of enrolling in graduate school (Nevill & Chen, 2007). Millett (2003) found that undergraduates who had majored in specific pure disciplines (e.g., life science, math, engineering) as opposed to applied fields (e.g., education, business) were twice as likely to apply to graduate or firstprofessional school. In addition, the selectivity of the undergraduate institution attended had a positive effect on graduate enrollment (Eide, Brewer, & Ehrenberg, 1998), and more specifically, enrollment into a doctoral program (Zhang, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Higher Education Context", "text": "Institutional characteristics play an important role in the college choice process (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999). Carter (2002) claimed that institutional characteristics and experiences can mediate or counteract background characteristics and can independently affect educational outcomes including academic achievement and aspirations, which directly affects postsecondary enrollment. Ethington and Smart (1986) examined the process by which students arrive in graduate school and found the primary influences on graduate school attendance were from variables associated with undergraduate experiences (e.g., academic and social integration). Lastly, the selectivity of the undergraduate institution has an effect on graduate school attendance for men (Ethington & Smart, 1986) and influences enrollment into doctoral programs (Zhang, 2005). Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have served an important role in promoting access to higher education for African Americans when other avenues excluded their participation. HBCUs award approximately 20 percent of all bachelor's degrees to Black students, and award 20 percent of all first professional degrees (McDonough, Antonio, Trent, 1997;Palmer, 2010). Enrollment statistics are significant because HBCUs represent only 3 percent of the nation's institutions of higher learning. It has been shown that Black students who attend these institutions display higher gains in academic achievement, higher rates of undergraduate degree attainment and higher occupational aspirations than those Black students who attend predominately White institutions (PWIs). Research also indicates that the experience at an HBCU propels more African Americans into graduate and professional degree programs (Allen, 1992;Perna, 2001; Roebuck & Murty, 1993). According to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), of the top 10 colleges that graduate African Americans who go on to earn PhDs or MDs, 9 are HBCUs (as cited in Palmer, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Economics and Policy Context", "text": "As proposed by Perna (2006), demographic characteristics of a population, characteristics of a labor market, and policy structures can also impact college enrollment. Researchers noted how policies such as the Dream Act can encourage attendance (Dougherty, Nienhusser, & Vega, 2010) or Proposition 209, which can deter participation (Tobolowsky, Outcalt, & McDonough, 2005). In addition, researchers explored how state policies affected college choice and found that state appropriations, tuition policy, financial aid were related to enrollment (Perna, Steel, Woda, and Hibbert, 2005;Perna & Titus, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Financial Constraints", "text": "Low levels of financial resources may limit a student's ability to pay the costs of higher education or realize benefits that exceed the costs (Perna, 2006). Perna and Titus (2004) found that low SES students were less likely to enroll in 4-year institutions compared to other students. Consequently, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds have greater access to and ability to locate information about the college going process (McDonough, 1997) and Cabrera and LaNasa (2000) suggested that teachers and counselors, are of particular importance for low-income students to acquire this information. Several studies have investigated how educational costs, indebtedness, and foregone earnings effects educational attainment (Bedard & Herman, 2008;Kim & Eyerman's, 2006;Millet, 2003;Perna, 2004). The price of earning an undergraduate degree is increasing, and as a result, students are borrowing more money to complete their bachelor's degree (Nevill & Chen, 2007). Millett (2003) concluded that students with debt ranging between $10,000 and $15,000 were one and a half times less likely to apply to a graduate degree program then students without debt. Price (2004) further noted that students from lower-income backgrounds, Blacks, and Hispanics have a significantly greater risk to have excessive educational debt burden, which in turn can influence choice."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": "This study adapts Perna's (2006) proposed college choice model and examines the matters that increase or decrease the likelihood of Black students to attend graduate school. African American enrollment in college (undergraduate and graduate) and their educational attainment are both affected by their experiences (Thompson, 1998). These students' perceptions are based on the experiences of people like themselves, which affects their decisions of participating in higher education (Freeman, 1998). Perna's (2006) conceptual model of college choice employs several frameworks and assumes that multiple layers of context shape college-going decisions. She states that college choice is based on a comparison of benefits and the costs of registering, however, these perceptions of benefits and costs are shaped by individual's habitus. Habitus is acknowledged as being a common set of perceptions held by all members of the same group or class that forms an individual's expectations, attitudes, and aspirations. It often comes in the shape of family characteristics, school and community environment, or access to educational and information resources (DesJardins & Toutkoushian, 2005). Perna's model assumes that college choice decisions can be fully understood by taking into account four layers of context: individual's habitus; school, and community context; higher education context; and social, economic, and policy context (Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, & Perna, 2008). The first layer, habitus, includes factors of student's background characteristics such as race/ ethnicity, social class, parents' education, and the presence of social and cultural capital. Moreover, Perna (2006) attests that studying students' habitus toward college enrollment could shed some light on students' decisions to become academically prepared for higher education. The second layer, school and community context, reflects how social structures and resources influence or impede student college choice (Perna, 2006). The school and community context is reflected by the type of support from school counselors, educational expectations of family and peers, and involvement in curricular extracurricular activities. The third layer, the higher education context of Perna's model, emphasizes how higher education institutions shape college choice. Characteristics of an institution also influences student choice as students prefer to attend schools with characteristics similar to their personal and social identities, and select institutions that meets their needs for personal acceptance (Perna, 2006). The fourth layer, the social, economic, and policy context, includes labor market trends, population demographics, and policies that support and/ or discourage college matriculation (Bergerson, 2009). Key pieces that Roksa (2010) notes within this lens are facets of the state policy, governance, and financial context."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "Drawing on three of the four layers of Perna's proposed model, the purpose of this study is to identify the issues (i.e., financial aid, academic achievement, habitus, school and community and higher education context) that may influence Black, college graduates to enroll in graduate school. In addition, it seeks to determine if attendance at a historically Black college and university (HBCU) influence choice decisions. Therefore, this study seeks to discern the following: 1. The investigation of aspirations/expectations is essential in college choice research, as students will not participate if they do not aspire to participate (Carter, 2001). A comparison of the percentage of students who expect they will earn an advanced degree by those that eventually do in 2003, will determine if Black students desire to earn a graduate degree, and whether if they are on the path of meeting their goals. Therefore, what differences exist among the proportion of Black students who aspired to earn a graduate degree in 1993 and 2003, and the proportion that actually enrolled? 2. Among the students enrolled in American higher education, Black men have the lowest male-to-female ratio when compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. Understanding how Black males and females approach the decision to advance their education can discern as to why females choose higher education more often, and how to advance Black males' participation (Freeman, 2005). Therefore, what are the issues (e.g. undergraduate grade point average, financial aid, background characteristics, social and cultural capital, undergraduate major, institutional characteristics) college choice that affect the decision-making process of Black males compared to females? 3. How well does Perna's model explain Black, 4-year degree earner's decision to enroll in graduate/ professional school? 4. Research notes how Black students participation at HBCUs influences Black students decision to matriculate into a post-baccalaureate degree program. However, does attendance alone inspire the decision? Therefore, how does attendance at a HBCU influence Black students' choice to enroll into graduate education after controlling for college choice variables?"}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "To answer the preceding research questions, this study will use a national public dataset, Baccalaureate andBeyond 1993/2003 (B&B:93/03), provided by the National Center of Educational Statistics (NCES). The B&B followed a cohort of students who earned 4-year degrees during the 1992-93 academic year (Wine, Cominole, Wheeless, Dudley, & Franklin, 2005). The B&B consisted of data from students who were first interviewed as part of the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 93), which focused on how students and their families financed their postsecondary education. The students were interviewed and undergraduate transcripts were collected during the first B&B follow-up study in 1994 (B&B: 93/94) (Wine et. al., 2005). Three years later, in 1997, a second follow-up was conducted (B&B: 93/97), and the final follow-up took place in 2003 (Wine et. al., 2005). Though the dataset extends to approximately 18 years from when the initial cohort were interviewed, researchers from recent years have still used the data to investigate college participation (Dowd, 2008;Nevill & Chen, 2007;Strayhorn, 2009;Zhang, 2005), career paths (Bacolod, 2007;Goyette & Mullen, 2006;Nitopi, 2010;Strayhorn, 2008;Zhang 2008), and academic success (Bosshardt & Watts, 2008;Liu, Thomas, & Zhang, 2010). In addition, even though there are more recent datasets available (B&B: 00/01, B&B: 08/ 09), it was important for the researcher to examine issues of enrollment across an extensive longitude of time. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses will be used to address the research questions. The first question will be answered using descriptive statistics this analysis will provide an overview of the characteristics of Black students in the study and examine graduate school participation relative to their educational expectations. The study will use logistic regression to answer the second, third, and fourth research questions. Logistic regression is a type of analysis used when the dependent variable is categorical. In this study, the dependent variable is based on whether a student ever registered in a graduate degree program, regardless of completion. Thus, responses will be coded to \"enrolled\" and \"never enrolled\", a dichotomous dependent variable. The logistic regression model estimates the odds-ratio of an outcome occurring (e.g., enrollment into graduate school) relative to the baseline category (e.g., never enrolled in graduate school). Analysis of the second question will be examined by conducting the logistic regression analysis across gender. This investigation seeks to uncover and compare which variables are unique and/or common to Black women and men in their graduate degree pursuits. To address the third research question, independent variables of the college choice model will be entered into the logistic regression model in four separate blocks. The first block will include academic achievement and financial aid, followed by the second block, which includes habitus (i.e., background characteristics, social capital, cultural capital). The third block will include school and community context, and the final block will include the higher education context. Entering variables in these blocks will assess whether the measures improve the explanatory power of the logistic regression model. To answer the fourth research question, logistic regression will be used to examine the relationship between attendance at a historically Black college and participation in graduate education. Specifically, the model investigates the contribution of undergraduate HBCU attendance on college choice while controlling for all other variables."}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "In order to clarify and operationalize variables and frequently use expressions in this study, this section contains definitions of those reoccurring terms. Aspirations: the educational plans or expectations for degree attainment (Carter, 2002). In this study, the term is used interchangeably with expectations. Background characteristics: students' demographic characteristics as it relates to race/ethnicity, gender, age, and marital status. Black students: Within the context of this study, Black students are those people who self-identified as people of African descent. In this study, the term is used interchangeably with African Americans. College choice: Process in which students develop aspirations to continue formal education followed by a decision to attend (Hossler & Gallagher, 1987). Cultural capital: Cultural knowledge and value placed on college attainment (Perna, 2006). In this study, the highest level of education for both mother and father serves as a proxy for cultural capital. Graduate education: Pursuit of higher learning beyond the undergraduate degree. For the purpose of this study it includes participation in a degree programs that leads to a master's (e.g., MS, MA, MBA), professional (e.g., MD, DDS, JD), or doctoral (e.g., PhD, EdD) degree. The term will be used interchangeably with graduate/professional school, post baccalaureate, and postgraduate. Graduate enrollment: Enrollment in an accredited degree program for the pursuit of a master's (e.g., MS, MA, MBA), professional (e.g., MD, DDS, JD), or doctoral (e.g., PhD, EdD) degree. Habitus: The internalized system of beliefs and experiences obtained from one's social environment (McDonough, 1997;Perna, 2006). Students' habitus regarding college choice is expected to embody individuals' background characteristics, as well as cultural and social capital (Perna, 2006).

First, the focus of this study is African American graduate college choice. The study concentrates on this particular demographic of students because there is limited research on the distinct college choice processes of Black students (Freeman, 2005;McDonough et al., 1997). Additionally, the sample is delimited to Black students who earned an undergraduate degree in the 1992-93 academic year, and who participated in the 1994, 1997, and 2003 follow-up interviews. Thus, this study does not capture students who perhaps matriculated into graduate school after the 2003 follow-up. The next delimitation is that the study examined only 10 (academic achievement, financial aid, gender, age, marital status, parental education, parental support, undergraduate major, HBCU attendance, institutional control) indicators that explain the indicators that promote and hinder matriculation into graduate school. However, while generalizable, the study does not take into account additional issues that may contribute to graduate enrollment, such as number of dependents or the additional amount of financial aid received outside Pell grant award (e.g., work-study, scholarship, student loan)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "As with delimitations, there are certain limitations associated with this study. This study adapts Perna's (2006) proposed college choice model in order to reflect the decision making process of matriculating from undergraduate to graduate school, as opposed from high school to college (basic premise of the model). Therefore, the study will not employ some variables that lend itself to certain tenets of the choice model (i.e., economic, policy context). The adaptation of the conceptual model leads to the second limitation of this study. Secondary data analysis confines the researcher to available items that has already been established. This limits the researcher's ability to manipulate the survey or tool and to pose new questions. The final limitation involves the use of complex construct such as habitus. Because the survey does not offer precise measures of students' perception, Perna (2006) expands habitus regarding college choice to be comprised of students' background characteristics such as gender and age, cultural capital, and social capital. Carter (1999) suggested that the higher the percentage of African American students at an institution, the greater the impact on African American students' degree aspirations. Pascarella, Woniak, Pierson, and Flowers (2004) indicated that attendance at a historically Black college or university (HBCU) significantly influenced African American students' plans for a graduate degree. Additionally, Black students have an overall higher aspiration of obtaining a graduate degree than Whites and are less likely to lower their plans (Pascarella et al., 2004), yet their actual progression of obtaining that degree says otherwise. So, while there is acknowledgement that African Americans have high aspirations, their aspirations do not translate into college attendance (Freeman, 2005).\nThis study adapts Perna's (2006) proposed college choice model in order to reflect the decision making process of matriculating from undergraduate to graduate school, as opposed from high school to college. Moreover, the study does not employ variables that lend itself to tenets of the last contextual layer (i.e., economic, policy). The alteration of the conceptual model leads to the second limitation of this study, whereas secondary data analysis confines the researcher to available items that are established. This limits the researcher's ability to manipulate the survey tool and to pose new questions that perhaps capture a variable differently or more precisely. In addition, the study did not categorize the entire academic disciplines in which students were enrolled. This is due to several majors that could not be seamlessly positioned in Biglan's (1973) classification of academic majors of \"hard\" and \"soft\" disciplines. While retained approximately 80 percent of the student sample, this method of classification lost 19 percent or approximately 100 cases."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Study", "text": "There is extensive research examining the college choice process and to a lesser degree, the influence of race/ethnicity on college attendance, yet, little research has been dedicated to investigating Black graduate college choice. Understanding the issues that influence educational plans is an important focus as it speaks to the influences of educational attainment. Furthermore, identifying the issues and developing practices that enhance the likelihood of Black students to attend in graduate school would assist in the overall progression of fulfilling the educational goals and aspirations of a historically underrepresented population in higher education. The current study examines graduate education decisions for a national population of Black, four-year degree earners. This study attempts to add to the body of knowledge by researching African American college choice and more specifically, their registration in graduate/ professional school. Moreover, and of particular importance, this study helps to better understand the gap between students desire to participate and their actual participation in higher education. Establishing these links between an understanding of how students choose whether and where to attend college and the issues that enhance their decision-making can contribute to higher completion rates across the student populations (Bergerson, 2009). Though Black students complete graduate degrees at lower rates than White students do, it is essential to understand how their experiences affect choice, which consequently affects degree completion (Carter, 2001), thereby increasing the nation's pool for Black medical doctors, attorneys, and college professors."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "College choice is the process students undergo to make an appropriate decision regarding their participation in higher education. Moreover, the circumstances that influence this decision may vary by student. In this chapter, the researcher provided an introduction on the importance of college choice, an overview of college choice research, review of the conceptual model, purpose of the study, research design, definitions of terms, delimitations, limitations, and the significance of the study. In the next chapter, there will be a brief presentation of African Americans in postsecondary education followed by an extensive review of the literature related to the choice process of both undergraduate and graduate school participation.\nThe existing literature is limited in its ability to provide precise understandings of college choice of graduate students (Kallio, 1995), and more specifically, Black graduate students. The review presented here details the factors that contribute to the enrollment decisions of both undergraduate and graduate students. Drawing on the literature from both student types will later assist in developing a model that speaks more directly to the issues that surround prospective graduate students. In this chapter, the researcher shows how a model, initially designed to understand the college choice process of new college students, will be adapted to comprehend the same decisions of graduate college choice. In the next chapter, the methods for the study are presented. Also included are the research questions, identification of the population and sample, the data collection and procedures, instrumentation, and operational definitions of variables to be used in the study, as well as validity and reliability.\nFew existing models adequately examine graduate students' college choice. of each variable examined in the study, followed by the findings of the research questions, and concludes with a summary. The purpose of this study was to identify the issues (i.e., financial aid, academic achievement, habitus, school and community, and higher education context) that may influence Black, college graduates to enroll in graduate school, and to determine if attendance at a historically Black college and university (HBCU) influences enrollment choice decisions. To address the first research question, descriptive statistics of the 1992-93 bachelor degree recipients who enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program were compared to those students who, at the time of their graduation, had expectations of attaining a graduate degree, and those who had expectations 10 years later in 2003. Students' t values were then calculated to assess relative significance. The remaining research questions were analyzed using logistic regression to examine the factors that increased Black students' likelihood of participating in graduate school. Using the same dichotomous, dependent variable, questions two through four investigated a combination of ten independent variables to ascertain what contributes to the probability of enrollment choice. As previously mentioned in Chapter 3, this study includes ten predictor variables (i.e., undergraduate GPA, Pell grant amount, age, gender, marital status, parental support, parent's education, academic discipline, HBCU attendance, institutional control) that are collapsed into four blocks (i.e., academic achievement and financial aid; habitus; school and community context; higher education context). Though this study examines the effect of membership in a particular academic discipline has on graduate enrollment, not all undergraduate majors were coded into a \"hard\" or \"soft\" discipline. Categorizations are based on Biglan's (1973) classification and Stoecker's (1993) follow-up study. Appendix A presents those undergraduate majors included in the study, the coding scheme, and the percentage of Black students enrolled in those programs.\nEducation has had a special place in the hearts and minds of Black Americans since the Reconstruction Era (Mickelson, 1990). Education remains an important goal as evident by their desires to receive post-baccalaureate degrees. The exploration of graduate enrollment decisions of Black students in this study was framed using Perna's model. The adapted model in this study is not a definitive model of the process by which Black students choose to attend graduate school, but is useful as it provides some insight. Though other models may exist that contain salient factors believed to contribute to matriculation decisions, this study's analyses have provided an understanding of how the issues of academic achievement, financial aid, and cultural capital are exerted on graduate school choice."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "History of Black Higher Education in the United States", "text": "From slavery until now, African Americans have had to struggle to gain the opportunity to participate in any form of education. In 1850, there were approximately 4 million Blacks in America and roughly 500,000 whom were free. Less than 5 percent of them could read and write, and only 29 earned bachelor degrees between the years of 1619 and 1850 (Epps, 1991;Hirt, 2006;Wilson 1998). Following the Civil War, separate educational systems increased, yet a few African Americans braved racism and discrimination to earn bachelor and graduate degrees from White institutions in the northern states (Epps, 1991). Despite the opposition to access public education, these institutions, along with HBCUs, graduated almost all of America's Black teachers, doctors, and lawyers (Epps, 1991;Wilson 1998). African Americans have always recognized the value of an education, yet it has not always been afforded to them. During the early colonial years of U.S. history, Black Americans were prohibited from learning to read or write. These restrictions were designed to ensure submission while enslaved (A snapshot of African Americans in higher education, 2010). In the face of the risks and dangers, abolitionists and educated slaves remained committed to educating more African Americans by secretly offering them tutoring and instruction (Anderson, 1988; A snapshot of African Americans in higher education, 2010). From the founding of Harvard in 1636 to the 1830s American higher education excluded African Americans from participating. Oberlin College, however, admitted the first Black student in 1835 (Anderson, 2002). Prior to the Civil War, less than 30 African Americans had received bachelor degrees from a U.S. institution (Brown, 1999). However, with the end of the War, the federal government, through the Freedman's Bureau, and many southern missionaries shouldered the task of educating four million African Americans (Brown, 1999;Gasman, Lundy-Wagner, Ransom, & Bowman, 2010). From the Reconstruction era (1863-1877) through the Great Depression higher education for African Americans, especially in the South, existed through a system of private liberal arts colleges and federal government aid given to Black land-grant institutions (Anderson, 1988). Though they were called colleges, many of these institutions began as elementary and secondary schools (Brown, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "The Private Black College", "text": "Part of the developmental history of African Americans in higher education from 1865 to 1935 was due largely to relationships between philanthropists and Black communities. Three separate philanthropic groups, missionaries, Black religious organizations, and industrial philanthropy (e.g., corporate foundations and wealthy individuals) were major contributors of higher education during this period (Anderson, 1988;Roebuck & Murty, 1993). Beginning in the late nineteenth century, these groups debated the role of higher in the overall structure, the purpose of Black education, and the relationship of classical liberal training to larger issues of Black political and economic life (Anderson, 1988). The northern missionary societies, which were instrumental in the establishment of institutions of higher education for ex-slaves, were also responsible for sustaining the leading Black colleges (Anderson, 1988). One of the most prominent of these White organizations was the American Missionary Association (AMA). These missionaries' goals of establishing colleges were to convert former slaves to Christianity and to rid the country of the \"menace\" of uneducated African Americans (Anderson, 1988). Ran and staffed by northern missionaries, these schools taught former slaves how to read, trained African Americans for the clergy, and trained future teachers (Roebuck & Murty, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "The leading Black philanthropic organization was the African Methodist", "text": "Episcopal church, which paved the way for Black religious denominations to establish and maintain colleges for Black students. Inasmuch, Black religious organizations owned very few of the total number of Black college. Less than 15 percent of Black college students attended institutions sponsored by these organizations. The Black colleges supported and controlled by White missionary philanthropists enrolled a majority of Black college and professional students (Anderson, 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Missionary philanthropists supported classical liberal education for Black", "text": "Americans as a means to achieve racial equality in civil and political life. \"They assumed that the newly emancipated Blacks would move into mainstream national culture, largely free to do and become what they chose, limited only by their own intrinsic worth and effort\" (Anderson, 1998, p. 240). Because of their view of the need for well-trained Black leadership, the missionaries made liberal culture rather than industrial training the chief aim of their curriculum. The courses in Black colleges controlled by missionaries were similar to those in a majority of contemporary liberal arts schools. Industrial training had no major role in the missionaries' philosophy and program of training a leadership class to guide the ex-slaves in their social, economic, and political development (Anderson, 1998). Industrial philanthropy, which mirrored the growth of missionary and Black religious philanthropy, placed heavy emphasis on industrial training. The industrial philanthropic foundations viewed the missionary's program of developing African Americans in higher education as misguided (Anderson, 1988). Convinced that what Blacks needed most to learn was the discipline of manual labor and the boundaries of their environment. Industrial philanthropists generally opposed the development of Black higher education and did not change their position until after World War I. Due to the lack of federal and state support for the development of Black higher education, the opposition of industrial philanthropy, and the lack of capital maintained by missionary and Black religious philanthropy, the development of African American higher education was relatively stagnant during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The relative impoverishment of Black colleges and universities made it difficult for them to increase their already diminutive college-level enrollment. Only 58 of the 99 Black colleges had any collegiate students. The lack of good academic elementary and secondary schools for southern Black students forced the Black colleges to provide training for students at lower levels to help meet the educational needs of local Black communities."}, {"section_title": "The Public Black College", "text": "The Morrill Act of 1862, and later of 1890 is one of the most important laws enacted by Congress influencing higher education (Cohen, 1998). In 1862, Congress established a national system of land-grant universities and institutions to promote scientific investigation and experimentation. The land-grant universities grew from the Morrill Act in which Congress donated public lands to support colleges that would emphasize agriculture and mechanical arts as well as the traditional classical curriculum. However, because of the segregationist society that existed, the government had to revise the Morrill Act of 1862, issuing the Act of 1890. The Morill Act of 1890 specifically prohibited federal funds to states that discriminated against Blacks in admission to tax supported colleges or who refused to provide separate but equal facilities. The latter phrase led to the establishment of dual public land-grant institutions in seventeen of nineteen southern states (Brown, 1999). States were given the choice either to show that race was not an admissions criterion in schools or to designate a separate land-grant institution for Black students (Brown, 1999;Gasman et al., 2010). The Morrill Act of 1890 offered all states, including those in the South, the opportunity to establish public institutions of higher education that offered training in agriculture and mechanical arts. From the federal perspective, the policy was designed to promote agricultural productivity in rural areas, however, from the perspective of southern states, the Morrill Act justified efforts to create a new social order in which Whites were superior to Blacks (Hirt, 2006). Roebuck and Murty (1993) attest that southern state governments created public Black colleges for three reasons: 1) to get millions of dollars in federal funds for the development of White land-grant institutions; 2) to limit African American education to vocational training; and 3) to prevent Black students from attending White land-grant colleges. Of the 19 southern states, all decided to establish separate systems of higher education between 1890 and 1899 (Gasman et al., 2010). These institutions competed for resources and support with the private Black colleges that had been founded before 1890 (Hirt, 2006) and none initially conferred baccalaureate degrees (Roebuck & Murty, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "The Academic Curriculum", "text": "As previously mentioned, disputes arose in the late 1800s on the proper academic curriculum African Americans should receive regarding their education. Before emancipation in 1860, the illiteracy rate among Blacks was 95 percent (Gasman et al., 2010;Hirt, 2006;Wilson 1998). Both public and private Black colleges chose to emphasize teacher and ministry preparation (Gasman et al., 2010;Palmer, 2010). However, by 1890, all Black colleges incorporated some kind of industrial course in their curriculum. Attempting to mimic the academics of White institutions, Black colleges faced a dilemma in creating an appropriate curriculum to meet the needs of their students (Gasman et al., 2010). From the beginning, the education of Blacks revolved around the debate over what form this learning should take. From 1890 on, the evolution of Black colleges were intertwined with the issue of the purpose of these institutions. There were approximately 35 public and private Black colleges at the time that fell into one of two curricular types (Hirt, 2006). The first type of institution offered vocational education for Black Americans, of which the Hampton Institute served as the prototype (Hirt, 2006). Booker T. Washington, a graduate of the Hampton Institute, was a spokesperson of the industrial education approach. Because agriculture and industrialization were evolving, Washington was convinced that Black Americans should be educated in these areas. Conversely, W. E. B. Du Bois believed that Black institutions should develop their students to become professionals and leaders of the Black population, and was to be accomplished through a classical education. Du Bois felt that vocational training for Blacks limited their aspirations and reinforced White suppression (Hirt, 2006). Though Washington and Du Bois promoted distinct curricular forms, the decision to adopt either concept was controlled by White philanthropists, missionaries, or the government (Allen & Jewel, 2002;Palmer, 2010). Because many of the Black colleges functioned as multilevel schools, offering secondary, college preparatory, and college level work, there were issues of standardization. Between 1900 and 1954, seven studies were conducted to address the content, quality, and ways to improve education in Black schools (Hirt, 2006;Roebuck & Murty, 1993). Two of the reports conducted by DuBois, identified those institutions whose curriculum had developed sufficiently enough that they could be called colleges and then stratified those colleges into tiers based on academic quality and the number of registered students. In addition, other reports by the Phelps-Stokes Foundation, an education foundation, and the federal government, offered recommendations that included calls for increased financial support for Black colleges (Anderson, 1988;Hirt, 2006). By 1930, the majority of Black institutions had developed into full colleges, had dropped non-college courses, and were requiring all admits to have high school diplomas (Hirt, 2006). However, the growth of graduate education at these institutions was slow in comparison to undergraduate programs as only five private Black colleges offered graduate courses prior to 1937 (Gasman et al., 2010). Nevertheless, both private and public colleges during this period improved their faculty preparation, library holdings, curricular offerings, facilities, organization and administration, and financial base. In 1931, 31 Black colleges had received the approval of the American Medical Association to provide premedical courses, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) agreed to establish accrediting procedures of Black institutions (Roebuck & Murty, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Desegregation in Higher Education", "text": "Black institutions, later titled Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) following the Civil Rights Act, were created to provide access to higher education for Black Americans. Originating out of a social system that condoned slavery, these institutes educated approximately 2,600 students by 1915 (Brown, 1999;Wilson, 1998). Following the Civil War, states were required to provide a public school education for all citizens, however the mandate was not well received by southern states (Brown, 1999;Roebuck & Murty, 1993). As previously mentioned, the Morill Acts led to an explosion of public institutions in the United States. In 1870 there were approximately 63,000 students registered across 250 institutions (Cohen, 1998). Yet, as perhaps an unknown consequence, the 1890 Morrill Act further solidified the division among Blacks and Whites (Brown, 1999). This disjunction in society, and education more specifically, was soon sanctioned in six years by the Plessy v. Ferguson court case of 1896. Innately not an educational access case, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson was that separate but equal was the law of the country. It allowed states to establish racial segregation if accommodations and public facilities were equal. However, it did not give guidance on how to achieve these goals (Brown, 1999). The Court's ruling lead to the enactment of state segregation laws prohibiting Black and White students to attend the same institutions (Brown, 1999;Roebuck & Murty, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Several years later in 1904, the grand jury of Madison County, Kentucky indicted", "text": "Berea College for unlawfully and willfully permitting and receiving White and Black students as students. The Berea College v Kentucky ruling is significant because it is the first case involving segregated higher education to be addressed by the Courts, and the only higher education case in which the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of separate but equal as permissible. However, because of Berea's status as a private college, the impact of the case was limited (Brown, 1999). Though many of Black Americans resided in southern states in 1930s, several states maintained only one public institution to educate their Black populace while maintaining multiple institutions for its White students. These states included Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Thus, the four states with largest proportions of Black citizens (Alabama, 36%; Louisiana, 37%; Mississippi, 50%; South Carolina, 46%) supported a total of four public higher education institutions for them, while maintaining 23 public colleges for White students (Anderson, 2002).  (Brown, 1999;Hunter, 2006). Similar to the Murray and Gaines suit before it, the Sweatt v. Painter case of 1950 involved a Black student, Sweatt, who was denied admission to the University of Texas Law School. Because there were no law schools in Texas that admitted African Americans, and to comply with the equal but separate laws, the state of Texas opened a new law program that admitted only Black students (Hunter, 2006). Dissatisfied with the resolution, Sweatt rejected the offer and filed suit under the equal protection clause. In the Sweatt case, the Supreme Court ruled in Sweatt's favor and iterated that there was substantial inequality in the segregated law schools (Brown, 1999). Ferguson ruling that \"separate but equal\" was unconstitutional. The case began with a seven-year old, Linda Brown, who was denied admission to an elementary school, four blocks from her house in Topeka, Kansas. The Court ruled that the separate but equal policy had no place in the field of public education, and as a result, desegregation of public education became a mandate (Brown, 1999;Horsford, 2011;Hunter, 2006;Roebuck & Murty, 1993). However, much resistance to desegregation of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education continued through the 1950s and 1960s. Significant changes of access to higher education would not occur for African Americans until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964."}, {"section_title": "African American Participation in Higher Education", "text": "From 1965 to 1980, Black Americans increased their matriculation into higher education from 600,000 to 1.2 million (Wilson, 1998). Up to the early 1990s, the majority of these students attended HBCUs (Wilson, 1998). The dramatic increase in Black student enrollment in higher education could perhaps be largely contributed to two federal initiatives: the GI Bill and the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Wilson, 1998). The authorization of the GI Bill increased the number of military veterans able to attend. Turner and Bound (2003) further suggested that initially only 7 percent of enlisted men during World War II planned to go to college after the war, but after the announcement of the GI Bill, 29 percent of White enlisted personnel and 43 percent of Black enlistees expressed an interest in continuing their education. Additionally, the Civil Rights Act opened doors for more African Americans to choose and register at traditionally White institutions by restricting federal funds to segregated schools and colleges (Cohen, 1998;Freeman & McDonald, 2004). Those segregated institutions were persuaded to desegregate for fear of losing federal funding. Thus by 1980, African American participation in higher education nearly doubled (Wilson, 1980). Though today Black Americans are still challenged by the barriers associated with higher education participation and opportunity, participation gains have occurred from 1996 to 2006. Ryu (2009) reported that in 1996, minority students represented 26 percent of the undergraduate student population. Approximately 11 percent of these students were African Americans (see Table 1). In 2006, minority students' participation increased by 48 percent, of which African Americans constituted 12 percent. Moreover, African Americans increased their total entrance into undergraduate education by 44 percent; this was the second largest percentage change of any ethnic group. Though the percent change was 20 percent below the Hispanic student population, Black students still represented the largest minority student population in undergraduate education (Ryu, 2009). Increases in enrollment have also been experienced in graduate/ professional degree programs. The earliest graduate courses were offered at Yale in 1847 followed by the institution awarding the first Ph.D. in 1861, however, the awarding of doctoral degrees to Black Americans began in 1876-the first being to Edward Bouchet who earned a doctorate in physics from Yale University (Perkins, 2009). In 1900, there were 3,880 Black students in colleges and professional schools and fewer than 400 graduates of college and professional programs (Anderson, 1988). By 2006, participation grew to approximately 240,000 African American students advancing to a graduate/first-professional program. In spite of the enrollment growth over the 106 years, Black students only comprised of 9 percent of the total graduate/ professional school participants in 2006 compared to Whites students that represented an overwhelming majority of 58 percent (Ryu, 2009). Black students in master's degree programs take on debt in order to finance their education. On the other hand, only 38 percent of White graduate students take out student loans (NCES, 2004). Enrollment into graduate school is often broken down to a set of demographic and profile characteristics including: students' background (e.g., socioeconomic status, race, gender), characteristics of the undergraduate institution attended (e.g., selectivity, size), undergraduate experiences (e.g., social, academic integration), financial aid offered at the graduate level (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Millet, 2003), and social and cultural capital issues, such as parental involvement (Freeman, 2005;Perna, 2004). Despite increased efforts to provide educational opportunities that are more accessible to minority students, African Americans are less likely to attain a post bachelor's education (Carter, 2001). Over the course of the decades, various refinements have been made to incorporate the increasingly diverse student population especially concerning students of color and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds (Bergerson, 2009). This chapter presents research that examines college choice decisions of both undergraduate and graduate students, and begins by describing the model that some researchers (Freeman, 2005;Hamrick & Stage, 2004;Kallio, 1995;McDonough, 1997;Perna, 2006;Pitre, 2006) have used to examine choice, as well as the conceptual framework used to frame this study."}, {"section_title": "College Choice Models", "text": "Since there are few models of graduate college choice (Kallio, 1995), researchers have borrowed from the undergraduate literature. Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) Three Stage Model of College Choice is well known and highly referenced (Kallio, 1995;Pitre, 2006). Hossler, Braxton, and Coopersmith (1989) defined college choice as a \"complex, multistage process during which an individual develops aspirations to continue formal education beyond high school, followed later by a decision to attend a specific college, university or institution of advanced vocational training\" (p. 7). According to Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) model, students' backgrounds, attributes, activities, and institutional characteristics interact to influence the decisionmaking process of college choice. Students pass through a series of stages and first enter predisposition, during which societal and economic factors generate interest and attitudes conducive to college enrollment. Family background, academic ability, and early preferences of postsecondary participation influence students' aspirations to specific degree attainment and to seek college information. After predisposition, students transition to the second stage, search. In the search stage, students explore different institutions of higher education and evaluate how they relate to specific colleges and universities. The final stage, choice, students evaluate their options, develop a ranking order of personal preference, and subsequently enroll in an institution of higher education (Hossler & Gallagher, 1987). For the purpose of this study, college choice will be defined as enrollment in a graduate/ professional degree program. In addition, Hossler and Gallagher (1987) interpret college choice as sequential, while other lenses (e.g., Jackson Combined Model, Chapman Model, Hanson & Litten Model) view the process somewhat differently (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999). Perna's (2006)  The first layer, habitus, Perna (2006) borrows from Bourdieu and Passeron's (1977) social reproduction theory, which includes factors of student's background characteristics such as race/ ethnicity, social class, parents' education, and the presence of social and cultural capital. Bourdieu and Passeron's (1977) social reproduction theory, or cultural wealth principle, postulates that individuals operating in institutions, such as schools make socially constrained choices that serve to reproduce the existing social order (as cited in Bergerson, 2009). Individuals with the kinds of capital that are recognized and rewarded by organizations are able to navigate those systems more simply than those whose capital is not valued (Bergerson, 2009). \"The cultural wealth lens argues that when students' cultural capital is recognized and valued by schools, they achieve higher levels of success\" (Bergerson, 2009, p. 41). Ogbu (1995) describes this as cultural infusion, and without this support, Plank and Jordan (2001) indicate that highability, low socioeconomic (SES) students are unlikely to attend college. Moreover, Perna (2006) also attests that studying students' habitus toward college enrollment could shed some light on students' decisions to become academically prepared for higher education. The second layer, school and community context, reflects how social structures and resources influence or impede student college choice (Perna, 2006). Freeman (2005) suggests that in order for African American students to decide to enroll into college they need aspiration, ability, and cultural support. The school and community context is reflected by the type of support from school counselors, educational expectations of family and peers, and involvement in extracurricular activities. Because of the social and environmental constraints that exist, cultural support is necessary to enable African American students to begin and complete the college search process (Muhammad, 2008). The third layer, the higher education context of Perna's model, emphasizes how higher education institutions shape college choice. Perna noted that college and universities can be a source of information to students and their families about enrollment possibilities and influence students passively through their location and distance to students' homes and aggressively by marketing and recruitment. Characteristics of an institution also influences student choice as students prefer to attend schools with characteristics similar to their personal and social identities, and select institutions that meets their needs for personal acceptance (Perna, 2006). Lastly, and perhaps the most obvious, higher education institutions affect college choice through accepting and denying students for admissions. Perna (2006) viewed the school and community context in relation to high school and its environment. However, this study presents some overlap with the higher education component. She hypothesized that the secondary school context would not have an effect as large as students' most recent schooling experience-undergraduate education. Since students in this study are college graduates, school and community context includes the academic program at undergraduate institution, while the higher education context embodies the particular characteristics of the institution (e.g. public, private) students attend. The fourth layer, the social, economic, and policy context, includes labor market trends, population demographics, and policies that support and/ or discourage college enrollment (Bergerson, 2009). Key pieces that Roksa (2010) noted within this lens are facets of the state policy, governance, and financial context. Incorporating the social, economic, and policy context into the model recognizes the connection between policy and college choice (Perna, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Perna 's (2006)  Perna's college choice comprises of habitus, school and community, higher education, and social, economic, and policy, which are contextual layers that form the perception of how students assess the opportunity costs of enrolling into college. This study will address how these elements influence the decision of Black students to enroll into a graduate/ professional degree program. However, as per the limitation of this study as discussed in Chapter 1, the last contextual layer (i.e. policy, economic) was not included in the analysis. Figure 1 is a graphical representation after adapting Perna's model.

Social psychological studies examine students' self-assessment of their fit to the college they have chosen in regards to cost, location and social climate; economic studies tend to view choice as an investment decision related to perceived benefits and costs; and sociological status attainment research reviews the impact of social status on the development of aspirations for educational attainment (McDonough, 1997). Adapting Perna's (2006) framework, this study draws on selected elements from these three approaches to identify the influences of graduate college choice of Black collegians."}, {"section_title": "Understanding Habitus", "text": "McDonough (1997) suggests that students' decisions about college are based on sensible or reasonable choices, and it is habitus that subconsciously defines what is reasonable (Perna, 2006). Every aspect of an individual's social condition contributes to the development of habitus (Horvat, 2003). Moreover, Bourdieu and Passeron (1977) articulate habitus as being a common set of perceptions held by all members of the same group or class that shapes an individual's expectations, attitudes, and aspirations. These perceptions shape what opportunities individuals believe they have afforded to them. Perna (2006) notes an individual's habitus regarding college choice encompasses his/ her demographic characteristics, such as race/ ethnicity and gender, cultural capital (e.g., cultural knowledge and value of college attainment), and social capital (e.g., information about college and assistance with the college process). Because the notion of habitus comprise background characteristics and experiences of individuals, it is useful in investigations focused on race in education (Horvat, 2003). The cultural context. Experience is culturally defined and through culture, individuals' realities are constructed (Alexander-Snow, 1998;Freeman, 1998). The context of cultural can be defined as interrelated characteristics that provide a perspective, or frame of reference, for understanding individuals and/ or groups' ways of knowing and being (Freeman, 1998). Banks (1988) indicates that while not every individual in a group holds a particular view, it does mean that some perspectives occur more frequently within a cultural group than do others (as cited in Freeman, 1998). Culture is socially constituted, as it is a product of present and past activity (Alexander-Snow, 1998 (1983), claims that because of the history of poor education for Black students in the United States, African American parents and students have developed a distrust for schooling, and this distrust prevents students from internalizing the values of education and accepting the criteria for success (as cited in Carter, 2001). Ogbu's research on educational experiences of African Americans has led to the development of the caste theory of minority group members (Carter, 2001). Ogbu (2008) asserts that to understand why cultures and languages make learning difficult for some minorities, it is important to recognize there are different types of minority groups: voluntary and involuntary (Ogbu, 2008). Voluntary minorities (e.g., Chinese) are people who have moved \"more or less\" voluntarily to any society because they desire better overall opportunities, and their expectations influence the way they perceive and respond to events (i.e., schooling) in their host society. On the other hand, involuntary minorities are people who were originally brought into the U.S. or any other society against their will through slavery, conquest, colonization, or forced labor (e.g., Native Americans, Mexican Americans, African Americans) (Ogbu, 2008). Ogbu hypothesized that voluntary minority groups do not perceive racial barriers in American society, but view the host society as a land of opportunity in comparison to their home country. However, involuntary minority groups have negative views of society and of their chances to succeed in society (Carter, 2001). Pitre 2006 As aforementioned in the layers that forms the premise of Perna's (2006) model, the following section describes the impact of academic preparation and achievement; habitus in regards to race/ ethnicity, gender, age, number of dependents and marital status, social and cultural capital; degree aspirations; school and community; institutional characteristics; economics and state policy has on college choice."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Academic Preparedness and Achievement", "text": "Perhaps the single most important contributors to college enrollment are preparation and achievement (Astin, 1982;Perna, 2006). Academic achievement is an essential aspect of college choice as it affects a student's ability to maintain aspirations for college because parents, teachers, and counselors are more likely to support the aspirations of those students who display higher levels of academic achievement (Pitre, 2006). Through Perna's (2004) review of the literature, she explained that academic preparation is essential to college enrollment, even after controlling for variables. Moreover, Nevill and Chen (2007) Camara and Schmidt (1999) assert that there are consistent and significant differences between White and minority test-takers and differences in regards to SES (Camara & Schmidt 1999;Schmidt & Camara 2004) which led to claims of bias. The Educational Testing Service (ETS) and the GRE program have acknowledge the existence of differences in the mean scores achieved by different ethnic and racial groups stimulating from unequal knowledge and skills perhaps due to educational, economic, and social systems (GRE, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Race/ Ethnicity", "text": "Allen's (1992) research sought to understand the effects of individual and institutional characteristics on student outcomes by employing a multivariate approach to investigate the relationships between students' outcomes of academic achievement, social involvement, occupational aspirations, students' educational backgrounds and goals, demographic characteristics, and personal adjustment to college and its environment. Surveys were administered to Black undergraduates at six predominately White public universities, resulting in a sample size of 2,500 students. Allen (1992) reported that academic achievement is highest for students who have high educational aspirations and who aspire to prestigious and powerful occupations report. Allen (1992) also found that campus racial composition is correlated with academic achievement, high school grades, relations with professors, and class level. African American students who attend predominantly White universities reported lower college grades, higher grades in high school, less favorable relations with faculty, and are typically younger than their peers attending HBCUs (Allen, 1992). In addition to what Allen (1992) revealed about educational aspirations, Pascarella, Wolniak, Pierson, and Flowers (2004) argue that students customarily lowered their degree aspirations as they progress through college. In their study, while almost 92 percent of the sample planned to earn a degree when they entered college, only 81 percent had this goal at the end of their third year. Building upon the status attainment model, Pascarella et al. (2004) employed a longitudinal study using the National Study of Student Learning (NSSL), to identify significant academic and nonacademic influences on graduate degree plans during college, and to investigate how those variables impact graduate degree plans by race. The study examined 1,089 students from 18 four-year colleges and universities across 15 different states for a time of three years, beginning in 1992. The authors' goals were to determine differences existed among African American, Hispanic and White students graduate degree plans after completing three years of college. The major finding using logistic regression revealed that at the end of the third year, all students lowered their plans for a graduate degree, however, White students lowered their plans more than African American and Hispanic students (Pascarella et al., 2004). The authors noted that race may have a unique causal influence which educational plans are lowered during college. Nevertheless, African American and Hispanic students were still more likely than White students to plan for obtaining a graduate degree after completing three years of college, and they were less likely than Whites to lower their plans for a graduate degree. Though some studies concluded that Black students have higher aspirations of college attendance than Whites (Carter, 1999;Pascarella et al., 2004), Pitre's (2006) study indicated that African Americans' aspirations did not differ from White students. Utilizing survey data gathered by the Maryland Bridge Project to conduct analyses of African and White ninth grade students in the predisposition stage of Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) college choice model, Pitre (2006) determined that despite after controlling for variables, such as parental encouragement, academic achievement, academic track, perception of preparation, SES, and gender, analyses following logistical regression revealed that African American students were neither more or less likely to aspire to attended college compared to their White peers."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Gender", "text": "Commencing in the 1980s, the overall college enrollment rates began to increase, but at a faster rate for women as compared to men (Perna, 2006). Since the 1990s, college enrollment rates have been and continue to be higher for women than men. The Council of Graduate Schools (2008) reported that female graduate enrollment between 1997 and 2007 increased at an average annual rate of 4 percent, compared to 2 percent for males. Moreover, in relation to degree type, women outnumbered men in enrollment in master's degree programs (60.5% versus 39.5) and doctoral degrees (50.1% versus 49.9%) (Ryu, 2009). Additionally, the largest disparity within any race/ethnic is between Black women and Black men, as the enrollment of Black students in graduate and professional education is comprise of approximately 72 percent females and 28 percent males (Planty et al., 2009). Comprehending how African American males and females approach the process of deciding to enroll in graduate school can provide suggestions as to why each gender chooses to participate in higher education at varied rates (Freeman, 2005). Researchers noted that there were distinct variations between male and female aspirations for enrollment in graduate education. Pascarella, Wolniak, Pierson, and Flowers (2004) suggested that being female and older tends to inhibit plans for a graduate degree. Ethington and Smart (1986) asserted that men attending a more selective institution are more likely to attend graduate school, while women are more positively influenced by the size of an institution. Testing a conceptual framework based on an econometric theoretical model, Perna (2004) explored the differences sex and race/ ethnicity have on post-baccalaureate enrollment. The study is an expansion of the customary econometric approach in which it also included measures of social and cultural capital. Perna measured social capital as the financial support students received from their parents and measured cultural capital as parental educational attainment and whether English was the language most often spoken at home. The research study used 9,241 cases from the 1997 follow-up to the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) survey of 1992/93 bachelor's degree recipients. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between sex race/ ethnicity and post baccalaureate enrollment. Perna (2004) discovered that female, compared to male bachelor degree recipients, who do not take the SAT or ACT or have scores in the lowest quartile are, not as likely to enroll in a first professional degree program. Perna (2004) also indicated that a larger proportion of women (24 percent) did not take a standardized test compared to 17percent of men who also did not take either. The investigation also emphasized that higher percentages of women than men enroll in master level programs and below, and that smaller proportion of women enroll in doctoral and first professional programs. Even after controlling for race/ ethnicity, women were still more likely than men to enroll in either a master's degree program or below, but less likely than men to enroll in a first-professional degree program. The study reported that the chances of enrolling in a master's degree program are higher for both Black men and women than for White men and women. In addition, Perna stated that being Black increases the odds of enrolling in a professional degree program for women even after controlling for financial and academic resources, cultural capital, and social capital (Perna, 2004). Similar to Perna's (2004)  African American male bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 (i.e., 10 years after they received an undergraduate degree). This group included 21 percent that completed a graduate degree, 14 percent who were enrolled in graduate school at the time of data collection, and 6 percent who had dropped out. Blacks who aspired to earn a terminal degree were more likely than those who had lower aspirations to complete a graduate degree within 10 years of college graduation. Black men who aspired to the doctorate were just as likely as those who desired a master's degree to be enrolled in graduate school by 2003."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Cultural and Social Capital", "text": "Cultural and social capital can influence expectations about graduate enrollment through the lens in which students view costs and benefits (Perna, 2004). Cultural capital is referred to as a \"symbolic good\" that may provide students with access to resources that promote college-going behaviors (McDonough, 1997;Perna, 2006), and social capital is referred as social networks and the way those networks are maintained. Research posits that cultural and social capital is expressed through parents' educational attainment (McDonough, 1997), parental encouragement (Hamrick & Stage, 2004), and parental involvement (Perna, 2006;Perna & Titus, 2005;Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, Perna, 2008). Perna (2006) further noted that \"cultural capital may be manifested in terms of cultural knowledge and the value [parents] place on college attainment\" (p. 138) while social capital manifested through information about college and the assistance with college process. Perna and Titus (2005) noted that there are two types of relationships in which social capital can be derived: the relationship between a student and his/her parent; and relationships between a student's parent and other adults (e.g., school officials, student's friends' parents). This study examined the relationship between parental involvement, as a form of social capital, and college enrollment. Perna and Titus (2005) examined parental-student involvement (i.e., parent student discussions, parental monitoring), parent-school involvement (i.e., frequency parents report contacting their child's school about academic issues, behavioral problems, and educational opportunities), and parentto-parent involvement (i.e., number of student's friends' parents with whom a parent reports talking. Using a hierarchical linear multinomial modeling, the authors investigated a sample of 9,810 survey responses from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) to understand how parental involvement contributed to attendance at a 2-year college, 4-year college or university, or decision to not enroll into college. The authors concluded that the likelihood for enrollment in a 2 or 4-year institution increased with the frequency of parental contact with school about volunteering, academic matters, and educational opportunities. Students' aspiration of higher educational attainment is influenced by many factors, one in part due to parental influence. Likewise, research notes that parental education levels do influence educational attainment (Ethington & Smart, 1987;Hamrick & Stage, 2004;Mullen, Goyette & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2004). Mullen, Goyette, and Soares (2003) work addressed the impact parental education has on students' graduate educational attainment. Using 9,241 observations from the B&B (1993/ 1997) longitudinal study, the authors investigated enrollment by disaggregating graduate programs by type. Multinomial logistic regression indicates that the role of parents' education indirectly affects student's enrollment into master's programs, first professional, and doctoral programs, but has no effect on entry into MBA programs. In addition, Strayhorn's examination (2009) of parents' level of education was associated with Black males' enrollment in graduate school. Moreover, Hamrick and Stage (2004) reported African American students' predisposition were directly affected by parents' education and parents' expectations for their students' education attainment. African American men who had parents with an advanced degree were more likely to enroll in graduate school than those who had parents with less education (Strayhorn, 2009). Likewise, similar to that of undergraduate enrollment, students whose parents have a college degree enter higher education at 30 percent higher rates than students who were first generational college students (Pascarella et al., 2004). Also investigating the impact of parental education, Carter's (2001) Carter (2001) sought to uncover the influences that led students to aspire for the doctoral (PhD), medical (MD), and juris doctorate (JD) degrees. In the CIRP dataset, Carter found that father's educational attainment had a positive effect on aspirations among African American students, but no effect for White students in either dataset. She also discovered that the mother's educational attainment is positively influenced aspirations for both groups and high parental income negatively impacts White students aspirations with no effect on African American students. Hamrick and Stage (2004) explored college choice for a random sample of 300 students attending schools with high-minority enrollment and low income. Using the dataset from the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Study, the authors ultimately discover that the predisposition phase was influenced by family background and school experiences. These families encouraged educational activities at home and were more involved at school. Hamrick and Stage (2004) study further showed that White students participation in community activities led to higher reported interactions with educational mentors, which in turn transmitted additional information about attending college, while for African Americans, having at least one college educated parent, having a high SES, being female, and participating in community activities had a positive effects on parental expectations. Cultural capital is the knowledge that middle and upper-class individuals value yet schools do not teach (McDonough, 1997). When parents support college aspirations students have a greater likelihood to attend (Hamrick & Stage, 2004). Hamrick and Stage (2004) indicated the two factors that most greatly affected African American students' predisposition were parents' education and parents' expectations for students' education attainment. The value placed on higher education contributes to the awareness that opportunities exist and are attainable."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Age, Dependents, and Marital Status", "text": "Though not as extensively studied as other background characteristics, when examining age as it relates to graduate school enrollment, research has shown that 48 percent of students age 22 and younger at the time they receive their undergraduate degree enroll in graduate or professional school (Neville & Chen, 2007). However, by the time most enroll in graduate school, Redd (2006) indicated that the majority are over 30, have a spouse or young children, and consider themselves primarily employees who are attending school, while those enrolled in a professional program tend to be younger than 30, are unmarried and have no children or other financial responsibilities, are enrolled full-time. In contradiction, other research shows that the higher the degree attained the less likely an individual will be married and results in an increased likelihood they are single and never been married (Bradburn, Nevill, & Cataldi, 2006). Research also showed that individuals who were married when they received their bachelor's degree were less likely to enroll in graduate education (Nevill & Chen, 2007). Strayhorn (2009) showed that Black men who are younger at B.A. receipt were more likely than those who were older to have completed a graduate degree by 2003. African American men who took 5-6 years to earn their bachelor's degree were more likely to enroll in graduate school than those who took more than 6 years to complete their B.A. (17 percent vs. 13 percent). African American men who took more than 6 years to complete their undergraduate degree were more likely to drop out of graduate school. More married men had completed a graduate degree than had those who were single and never married (23 percent vs. 18 percent). Those without dependents were more likely than those with dependents to have completed a graduate degree. Black men who worked in technical fields were more likely than those in business/ management fields to be enrolled in graduate school. Lastly, Black men in the highest salary ranges were more likely than those in lowest to have completed graduate school. Strayhorn (2009) concluded that educational aspirations, age, and salary are associated with enrollment in and completion of graduate degree program."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Degree Aspirations", "text": "Research indicates that high aspirations may mitigate the negative effects of low SES on college attendance (Carter, 2002). Strayhorn (2009) states that those African American males who had higher educational aspirations at the point of B.A. receipt were more likely to enroll in or complete graduate school within 10 years, while Kim and Eyermann (2006) report students who had low degree aspirations as freshmen were less likely to plan to attend graduate school than students who had high degree aspirations (i.e., medicine or law). Moreover, students with master's or doctoral degree aspirations were less likely to plan to attend graduate school than those who aspired for a professional degree (Kim & Eyermann, 2006). Therefore, high aspirations have assisted students, especially African Americans, in achieving their goals. Researchers cannot pinpoint why the patterns of relationships between variables in models explaining African Americans' aspirations differ so greatly from the relationships in White students (Carter, 2002). Portes and Wilson (1976) suggested that White students' higher attainments are due to their advantages in background variables and characteristics (as cited in Carter, 2002). While minority students have the aspirations, the ability, and the qualifications to attend a four year college, they do not at the college of their choice, or to the same degree that White students do (Carter, 2002). What is especially lacking in discussions of educational aspirations of African American, Latino, and White students is the role that educational institutions play in the development and maintenance of aspirations (Carter, 2002). Focusing on the ways in which institutions contribute to the development of aspirations shifts away from cultural and individual characteristics and toward the types of educational environments that are most conducive for educational attainment (Carter, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of School and Community", "text": "Habitus exists not only in families and communities, but also in organizational contexts (McDonough, 1997). McDonough (1997) asserted that organizational habitus is a way to understand how institutions produce social inequalities. Nora (2004) described it as a fit between a student's values, belief system, and the academic environment. Nevertheless, organizational habitus refers to the impact social class and culture has on students college choices through an intermediate organization (McDonough, 1997), in this case, the high school and postsecondary institution. Pitre's (2006) study found that students who indicated high school was not preparing them well for admission to the college of their choice were less likely to aspire to college attendance when compared to students who indicated that the high school was preparing them \"somewhat well\". Descriptive analysis of the 241 student sample revealed that students' aspirations for college attendance were related to their perceptions of how well the high school was preparing them for college. Further analysis showed that students who believe that high school was not preparing them were 33percent less likely to aspire to college, and students who were not sure of their perception of preparation were also less likely to aspire. Pitre's (2006) study also found that lack of information can potentially weaken African American students' aspirations for college attendance in the latter stages of the college choice process and/ or doubt their ability to attend. Freeman's (1999) uncovered three themes associated with factors that influence African American students and their decision making process about attending college: family or self-influences (e.g., a family member wanted the student to achieve education beyond their level), psychological or social barriers (e.g., college never presented to the student as an option), and cultural awareness (e.g., integrating Black history into the curriculum). Data were gathered from 70 students participating in 16 different group interviews. Researchers conducted interviews with African American students from 10 th to 12 th grades in five cities with large African American populations. Students whose parents or family members had not attended college tend to express they received strong feelings from parents about going \"beyond their socioeconomic status\". Another rational that a student often expressed was that college had never been presented as an option. Freeman (1999) also found that there was an intimidation factor associated with the desire to attend college. Students attending both private and public schools, who had visited a college or university, expressed similar sentiments of standing out as someone who is Black enrolled at a predominately White campus."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Institutional Characteristics", "text": "Not only is the predisposition phase is influenced by family background, but also school experiences (Hamrick & Stage, 2004). McDonough (1997) described the choice process as a model with multiple influential factors depending on the individual, SES, family education, and type of school (as cited in Hamrick & Stage, 2004). Carter (2002) accounts that institutional characteristics and experiences can mediate or counteract background characteristics and can independently affect several educational outcomes including academic achievement and aspirations, which directly affects postsecondary enrollment. Ethington and Smart (1986)  found that of those who enrolled in graduate programs, graduates from high quality colleges were more likely to enroll in doctoral programs and in research universities, and these students were more likely to finish their degree within four to five years of completing the undergraduate degree. Similar to other research, this study concluded that attending an elite private institution had an impact on the probability of attending graduate school, and increases the likelihood of attending a Research institution compared to no graduate school (Eide, Brewer, & Ehrenberg, 1998). Zhang (2005) also explored the effect of attending an HBCU, however, no significant difference was indicated. Kim and Conrad (2006)  American students from families with higher parental income, and that students from both institutions had the same level of degree aspirations. Walpole (2008) addressed the effect of social class has on college experience and outcomes of Black students. Employing stepwise logistic regression to a survey, nine years after students entered college, revealed that sex, college GPA, and plans following college, influence the likelihood that a student would attend college. Similar to Kim and Conrad (2006), Walpole (2008)  interviews of \"college-bound\" African American and Latino high school juniors and seniors, parents, and counselors in southern California counties, the authors further noted that many of the African Americans that participated (parents and students) felt educational opportunities were limited and that HBCUs provided an alternate avenue. Affirmative action backlash. The creation of affirmative action, and similar initiatives, were designed to increase the enrollment of students of color in postsecondary education. These programs included grants, scholarships, and academic services to increase minority rates of retention and graduation (Anderson, 2002). However, affirmative action for minority students had created a strong backlash against such programs. Generated in part by competition for admission to highly selective universities, opposition to affirmative action grew from White families who competed to get their children into these institutions (Anderson, 2002). Consequently, the increased competition and stress felt by White students and their families fueled a backlash behavior toward people of color who were perceived to have special privileges (Dalton, 1991). As competition for college admission, financial aid, and graduate school increased, so had White students' feelings of anger and resentment toward people of color (Dalton, 1991).  (Anderson, 2002). Similarly, the state of Washington passed Resolution I-200, following California's Proposition 209, which suspended affirmative action practices in admission and financial aid policies (Anderson, 2002). Though not conclusive, early reports suggest that the legal and policy changes, and the racial climate could have had an impact on the recruitment and admission of some Black students to graduate/ professional schools in California (Anderson, 2002). Anderson (2002) attest that in 1997 nearly 200 students applied to UC San Diego's medical school the first semester after the new ban on affirmative action, yet none were admitted (Anderson, 2002). Additionally, UC Berkeley reported that only one Black law student was admitted in 1995, but deferred admission to 1997; none of the 14 Black students admitted and enrolled in the 1996-97 academic year returned Fall 1997; and only one of the 17 Black students admitted for the Fall 1997 term decided to attend (Anderson, 2002). Much controversy has surrounded the admission of underrepresented students. From the 1960s through the early 1990s, institutions were subject to political and judicial pressure to increase racial diversity on campus (Altbach, Lomotey, Rivers, 2002). However, some challenges in the form federal and state policies, alongside economic circumstances have also diminished disadvantaged students' to college opportunity. As this study does not include the last contextual layer of Perna's (2006) choice model, it is useful to understand the 1990s landscape. The context of the 1990s. Higher education suffered a reduction of resources during the early 1990s. Moreover, the relationship between it and the state governments was further strained due to economic pressures and concerns about high college costs (Kinzie, Palmer, Hayek, Hossler, Jacob, & Cummings, 2004). As a whole, the country's share of higher education in state budgeting dropped from 14 percent in 1990 to 12.5 percent in 1994 (Callan, 2001). Between these two years and for the first time in 40 years, there was a decline in state dollars spent on higher education, and as a result, public colleges and universities increased tuition costs (Callan, 2001). However, while college prices rose during this period, enrollment remained stable (Phipps & Merisotis, 2003). During the 1990s, college options expanded significantly. Students could attend private or public 4-year institutions, 2-year institutions, for-profit institutions, vocational schools, or virtual universities. As the variety of options increased competition across states and colleges, policy adaptation occurred in order to try to enroll the highest quality student (Kinzie et al., 2004). In Perna, Steel, Woda, and Hibbert (2005) Although the total rate of increase in enrollments between 1990 and 1998 was greater for Blacks than for Whites, Black students continued to be underrepresented in college enrollment relative to their representation in the eligible population. Thirty-eight percent of the state's Black first time, full-time freshmen attended HBCUs in fall 1998.  noted that at the public four-year non-HBCUs, the increased Black and White gap in participation may be linked to the lower rate of growth in state appropriations and higher rate of growth in tuition. Although average state financial aid awards increased faster at the public, four-year, non-HBCUs, than at other institutions. This increase did not compensate for the negative effects of tuition. The authors indicate that Blacks concentration in the state's public 4-year HBCUs can be credited to the lower rate of growth in tuition, despite a lower rate of growth in state appropriations. At private 4-year institutions, high rate of growth in state appropriations contributed to a lower rate of growth in tuition and faster rate of growth in Black enrollment. Changes in state financial aid also appear to have had a smaller effect on Black enrollment than did tuition. Policy discussions regarding institutional accountability has paid slight attention to how state characteristics and policies are associated with educational outcomes in higher education (Roksa, 2010). Roksa (2010) examined how one aspect of the state context, reliance on community colleges vs. 4-year institutions to provide higher education, is related to bachelor's degree attainment of students attending public 4-year colleges and universities. Roksa (2010) pointed that the larger the community college sector, the more bachelor's degrees that are produce by public 4-year institutions. The investigation used a sample of 5,217 students from the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS), a component of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS 1988(NELS -2000, who enrolled in college within two years of their high school graduation. Regression and descriptive analyses revealed that a large proportion of students in the state attending community colleges, results in a decreased likelihood that individual's would attend a public 4-year institution. Roksa suggested that if there were more spaces available in community colleges, students would be more likely to matriculate to the community college. In addition, 3.5 times as many students who do not expect to earn bachelor's degrees enter 4-year institutions in states with small community college sectors. \"Thus, when states do not provide community college alternatives, many students including those who do not expect to earn bachelor's degrees, end up enrolling in 4-year institutions\" (p. 9). Lastly, in a unique exploration, Bedard and Herman (2008)  Rising unemployment rates is a factor that increases the risk of an economic downturn or recession. During the recession in the early 1990s, higher education was in competition with other state services for financial support (Callan, 2002). There was an immense effort to cut public spending and the demands from other sectors such as healthcare and prisons, and the efforts to balance state and federal budgets, created financial problems for higher education (Altbach, Lomotey, & Rivers, 2002). Though the economic downturn only lasted until the mid-1990s, Phipps and Merisotis (2003) suggest that state budgets might have remained constricted due to a combination of weak revenues and continuously rising healthcare costs. Callan (2001; suggested that state and federal policies in the 1990s did little to address the educational opportunity gaps as they emerged and widened. Beginning in the 1980s, states shifted the responsibility for higher education away from taxpayers toward students and their families as tuition rates for public higher education increased without increases in need-based financial assistance (Callan, 2001). In addition, as the gap in economic opportunity between college-educated and non-college educated widen in the 1990s, so did the gap between the rich and poor (Callan, 2001). Despite the rise in college costs, many colleges and universities dedicated funds, in the form of tuition discounts, to provide aid to undergraduates to assist in paying for tuition and fees. In 1992-93 academic year, U.S. Department of Education reported that 17 percent of all students at public colleges received tuition discounts averaging $2,200 per student, yet the majority went to students from middle and high income groups (as cited in Phipps & Merisotis, 2003). Callan (2001) reported that the public policies of 1990s emphasized reducing the financial burden on students in college, or those most likely to attend college. Additionally, there existed disproportionate increases in subsides for middle-income students and families and a decreased public concern for those from lower income groups (Callan, 2001;Phipps & Merisotis, 2003). As a result, public benefits made college somewhat more affordable for students from upper-and middle-income families, giving them expanded college choices over less affluent students (Callan, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Student Debt", "text": "Callan 2001attests that the transformation of the financial aid system from need-based grants to a national aid system in which loans are the dominate form of aid, helped jeopardize postsecondary opportunity. The mid-1990s saw declines in available federal funds to higher education. Declines in total grant aid and students' increased reliance on loans, coupled with a rise in the number of independent students, shifted participation rates of some low-income students (as cited in Kinzie et al., 2004). Millet's (2003) study investigates how undergraduate loan debt affects the application and enrollment in graduate or first professional school degree. Millet utilized a sample of 1,982 cases from the B&B 1992-93 longitudinal study, receiving their bachelor's degree and expecting to earn a doctoral degree to draw a conclusion. She noted \"that undergraduate debt along with students' personal background characteristics, baccalaureate institution, their college experiences, and their immediate opportunity costs to attend graduate school, individually and collectively influence students' decisions to apply to graduate school, and if accepted, their decision to enroll in graduate school\" (p. 394). Millet (2003) suggested that students with debt of $5,000 or higher are less likely to apply to graduate school than their peers who did not have any educational debt. It is also interesting to note that 50percent of all graduates borrow to finance their undergraduate education, with average loans approximately $10,100 (Heller, 2001). Moreover, Black students have 1.5 times greater risk than Whites to have excessive education debt burden (Price, 2004). Thus, these students have higher educational debt and lower salaries (Price, 2004). Also, students who have educational debt are more likely to have parents who have not earned a bachelor's degree. Yet, Millet's (2003) study also found that degree recipients who expected to earn a doctoral degree appeared to be less adversely affected by financial indebtedness in enrolling in graduate or a first professional program if they applied and were accepted. However, given the chance to work to help defray some of the college costs negatively influence graduate degree plans of African Americans, compared to Whites and Hispanics (Pascarella, Woniak, Pierson, & Flowers, 2004). Meaning Black students would be less likely to attend graduate school, given opportunity to be employed. Kim and Eyerman's (2006) study is of interest because they pay particular attention to how the Higher Education Amendment of 1992, which created subsidized and unsubsidized loans and increased the borrowing rate, impacted plans to attend graduate school. To examine this, the researchers utilized survey samples from the 1985 CIRP Freshmen survey and the follow up in 1989, and the 1994 CIRP Freshmen survey and the follow up in 1998. The selected sample used for this study was 7,588 students for the first cohort and 5,234 students for the second cohort. Two logistic regression analyses were conducted, one for each cohort. The study was missing information on actual enrollment into a graduate program, but included their plans to attend graduate school. Nevertheless, the 1989 loan debt did not have a significant effect on students' plans to enroll in a graduate degree program before the Higher Education Amendment of 1992. However, of the 1994-98 cohort, the study suggests that middle-income students borrowing increased their likelihood of plans to attend graduate school, but did not have a significant effect on high or low income students. Kim and Eyermann (2006) claim that despite the significant increase in undergraduate debt that some students may have accumulated, their aspirations for graduate school appear to have remained high because borrowing is now the norm. Since 1996, the annual cost of attending graduate/ professional schools full-time has grown 65 percent, and now averages over $28,000 (Redd, 2006). Given that federal and state grant aid is generally unavailable for graduate study, students pursuing graduate degrees are heavily dependent on loans. In addition, the financial barriers to graduate education can have an enormous influence on the racial/ ethnic composition of professionals in many fields. Thus, it is important to understand the characteristics of students who attend graduate school, the financial aid these students receive to fund their programs, and students' borrowing and debt burdens after they complete their degrees."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Socioeconomic Status", "text": "The amount of educational or financial debt can deter plans of initiating or persisting to acquire a college degree. Moreover, Perna (2000; noted that low levels of financial resources inhibit the ability for a family or student to pay the costs of higher education and decrease the overall likelihood of participation in postsecondary education. Though enrollment rates in higher education has risen in recent years, the gap in the extent of participation, such as the income gap between rich and poor has grew (Callan, 2001). Perna (2006) For students consider their financial resources when determining the costs and benefits of investing in higher education. The educational attainment of parents, which is a key predictor of income, can have a tremendous effect on student's education, whereas low levels of financial resources constrains family's ability to pay the costs and/ or realize benefits that exceed costs (Callan, 2001;Perna, 2006). Several studies have researched how educational costs, indebtedness, and foregone earnings effects educational attainment (Bedard & Herman, 2008;Kim & Eyerman's, 2006;Millet, 2003;Perna, 2004). In addition, compounding upon financial constraints, low-income families and students have less knowledge of college prices, and minorities are less inclined to borrow than Whites (Freeman, 2005). A growing number of students are accumulating larger debts in pursuit of their bachelor's degrees, and the rate of increased loan amounts is more than three times the rate of inflation (Millett, 2003). Given the increased reliance upon loan debt, Millet (2003) questioned the viability of graduate school being an immediate option for students aspiring for a post-baccalaureate degree. Though the receipt of financial aid has had the greatest impact on enrollment in graduate school (Ethington & Smart, 1986), consequently, less than one-third of students in most programs receive grants, fellowships, assistantships, or other sources of free money (Redd, 2006). Solmon, Solmon, and Schiff (2002) state that in comparison to ethnic minorities, part-time students, and the middle-class, college opportunity is most problematic for students from low-income households. In Price's (2004)  burdens borrow more for college and have lower average salaries than do other students (Price, 2004). Similar to Freeman's (1999) study, King and Chepyator-Thomson (1996) discerned the factors that influenced the decision to enroll into graduate school, which included positioning for career opportunities. A survey of 106 African American doctoral recipients was conducted at several PWI's where students were enrolled cross several academic departments specializing in sport and exercise science. Those enrolled believe that a doctoral degree was necessary for employment for certain positions, to increase their earning potential, to pursue even more rewarding opportunities, and to compete against \"mainstream\" applicants. \"We still must be more qualified than our White and male counter parts\" (p. 172). To others they were intrinsically motivated describing it as a personal goal, a challenge, or hoped to improve themselves academically."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Conceptually, Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) choice model is perhaps the most widely cited framework for understanding the college choice process (Bergerson, 2009). According to Hossler and Gallagher (1987), background attributes, activities, and institutional characteristics interact to influence the decision making process of college choice. Students pass through a series of stages and first enter predisposition during which societal (e.g., parental involvement, peers, and interaction with higher education) and economic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and opportunity costs) generate interest and attitudes conducive to college enrollment (Bergerson, 2009). Expanding upon Hossler and Gallagher's choice model, Perna (2006) proposes that choice is primarily impacted by how potential students perceive the benefits and costs of attending college, which is influenced by academic preparation and achievement; habitus; school and community; higher education; and social, economic, and policy context."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "The The B&B: 93/03, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE), followed a cohort of students who earned 4-year degrees during the 1992-93 academic year (Wine, Cominole, Wheeless, Dudley, & Franklin, 2005). Students were first interviewed as part of the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 93), which focused on how students and their families financed their postsecondary education. Students were re-interviewed for the first B&B follow-up study in 1994 (B&B: 93/94), second follow-up in 1997 (B&B: 93/97), and final follow-up, B&B: 93/03, took place in 2003, 10 years after the receipt of the undergraduate degree (Wine et. al., 2005). The B&B: 93/03 interview was first developed for implementation in the field and was later revised (Wine et al., 2005). Instrument specifications defined the structure of sections, variable names and definitions, skip patterns, and out-of-range limits (Wine et al., 2005). Topics covered in the interview sections included education, employment, teachers, finances, and background. Section A, the education portion, collected information on postsecondary education obtained since the B&B: 93/97 including undergraduate and graduate degree, credit and noncredit coursework, and courses taken to obtain or maintain certification and/or licensure (Wine et al., 2005). Section B, the employment section, gathered information on employment status, characteristics of respondents' careers, and information about time spent out of the workforce. Section C, for teachers and those considering teaching contained questions about teaching in elementary and secondary schools. The finance section, Section D, contained questions focusing on income, assets, debts, savings, and education loan burden.

A process of institutional level sampling for the NPSAS:93 was composed from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Institutional Characteristics (IC) database (Wine et al., 2005). Out of those institutions that qualified, the population consisted of 10,140 eligible institutions (Wine et al., 2005). Postsecondary institutions were stratified by geographic region, zip code and state, and then further stratified by institutional control (e.g., public, private, proprietary, not for-profit) and degree offering (Bradburn, Nevill, & Cataldi, 2006).

Second, they were not currently enrolled in high school, and third, not currently enrolled in a general equivalency diploma (GED) or other high school completion program (Wine et al., 2005). Additionally, students have to been awarded a baccalaureate degree sometime between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993 (Wine et al., 2005). The B&B:93/03 student sample was derived from lists compiled by the NPSAS:93 institutions of students eligible to receive their bachelor's degree by the 1992-93 academic year. Stratified systematic sampling was used to acquire the student samples from these lists. In addition, during the computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), students who replied having received a bachelor's degree during the 1992-93 academic year were also included. Thus, from the NPSAS:93 sample, 16,320 baccalaureate recipients were identified to participate in the B&B:93 cohort (Wine et al., 2005).

Weighting compensated for unequal probability of selection into the B&B sampled and adjusted for non-responses (Bradburn et al., 2006). The weights for B&B: 93/03 were developed by utilizing a series of adjustments for sub-sampling and nonresponse to the B&B: 93/94 base weight (Wine et al., 2005). Four total adjustments were made to account for sub-sampling of the B&B 93/97 non-respondents, those not located, response refusals of those that were located, types of non-response other than refusals among those who were located and did not refuse. An additional adjustment was constructed for analyzing those who responded to all four surveys (i.e., NPSAS: 93, B&B: 93/94, B&B: 93/97, and B&B: 93/03). This consisted of the creation of a panel or longitudinal weight for B&B:93/03 respondents who did not respond to all three of the previous surveys (Bradburn et al., 2006).

A web-based questionnaire was designed for use as a self -administered interview, a telephone interview, and an in-person interview (Bradburn et al., 2006). A trained interviewer using CATI for telephone respondents and the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) for field interviews, were made available for data collection (Wine et al., 2005). Self-administered respondents and interviewers were guided through the interview questions depending on skip logic that used answers to previous questions and preloaded information from previous interviews.

Citations of previous research were included to operationalize the indicators as a means of construct validity (Schriesheim, Powers, Scandura, Gardiner, & Lankau, 1993). Carter (2001) attested that multiple studies operationalize degree aspirations interchangeably with expectations (Agnew & Jones, 1988;Berman & Haug, 1975;Hanson, 1994) and educational plans (Friesen, 1983). Due to the lack of uniformity, Carter (2001) defined aspiration as both a goal a student would like to achieve and a goal that she/he expects to attain.

In the following section, students' habitus regarding college choice is expected to reflect an individual's background characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race), as well as cultural (i.e., parental education) and social capital (i.e., direct financial support received from parents) (Perna, 2006). Through a federal analysis, eligibility and the amount of a Pell Grant award is determined by the Department of Education who evaluates criteria such as family's income, assets, and family size. Age. Some researchers noted the influence of age on graduate school enrollment (Neville & Chen, 2007) and completion (Strayhorn, 2009) both favoring younger students to exhibit the proposed outcome. Age in this study is an interval variable and is identified as the graduate's age at the time s/he receive his/ her bachelor's degree. Gender. College enrollment rates have consistently been higher for women compared to men since the 1980s (Perna, 2006), however researchers suggest that variations between male and female aspirations for enrollment in graduate education exists (Pascarella et al., 2004;Perna 2004). Thus, gender is included as a variable within this study. Variable categories are male and female, whereas female is the reference group and male received the dummy code. Marital Status. Marital status, similar to age, has not been studied as extensively as other background characteristics. However, researchers suggest that marital status is associated with degree attainment (Bradburn, et al., 2006) and enrollment in graduate education (Nevill & Chen, 2007). In this study, marital status is defined as the status the student was at time they received the bachelor's degree. Categories are: 1) Married, 2) Separated, 3) Divorced, 4) Widowed, 5) cohabiting, 6) never married. Categories 1 through 5 were recoded to \"other\" as the reference group. Cultural capital. Cultural capital is the significant support and encouragement a student receives from family (Nora, 2004). This capital may be manifested in terms of cultural knowledge and value placed on college attainment (Perna, 2006). In addition, parents' educational attainment maybe a proxy for cultural knowledge and values associated with higher education (McDonough, 1997;Perna & Titus, 2004). This study uses highest level of education variable completed by either parent. This variable was recoded into two categories, parents having less than a bachelor's degree and parents who acquired a bachelor's degree or higher. Social capital. Coleman (1998) suggests that parental involvement is a form of social capital that may promote college enrollment (as cite in Perna, 2006). These may represent tangible financial activities such as establishing a trust fund or paying for children to participate in college prep activities (Smith & Fleming, 2006). The availability of types of social capital that promote choice may be manifested through information about college and assistance with the college process. In this study, parental involvement and support serves as a proxy for social capital.

The investigation of aspirations/expectations is essential in college choice research, as students will not participate if they do not aspire to participate (Carter, 2001). A comparison of the percentage of students who expect they will earn an advanced degree by those that eventually do in 2003, will determine if Black students desire to earn a graduate degree, and whether if they are on the path of meeting their goals. Therefore, what differences exist among the proportion of Black students who aspired to earn a graduate degree in 1993 and 2003, and the proportion that actually enrolled? 2. Among the students enrolled in American higher education, Black men have the lowest male-to-female ratio when compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. Understanding how Black males and females approach the decision to advance their education can discern as to why females choose higher education more often, and how to advance Black males' participation (Freeman, 2005). Therefore, what are the issues of college choice that affect the decision-making process of Black males compared to females? 3. How well does Perna's model explain Black, 4-year degree earner's decision to enroll in graduate/ professional school? 4. Research notes how Black students participation at HBCUs influences Black students decision to matriculate into a post-baccalaureate degree program. However, does attendance alone inspire the decision?

Descriptive statistics including percentages and means were calculated for individual variables within the study. This provided an overview that describes Black college graduates. Descriptive statistics was also used to answer the first research question by reporting the percentage of students who aspired for a graduate degree and compared it to the percent of those that enrolled in graduate/professional school. In addition to descriptive analysis, logistic regression was utilized as a method of analysis. Logistic regression is a common method in studying aspirations and enrollment patterns of students into graduate programs (Kim & Eyerman, 2006;Pascarella, Wolniak, Pierson, & Flowers, 2004;Perna, 2004;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003), and is a useful method of analysis when the dependent variable is dichotomous (Long, 1997). Logistic regression isolates the effects of a given independent variable on the dichotomous dependent variable, for example, enrolled in graduate education (yes=1, no=0). The coefficients of logistic regression show the change in the predicted logged odds of experiencing an event or having characteristics for a one-unit change in the independent variable (Cabrera, 1994). In other words, this method estimates the log of odds of one outcome relative to the baseline category (i.e., did not enroll in graduate school). Results of the logistic regression were presented as odds ratios for the likelihood of enrolling in graduate school. An odds ratio greater than one indicates that the odds of enrolling increase when the independent variable increases; an odds ratio less than one indicates that the odds of enrolling decrease when the independent variable increases (Menard, 1995). The use of logistic regression was used to answer the second, third, and fourth research questions. Logistic regression is useful for situations in which researchers would want to predict the presence or absence of a characteristic or outcome based on values of a set of predictor variables (Long, 1997), as in this case where the dependent variable is present or absent of graduate enrollment. In addition, this inquiry incorporates both categorical and continuous predictor variables that explain the presence or absence of the criterion. Analysis of the second question was examined by conducting the logistic regression analysis according to gender. Next, to examine the third research question, the independent variables of the college choice model were blocked into the logistic regression analysis according to the contextual layers. By entering the variables in these blocks, the analyses illustrate the predictability of choice from the adaptation of Perna's model. The first block includes academic achievement and financial aid, followed by the second block, which considers habitus (e.g., background characteristics, social capital, cultural capital). The third block includes school and community context (i.e., undergraduate major), and the last block incorporates the higher education context or undergraduate institution characteristics. The groupings were used as separate blocks from which the independent variables are tested in the model.

Thus, missing from Table 4 are the real numbers of cases associated with the percentages and standard deviations. Provided, however, is an approximation of the sample size. At the time students received their degree, the average age was 26 and their mean GPA was 2.77. Approximately 34 percent of Black students in this sample received Pell Grant compared to 17 percent of all students in the B&B who received the award. The average Pell Grant award the student sample received during the 1992-93 school year was approximately $513, and the average amount of financial support they receive from their parents was approximately $1832. In addition, about three-fourths have never been married while 25 percent have either been married, divorced, widowed, or cohabitating with a partner. Of those students who were single at the time of graduation, 39 percent enrolled in graduate school while approximately 60 percent did not. In this study, the majority of students are female (63 percent) and 37 percent are male. Though females outnumber males, both groups have similar representation that matriculated into graduate school (38 percent and 37 percent, respectively). Approximately 41 percent of students have at least one parent that completed at least a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 59 percent of the sample who had not. Of the 41 percent with a college-educated parent, 47 percent enrolled in graduate/ professional school while approximately 53 percent did not. An extremely high proportion of Black students (82 percent) majored in an academic program classified as a \"soft\" discipline, of which a little over a third (36 percent) participated in graduate education. Moreover, though only 18 percent of students majored in a \"hard\" discipline, this category has a larger representation of students who entered graduate school (47 percent), as compared to students from \"soft\" disciplines. Less than half (40 percent) of students graduated from a private institution where as 60 percent attended a public college or university. Of those who received degrees from a private or public institution, approximately 35 percent and 39 percent respectively, entered a graduate program. proportions were calculated to determine significance, by using the following formula: where E 1 and E 2 are the independent estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are the respective standard errors (Choy & Bradburn, 2008).

Research notes that logistic regression is a common method of analysis when studying enrollment patterns of students into college (Cabrera, 1994;Kim & Eyerman, 2006;Pascarella, Wolniak, Pierson, & Flowers, 2004;Perna, 2004;Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003), and is a useful method of analysis when the dependent variable is dichotomous (Cabrera, 1994;Long, 1997;Menard, 1995;Pedhazur, 1997). Accordingly, a logistic regression equation takes the following form: where the logit is the odds of an outcome happening (dependent variable), P is the probability of enrolling, 1-P is the probability of not enrolling, \uf061 is the intercept, \uf020and \uf062\uf020the coefficient of the independent variables (Menard, 1995;Pedhazur, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Research Question Two", "text": "What are the issues of college choice that affect the decision-making process of"}, {"section_title": "Black males compared to females?", "text": "The second question examined the issues that distinguished between participation in graduate education among Black females and males. The following table displays the results of which two independent variables are significant for females (i.e., GPA, parent's highest education) and one independent variable for males (i.e., GPA). Cells that do not include any output indicate the categories either have too few cases for analysis or are due to multicollinearity errors. Undergraduate GPA is a significant predictor of graduate enrollment for females and males, as it increases the odds of matriculation for both by approximately 1.01 times. The coefficient for parent's education is -0.22 and the odds ratio is 0.34. With \uf062 being negative the inverse odds ratio was calculated by dividing it by 1. Thus, Black females whose parents possessed a bachelor's degree or higher, had 2.92 greater odds of enrolling into graduate school compared to first generational college students.  There were approximately 200 cases (unweighted) retained in the models. As an indicator for goodness of fit, several indices were used to assess the quality of the statistical models: pseudo R 2 , the proportion of cases correctly predicted (PCP), and scaled deviance (i.e., G 2 ). In logistic regression, the best fitting model yields a G 2 that approaches zero (Cabrera, 1994). Reductions in the scaled deviance with an associated pvalue less 0.05 denotes that the model accounts for an improvement of fit (Cabrera, 1994). Using the indicators to assess the model's fit, this study finds that adding school and community context significantly improves the models explanatory power. Shown in Table 8, the change in scaled deviance shows that adding school and community context has the greatest effect on the full model, followed by habitus. Pseudo R 2 measures increase with each step of the logistic regression model, and the final model correctly predicts 74 percent of the cases for all students.  "}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Study", "text": "Enhanced focuses on issues of access and equity in higher education have emerged, and researchers have concentrated on exploring the college choice and enrollment decisions of students of color (Bergerson, 2009). This study examines enrollment behaviors of Black, four-year degree earners, and attempts to add to the body of knowledge by investigating African American college choice and more specifically, their enrollment in graduate/ professional school. Additionally, and of particular importance, this examination helps bridge the gap between students desire to participate and their actual participation in higher education. Establishing links between aspirations and participation, understanding how students choose whether and where to attend college, and exploring the issues that enhance students' decision-making, can contribute to higher completion rates across student populations (Bergerson, 2009). Because Black students complete graduate degrees at lower rates than White students do, it is essential to understand how their experiences affect choice, which consequently affects degree completion (Carter, 2001), thereby increasing the nation's stock in Black medical doctors, attorneys, and college professors. The current study examines graduate enrollment decisions for a national population of Black collegians and furthers the body of knowledge by investigating African American college choice, and more specifically, their enrollment in graduate/ professional school. It is also of particular importance as it helps bridge those missing links between students desire to participate and their actual participation in higher education. The research questions this study addresses include: This study uses secondary data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, a national dataset, and employs descriptive and logistic regression analyses to address the research questions. By using descriptive methods, this study provides an overview of the characteristics of the Black students in the study, and examines graduate school enrollment relative to their educational expectations. Secondly, logistic regression was used to examine the issues that promote or hinder enrollment into a graduate/ professional degree program. Though the dataset extends to approximately 18 years from when the initial cohort were interviewed, researchers from recent years have still used the data to investigate college enrollment (Dowd, 2008;Nevill & Chen, 2007;Strayhorn, 2009;Zhang, 2005), career paths (Bacolod, 2007;Goyette & Mullen, 2006;Nitopi, 2010;Strayhorn, 2008;Zhang 2008), and academic success (Bosshardt & Watts, 2008;Liu, Thomas, & Zhang, 2010). In addition, even though there are more recent datasets available (B&B: 00/01, B&B: 08/ 09), it was important for the researcher to examine the issues of enrollment across a greater extent of time."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Question One: Aspirations versus Enrollment", "text": "What differences exist among the proportion of Black students who aspired to earn a graduate degree in 1993 and 2003, and "}, {"section_title": "the proportion that actually enrolled?", "text": "Developing educational aspirations is a critical first step toward college access and degree attainment (Cooper, 2008). However, the most perplexing aspect of how Black students vary in enrollment choice is the gap between their aspirations to attend college and their actual attendance (Freeman, 2005). Thus, perhaps a preliminary stage in investigating graduate school enrollment of students is to determine if they desire an advanced degree. The first research question addresses the differences between the representation of students that aspired to obtain a graduate degree in 1993 and 2003, and those that ever enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003. To accomplish this, Powerstats, a web analysis software was used to calculate the percentages. Student's t value was also calculated to determine the significant difference among the three proportions. The analyses reveal that students' consistently maintain graduate school expectations considerably higher than the enrollment rates. Analyses of the stability in aspirations show that a substantial percentage of degree earners in 1993 decreased their aspirations in 2003. However, more than threefourths of Black students who had graduate school expectations maintained those aspirations 10 years later. In 1993, an overwhelming majority (89 percent) had expectations of enrolling in graduate school and later decreased to 77 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, even though students' expectations fell after a decade, it was still significantly greater than those that enrolled in a graduate degree program by 2003 (37 percent). Findings are consistent with studies of Black high school students decreasing their educational aspirations over time (Carter, 2001;Cooper, 2008) and somewhat differs from other research as aspirations varies (Kao & Tienda, 1998;Schapiro, O'Malley, & Litten, 1991). It may not be a compelling argument to associate aspirations of a high school student to that of a collegiate due to developmental differences, however, the purpose is to observe the fluctuations of expectations over time. In Carter's (2001) study, Black students in both Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) data set tend to change their degree expectations and plans over time. Over 89 percent of Black students in 1990 in BPS expected to earn a bachelor's or higher, with 53 percent expecting to earn a graduate degree. This percentage dropped in 1992 with 87 percent of Black students expecting to earn a bachelor's or higher and 49 percent expecting to earn a graduate degree. In addition, Carter (2001) also notes that though both Black and White students lower their expectations over time, Black students still maintain significantly higher aspirations than do White students. However, Cooper (2008) examined aspirations of high school students in the 10 th grade, and two years later when they entered the 12 th grade. Using the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS: 2002/04), Cooper denotes that Black and Latino men decrease their aspirations at higher rates than other students do. Of Black students who aspired for a graduate degree in the 10th grade, 57 percent of males and 60 percent of Black females maintained those aspirations by the 12th grade, as compared to 57.5 percent of White males, and 64.3 percent of White females. Using an earlier cohort of the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS: 88), Kao and Tienda (1998)  As time passes, students are much more realistic about their own likelihood of attending and completing college, as these declines in aspirations may reflect a selfassessment of students' interests and abilities, financial situation, and other life circumstances (Kao & Tienda, 1998). Mickelson (1990) suggests some reasons that may prevent Black students from acting on their aspirations, the primary being due to their inability to distinguish between abstract and concrete attitudes. Abstract attitudes embodies popular beliefs that schooling is a vehicle for success and upward mobility, and concrete attitudes reflect the diverse realities and obstacles that particular people may experience regarding educational access, employment, and salary earnings (Kao & Tienda, 1998;Mickelson, 1990). These abstract attitudes toward education are the dominate views of the American society. In addition, Mickelson (1990) finds that Black students scored higher than White students did on abstract attitudes toward school, but Whites scored higher than Blacks did on concrete attitudes. However, the author notes that concrete attitudes are most critical determinant in educational outcomes. It is difficult to discern whether these students intend on pursing graduate school or whether it is just a fantasy with no real intentions of attending. Moreover, some research suggests when Black students have high aspirations, they are either unrealistic or that African Americans inflate their education expectations as an adaptation to deprivation (Agnew & Jones, 1988). However, why not defer to Robert Browning's claim, \"that a man's reach should always exceed his grasp\", regardless of it being an abstract or concrete attitude. Research states that minority freshmen who have the best chances of obtaining a graduate degree are those who enter college with the highest aspirations (Astin, 1982). For how much more difficult would it be for students to attain a degree they do not desire? Therefore, future aspiration research should be directed toward forging realities from these fluctuating desires of degree attainment."}, {"section_title": "Research Question Two: Gender Comparison", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "What are the issues of college choice that affect the decision-making process of Black males compared to females?", "text": "After examining the influences of matriculation across gender, similar variables proved to be significant as within the aggregate analysis of students. Findings indicate that undergraduate grade point average is vital in the decision-making process of both Black women and men. Comparable to other research, academic achievement at the undergraduate institution is the strongest predictor of entry into a graduate program regardless of gender (Bedard & Herman, 2008;Ethington & Smart, 1986;Hearn, 1987;Millett, 2003). Academic achievement, however, is the only variable that helps explain post baccalaureate attendance for males, whereas the level of education held by parents is also influential of college choice behavior for Black females. This suggests that parents transmit the cultural capital of education to their daughters more effectively than to their sons, or that females are greatly influenced by the postsecondary education achievement of their parents as they elect to attend graduate/ professional school. Offering some details as to why, Hossler, Schmit, and Vesper (1999) explained that female students conversed more with their parents about college plans than did male students. Additionally, Black women whose parents were college educated received a lot of information from their parents about which school was appropriate for them and had some form of academic support (Winkle-Wagner, 2010). Though only interviewing Black, male, university, faculty, all of Holloman and Strayhorn's (2010) participates indicated their parents stressed the importance of their advancing education as a means of providing flexibility in career choices after college. Moreover, subjects reported having engaged parents who prepared them to learn to navigate the college system. They also maintained close relationships with their fathers, who instilled in them a strong sense of confidence and determination. Parents sustain and encourage the college decision process through their expectations for their children's educational and occupational attainment and by continuously asking their children about college-related plans and activities (Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, & Perna, 2006). Some investigators, however, maintain a view that male students are not receiving adequate encouragement to continue education beyond high school (Freeman, 2005). Researchers found that Black students of both genders and parents believe that Black females receive more encouragement to participate in higher learning than males (Freeman, 2005;Smith & Fleming, 2006). Parents in Smith and Fleming's (2006) study assumed that daughters would not only go to college but would persist in higher education through graduate education, whereas the primary encouragement for sons was less ambitions (e.g., community college enrollment, military service). Thus, parents affirmed they make a conscious effort to boost the intellectual self-esteem of their daughters (Smith & Fleming, 2006). Students' expectations are closely linked to what they perceived to be their sources of encouragement. Consequently, African American females are not only encouraged more to consider higher education, but they are encouraged at an earlier age, and are expected to be more academically talented (Freeman, 2005;Smith & Fleming, 2006). Parents and parental education, as cultural capital, is a primary constructor of habitus, and Perna (2006) and Horvat (1996) highlight that it is through habitus that the practices and decisions of individuals and their interactions with structures are shaped. Meaning, the value and knowledge placed on graduate education guides the decree to participate. Findings may appear that cultural capital, in the form of parental education, is not a significant influence on Black males' college choice patterns. However, it perhaps maybe more appropriate to discern if this reason is due to the deficiency or absence of transmitting the educational value to Black men."}, {"section_title": "Research Question Three: Perna's Adapted Model", "text": "How well does Perna's model explain Black, 4-year degree earner's decision to enroll in graduate/ professional school? The third research question investigates how well adapting Perna's (2006) college choice model explains Black students' decision to participate in graduate education. The model's explanatory power is improved by adding the contexts of habitus (i.e., background characteristics, cultural and social capital) and school and community (i.e., academic discipline), with the greatest contribution from the school and community context. All the contextual layers proposed by Perna except, for the addition of the higher education context, enhances the model's fit of explaining graduate college choice of Black collegians. Though the context of higher education does not expand the model, it also does not worsen it. These findings may suggest that the higher education context measures (institutional control, HBCU attendance) may not be appropriate proxies to be included in the analysis. Results from the full model indicate that there are three variables pertinent for post-baccalaureate enrollment: academic achievement (i.e., undergraduate grade point average), financial aid (i.e., amount of Pell awarded in 1992-93), and cultural capital (i.e., parental education level. As anticipated, GPA is the strongest indicator of graduate school attendance. This discovery is similar to findings articulated by researchers (Bedard & Herman, 2008;Ethington & Smart, 1986;Heller, 2001;Mullen, Goyette, Soares, 2003), however, is somewhat divergent in Millet (2003), as she concludes GPA is not important in the decision to enroll in graduate school, but is critical in their decision to apply. Financial aid also showed to have an impact on post-baccalaureate attendance. Although low-income students can be adversely affected by the cost of tuition, financial aid can positively predispose them to attend college (Berkner & Chavez, 1997). Pell Grant, a need-based financial aid award, significantly contributed to enrollment decisions of Black students in this study. The award helps students to defray the cost of attendance at their undergraduate institution and perhaps allow students to set aside money needed to attend graduate/ professional school. Aid is especially important to Black students as it clarifies their decision of whether to participate in graduate education or to enter the work force (Davis, Johnson, Ralston, Fields, Young-Clark, Colyard, Fluellen, & Rasco, 2010). Financial aid became a significant predictor after the introduction of the school and community context (i.e., academic discipline) was entered into the model. It is unclear as to what specifically about the academic discipline influenced the significance of financial aid; nevertheless, academic discipline's effect is positive, yet insignificant. Tsapogas and Cahalan (1996) discovered that graduates with bachelor's degrees in the life, social, and physical sciences (e.g., hard discipline) were more likely to enroll in a graduate degree program before entering the labor force than graduates with degrees in engineering or computer science (Tsapogas & Cahalan, 1996). This finding is consistent with the one reported by Millett (2003) that undergraduates who had majored in pure disciplines as opposed to applied fields were twice as likely to apply to graduate or firstprofessional school. Additionally, examinations of undergraduate major according to social and behavioral sciences, science and math, computers and engineering, education, health professions, and found students from each major had a greater likelihood of enrolling as compared to students whose undergraduate major was business management (Heller, 2001). The act of choosing higher education is constructed under the circumstances present in each student's world, school and curricular influences, and the influences of family (Horvat, 1996;McDonough, 1997;Perna, 2006). Family educational background affects enrollment in postgraduate education even after the receipt of the baccalaureate (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003). Parental education level (i.e. cultural capital), the study's only significant component of habitus, increases the likelihood that Black students matriculate into a graduate program. Hovart (1996) notes that parents are the primary constructor of habitus, and it is through this habitus that perceived opportunities are shaped (Horvat, 2003;McDonough, 1997;Nora, 2004;Perna, 2006). As parental education level increases, children are more likely to plan to enroll into college, as parents with college educations are more likely to value education and to transmit their values to their children (Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Research Question Four: HBCU Attendance", "text": "How does attendance at a historically Black college and university (HBCU) influence Black students' choice to enroll into graduate education after controlling for other variables? Question 4 examines the role attendance at a HBCU has on students decision to matriculate into a graduate degree program before and after controlling for the remaining college choice independent variables. Results yielded no significant difference. Findings suggest that students who attended a HBCU as an undergraduate, are just as likely or unlikely, to pursue a graduate degree as students from a non-HBCU, with or without controlling for variables such as GPA, financial aid, gender, age, parental support, parental education level, academic discipline, and institutional control. Findings are consistent with studies indicating no difference between attendance at an HBCU or non-HBCU and its effect on graduate enrollment (Eagan, Garcia, Herrera, Garibay, Hurtado, & Chang, 2010;Ehrenberg & Rothstein, 1994;Zhang, 2005). Conversely, prior researchers have noted HBCU attendance is an important indicator of acquiring an advanced degree (Brazziel, 1983;Pearson & Pearson, 1985;Solorrzano, 1995), and is particularly instrumental for Black students enrolled in mathematics, life, and physical sciences during within their undergraduate years (Thomas, 1992). The importance of HBCU to such issues as social integration, academic achievement, and persistence to degree has been established in prior studies (Allen, 1992;Bohr, Pascarella, Nora, & Terenzini, 1995), however, the relevance of these institutions is often a topic of contention. A reason perhaps why HBCU attendance is not a significant contributor to students' choice can be due to the relative sample size of this population in comparison to those Blacks students completing their undergraduate degrees from a non-HBCU. Utilizing a subsample from a national dataset may prove to be a consistent problem to conduct research, especially on minority populations. Sue and Dhindsa (2006) claim to address the sample size problem, researchers have resorted to oversampling. Given these problems, research findings for small groups may be unavailable, or the extent of knowledge regarding certain minority groups may be limited (Sue & Dhindsa, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "What motivates graduate college choice is an emerging issue not only of interest to educational researchers who seek to comprehend the determinants of educational attainment. However, it also concerns institutional officials who look to improve recruitment strategies, enrollment models, and admission policies, and policy makers who seek to improve the nation's access to higher education. The implementation of effective educational policy, whether at the institutional level to improve recruitment or at the state and national level to equalize educational opportunity, will depend on more varied research on college choice (Bergerson, 2009). The results of the study have implications for graduate enrollment research. Findings indicate that academic achievement, need-based financial aid, and cultural capital are the primary influences of postgraduate opportunity. This section discusses possible ways the study clarifies or extends the understanding of African American graduate college choice and approaches that may improve their participation. Future earning potential and the expected cost of attendance are two primary factors that students consider in their examination of the value of higher education (Freeman, 2005;Perna, 2006;DesJardins & Toutkoushian, 2005). The costs include the direct expense of education such as tuition, fees, and books; as well as the opportunity costs of education (e.g., foregone earnings) that a person has to give up in order to acquire higher learning. However, it is understood that experience and perception allows individuals to gather additional information, their beliefs become more established, they revise their preferences and opinions less frequently, and in doing so they eliminate uncertainty about their preferences and the later choices they make (DesJardins & Toutkoushian, 2005). When students perceive they will receive a favorable return on their investment in higher education, they select to enroll (DesJardins & Toutkoushian, 2005;Freeman, 2005). Responses of African Americans students in Freeman's (2005) study reflect that they have a fear of either not having enough money to attend college or of not getting a job that pays appropriately with their level of education. Moreover, individuals expect that investing in education will lead to higher future incomes and offset the potential costs (DesJardins & Toutkoushian, 2005). Perna (2006) makes the claim that several contextual layers influence how students perceive what the cost and benefits of higher learning to be, and their subsequent decision to matriculate. One of the conceptual aims of this study was to explore how the adaptation of Perna's model contributes to the comprehension of graduate school attendance of Black students. Though not all the variables studied were predictors of the decision to attend, this study adds to the diminutive body of work that examines postgraduate participation and African American college choice. The limited number of factors found to influence registration into a degree program may require a re-evaluation and expanded operationalization of variables such as social and cultural capital. This study's investigation of the propensity of Black students to pursue graduate education is influenced by three variables: academic achievement, financial aid (i.e., Pell Grant), and cultural capital (i.e., parental education level). These indicators are important because high academic achievement presents greater opportunities based on a student's scholastic ability; financial aid, provides resources and funds to allow students to participate; and cultural capital, increases the understanding and the value of participating in higher education. Perhaps the most apparent policy implication that can be derived from this study is sustaining of the need-based award, Pell Grants. In mid-2011 the federal government warned of government \"shutdown\" that could occur if the federal budget was not balanced. Despite the evidence that Pell funding has failed to keep pace with the rising cost of college tuition, representatives offered an idea to reduce the support to this needbased program. However, federal financial assistance such as this greatly increases minority postsecondary enrollment (Kinzie, Palmer, Hayek, Hossler, Jacob, & Cummings;Roebuck & Murty, 1993). As policy changes occur, university research offices will need to be able to project and monitor the effects that could diminish their institution's enrollments and goals for campus diversity (Hurtado, Inkelas, Briggs, & Rhee, 1997). This study does not particularly address the reason why financial assistance during college affects post-baccalaureate attendance. However, it maybe hypothesized that defraying the cost during those undergraduate years decreases the likelihood of 125 having to borrow excessively, thus, freeing up the capital needed to pursue an advanced degree; or that aid mitigates financial barriers, in such a way that it increases students' academic capital, and as such, graduate education appears more obtainable. Informing students of non-debt occurring financial aid that exists during postsecondary education can help alleviate some uncertainty of the decision to obtain an advanced education if cost is a concern. For example commencing in 2006, the creation of the Academic Competitiveness Grants, a merit-based grant program, gives Pell Grant recipients additional funds for completing \"rigorous high school curriculum\" and maintaining a 3.0 GPA in college (Long, 2008). However, Long (2008) cautions that careful attention should be paid to the criteria used in awarding this aid for concern of replicating the negative effects that have been found with other merit-based aid-such as primarily benefiting students whose schools offer Advanced Placement (AP) or Honors curriculum. Another implication of this study is the continued institutional support of those academic services and programs that improves GPA such as tutoring services and faculty-student interaction through either mentorship or such initiatives as the McNair Scholars. Programs such as these can help students to achieve their academic goals while simultaneously improving retention. Higher educational institutions should also seek to develop different marketing strategies and support networks that speak to the individual needs of various student groups they attract to their campuses (Holloman & Strayhorn, 2010). It may be difficult or financially improbable for an institution to engage an undergraduate outside their campus beyond the traditional marketing strategies (e.g., emails, pamphlets, recruitment visits), therefore, the home campus Graduate College should place a concerted effort in recruiting and re-enrolling their institutions current students into graduate/professional school. It is especially important for Black students to get information about the college going process (undergraduate or graduate) as early as possible. When undergraduate Admissions Office initiates their college readiness programs and college fairs for high school students, these would be prime times to speak to students and their families about postgraduate education. Oftentimes parents, especially those from low-income backgrounds, do not speak to their children about higher education because they lack the knowledge about process. Thus, establishing approaches and strategies to reach parents is warranted. These strategies would not only assist in the recruitment efforts aimed at students, but it will also help administrators, and others, who seek to understand how the prospective students are influenced before they matriculate to postsecondary settings (Holloman & Strayhorn, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "Based on the current research there are several areas for further investigation. Perhaps the first steps would be to address some of the limitations and delimitations of the study. As previously mentioned, by altering the model this study does not include a variable that embodies the economic, political, and social context of the college choice framework. Perhaps other datasets can be used in combination with the B&B that address either the disposition of students' state of residence (e.g., demographic characteristics, unemployment rate) or their reactions to federal or state policies. In addition, several other proxies could be used for independent variables such as financial aid (e.g., scholarship, work-study) and academic discipline (e.g., applied vs. pure discipline; life vs. non-life discipline). This study examines how the participation in a hard/soft undergraduate major affects post-baccalaureate matriculation, and particularly identifies disciplines as hard/soft using Biglan's classification because it commonly used in research. However, categorization into life vs. non-life disciplines perhaps maybe more seamless than hard/soft stratum. This perhaps will lose fewer students in the analysis because of the researcher's inability to classify a discipline that did not appear in Biglan (1973) or Stoecker's (1993) follow-up examination. Additionally, because the study only examines graduate enrollment of Black students, a follow-up study should include an analysis of all ethnicities. As Paulsen (1990) states, more research is needed on the understanding of the choice process of all groups. Therefore, an investigation is warranted on how well this model or others explain post-baccalaureate participation of all students, and into what degree field (e.g., master's, doctoral, professional). A comparison of B&B cohorts can also be made of students who either participated in the B&B: 1993/ 94, B&B: 2000/ 01, or B&B: 2008/ 09 surveys to ascertain whether predictors of enrollment have changed over time and the application of the model as an appropriate framework for investigating graduate college choice. Finally, since parental education levels are a significant indicator of both the aggregate enrollment and the graduate enrollment for Black females, parental influence should be further explored. Later research can examine which parent exerts the highest influence on a student's enrollment decision in regards to that student's gender, and an analysis of graduate students' experiences reflecting how they navigated the seen and unseen barriers in their quest for an advanced degree, and the role their family contributed in doing so. In addition, future research should explore the differences in parental involvement in their children's education, and explore the ways parents' past educational experiences may influence their involvement in their children's education (Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, & Perna, 2008)."}]
