Although these are the genes with largest effects known for AD, the observed effects of the non-APOE risk variants are relatively small, with odds ratios of about 1.2. The complex genetic makeup of AD necessitates explorations that go beyond single marker analysis to look for epistatic relationships that might explain some of the missing heritability. Using the information garnered from large scale GWAS analyses and outcome measures derived from biological processes that are more proximal to gene function, we aim to elucidate how some of these risk variants relate to specific aspects of AD etiology.\nRecent work has begun to address the relationship between these risk variants and biomarkers of AD. One study performed fine mapping of PICALM, BIN1, CLU, and CR1 and found that these genes were not associated with amyloid pathology or tau pathology measured in vivo in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [4] . Other evidence has suggested CR1 is involved in amyloid pathology, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy [5, 6] . Moreover, recent work has identified an interaction between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapped to the CR1 gene and APOE genotype in relation to amyloid pathology measured by Positron Emission Tomography PET [7] . BIN1 has had similar mixed associations including the null result previously mentioned and other work suggesting it is related to tau pathology [8] , perhaps through its role in the immune response system [9] . Yet to date no single analysis of single marker and epistatic relationships between the replicated SNP hits from these four genes has been performed in relation to neuroimaging measures of amyloid deposition.\nThe aim of the current study was to leverage two independent datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to identify genetic effects and interactions among the known risk SNPs of AD. First, we sought to evaluate the null-effects reported previously between PICALM, BIN1, CLU, CR1 and amyloid burden using a PET measure of amyloid, rather than the CSF measure used previously [4] . Similar to the CSF measures, amyloid imaging measures have been related to disease onset and progression, have been validated post-mortem, and more recently were included as a biomarker for classifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in research studies [10] [11] [12] [13] . Second, we tested for genetic interactions with APOE-\u03b54 genotype status given the previous reports of APOEgene interactions that explain some of the variance in AD disease status [14] . Finally, we tested whether SNP-SNP interactions among these risk genes would explain additional variance in amyloid pathology beyond known variance related to age, disease status, and APOE genotype."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of CaliforniaSan Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.

We added additional support for the lack of single marker associations between these SNPs and amyloid deposition; however, we provide new evidence for an epistatic relationship between BIN1 x PICALM. This interaction suggests that using powerful quantitative endophenotypes derived from neuroimaging measures may be a fruitful avenue for exploring epistatic relationships among candidate genes in order to explain some of the missing heritability of AD. BIN1 x PICALM The BIN1 x PICALM interaction appears to explain an additional 1% of the variance (R 2 full -reduced = 0.014) in amyloid load and is biologically plausible given the role these genes play in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis [9] . PICALM in particular has been suggested to be involved in A\u03b2 clearance [21] and amyloid pathogensis through its role in regulating A\u03b2 metabolism [22] . The minor allele of the replicated PICALM candidate SNP used in these analyses (rs3851179) is related to a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 0.89) [14] , suggesting that the minor allele of this SNP should be related to decreased amyloid burden. The observed interaction effect is in line with such an expectation, as minor allele carriers of this rs3851179 showed lower levels of amyloid deposition than non-carriers, but the effect was only present in those individuals also carrying the BIN1 risk allele. Thus, the protective effect of PICALM appears to be relegated to those individuals who carry some other genetic risk factor for AD pathology. Recent work has suggested that while both BIN1 and PICALM both play a role in calthrin-mediated endocytosis (as previously described), only PICALM is related to the secretion of the A\u03b2 peptide [23] . The previous null association between PICALM and A\u03b2 [4] , and the current null result in our single marker analyses suggest that the relationship between PICALM and A\u03b2 may be more complex. Indeed, the interaction effect we observe suggests that variation in PICALM and BIN1 combine to modify risk for amyloid deposition. Additional work aimed at analyzing the functional relationship between BIN1, PICALM, and A\u03b2 may help clarify the mechanisms of this observed statistical interaction."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "The present results must be interpreted within the framework of our statistical models. In all cases, we included covariates related to disease status and progression including age, diagnosis, and APOE carrier status. Thus, significant interactions are explaining variance beyond known predictors of risk, and while the contributions of these interactions appear to be meaningful, the implications should not be extended without considering the variance accounted for by the other factors in our model. We provide some suggestions as to the functional significance of the SNPs identified, but future work specifically relating these SNPs to gene expression and A\u03b2 secretion may help clarify these genetic interactions.\nThe difference in effects between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO could be attributed in part to sample size, and the additional subjects in ADNI-2/GO likely provided the additional power necessary to detect interaction effects. However, the two Figure 1 . PICALM x BIN1 and amyloid deposition. The top two interactions were rs3851179 at the PICALM locus with rs7561528 ( Figure 1A ) and with rs744373 ( Figure 1B) cohorts also differed in their distribution of clinical status, with a greater percentage of AD cases and a much lower percentage of MCI patients in ADNI-1. Although the distribution of mean SUVR values did not significantly differ between the two cohorts (t(546) = 1.28, p = 0.771), we cannot rule out the possibility that the difference in diagnostic category had some effect on our result. For that reason, we also repeated tests for all significant interactions including a cohort covariate. The BIN1 x APOE interaction was unchanged (p = 0.035) and the two BIN1 x PICALM interactions were more significant (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.006 respectively). Ultimately, additional analyses in a cohort with a more comparable clinical picture to that of ADNI-2/GO may be useful in further validating our results.\nTo reduce the total number of comparisons, we chose to focus in on the SNPs which had shown a replicated effect on AD rather than looking across the gene. Certainly the previously identified genetic effects are expected to act at the gene level [24] , and thus other SNP-SNP interactions between these genes may be able to explain the same or additional variance. Future work approaching epistatic relationships from the gene or pathway level may help clarify the observed interaction and provide additional targets for future functional analyses.
