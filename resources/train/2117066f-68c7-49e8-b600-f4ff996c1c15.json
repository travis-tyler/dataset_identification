In addition, Florida lost many lives and part of the 2,170 miles of shorelines. A bridge and sections of I-10 were destroyed and transportation interrupted for many days. With population and development continuing to increase along coastal areas, a greater number of people and property are vulnerable to hurricane threat. Hurricanes cannot be controlled but the vulnerability can be reduced through accurate forecasting. The major damage caused by hurricanes is associated with storm surges and coastal flooding. According to NOAA (1999), a storm surge is a large dome of water, 80 to 160 km wide, that sweeps across the coastline near where a hurricane makes landfall. It can be more than 4.5 m deep at its peak. The surge of high water topped by waves can be devastating. Along the coast, storm surge is the greatest threat to life and property. Not only can hurricanes damage houses and buildings in highly populated coastal residential and commercial areas but also, within just a few hours, they can cause drastic changes in the coastline as an outcome of morphological response. This may result in an ecological imbalance of estuarine systems, especially those that are separated from the ocean by barrier islands, which are a common feature of Florida's coastline. In order to reduce coastal hazards associated with hurricanes, it is necessary to have an accurate prediction model of storm surge and coastal flooding, which is essential for developing cost effective storm mitigation and preparation. Accurate storm surge simulations are also essential for producing accurate flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) for coastal counties. Florida coastal counties alone contribute more than 40% of the total insurance premiums collected by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  showed that the FEMA methodology on flood insurance rates in Pinellas county, Florida (FEMA, 1988), which is based on the 1-D WHAFIS model, overestimates possible damage that may be caused by the 100-year storm event. The use of a more robust storm surge model will likely result in significant savings in insurance premiums."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Surges are induced by the hurricane wind and atmospheric pressure fields, and are significantly affected by the complex coastal bathymetry and topography. In addition, there exist significant nonlinear interactions among surge, wave, wind, and tide. Physical processes governing the development of storm surges during hurricanes are quite complex. Bode and Hardy (1997) pointed out the lack of robust storm surge models for tropical storms. During the last ten years, more hurricane and storm surge data have been collected in Florida and elsewhere, providing a good opportunity to develop and validate new storm surge models. Many existing storm surge models contain rather simple physics even though physically measurable attributes, such as water level, actually include the combined effects of physical processes such as waves and tides. They take into account only a few hurricane parameters such as pressure deficit, size of the storm, its translation speed, and direction."}, {"section_title": "Wave Effect on Surface Stress", "text": "According to Janssen (1991) the sea surface stress depends not only on wind speed but roughness due to waves as well. The total stress near the sea surface is the sum of the turbulent part and wave-induced part, where \u03c4 t is the turbulent stress which according to the mixing-length hypothesis can be parameterized as follows: where \u03ba = 0.4 is von Karman constant; U (z) is the wind speed at height z; \u03c1 a is the air density. Janssen (1991) also introduced the effective roughness length, z e , as opposed to the roughness length, z 0 , when waves are absent. The effective roughness length is a function of the wave-induced stress. In derivation of his wave-induced stress, Janssen (1991) used the following wind profile: where u * is the friction velocity. If equation 1-3 is differentiated, squared and compared with equation 1-2 at z = z 0 , the following relationship between z 0 and z e is obtained: Assuming that Charnok-like expression z 0 = \u03b1u 2 * /g is valid, the value of \u03b1 is tuned in such a way that z e = \u03b1u 2 * /g for old wind sea. The old wind sea term means that waves are no longer developing under current wind condition and the wave-induced stress for such sea diminishes, yielding z e \u2192 z 0 . For young waves (traveling much slower that the wind) almost the entire surface stress is due to waves; therefore, \u03c4w / \u03c4 approaches one. Zhang and Li (1996) applied the theory of Janssen in their coupling of a thirdgeneration wave model and a two-dimensional storm surge model. Comparing their results with measured data of two storm events that took place in the northern South China Sea, they found that the introduction of a wave dependent drag gives a significant improvement over the use of the Smith and Banke (1975) stress relation which underestimated the surges by 10%. where Mastenbroek et al. (1993) also studied the effect of a wave-dependent drag coefficient on the generation of storm surges in the North Sea. To estimate the effects of waves on the boundary layer, the theory of Janssen was used. The results were compared to measured data for three storm periods. The calculations with the wave-dependent drag gave a significant improvement. In turn the calculations with the Smith and Banke stress relation underestimated the surges by 20%. Donelan et al. (1993) investigated the aerodynamic roughness of the sea surface, z 0 , using data from Lake Ontario, from the North Sea near the Dutch coast, and from an exposed site in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nova Scotia. They found that normalized roughness depends strongly on wave age ( where C p is the phase speed of the waves at the spectral peak. Their equation for the wave enhanced drag coefficient is The authors normalized roughness by the RMS wave height and using the friction velocity, u * , of the wind stress and concluded that in both cases young waves were rougher than mature waves. Xie et al. (2001) investigated the influence of surface waves on ocean currents in the coastal waters by using a coupled wave-current modeling system. They took into account the fact that the wave-induced wind stress is not only a function of wind speed but the wave-modified drag coefficient as well, which in turn is a function of the spectral peak frequency of waves. For young waves the spectral peak frequency is large, and accordingly, the wave-induced surface stress is large. However, for fully developed wind waves the spectral peak frequency is small, and accordingly, the effect of waves on surface stress is relatively small. The authors note that the wave spectral peak frequency increases as the water depth decreases. In their study the magnitude of the peak spectral frequency increases from about 0.6 rad s \u22121 in the relatively deep offshore water to approximately 0.9-1.0 rad s \u22121 in the shallow coastal waters. As a consequence, under a constant wind the effect of waves on wind stress is larger in the shallower water than in the deeper water."}, {"section_title": "Wave Effect in Wave-Current Interaction at the Bottom", "text": "Bottom friction is an important factor in wave-current interaction. According to Graber and Madsen (1988), the shape of the wave spectrum in finite-depth waters is significantly influenced by the bottom friction. During a storm event when waves are large the area of such an influence extends far offshore. Grant and Madsen (1979) developed an analytical theory to describe the combined motion of waves and currents in the vicinity of a rough bottom and the associated boundary shear stress by considering a combined wave-current friction factor. The magnitude of the maximum boundary shear stress due to combined wave and current is where the combined friction factor f cw is a function of | u a | / | u b |; | u a | is the magnitude of the steady current velocity vector at a height a above the bottom; | u b | is the maximum near-bottom orbital velocity from linear wave theory; \u03c6 c is the angle made by u a with the direction of wave propagation. Schoellhamer (1993) pointed out weaknesses of the Grant and Madsen (1979) methodology which include the introduction of a fictitious reference velocity at an unknown level, the assumption of the logarithmic layer being constant which is not correct when waves are present. Tang and Grimshaw (1996) adapted the Grant and Madsen (1979) bottom boundary layer theory to study the effect of increased bottom friction due to wind-wave current interaction using a 2-D shallow water numerical model. They showed that the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory may break down in very shallow water where the wave amplitudes become large. To avoid the problem the authors introduced an empirical wave-breaking criterion into the bottom friction formulation: where a W is the wind-wave amplitude at the surface and h is the local depth; \u03b2 is an empirically determined parameter in the range 0.5 < \u03b2 < 0.9 based on results for wave breaking. Based on their numerical (hence not verified) results, Tang and Grimshaw (1996) concluded that although the wind-wave enhancement of the bottom stress is significant only in the nearshore zone of shallow water, there is a dramatic reduction in the sea surface elevation and the currents in this region. Signell and List (1997) studied the effect of wave-enhanced bottom friction on storm-driven circulation in Massachusetts Bay based on a simplified form of the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory described by Signell et al. (1990). They found that the drag coefficient increases dramatically by a factor of 2-6. The most significant drag coefficient enhancement took place in the shallow regions near the shoreline. In response to the increased bottom drag, however, bottom currents were reduced by 30%-70%. Since the bottom stress is proportional to bottom drag and to the square of the bottom velocity, the mean bottom shear stress increased only by 10%-60% instead of a factor of 2-6. Wang et al. (2000) analyzed several important mechanisms for storm-induced entrainment of estuarine sediments using field measurements. Their study showed that the bottom shear stress, computed using a wave-current interaction model based, again, on the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory, increased significantly during episodic wind events. The currents and waves tended to enhance each other so that the shear stresses during the peaks of storms, computed from the wave-current interaction model, were approximately three times larger than using the traditional quadratic law. A large re-suspension event was caused by a frontal passage when strong wind-driven currents augmented the tidal currents. It was also pointed out in this study that the timing of storm waves with respect to tidal phase was a critical factor. Liu and Dalrymple (1978) proposed a simple empirical model which was also used by Sun and Sheng (2002) in their study of 3-D wave-induced circulation. The bottom shear stress is defined as where U wb is the maximum near-bed wave orbital velocity estimated from linear wave theory; u b is the near-bed wave-averaged velocity; C d is the friction coefficient which can be calculated according to the law of the wall Sheng (1986)  where \u03ba is von Karman constant, z 0 = k s /30 with k s being the Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness, and z b is the vertical distance of the lower grid point above the bottom. This simple model assumes that waves and currents are co-linear which is rather unrealistic. As a result of the assumption, the bottom stress will be overestimated when wave and current directions deviate from each other. Xie et al. (2001) also emphasize that surface waves produce two opposite effects on circulation: energy input through surface stress and energy dissipation through bottom stress. The net effect of wave-induced surface and bottom stresses can be quite different under different wind directions. This effect can either enhance or damp the surface current. The authors showed that the effect of waveinduced bottom stress is more significant for alongshore winds than for cross-shore winds. Their results indicated that the effect of waves on currents is mainly present in shallow coastal waters and attenuates rapidly offshore as water depth increases. Xie et al. (2001) also note that the effects of wave-induced surface and bottom stresses also depend on the wind speed. In tropical cyclone situations the wave-induced surface shear stress is generally more important than that due to wave-induced bottom stress, and hence the effect of wind waves usually increases the magnitude of storm surge. Johnson and Kofoed-Hansen (2000) studied the influence of bottom friction on sea surface roughness. Their investigations show that the bottom dissipation keeps waves young, which results in increased wind friction."}, {"section_title": "Wave Effect through Radiation Stress", "text": "Waves breaking on a sloping beach produce a wave setup in the nearshore, a rise in the water level above the still water level (the mean sea level in the absence of waves). Higher breakers will produce higher setup than lower breakers. Longshore variation in wave breaker heights will produce longshore currents which cause longshore sediment transport. Wave setup generally occurs in the surf zone. The breaking waves produce excess momentum flux in the shoreward direction which is usually termed \"radiation stress.\" As the broken waves continue to propagate toward the shore, the excess momentum flux or radiation stress diminishes. In the steady state, the shoreward decrease in radiation stress is balanced by a shoreward increase in the water level. This raises the water surface elevation within the surf zone to higher than the still water level (SWL) producing setup. It also pushes the water level outside of the surf zone to lower than the SWL producing setdown. It is necessary to account for wave setup within the surf zone during the calculation of storm surge elevation. The reason for that is that the setup may be very significant especially during a storm event. According to Dean and Dalrymple (1991) the wave setup near the shore is about 19% of the breaking wave height. The significant wave height during the 100-year storm estimated by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (1988) in the Gulf of Mexico is 8.86 m with the period of 11.5 sec. The breaking wave height during the storm according to Dean and Dalrymple (1991, p. 116) may reach 8.5 m assuming a plane beach, and 0 o deep water incident angle. Therefore, the wave setup may reach 1.62 m at the shore, which is a significant value as far as flooding caused by the wave setup is concerned. It would be incorrect to add the calculated wave setup on top of the calculated storm surge elevation linearly since there is a non-linear interaction between the two. Moreover, it is practically impossible to distinctly separate the wave setup from everything else based on the surface elevation data collected in the field. Therefore, wave setup should be introduced in the equations in terms of radiation stresses, so that the calculated surface elevation would include it internally in a non-linear fashion. Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964) derived depth-integrated radiation stress quantities that are used in many numerical models including storm surge models accounting for wave-induced setup. Mastenbroek et al. (1993) and Zhang and Li (1996) incorporated radiation stress terms based on the Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964) formulation into two-dimensional ocean circulation equations and investigated the importance of radiation stress in calculation of storm surge. Mastenbroek et al. (1993) reported that only in one of the three cases they studied the radiation stress increased the surge some 5%. In the other two cases the effect of the radiation stress was insignificant. Similarly, Zhang and Li (1996) concluded that the inclusion of the radiation stress improves the accuracy of the computed results slightly by 2%. It has to be pointed out that the study by Mastenbroek et al. (1993) took place in the North Sea with stations along the Dutch and British coasts. The authors do not specify how deep the locations of their stations are. It is hard to estimate the importance of the radiation stress if it is not being estimated in relatively shallow water where wave setup is formed under the influence of the breaking waves. Also, the surge model they used does not account for flooding and drying. This makes the model inadequate in shallow water regions. The same conclusion is valid for the model used by Zhang and Li (1996). Their grid is located in the northern South China Sea and the depths of their station locations are not specified either.  implemented the Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964) radiation stresses in the CH3D (Sheng, 1987) model and simulated 2-D wave setup fields during the 100-year storm event for two study areas in Pinellas County, Florida. The setup value varied from approximately 0.5 m to 1.0 m. There was some effect on wave setup when waves were approaching at 40 o angle which, according to Dean et al. (1995), is the most likely angle of approach of the 100-year storm event in Pinellas County. Also, the study showed that the grid resolution has some effect on calculated wave setup especially in the areas where bathymetry has steeper gradients. Coarse grids are not capable of resolving these bathymetric gradients and as a result the calculated wave setup is typically lower than that calculated using a finer grid. Sun and Sheng (2002) coupled CH3D with the REF/DIF wave model (Kirby and Dalrymple (1994)) and showed significant effects of waves on water level and coastal currents. They compared simulated wave setup to measured laboratory data and found that the calculated wave setup is usually overestimated and proposed that the original wave forcing should be reduced by multiplying wave forcing by a coefficient of 0.8. This is rather an ad hoc approach and the high radiation stresses might have come from overestimated waves calculated by Recently, some efforts have been made in order to derive vertically varying radiation stress. Mellor (2003) exploited three-dimensional equations of motion decomposing velocities into three components: mean current, wave, and turbulence. His radiation stress terms are vertically dependant and, if depth integrated, appear in a more conventional form as in Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964)."}, {"section_title": "Miscellaneous", "text": "Davis and  found that the maximum surge heights depend on the tidal phase when the hurricane landfall occurs: maximum surge height occurs when hurricane landfall occurs at several hours after the peak tide.  simulated the storm surge in Pinellas County using the PEM model (Davis and Sheng, 2002) and found that the maximum surge heights and flooding patterns for the county are dramatically different when the high resolution ALSM data are used as opposed to the USGS 0.25-degree data.  used the 2-D version of CH3D and REF/DIF to simulate the wave setup, and used the SWAN (Holthuijsen et al., 2000) to simulate the wind-induced surge in Pinellas County.

The model will be capable of performing in shallow water regions and simulating wetting-and-drying.  WNA and WINDGEN winds were extensively utilized in this study. Two other wind models that were tested: a complex Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) model and a much simpler analytic wind model (Holland, 1980) based on the hypothesis of an exponential decay of atmospheric pressure from the center of a storm. The PBL model is based on Chow (1971) (Cardone et al., 1992) d where  This parameterization is based on matching of mean profiles of wind, temperature, and moisture by surface and outer layer similarity theories. The general form of the parametric relations may be written as where u and v are the vertically averaged horizontal velocity components (in the direction of the surface shear and perpendicular to it, respectively); z 0 is the roughness parameter; \u03ba is von Karman's constant; \u03b8 V and q are the mean layer virtual potential temperature and specific humidity, respectively (the subscript 0 denotes the value at z 0 ); \u03b8 * is a potential temperature scale expressed in terms of the heat flux, H; q * is a specific humidity scale involving the moisture flux; and A m , B m , C m , and D m are universal functions of dimensionless similarity parameters.

If h L \u2264 \u22122 (unstable) then where g\u03b8 * is the Monin-Obukhov length; C P is the heat capacity. For near-neutral conditions, \u22122 < h/L < 2, A m , B m , and C m are assumed to be given by linear interpolation between the above computed values at h/L = \u00b12. The PBL model is a sophisticated wind model but the uncertainty in choosing the right parameters makes it hard to use when only a few major storm parameters such as central pressure deficit, translation speed, direction, and radius to maximum winds are known. A simpler analytic wind model by Holland (1980) does not have as many uncertain parameters as the PBL model and it can be very useful in simulating hypothetical storm events. The model is built into the CH3D model and is based on the assumption of exponentially varying atmospheric pressure from the storm center also known as the storm eye: where P 0 is the central atmospheric pressure, P \u221e is the atmospheric pressure far away from the center, r is the distance from the center of the storm, and A and B are scaling parameters. Davis (2001) followed a simplifying assumption made by Wilson (1957) to set A to the radius of maximum wind speed, R, and set B equal to 1 in his simulations of Hurricanes Floyd and Irene (1999). Repeating Davis (2001) derivation steps yields where P a is the relative atmospheric pressure and P 0 = P 0 \u2212 P \u221e is the central pressure drop of the storm. The cyclostrophic wind velocity, U c , is The geostrophic wind velocity, U g , is The gradient wind velocity, U G , is [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] and the resolved part, V * s , of the translational velocity of the storm, where \u03b8 is the angle from the direction of bearing of the storm, \u03b2, to any point inside the storm. The surface wind velocity, U s , in the x\u2212 and y\u2212 directions is then written as where \u03c6 is an inward rotation angle of 18 o and K is the ratio of surface wind velocity to gradient wind velocity."}, {"section_title": "Regional Circulation Model: ADCIRC", "text": "ADCIRC is ADvanced CIRCulation model that solves the equations of motion for a fluid on a rotating earth.

This makes the model computationally efficient without much of a slow down when coupled with the local circulation model, CH3D. Both models can use the same time step. Some of the deficiencies that ADCIRC has include its inability to exploit boundary fitted grids. Near land, shoreline approximation can be reached by increasing the resolution of the computational grid. The ADCIRC computational grid that was provided to us had rather coarse resolution (5-6 km) along the coastline which would result in losing some accuracy of the calculated storm surge in the nearshore regions. Also, the version of ADCIRC which was used in this study does not calculate wetting-and-drying.

It solves the spectral action density balance equation for wave number-direction spectra. The implicit assumption of these equations is that the medium (depth and current) as well as the wave field vary on time and space scales that are much larger than the corresponding scales of a single wave. Furthermore, the physics included in the model do not cover conditions where the waves are severely depth-limited. This implies that the model can generally by applied on spatial scales (grid increments) larger than 1 to 10 km, and outside the surf zone. The governing equations include refraction and straining of the wave field due to temporal and spatial variations of the mean water depth and the mean current (tides, surges etc.), and wave growth and decay due to the actions of wind, nonlinear resonant interactions, dissipation ('whitecapping') and bottom friction. Wave propagation is considered to be linear. Relevant nonlinear effects such as resonant interactions are therefore included in the source terms (physics). The WAVEWATCH-III North Atlantic computational grid (shown in Figure 2-2) covers the western North Atlantic including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. The size of the grid is 275\u00d7203 with spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (\u223c28 km). WAVEWATCH-III products are 6-hour hindcast and 120-hour forecast with 6-hour intervals.

WAVEWATCH-III wave forcing was obtained by the courtesy of NOAA/NCEP. This is one of the advantages of using the model: no computational burden is involved at all except for the preprocessing phase. Another reason for using WAVEWATCH-III is that, as will be shown in Section 5.1.4, the model produces good results compared with measured data during hurricane events.

First, the algorithm is implemented into the vertically averaged equations of CH3D. During each time step, the vertically averaged equations of CH3D are first solved, and a new shoreline is calculated. This new shoreline is then implemented in the calculation of the three-dimensional baroclinic flow field. In the curvilinear coordinate system, the two-dimensional vertically averaged, non-dimensional equations can be written as where F \u03be and F \u03b7 are the remaining nonlinear, horizontal diffusion, wind stress, bottom friction, radiation stress, atmospheric pressure gradient and surface slope in the opposite directions terms, and u, v are depth-averaged velocities defined as where H = h + \u03b6 is total water depth.

A resulting zero value of the total depth in the cell center means the cell is dry and it may be flooded when the total water depth becomes positive. Since the CH3D model uses the total depth as a denominator in some of its equations' terms, the zero total depth value is not always a good way of distinguishing between wet and dry cells. Also, very small total depth might bring in instability, e.g., very strong wind blowing over extremely shallow water will result in a highly unpredictable behavior of horizontal velocities which may grow unrealistically high and cause the model to blow up. To solve the problem, a \"critical\" total depth value as opposed to the zero total depth value was used to distinguish between wet and dry cells. If the total depth of a cell is smaller than the critical value then the cell is dry, otherwise it is wet. The value of 30 cm performed well under hurricane strong wind conditions.

Following the relation between z 0 and C d , , yields the wave enhanced drag coefficient where C p is wave phase speed and W s /C p represents the inverse wave age. Wave enhancement of bottom stress is implemented in CH3D using two methodologies. The first methodology exploits the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory described in a simplified form by Signell et al. (1990). The second methodology makes use of a one-dimensional wave-current bottom boundary layer model (Sheng and Villaret, 1989) as described in Sheng and Villaret (1989) and Sun (2001). The Grant and Madsen (1979) formulation is given by the typical quadratic law with one distinction: C de is the wave enhanced drag coefficient. The main idea used in the formulation in order to find C de is that where \u03c4 C is the bottom stress due to current and \u03c4 W is the maximum stress due to waves which can be defined as where U W is the near-bottom wave orbital velocity and f W is the wave friction factor which depends on the bottom roughness, k s and the near-bottom excursion amplitude A B = U W /\u03c9 and whose values are obtained using the empirical expressions from Grant and Madsen (1982): With u * B determined, an iteration procedure is used to determine C de at z r . With an initial guess of C de , the steady shear stress component u * B is The combined wave-current shear velocity u * CW is defined by The apparent bottom roughness k BC , which indicates the turbulence level due to the combination of the wave boundary layer and the physical bottom roughness, is expressed as where the exponent \u03b2 is given by The apparent roughness is then used to determine the velocity profile in the constant stress region above the wave boundary layer using the law-of-the-wall The final expression for the wave enhanced drag coefficient is where z r is a reference height chosen to lie above the wave boundary layer and k BC is the apparent bottom roughness which accounts for the turbulence induced by both the wave boundary layer and physical bottom roughness. According to Signell et al. (1990), the reference height was specified as 20 cm and k s = 0.1 cm was selected to correspond to a drag coefficient of 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at one meter above the bed in the absence of waves. Once the effective drag coefficient C de is calculated, it is used in CH3D to compute bottom stress as defined by equation 2-62. As was pointed out in Section 1.1.2, the Grant and Madsen (1979) methodology has some deficiencies which include a fictitious reference velocity at an unknown level and the assumption of the logarithmic layer being constant which is not correct when waves are present. Sun (2001) used a 1-D wave-current bottom boundary layer model based on Sheng and Villaret (1989) to calculate bottom shear stress through nonlinear interaction between waves and currents. This model was adopted and implemented in CH3D in the following paragraphs. The governing equations for the combined wave-current bottom boundary layer model are the vertical one-dimensional equations of motion: Boundary conditions at the bottom are: where u 1 , v 1 are velocity components at the lowest grid point, z 1 , and C d is computed by: where z 0 is the bottom roughness (it was set to 0.1 cm) and \u03ba is the von Karman constant. The smallest grid spacing near the bottom is 0.03 cm. Boundary conditions above the bottom boundary layer which was set to 30 cm are: To drive an oscillatory motion due to waves, a pressure gradient from the linear wave theory is applied: where g is gravitational acceleration, k is wave number, H is wave height, \u03d5 is wave direction, and \u03c3 is angular wave frequency. To drive a current, a constant pressure gradient is applied in the y\u2212 direction: The eddy viscosity A v is determined using a TKE closure model developed by Sheng and Villaret (1989). The model solves an equation for the turbulent kinetic energy, q 2 : The second-order correlation terms of fluctuating velocities are solved using the following equilibrium condition: The macro-scale \u039b is determined by the following integral constraints: where C 1 is between 0.1 and 0.25, H is the total depth, H p is the depth of pycnocline, C 2 ranging between 0.1 and 0.25 is the fractional cut-off limitation of turbulent macro-scale based on \u03b4 q 2 , the spread of the turbulence determined from the turbulent kinetic energy profile, and N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency defined as: (2-88) Sheng and Villaret (1989) and Sun (2001)  2) were performed to validate the model: for a pure oscillatory flow (Jonsson and Carlsen, 1979) and uniform current superimposed on an oscillatory flow (Bakker and Dorn, 1978). The model results of both tests agreed well with the experimental data. A series of model runs (a total of 145200 runs) using various combinations of water depth, wave height, wave period, wave direction and current magnitude (shown in Table 2-2) was performed in order to develop a \"look-up KM \u2212 z 0 , and the wave height corresponded to the z 1 point is determined according to the linear wave theory: where h is local water depth, \u03b6 is water surface elevation, KM is the number of vertical layers in CH3D, and H (z=\u03b6) is wave height at the surface.  (Mellor, 2003). The derivation of the vertically uniform radiation stress and the relation between radiation stress gradients and wave setup follows in the manner of Dean and Dalrymple (1991). If a wave is propagating at some angle \u03b8 to the x axis (representing onshore direction), then the radiation stress in this direction will be: Similarly, the radiation stress in the transverse (longshore) direction will be: where n is the ratio of group velocity to wave celerity. There is an additional term which represents the flux in the x direction of the y component of momentum In a simple 1-D case, the relation between the radiation stress and wave setup can be expressed as follows: where\u03b7 is the mean water surface slope or wave setup. In 2-D case, a system of two differential equations has to be solved: Mellor (2003) derived equations for three-dimensional ocean circulation models that handle surface waves. In his derivation radiation stresses vary vertically and are expressed as follows: where H is the total depth; \u03c3 = (z \u2212 \u03b6)/H ; k is the wave number whose x\u2212 and y\u2212 components are k \u03b1 and k \u03b2 , respectively; E is the total wave energy; \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 is the Kronecker delta; and (1+\u03c3) sinh KH (1+\u03c3) cosh KH 1+\u03c3) cosh KH (2-97) If Mellor's equations are integrated vertically, his radiation stresses become identical to those of Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964). Since CH3D calculates the water surface elevation in the \"external mode\" where vertically integrated equations are used, the calculated wave setup will be the same no matter which radiation stress formulation is used. The difference between the two formulations will take place in the velocity field."}, {"section_title": "Local Wave Model: SWAN", "text": "The SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) model (Booij et al., 1999 wave steepness, and some others.

The corresponding source term for these mechanisms is commonly described as the sum of linear and exponential growth: in which A and B depend on wave frequency and direction, and wind speed and direction. The dissipation term of wave energy is represented by the summation of three Whitecapping is primarily controlled by the steepness of the waves. In SWAN the whitecapping formulations are based on a pulse-based model: where \u0393 is a steepness dependent coefficient, k is wave number and\u03c3 andk denote a mean frequency and a mean wave number, respectively. Depth-induced dissipation may be caused by bottom friction which can generally be represented as: in which C bottom is a bottom friction coefficient. JONSWAP suggested to use an empirically obtained constant. It performs well in many different conditions as long as a suitable value is chosen (typically different for swell and wind sea). The total dissipation (i.e., integrated over the spectrum) due to depth-induced wave breaking in shallow water can be well modeled with the dissipation of a bore applied to the breaking waves in a random field. The expression used in SWAN is: where E tot is the total wave energy and D tot (which is negative) is the rate of dissipation of the total energy due to wave breaking. In deep water, quadruplet wave-wave interactions dominate the evolution of the spectrum. They transfer wave energy from the spectral peak to lower frequencies (thus moving the peak frequency to lower values) and to higher frequencies (where the energy is dissipated by whitecapping). In very shallow water, triad wave-wave interactions transfer energy from lower frequencies to higher frequencies often resulting in higher harmonics (low-frequency energy generation by triad wave-wave interactions is not considered here Some of the deficiencies of the SWAN model include the assumption of the wave spectrum being Gaussian which may not be true in the breaker zone (Ochi, 1998), and the incapability of replicating extreme dissipation imparted by muddy bottom (Kaihatu and Sheremet, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "When it comes to numerical simulation of a storm surge, various physical processes have to be taken into account.

There is also an interaction between these physical processes that takes place at the air-sea One of the major advantages of this methodology is that unlike many other storm surge models, the water elevation is calculated dynamically and not in parts which include storm surge, tide and wave setup in the surf zone. It is all done as a whole due to the reason that all these parts that water elevation consists of interact between each other in a non-linear fashion and it would be physically incorrect to neglect this interaction."}, {"section_title": "Coupling Mechanism", "text": "By definition, a storm surge is an increase (or decrease) in water level associated with some significant meteorological event, e.g. persistent strong winds and change in atmospheric pressure (as in a tropical cyclone). This means that there are two major components in storm surge modeling: an atmospheric model which calculates wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure during a hurricane  event; and a circulation model which calculates surface water elevation and currents based on the meteorological conditions provided by the atmospheric model. As was stated earlier, wave effects can become a significant factor during storm events. Waves breaking in the surf zone transfer their momentum to the water column which results in wave set-up or increase in water elevation from the breaker point to the point where the waves completely dissipate by running up the beach. Wave setup is mainly a function of the breaking wave height. Stormy seas generate large waves which break further offshore as opposed to waves during regular conditions, thus extending the surf zone. As a result, a larger area is affected by the rising water due to wave set-up which can be significant and has to be accounted for. Therefore, adding a wave model as another component of storm surge calculation adds robustness to the entire storm surge modeling system. Carolina or Florida) during hurricane events when the actual hurricane is located thousands of kilometers away. Both models can run concurrently using the same time step. ADCIRC results are not affected by results of CH3D. The same one-way coupling is used to couple WAVEWATCH-III and SWAN. The second type of coupling is two-way coupling which is also known as dynamic coupling, where the results calculated by model A are fed to model B whose results are fed back to model A. This type of coupling is used to couple the local circulation model, CH3D, and the local wave model, SWAN. CH3D solves for water elevation and currents. It also accounts for situations when land cells become flooded and vice versa. SWAN computes wave conditions within the same curvilinear grid as used in CH3D. Since wave conditions change relatively slowly, the wave model simulation was conducted every 30 minutes to ease the computational burden. This means that after thirty 60-second CH3D time steps, the two models mutually exchange information. CH3D loads in wave information (wave height, wave period, and wave direction) to account for wave setup. SWAN, in return, updates bathymetry that changes in time due to tide, storm surge, wave setup, and inundation of previous land areas. The current field used in SWAN simulation gets updated as well. Also, the updated wind field is passed onto the wave model via CH3D. A diagram of the entire coupling process from initialization to concurrent simulation and coupling of ADCIRC, CH3D, and SWAN is shown in Figure 3 Dealing with storm surge in shallow water coastal areas brings the issue of capability of taking into account of wetting-and-drying right to the front. The ability to account for wetting-and-drying is essential in storm surge modeling since the main question to be answered by storm surge prediction models is not how high the surge may rise near the shore during a hurricane event but how far the surge might propagate inland, what land areas might be affected and how much damage it may cause. Some methodologies that try to account for flooding (e.g., FEMA) do not do it dynamically, that is, they just calculate the maximum surge level and extend it from the coastal area to the land. This is a rather simple approach and it does not consider the actual physical processes that move the water up the beach over the land. Also, the maximum storm surge level is a fixed number, which is independent of time. Therefore, this approach cannot tell when in time a land area will be inundated and once it gets inundated, how long it will stay flooded. Storm surge models that do not have wetting-and-drying scheme incorporated in them cannot produce accurate storm surge near the coastline. Hubbert and McInnes (1999) showed that their storm surge heights at the coast produced by 'fixed coastline' version of the model were overestimated by 17% compared with the inundation version of their model. This overestimation comes as a result of the water being piled up near the coast by the action of high wind and the 'fixed coastline' storm surge model not allowing the water to propagate inland. The CH3D model is capable of accounting for wetting-and-drying. The method is based on a lightly modified version of a robust wetting-and-drying scheme developed by Casulli and Cheng (1992). The technical description can be found in Section 2.3.4.2. The idea is, every time step the model calculates free surface elevation which is then used to calculate total depth. If the total depth in a computational cell exceeds some \"critical\" value (i.e., 30 cm), then the cell is considered to be wet, otherwise dry."}, {"section_title": "Validation", "text": "In order to validate the wetting-and-drying scheme, three test cases were performed: (1) the wall case, (2) the wind case, and (3) the analytical solution case. The first two cases are rather qualitative and the third test is very robust and quantitative.\nIn order to validate the air pressure gradient term, a numerical solution based on the governing CH3D equations was compared with analytical solution derived by Holland (1980) and simplified as in Wilson (1957) (see Section 2.3.1). The local pressure in a storm can be written as: where P 0 is the pressure in the center of the storm, P \u221e is the free stream pressure, r is the distance from the center of the storm, and R is the radius to maximum wind. For steady state condition, the water surface elevation due to the pressure gradient of the storm can be written as: where C is specified by boundary conditions or simply zero in case of steady state conditions. The computational domain for the test was a 100 km \u00d7 100 km rectangular grid. The following parameters were used for analytical storm: atmospheric pressure at center, P 0 = 960 mb; free stream pressure, P \u221e = 1013 mb; radius to maximum wind, R = 30 km. The analytical solution of water level is shown in Figure 4-12 and the difference between the analytical solution and numerical solution is shown in Figure 4-13. The difference is on the order of 0.0001 cm, which validates the accuracy of the implemented in the CH3D model atmospheric pressure gradient terms.  Villaret (1989).

First, the wave model (SWAN) calculates 2-D wave field and passes it to the circulation model (CH3D) which calculates radiation stresses and water elevation, which when any other forcing mechanisms such as tide, wind or atmospheric pressure gradient are not accounted for, represents wave setup. Two laboratory experiments were simulated in order to validate the wave setup calculation methodology. The first experiment was by Stive and Wind (1982). In the experiment the authors studied variations of radiation stress and mean water level for the twodimensional shoaling and breaking of progressive, periodic waves on a plane, gently slopping laboratory beach. The experiment was conducted in a wave flume which is 55 m long, 1 m wide and 1 m high (see Figure 4-19).  During the experiment the following wave parameters were used by the The second experiment was by Mory and Hamm (1997).

Sun and Sheng (2002) studied the importance of wave-induced currents and other wave related effects on the general nearshore circulation. In order to account for these effects, a couple of wave-related features were incorporated in CH3D.\nThe Mory and Hamm (1997) Kirby and Dalrymple (1994) was used. One of the experiments was conducted using a monochromatic incident wave generated by the wave maker with a wave height of 0.075 m and a wave period of 1.69 s.

The computational layout of the test is shown in Figure 4-3. The bed is mildly sloped (1:100,000) and the wind (0.1 dyne/cm 2 ) blows onshore. There are four output locations. Location 1 is initially dry and becomes wet during the simulation. The results are consistent with what one would expect. In Location 1, which is initially dry, surface elevation does not change during some period of time due to the reason that the water which is piling up against the beach has not yet reached the location. To clarify the behavior of the blue line in Figure 4-4, it has to be noted that it was plotted the way that when a cell is dry it has no value for water elevation. Later on, when Location 1 gets inundated by the water that is being pushed onshore by the blowing wind, the water elevation starts to grow from the initial elevation which is ground level.

"}, {"section_title": "Forcing and Boundary Conditions", "text": "The major boundary condition that must be specified along the open boundaries of a coastal model domain is tide. Ideally, water surface elevation measured along open boundaries can be used to specify the boundary condition. However, due to the paucity of real time tide data, it is usual to specify tidal constituents along the open boundaries. Recently, a tidal database was created using the AD-CIRC model (Luettich et al., 1992) for the Western North Atlantic, Caribbean Isabel. The constituents and their corresponding periods are listed in Table 5-3. It should be noted that although the tidal database was partially validated (except nonlinearly generated constituents M4, M6, and STEADY) by Mukai et al. (2001), there are still errors associated with the constituents. In order to improve tidal simulation by reducing errors associated with the ADCIRC constituents in the Outer Banks/Chesapeake Bay area, an analysis of tidal constituents based on a comparison between simulated and measured water elevation was performed. The analysis was done using the IOS program (Foreman, 1977) for calculating tidal constituents based on measured or simulated time series of water elevation. A two-month period, Sep-15, 2003through Nov-15, 2003  Wind is a major force driving a storm surge. So when it comes to using wind in a storm surge model, it is very important to validate the wind because its accuracy will be a significant factor in the overall accuracy of model's output. Two analysis wind fields were used to drive the model: WINDGEN and WNA (refer to Table 2-1) for more information on these wind fields).       Figure 5-7: Significant wave height and peak wave period obtained from WAVEWATCH-III compared with measured wave height at NDBC station 41001.   Figure 4-29 for the entire FRF instrument setup); and the third set was provided by Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) which measured waves at Gloucester Point, VA (see Figure 5-9 for the location of the VIMS instrument package). First, let us compare the simulated and measured wave parameters at the FRF Waverider approximately 4 km offshore (these data will be further referred to as the Duck data). The depth at the location is 17 m. The maximum significant wave height measured at the FRF Waverider buoy during Hurricane Isabel was 8.1 m, while the largest wave (crest to trough) recorded on September 18 at 19:11 UTC, was 12.1 m. The ratio of the largest wave to local water depth, 12.1/17 = 0.71, is close to the range when waves might start to break. The \"simulated vs. measured\" significant wave height, peak wave period and wave direction are shown in Figures 5-10, 5-11, and 5-12, respectively. It should be pointed out that all simulated results presented in this section were obtained using the WNA wind, since the WINDGEN wind for Hurricane Isabel was slightly less accurate. The simulated wave height matches well with the measured data with Figure 5-10: Simulated significant wave height vs. measured from the FRF Waverider buoy during Hurricane Isabel. slight underestimation at the peak. There is also a phase lag right before the peak which might be due to swell waves generated outside of the computational domain which could not be properly simulated by the SWAN model because, as was discussed in Section 5.1.4, the wave height boundary conditions obtained from the regional WAVEWATCH-III model were slightly underestimated right before Hurricane Isabel passed over the area. The consequence of such wave height underestimation will most likely result in lower than expected wave setup right before the peak of the storm. Despite that, however, the peak wave height values match well, which should result in an accurate calculated wave setup contribution to the overall peak storm surge level. The calculated peak wave period matches the measured peak period very well, so does the calculated wave direction, especially during the peak of the storm when the difference was less than 5 degrees, an excellent agreement. Wave direction is an important factor in calculation of wave setup. Wave rays approaching the shore perpendicularly will cause higher wave setup as opposed to the case when they approach the shore in an oblique manner . Wave direction can also influence the estimation of cross-shore and longshore currents. (from north-west to south-east) are shown in the bottom panel plot. Northerly and southerly longshore currents are formed in both plots. Since no other forcing mechanism (wind or tide) was considered in this simulation, currents are generated by wave action only through radiation stresses and wave setup. Now, let us compare simulated and measured wave parameters at the end of the FRF pier approximately 600 m offshore (these data will be referred to as the Duck 625 data). The depth at this location is 8.4 m and the maximum measured significant wave height during Hurricane Isabel was 3.7 m. The \"simulated vs. measured\" significant wave height and peak wave period comparisons are shown in Figure 5-14. There was no record of wave direction at that location. The trend in simulated significant wave height at the FRF pier is similar to that at the Duck As was pointed out earlier in this section, the underestimation of wave height before the peak of the storm will result in lower than expected wave setup during that time. But due to the fact that the peak wave height values match well, the contribution of the calculated wave setup to the overall storm surge during its peak at the end of the FRF pier should be accurate. The calculated peak wave period is again in good agreement with the observed one. Now, let us compare simulated and measured wave parameters at Gloucester Point, VA (these data will be referred to as the VIMS data). The depth at the location is around 8.5 m, while the maximum measured significant wave height during Hurricane Isabel was 1.7 m. The \"simulated vs. measured\" significant wave height and peak wave period comparisons are shown in Figure 5 the peaks agree well. The main reason behind this is the strong WNA wind which in reality was slightly weaker (see Figure D-7 in Appendix D). The result of the slight wave height overestimation at VIMS will be a slightly higher than expected wave setup in that location. The calculated peak wave period agrees well with observed."}, {"section_title": "Results: Simulated Water Level", "text": "In order to establish how well the modeling system performs during hurricanes when different forcing mechanisms are present, several simulations of Hurricane Isabel were carried out using WNA or WINDGEN wind and including or excluding wave effect. Simulated water elevation, using WNA and WINDGEN wind (both include wave effect), are compared with measured water elevation at seven stations in Figures 5-16 through 5-22. All the other simulated versus measured water elevation results during Hurricane Isabel are shown in Appendix F. It can be noted that the peak values of the calculated water surface elevation match the measured water elevation well at Duck, Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and Gloucester Point. The simulated wind at the Outer Banks and lower Chesapeake Bay agree well with data and, as a result, the simulated water elevations agree well       with measured data. Right before the peak, a slight underestimation can be observed at all the stations. As was pointed out in the previous section, the computed wave height before the peak was underestimated due to the underestimated wave boundary conditions provided to SWAN by the regional WAVEWATCH-III model. This underestimation resulted in lower than expected wave setup right before the peak of the storm. The wave height at the peak of the storm was accurately simulated, which resulted in adequate contribution of calculated wave setup to the simulated water level at that time.  This demonstrates that wave setup can be a significant factor and contributor to storm surge level and inundation.

It should be noted that during the peak of the surge, the tide was at its low stage at an approximate level of -0.3 m.

An Despite the fact that the storm surge level was not too high (thanks to low tide during the peak), it took approximately 30 hours from the point when the Figure 5-78: Simulated storm surge (water level minus tide) at the three stations using WNA wind."}, {"section_title": "Error Analysis", "text": "Error analysis is a good way of estimating how well the calculated water elevation compares with water level measured at tide stations throughout the computational domain. It has to be pointed out that measured water elevation consists of two parts: tide and storm surge itself. Theoretically, the storm surge part can also be split into two constituents, one due to wind action and the other due to wave setup. But practically it is impossible to filter out the wave setup from the storm surge and therefore it would be reasonable if we left the storm surge elevation intact. Tide, on the other hand, can be filtered out using the Doodson and Warburg (1941) 39-hourly average tidal filter as described by Groves (1955). An error between measured and calculated water elevation can be attributed to either tide or storm surge or their combination. In order to estimate the contribution of each source of error, a \"pure\" tide simulation was performed and its results were compared with tidal elevation which was filtered out from measured water elevation using Doodson and Warburg (1941) 39-hourly average tidal filter. \"Pure\" tide simulation means that the only boundary force imposed during that simulation was tide and all other forcing mechanisms such as wind and wave were not considered. In order to weigh the effect of each component involved in the non-linear interaction between the surge, tide, wind, and wave, several simulations were made by including different component combinations. Turning the wetting-and-drying feature on and off was an option as well. Table 5-7 specifies the six specific features included in five simulations.  Continued on next page Based on this error analysis, especially on the average RMS errors and average absolute errors at the peak water elevation, it can be concluded that the WNA wind produced slightly better surge simulation results than the WINDGEN wind. This is consistent with the overall analysis of wind data shown in Table 5-6, which justifies the importance of wind accuracy: more accurate wind produces more accurate water elevation results. The accuracy of the simulated water elevation depended on the accurate simulation of tide which was accurate across the Outer Banks up to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, with the average RMS error of approximately 4 cm. Inside the bay, the accuracy of the calculated tide worsened, with the average RMS error increasing to 6 cm. So did the accuracy of the simulated water elevation, which was also accompanied with the worse accuracy of the WNA wind inside the Chesapeake Bay as opposed to that over the Outer Banks. Overall, Simulation 3 produced better results in terms of smaller RMS errors and better comparison with measured water surface elevation at its peak. Water level calculated using wave enhanced bottom friction based on the Sheng and Villaret (1989) formulation (Simulation 4 b ) was slightly worse. Simulation 4 a which accounted for wave enhanced bottom friction (Grant and Madsen (1979) formulation) was even worse due to overestimated bottom friction. Simulation 5 which did not account for wetting-and-drying improved the results inside Chesapeake Bay, but the only reason for this improvement was that the calculated water elevation was significantly underestimated there, so when the flooding was turned off, the water elevation was able to gain 20-30 cm more, thus making it look better. The \"timing\" errors are very small (based on Simulation 4 b using WNA wind, 0 to 16 min) for the three Outer Bank stations (Beaufort, Duck, and Chesapeake Bay Bridge). For the other four stations inside Chesapeake Bay the errors are much larger (45 min to almost 3 hours). This is consistent with the fact that the WNA wind was more accurate in the Outer Banks area compared with the wind in the Chesapeake Bay area. Also, more accurate over the Outer Banks area WNA wind produced smaller \"timing\" errors compared with less accurate WINDGEN wind in that area. And more accurate over the Chesapeake Bay WINDGEN wind produced smaller \"timing\" errors compared with less accurate WNA wind in that area. Including wave and radiation stress terms (Simulation 2) increased the calculated water level by 1-17%. More significant wave setup effect was observed along the Outer Banks and less significant inside Chesapeake Bay. This is in accordance with the wave height distribution over the area: larger breaking waves resulted in higher wave setup. In the Chesapeake Bay, waves were not as high as near the Outer Banks, thus the wave setup was lower. Adding wave enhanced surface stress helped further increase (in most cases) the computed water elevation by 5-18%. At Beaufort, the increase was not very significant (2%), and at Kiptopeke, a 1% decrease was observed. This happened because during the peak of the storm, the wind was blowing primarily offshore. Waves increased the stress thus pushing more water offshore and creating a slight set-down. Accounting for wave enhanced bottom friction using the Grant and Madsen (1979) model decreased the calculated water elevation by 1-14%. The importance of the wave enhanced bottom friction was more significant inside shallower Chesapeake Bay. It is known that the Grant and Madsen (1979) model tends to overestimate the wave enhanced bottom stress (Sheng, 1982), although there was insufficient data during Hurricane Isabel to confirm this. To improve the uncertainty of the wave-enhanced bottom stress, a one-dimensional turbulent boundary layer model with TKE closure (Sheng and Villaret, 1989) was used to develop a \"look-up table\" (see Section 2.3.4.3) for calculating wave enhanced bottom stress in a wide range of combined wave-current boundary layer flows. When wetting-and-drying scheme was not activated during the calculation, the peak water level value, in general, grew an extra 2-20%, although the elevation actually dropped near Duck. After analyzing the flood map obtained during Simulation 4 b when wetting-and-drying was activated, it turned out that this part of the grid had high enough topographic elevation so it did not get flooded during Isabel. Therefore, when wetting-and-drying was disabled, the calculated water elevation would not be affected much anyway. Why did the elevation actually drop? It happened because when the CH3D model runs in \"no wetting-and-drying\" mode, a minimum depth has to be specified. During Simulation 5, this depth was set to 10 m, meaning that any grid cell whose depth was less than 10 m was forced to be 10 m. Normally, the minimum depth should be set as low as possible to reduce the number of cells to be affected by the cut-off depth. Picking a small value might cause the model to become unstable, especially under severe wind conditions, and blow-up which did happen when the minimum depth was set to less than 10 m. The actual depth at Duck is less than 6 m, so during Simulation 5, it was set to 10 m. Such deepening of the bathymetry caused a slight decrease in the calculated water surface elevation. This case brings out a problem related to storm surge models without wetting-and-drying. Most such models, including ADCIRC, have a cut-off depth. This may result in inaccurate storm surge simulations. 118 Table 5-10 shows peak storm surge values (tide was subtracted from water elevation) computed during these simulations. Percent increase or decrease was calculated the same way it was calculated in the previous table. The results demonstrate that including wave setup increased and improved the calculated surge, especially at Beaufort and Duck. Its effect ranged between 3-18%. Wave-enhanced wind also made the computed surge look better by increasing the values by 1-16%. The wave-enhanced bottom stress calculated using the Grant and Madsen (1979) model, mostly made the surge look worse by decreasing the peak surge values by 0-16%. Wave enhanced bottom stress calculated using the Sheng and Villaret (1989) formulation (Simulation 4 b ) decreased the surge less dramatically, by 0-5%. When the wetting-and-drying feature was inactive, the surge level inside Chesapeake Bay grew by 3-14%. Another interesting fact can be deduced from comparing water elevation calculated by linear superposition of separately simulated tide, wave setup, and surge with water elevation calculated through the dynamic coupling. As can be seen from these figures, at the peak the linearly coupled water elevation is only slightly higher than the dynamically coupled one. Does this mean that the dynamic coupling in storm surge modeling does not bring in a significant improvement? Not necessarily. This might be the case when one is not concerned about flooding, otherwise the major difference between linear and dynamic coupling can be observed over inundated areas.   As can be seen from the figures, at the beginning all three locations are dry. Then, in the middle of the storm, they get inundated and after the storm passes they get dry again. The difference between water elevations calculated linearly and dynamically is significant during the peak of the storm. The reason behind that is that when tide and wave setup were calculated separately, their elevation was not high enough to flood those locations. Thus, only separately calculated surge was able to flood those areas but it was significantly lower than the one calculated through the dynamic coupling. Also, when coupled linearly, the location near South River was flooded 10 hours after the area was flooded using the dynamic coupling.   Near Gloucester, VA Figure 5-31: Linearly coupled water elevation vs. water elevation calculated through dynamic coupling near Gloucester, VA. The location is initially dry and gets flooded during Isabel. After the surge recedes, it becomes dry again.\nAs was discussed in section 5.1.7, error analysis is a good way of comparing calculated water elevation to measured water level. In that section it was also pointed out that an error between measured and calculated water elevation can be attributed to either tide or storm surge or their combination. An estimation of the contribution of tide to the total error was done by performing a \"pure\" tide simulation and comparing its results with tidal elevation which was filtered out from measured water elevation using Doodson and Warburg (1941) 39-hourly average tidal filter. In order to weigh the effect of each component involved in the non-linear interaction between the surge, tide, wind, and wave, several simulations were made by including different component combinations. Turning the wetting-and-drying feature on and off was an option as well.  used to calculate the errors). Errors of peak values (measured peak elevation minus simulated peak elevation) and timing errors (time when measured peak elevation occurred minus time when simulated peak elevation occurred) are also shown. A separate column in the table displays the errors attributed to \"pure\" tide. Tidal range is also shown for each station.        Based on RMS errors and average absolute errors shown in the table above, it can be concluded that the WINDGEN wind gave significantly more accurate surge elevations than the WNA wind. The peak water elevations calculated using WNA wind were not very well pronounced, therefore errors at the peak and \"timing\" errors at the peak were not calculated and are not shown in Table 5-12. The accuracy of the simulated tide was not very good, with the average RMS error of 9 to 10 cm, which might be due to a significant contribution of non-linear tidal constituents which were not included in the boundary condition of this model simulation. The simulated water elevation at Ft Myers was significantly underestimated, whereas at the other three stations the results looked very good. It is hard to say what caused the Ft Myers elevation to be so low. The station is located on the Caloosahatchee River, approximately 25 km inland. The wind station located there broke down before the storm reached its maximum strength in the area, thus the accuracy of the wind data used in the model near Ft Myers is uncertain. Overall, excluding the Ft Myers station, Simulation 4 b produced better results in terms of smaller RMS errors and better comparison with measured water surface elevation at its peak. Simulation 5, when the wetting-and-drying feature was disabled, significantly worsen the results for the three stations within Estero Bay. On the other hand, Simulation 5 significantly improved the computed water level at Ft Myers. This happened because without wetting more water was pushed up the Caloosahatchee River significantly increasing the water elevation there. The \"timing\" errors are in excellent agreement with measured data for all four stations (5 to 45 min, with the average error around 20 min). Table 5-13 shows the peak water elevation values calculated during these simulations along with the measured ones. By normalizing the difference between consecutive simulations by the peak measured water level, we can calculate percent increase or decrease that each component introduced at the time when the peak water elevation was observed (e.g., at Big Carlos Pass, the Simulation 2 value \u2191 3% relative to the Simulation 1 value, and the Simulation 4 a and 4 b values \u2193 7% and \u2193 2% relative to the Simulation 3 value, respectively). Including radiation stress terms increased the calculated water level by 1-5%. Adding wave enhanced surface stress helped further increase the computed water elevation by 6-15%. Accounting for wave enhanced bottom friction decreased the calculated water elevation by 7-16% and 1-8% using Grant and Madsen (1979) and Sheng and Villaret (1989) formulations, respectively. When wetting-and-drying scheme was not engaged during the calculation the peak water level value grew an extra 18-49%. The results reveal that including wave setup increased and improved the calculated surge by 2-5%. This increase was not as significant as it was observed during Hurricane Isabel (3-18%) due the reason that waves were not as high during Charley as they were during Isabel and all four stations were located in estuaries (Estero Bay and Caloosahatchee River), and thus were sheltered, whereas some of the Isabel stations such as Beaufort, Duck, and Chespeake Bay Bridge were located on the open ocean front. The wave-enhanced wind was a significant factor in increasing and improving the calculated storm surge. Its effect ranged within 9-13%. Such significance can be explained by the fact that the waves entering the computational domain were not very high, around 4 m in height with approximately 9 sec period (for comparison, during Isabel waves were as high as 15 m with 14 sec wave period). With strong wind blowing onshore, the small, short period waves were not fully developed, in other words, they were still young and energetic. Young seas increase sea surface roughness and, as a result, surface stress also increases. Wave-enhanced bottom stress based on the Sheng and Villaret (1989) formulation (Simulation 4 b ) decreased the peak surge values by 2-4% near Estero Bay and by 8% at Ft Myers station where the more significant effect can be explained by the remoteness of the station and shallow depths in the area, 2 to 4 m. When the wetting-and-drying feature was inactive, the water level grew significantly by 13-42%. This significant increase can be explained by the fact that most of the calculated flooding would have occurred in the vicinity of Estero Bay, so when the flooding feature was inactive, the water could not propagate inland thus piling up near the shore and significantly overestimating the calculated storm surge.\nAs was discussed in section 5.1.7, error analysis is a good way of comparing calculated water elevation to measured water level. In that section it was also pointed out that an error between measured and calculated water elevation can be attributed to either tide or storm surge or their combination. An estimation of the contribution of tide to the total error was done by performing a \"pure\" tide simulation and comparing its results with tidal elevation which was filtered out from measured water elevation using Doodson and Warburg (1941) 39-hourly average tidal filter. In order to weigh the effect of each component involved in the non-linear interaction between the surge, tide, wind, and wave, several simulations were made by including different component combinations. Turning the wetting-and-drying feature on and off was an option as well. Table 5-16 specifies which simulation had what features. The \"timing\" errors are acceptable (based on Simulation 4 b using WNA wind, 45 to 73 min) for all three stations. More accurate WNA wind produced smaller \"timing\" errors compared with less accurate WINDGEN wind. Table 5-18 shows the peak water elevation values calculated during these simulations along with the measured values. By normalizing the difference between consecutive simulations by the peak measured water level, the percent error of the effect of each component included in the non-linear interaction was calculated at the time when the peak water elevation was observed (e.g., at St Pete, the Simulation 2 value \u2191 1% relative to the Simulation 1 value, and the Simulation 4 a and 4 b values \u2193 13% and \u2193 6% relative to the Simulation 3 value, respectively). Including radiation stress terms increased the calculated water level by 1-2%. It was somewhat surprising to see such a weak wave effect, especially at Clearwater Beach which openly faces the approaching waves. For example, the analogous effect during Isabel was 3-18%. This might be reasoned by the fact that the maximum wave height of 1.4 m occurred on Sep-5 at 23:00 UTC while the maximum water elevation value was observed on Sep-6 at 13:00 UTC. Similarly, the maximum calculated wave height at St Pete and Port Manatee was 0.65 m and 0.55 m, respectively, and occurred around Sep-5, 18:00 UTC while the calculated water elevation reached its peak 18 hours later. The wave fields were calculated using the SWAN model. The boundary conditions were obtained from the regional wave model, WAVEWATCH-III. Since there was no wave station in the vicinity of the computational domain, the accuracy of the computed waves could not be verified. Adding wave enhanced surface stress helped further increase the computed water elevation by 2-7%. Accounting for wave enhanced bottom friction decreased the calculated water elevation by 0-13% and 0-6% for Simulations 4 a and 4 b , respectively. When wetting-and-drying scheme was not engaged during the calculation, the peak water level value grew an extra 5-7%. Unlike Hurricanes Isabel and Frances when the maximum surge and maximum water elevation were observed at approximately the same time, during Frances, the surge reached its maximum approximately 4 hours after the water elevation maximum occurred. Therefore, wave, wind, and flood conditions were slightly different from the conditions reflected in Table 5-18. Wave setup, again, had an insignificant effect on storm surge at it peak, 0-4%. Wave enhanced surface stress improved the calculated surge increasing it by 6-13%. Wave enhanced bottom stress effect (both formulations) was very insignificant decreasing the surge by 1%. Turning off the wetting-and-drying feature increased the surge by only 1-3%, which can be explained by the fact that most of the flooding occurred a few hours earlier during the high tide when the wetting-and-drying effect appeared to be more significant, 5-7%."}, {"section_title": "Results: Simulated Flood Level", "text": "A robust wetting-and-drying scheme incorporated in the modeling system allows to estimate inundation caused by hurricanes. Figures 5-32 through 5-37 show the highest simulated inundation caused by Hurricane Isabel during its passage over the Outer Banks and Chesapeake Bay using WNA wind. The plots also identify the time when the highest flood level occurred. Similarly, Figures 5-35 through 5-37 show the maximum simulated inundation using WINDGEN wind. Simulation 3 (see Table 5-7) using WNA wind produced the best comparison between measured and simulated water elevations at all the water elevation data stations throughout the computational domain. Therefore, this simulation was       There was no direct inundation data available against which to compare our flood maps. The only data that could be found to compare the calculated inundated areas are air photos taken before and after Isabel passed over the domain. Figures 5-38 and 5-39 show pre-storm and post-storm air photos taken at two locations, in the southern and eastern Outer Banks, respectively (see Figure 5-2 for location information). By examining the pre-storm and post-storm photos, it can be seen that these areas were subject to extensive inundation during Isabel. The bottom panels in the figures demonstrate close-ups of our computed inundation maps which also display the presence of water over the land. This validation cannot be considered complete and is rather qualitative because the actual measured flood level is unknown but, despite that, it shows a good potential of the storm surge modeling system for predicting inundation.   It is of interest to compare measured currents to those calculated by our storm surge modeling system in general and the CH3D model in particular, primarily to examine how robust the current-wave coupling algorithms in CH3D are. The coupling accounts for wave setup through either depth uniform (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart, 1964) or vertically varying (Mellor, 2003) radiation stresses, waveenhanced surface stress and wave-induced bottom friction. The currents were classified as the \"South to North\" current and \"West to East\" current. The latter can be looked at as the along-channel current at Gloucester Point and as the cross-shore current near Kitty Hawk (although not exactly due to the shoreline orientation in that area) and the former can be considered, again to some degree, as the longshore current near Kitty Hawk. Eight vertical layers were used in the CH3D model to simulate currents during Isabel. Comparison between measured and calculated \"South to North\" and \"West to East\" currents at Kitty Hawk is shown in Figures 5-42 and 5-43. The Gloucester Point comparison is shown in Figures 5-44 and 5-45. Simulated currents at Kitty Hawk agree well with measured data, although at the peak of the storm the \"West to East\" simulated current is overestimated. Simulated currents at Gloucester Point are in worse agreement with measured  data, especially in the West-East direction. This is partially due to the close proximity of the current meter to the shoreline. Near the shoreline, flow simulated by the model closely follows the shoreline orientation. In order to effectively account for horizontal diffusion, there has to be enough grid cells between the instrument location and the shoreline. Refining the grid in the area helped increase the accuracy of simulated currents but it was not enough to achieve as accurate agreement with measured data as it was achieved at Kitty Hawk.    above Hurricane Hugo's $7 billion ($9.4 billion in 2000 dollars) in 1989.\nThe wetting-and-drying scheme incorporated in   A more quantitative flood analysis was done based on some evidences obtained from \"Hurricane Charley Post-Storm Conditions and Impact\" report (Clark and LaGrone, 2004). In this report, four locations were examined on presence of high water marks left by the flood caused by Hurricane Charley. The locations are: Gasparilla Island, North Captiva Island, Captiva Island, and Estero Island (see        \nThe wetting-and-drying scheme incorporated in the modeling system allowed the estimation of inundation in the Tampa Bay area.  Storms can only worsen this situation. According to Morton and Sallenger (2003), extreme storms that strike coastal regions cause morphological response. Post storm erosional responses include dune scarps, channel incision, and washouts, whereas depositional responses include perched fans, washover terraces, and sheetwash lineations. Washover penetration inland can be on the order of a few hundred meters depending on storm intensity, storm duration, tide, wave action, and variations in nearshore bathymetry. The current integrated storm surge modeling system can be further enhanced through its coupling with a robust erosion model (e.g. SBEACH) to predict the post storm morphological responses."}, {"section_title": "Computational Domain", "text": "The computational grid used to simulate Hurricane Charley (see was used for topographic interpolation over the land.

Since the CH3D model is capable of using curvilinear grids, the computational mesh was created so it precisely fitted the shoreline and resolved small scale topographic features such as inlets and islands.

Both, wind speed and direction were measured at two stations: one station at Ft Myers and another one located at Naples. The Naples station is located approximately 10 km south of our model domain's southern open boundary. Such proximity allowed us to make use of the wind data for comparison with WNA and WINDGEN wind. Figures 5-48 through 5-51 demonstrate a comparison analysis between measured wind speed and direction at the two wind stations vs. those obtained using WNA and WINDGEN wind data. The Ft Myers station was inoperative for 2.5 hours during the time when Charley was passing over the area. The wind direction measured at Ft Myers was almost constant all the time which was a little strange. The same trend was observed after analyzing the data over a 3-month period prior to Charley. Since wind direction measured at Naples was in good agreement with WNA and WINDGEN wind direction, wind direction data at Ft Myers were considered erroneous and were not used. The WINDGEN wind at the two stations was stronger than the WNA wind, though it was hard to judge which one of the two was better because the station at Ft Myers broke down before the wind reached its maximum and the Naples station was a little too far from the center of the hurricane.    As can be seen in the figures, simulated water elevation using WNA wind was significantly underestimated at all four locations. In contrast to these results, simulated water elevation using WINDGEN wind looked much better, matching the surge peak very well at Big Carlos Pass, slightly overestimating the surge peak at both locations in Estero Bay, and underestimating the peak surge value at Ft Myers. Such discrepancy in the simulated water elevations using the two winds is a result of large difference between WNA and WINDGEN wind fields during the    Two simulated results are shown: one using WNA wind and another using WIND-GEN wind. time when the strongest winds were experienced in the area. In order to investigate this problem, wind snapshots in the Estero Bay area were taken at three instants shown in Figure 5-56: (1) before the storm peak (Aug-13 16:50 UTC, Julian Day=226.701), (2) right at the peak (Aug-13 20:40 UTC, Julian Day=226.862), and (3) after the storm peak (Aug-14 01:20 UTC, Julian Day=227.055).

Dashed lines specify the three time instants when wind snapshots were taken. direction along with total water depth contours in the Estero Bay area, the most significant difference between WNA and WINDGEN wind fields can be found in snapshot 2, which was taken at the peak of the storm surge in Estero Bay. There is an evident discrepancy in wind direction which is responsible for the significant difference in water elevation.  compares with measured water elevation much better than that calculated using WNA wind. Figure 5-63 shows a comparison between WNA and WINDGEN wind direction vs. actual wind direction measured at Naples, FL which is approximately 30 km south of Estero Bay. As can be seen from the figure, at the time of high surge (when snapshot 2 was taken), WINDGEN wind direction compares very well with the measured wind direction and the WNA wind direction is off by approximately 30 degrees. This leads to the conclusion that WINDGEN wind field is more reliable when it mattered most (i.e. when the storm was at its peak) and the significant underestimation of storm surge calculated using WNA wind is due to the incorrect wind information provided to the modeling system by the WNA wind. This should not be a surprise because WNA wind is not known to resolve the hurricane wind field accurately. Maximum water elevation relative to NAVD88 Charley was a fast moving hurricane whereas Frances was moving very slowly. Figure 5-65: Simulated storm surge (water level minus tide) at the four stations using WINDGEN wind.\nThree NOAA tide stations in the area were able to record water elevation during the passage of Hurricane Frances across Florida. These stations are: Clearwater Beach which is located outside Tampa Bay on the Gulf coast in 3.5 m depth, in the northern part of the north of the computational domain; St Pete which is located inside Tampa Bay near St Petersburg in 7.3 m depth; and Port Manatee which is located across the bay from St Pete station in 0.7 m depth. All three stations show that during the period when the eye of Frances was crossing over the Florida peninsula, there was a slight set down of water level due to strong winds blowing offshore. Once the hurricane moved further along such that the wind started blowing onshore and into the bay, the water level started to increase. Since the hurricane moved across Florida slowly allowing strong winds blowing into the bay for 20 hours, the water level rose steadily gaining up to 165 cm (at St Pete station) from the point when the level reached its lowest value."}, {"section_title": "Rip Current Forecasting", "text": "One of the future applications of the integrated modeling system can be rip current risk index forecasting. The rip current predictive index currently used by the NWS employs risk factors for wave height, wind, wave period and previous rip currents. A team of researches from the University of Florida conducted a study in Volusia County and analyzed rip current rescue statistics over a six-month period and found that rip currents were most strongly linked with the wave direction. According to their conclusions, the greatest threat associated with rip currents occurs when waves approach at an angle near zero. Waves approaching in a 25degree band on either side of zero, although occurring only about 30% of the time during the study period, accounted for nearly 60% of all of the rip current rescues recorded during the study. Adding a wave direction factor to the predictive index resulted in more accurate rip current forecasts with fewer false alarms. Tide can be an important factor in estimating the risk of occurrence of rip currents. A low or outgoing tide can greatly increase the rip current risk. According to Engle et al. (2002), the frequency of rip current rescues increased markedly during (1) shorenormal wave incidence, (2) mid-low tidal stages, (3) deep water wave heights of 0.5 to 1.0 meters and (4) wave periods from 8 to 10 seconds. Our methodology which couples CH3D-SSMS with a wave model, SWAN, using high resolution curvilinear/boundary-fitted grids will be able to capture the angle at which waves approach the shore. Neither rectilinear nor finite element models are capable of doing that. Every shoreline segment (\u223c350 m) will contain the following information: wave angle with respect to shoreline orientation (e.g. zero angle means the wave rays are approaching perpendicular to the shore), wave height, wave period, and tidal stage (e.g. low, mean, high). Based on this information a predictive rip current risk index can be calculated and assigned to each shoreline segment. This will result in more accurate rip current forecasts with fewer false alarms."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 7 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The goal of this study was to develop a storm surge modeling system, CH3D-SSMS, which accounts for wave effects (e.g., wave setup, wave enhanced surface stress, wave enhanced bottom friction) and wetting and drying, and validate the model using water elevation, wind, and wave data collected during recent hurricane events (Hurricane Isabel (2003) in the Outer Banks, NC and Chesapeake Bay, VA; Hurricane Charley (2004) in Charlotte Harbor, FL;and Hurricane Frances (2004) in Tampa Bay, FL). The developed modeling system makes use of the wind data produced by WINDGEN and WNA atmospheric models to simulate storm surge. It dynamically couples local scale circulation (CH3D) and wave (SWAN) models. Open boundary conditions for the local models are provided by coupling the local models with regional scale circulation (ADCIRC) and wave (WAVEWATCH-III) models. CH3D's components such as pressure gradient terms, radiation stress terms, and wetting-and-drying scheme were validated by comparing model results with either laboratory data (wave setup) or analytical solutions (pressure gradient and wetting-and-drying scheme). In order to validate the modeling system, three boundary-fitted curvilinear grids were generated using high resolution GEODAS bathymetry and USGS NED topography data: in the Outer Banks and Chesapeake Bay area, in the Tampa Bay are, and the Charlotte Harbor area. A thorough analysis of the WNA and WINDGEN wind was performed for Hurricane Isabel. The analysis revealed that results from both atmospheric models compared well with measured wind speed and direction over the Outer Banks and near the Chesapeake Bay mouth, with the WNA wind being slightly better. However, inside Chesapeake Bay, the accuracy of both models significantly decreased. This is supposedly due to the effect of land surrounding the Chesapeake Bay and/or the coarse resolution of the atmospheric models (22-28 km). Similar but not as comprehensive, due to the lack of available wind data, analysis was performed for Hurricanes Charley and Frances. The WINDGEN wind of Charley was stronger in magnitude and more accurate than WNA. Using the WINDGEN wind, the CH3D model produced more accurate water elevation during the storm. For Hurricane Frances, the WINDGEN wind was much weaker and less accurate than WNA. Using the WINDGEN wind, the simulated water surface elevation was underestimated. Wave parameters calculated by the regional WAVEWATCH-III wave model, which were used as boundary conditions in the local wave model, SWAN, were validated by comparing the calculated wave height and wave period with the wave height and wave period measured from NDBC moored buoys during Hurricane Isabel. The SWAN model, which provided the wave information (wave height, period, direction) to the local circulation model, CH3D, was also verified using wave time series measured at FRF and VIMS facilities during Isabel. The effect of linear and non-linear interactions between storm surge, tide, wind and wave was investigated in this study. For each hurricane, a series of simulations was conducted by considering various combinations of the linear and non-linear storm surge interactions: (1) wind and tide, (2) wind, tide, and wave setup, (3) wind, tide, wave setup, and wave enhanced surface stress, (4) wind, tide, wave setup, wave enhanced surface stress, and wave enhanced bottom stress. When Isabel, Charley, and Frances were simulated using tide and wind only, the calculated peak water elevation was always underestimated. The inclusion of wave setup improved the computed storm surge by up to 18% during Isabel. The most significant improvement was observed at Beaufort and Duck where high breaking waves caused a significant water level setup. For other hurricanes, Charley and Frances, the wave setup effect was positive but not very significant, up to 5% and 4%, respectively. Accounting for wave enhanced surface stress had a significant positive effect during all three hurricanes. The inclusion of this feature increased the calculated storm surge by 5-16% during Isabel, 9-13% during Charley, and 6-13% during Frances. Accounting for wave induced bottom friction had: (1) moderate effect, up to 5% reduction of the storm surge level at the peak, when the Sheng and Villaret (1989) formulation was used and (2) significant effect, up 16% reduction of the storm surge level at the peak, due to overestimated bottom friction when the Grant and Madsen (1979) formulation was used. The effect of dynamic coupling versus linearly superimposed results of independently simulated tide, wave setup, and surge is twofold: over open water, dynamic coupling produces slightly more accurate storm surge, and over land, the inundation calculated through dynamic coupling occurs earlier and is much more significant, however, due to the lack of data, this was not verified. The effect of excluding the wetting-and-drying feature during storm surge simulations was also examined. This effect mostly depends on the extent of inundation. For instance, during Charley, there was significant flooding calculated in the vicinity of Estero Bay. When wetting-and-drying was disabled, water elevation increased by 18-22% in the area, thereby significantly overestimating the calculated water level at the peak of the storm. On the other hand, the calculated inundation during Frances was not very extensive resulting in only 5-7% increase in water elevation when the wetting and drying feature of the CH3D model was inactivated. An interesting phenomenon was observed during the simulation of Hurricane Frances. The maximum storm surge occurred approximately 4 hours after the peak water level was observed in the Tampa Bay area. This was a result of slowly (5-10 mph) moving Frances which caused the surge to last up to 30 hours. The highest water level occurred during high tide and when the tide was already receding, the maximum surge came in. The calculated storm surge during Frances ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 m but if the peak of the storm were to coincide with high tide the surge level would have been 0.6 to 0.7 m higher. Bay. Even though Charley was the strongest among the three, it was the smallest thereby affecting less territory compared with Isabel whose impact in terms of inundation was more significant.
