[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Recent advances in global biogeochemical research demonstrate a critical need for long-term ocean color satellite data records of consistent high quality. To achieve that quality, spaceborne instruments require on-orbit vicarious calibration, where the integrated instrument and atmospheric correction system is adjusted using in situ normalized water-leaving radiances, such as those collected by the marine optical buoy (MOBY).

Ocean color satellites provide the scientific community a means of studying the biosphere on temporal and spatial scales unattainable using conventional in situ sampling platforms, such as research vessels, drifters, or permanent moorings. The NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) has been producing a continuous, global marine bio-optical data set since late 1997. SeaWiFS measures the spectra of reflected sunlight emanating upward from the top of the Earth's atmosphere at six visible and two nearinfrared wavebands. Spectral water-leaving radiances, L w \u0351\u0352, the light backscattered out of the ocean, are obtained by removing the contribution of the atmosphere from the total signal [1] . The L w \u0351\u0352 are subsequently used to estimate a number of geophysical data parameters through the application of secondary bio-optical algorithms [2] . The community relies heavily on SeaWiFS data products, the concentration of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll a \u0351C a \u0352, in particular, to support studies ranging from management of regional ecosystems to the development of decadal climate records [3] .\nBailey and Werdell [4] recently demonstrated that SeaWiFS L w \u0351\u0352 approach their assigned prelaunch goal of 5% absolute accuracy. This radiometric quality results, in part, from the mission-long on-orbit vicarious calibration [5] [6] [7] executed by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) to refine the integrated instrument-atmospheric correction system. After temporal changes in sensor responsitivity are characterized using lunar and solar diffuser ob-servations [8] , SeaWiFS visible radiances are adjusted to force agreement with the normalized waterleaving radiances, L wn \u0351\u0352, from the marine optical buoy [9] (MOBY), deployed 15 km west of Lanai, Hawaii. The terms from the vicarious calibration are given as fractional gain factors g \u0351\u0352, with values of unity indicating no correction. During data processing, these gain factors are applied at the top-ofthe-atmosphere, effectively updating the prelaunch sensor calibration, and thereby accounting for undetermined postlaunch changes to the instrument (resulting from, for example, orbit-raising maneuvers).\nNASA has acquired well-calibrated, hyperspectral data from MOBY near-continuously since mid-1997 (a preoperational deployment of MOBY occurred from November 1996 to February 1997). Unfortunately, similar time series of in situ radiometric data do not exist during the eras of the SeaWiFS predecessors, in particular, the NASA coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA; now known as the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) ocean color and temperature scanner (OCTS). Ocean surface reflectance models (ORMs) developed for the visible part of the spectrum have been shown to reproduce accurately the radiance spectra observed in the field, at least for deep marine waters [10, 11] . These models generally permit the estimation of plausible, average L wn \u0351\u0352 using a single input parameter, C a , which is used as a proxy for the bulk bio-optical properties of oceanic Case-1 [12] waters. Given that long-term and seasonal time series of in situ C a exist [13] , we propose that continuous, regional time series of C a in combination with an ORM provide a viable data source for the vicarious calibration of ocean color satellites in the absence of abundant in situ radiometry. Such a concept is not novel per se, as Evans and Gordon [14] successfully used fixed, theoretical clear-water radiances to calibrate the CZCS bands at 520 and 550 nm.\nHere, we relax the constraint of fixed radiances and evaluate the utility of an ORM allowed to vary temporally with C a for the visible-band vicarious calibration of SeaWiFS. Our multistep approach begins with a description of the C a -driven ORM developed by Morel and Maritorena [11] (MM01) for Case-1 waters. We then acquire and evaluate regional C a time series from the well-established U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time series Study (BATS) and Hawaiian Ocean Time series (HOT) hydrostations. These C a are used in combination with the ORM to build a regional time series of modeled L wn \u0351\u0352 for the Sargasso Sea and North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). The radiances are used in turn to derive independent g \u0351\u0352 for SeaWiFS, which are subsequently compared to the operational vicarious gains derived from MOBY radiometry. Finally, we quantify the downstream effect of using the model-based vicarious gains by incorporating them into the OBPG satellite-to-in situ data product validation system for comparison with the operational SeaWiFS results [4] . After vetting the approach with SeaWiFS, we apply the methods to the historical CZCS and OCTS ocean color time series, with the intent of developing an updated baseline technique for their retrospective visible-band calibration."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Approach", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Model Development", "text": "Spectral subsurface irradiance reflectance (the ratio of upward to downward irradiance), R\u03510 \u03ea \u0352 has been related to the ratio X \u03ed b b \u035e\u0351a \u03e9 b b \u0352 through a polynomial [15] expression, where a and b b are the total absorption and backscattering coefficients, respectively. In this expansion, the first term is predominant such that the polynomial can be reduced to:\nprovided that appropriate values of the dimensionless term f\u0408 have been produced. This term varies with the composition of the water body, the illumination (Sun \u03e9 sky) conditions, and the sea state. Spectral dependencies are omitted for brevity unless required for clarity. Using Eq.\n(1), we estimate L wn via:\nwhere F 0 is the mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance, Q is the ratio of the upwelling irradiance to the upwelling radiance at nadir (equal to for a totally diffuse radiance distribution), and \u146c describes the combined reflection and refraction effects that occur as downward irradiance and upward radiance propagate through the air-sea interface [10, 16, 17] . For simplicity, we adopt a constant value of \u146c \u03ed 0.529, which is valid when the solar zenith angle and wind speed are not too large [17] . The remaining unknowns in Eqs. (1) and (2) include only a, b b , f\u0408, and Q. Conveniently, Morel et al. [16] describe both f\u0408 and Q spectrally as a function of C a and solar zenith angle 0 , using a series of lookup tables (LUT; available at http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/\u03f3morel). We refer the reader to Morel and Mueller [18] for a detailed review of f\u0408 and Q and their role in the remote sensing paradigm. The estimation of both a and b b from C a , however, warrants additional description, as these relationships are likely candidates for update in subsequent analyses.\nIn seawater, the backscattering coefficient can be partitioned into its water and particulate components using b b \u03ed b bw \u03e9 b bp , where the subscripts w and p indicate water and particles, respectively, and the former is considered known. The particulate backscattering spectrum is described by b bp \u03ed b bp \u03eb b p , where b bp is the particulate backscattering ratio (the ratio of backscattering to total scattering) and b p is the particulate scattering spectrum. In situ measurements of b p have been empirically related [19] to C a using\nMM01 most recently described this relationship using 0.416 and 0.766 for B and E, respectively. The validity of Eq. (3) for BATS and HOT will be reviewed in Subsection 2.B. The spectral dependency of light scattering is primarily a function of the particle size distribution, which is reviewed in detail elsewhere [20] and often described via v . MM01 adopted a C a -controlled spectral variation that maintains a \u03ea1 dependency at C a \u03fd 0.02 mg m"}, {"section_title": "\u03ea3", "text": ", where small detrital particles are optically dominant, and serially diminishes to 0 at C a \u0546 2 mg m \u03ea3 [their Eq. (14)]. With the b bp introduced in Eq. (13) of MM01, the spectral particulate backscattering coefficient is fully expressed as\nwhere is wavelength, 550 nm is a nominal scaling wavelength from Eq. (3), and the expression in braces describes b bp . In Eq. (4), the constant background term (set to 0.002) and decimal logarithm of C a (in brackets) describe a maximal backscattering efficiency of 1.2% at 550 nm when C a \u03ed 0.01 mg m\n. If we temporarily adopt bounding C a values of 0.05 and 0.25 mg m \u03ea3 for our study sites of BATS and HOT ( Figs. 1 and 2 ), Eq. (4) produces b bp \u0351550\u0352 of 0.0103 and 0.0085, respectively, which is consistent with recent in situ observations collected in different environments [21] [22] [23] .\nConsidering the same bounding C a values, we estimate v of \u03ea0.8 and \u03ea0.45, respectively, using Eq. (13) of MM01. By design, these are typical of assemblages of larger phytoplankton [24] \u0351\u03fe2 m\u0352, but not of smaller particles \u03510.2-0.5 m\u0352, such as viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotic algal cells, which have values closer to \u03ea2 and are now thought to make the dominant contribution to b bp in oligotrophic waters [25] . Bacterial assemblages have been shown to dominate the waters around both BATS and HOT [26, 27] . As such, we replace the MM01 v with the parameterization of Ciotti et al. [28] (their Eq. (24)):\nwhich assumes that the scattering spectral dependency follows \u03ea2 when C a \u03f3 0.05 mg m \u03ea3 and 0 when C a \u03f3 20 mg m\n. Using Eq. (5), the same bounding C a produce v values of \u03ea2 and \u03ea1.46. For comparison, Loisel et al. [29] inverted SeaWiFS radiometry to derive mean annual v values of \u03f3\u03ea1.5 and \u03f3\u03ea2 for the BATS and HOT regions, respectively (see their Fig. 3) , and a mean annual average of \u03ea1.37 \u0351\u03ee0.42 standard deviation). The net effect of replacing the MM01 v with Eq. (5) is a radiometric brightening that increases with decreasing wavelength, which will be supported by in situ observations we describe in Subsection 2.B.\nSignificant uncertainty resides in both the empirical and analytical components of Eqs. (3)-(5), but global data sets for independent verification are uncommon. Alternative formulations exist [21] [22] [23] , yet debates over the backscattering properties of oceanic particles and field instrumentation persist [20] . In Case-1 waters, the temporally and spatially varying relative concentrations of algae and other particulates, or variations within the plankton assemblages, almost certainly modify the C a -to-b b relationship [24] , particularly with varying particle size distributions [25] . Without a priori knowledge of such dynamics, however, the use of Eqs. (3)-(5) provides a moderately accurate and convenient expression of b b for the C a -driven ORM.\nThe absorption coefficient of seawater is also commonly partitioned into components using a \u03ed a w \u03e9 a \u03e9 a n \u03e9 a g , where the subscripts w, , n, and g indicate water, phytoplankton, nonphytoplankton particles, and dissolved organics, respectively, and a w is considered known. While the relationship between C a and a has been extensively studied [30] , as has that between C a and total particulate absorption Fig. 1 . Near-surface C a measurements from the BATS site for years 1998 -2004 (symbols) and a smoothed fit to these data (solid line). To generate this fit, we first organized the C a by day of year and then sorted them into biweekly bins (resulting in 26 sequential 14-day collections). We then calculated the mean of the semiinterquartile range for each bin, and smoothed this mean timeseries by recalculating the three-element central moving-average for each bin. Several undersampled bins whose means proved to be outliers precipitated the latter time-series filter. Finally, we redisplayed the means temporally using the central day number for each bin, and used cubic spline interpolation to estimate C a for every day of the year (roots of residual mean squares of 0.066 and 0.010 for BATS and HOT, respectively). Data are displayed as a function of day of year (a) and a multiannual time-series (b). Using the generalized fit, C a may be estimated from the day of year. The sample sizes are 45, 41, 43, 54, 64, 58 , and 9 for 1998 through 2004, respectively.\n\u0351\u03ed a \u03e9 a n \u0352 in Case-1 conditions [31] , the global correlation between C a and a g is weak [32] . A C a -based relationship for a g \u0351440\u0352, using a \u0351440\u0352, has been proposed [33] , but remains unverified. Further, the determination of a g \u0351\u0352 requires independent knowledge of its spectral slope [34] , a parameter that varies significantly [35] and does not appear to be related to C a .\nIn contrast, the spectral diffuse downwelling attenuation coefficient K d encompasses the effects of all absorbing material in the water column, including that of dissolved organics, and is used routinely in lieu of a in ORM applications [10, 11] . MM01 revisited the correlation between C a and the biological component of K d :\nwhere spectral and e are provided in MM01 Table 2 and K w is the term for pure water. The validity of Eq. (6) for BATS and HOT will be reviewed in Subsection 2.B. Using numerical simulations, Gordon [36] related K d to the absorption and backscattering coeffi-\nwhere d is the average cosine of the downward flux below the surface. As for f\u0408 and Q, Morel and Gentili [37] describe d spectrally as a function of C a and 0 using a LUT. When solved for a using Eq. (1), the relationship becomes\nNote that as R\u03510 \u03ea \u0352 is a small number, K d remains the principal property in Eq. (7) .\nThe goal of the present approach is to produce R\u03510 \u03ea \u0352 as a function of C a using estimates of b b and a (using Eqs. (4) A final radiometric normalization is required to accurately compare L wn collected under varied geometric conditions, as is our need in the vicarious calibration process [18] . An anisotropic light field influences L wn retrieved under different viewing and solar geometries, as affected by local illumination conditions and resident concentrations of in-water constituents (and their scattering properties). In practice, we \"exactly\" normalize L wn to the case of sensor and solar zenith angles \u03ed 0\u00b0using a geometry-and C a -based LUT (similar to those described previously), where C a acts as a proxy for all of the bio-optical components [16] . For simplicity, in our initial derivation of L wn , we use a constant solar zenith angle of 30\u00b0. This is consistent with applications and discussions presented in MM01 and Morel and Gentili [37] , and with the experimental conditions under which the data used to derive the above empirical relationships were collected (predominantly 15\u00b0\u0545 0 \u0545 45\u00b0). Our final step is the calculation of \"exact\" L wn (from 0 \u03ed 30\u00b0to 0 \u03ed 0\u00b0). The ultimate radiometric product is spectral L wn derived using only C a as input.\n). It is worth recalling that the magnitude and shape of this bias would increase were the MM01 v not replaced by Eq. (5). Modeled values \u03fe600 nm are higher than observed in situ for all cases.\nThe predominant source of this bias is not immediately apparent, even when individual components of the ORM are regionally evaluated. This is mainly because of the paucity of relevant in situ data sets that would permit empirical analyses of certain model components, for example, f\u0408. Those measurements that are currently available, however, merit some discussion. With regard to Q, using data from nine stations in the Gulf of California, Voss and Morel [42] found the adopted parameterization to replicate in situ measurements to within 7%. On average, the SCAPA data support this conclusion for the range 0.05 \u0545 C a \u0545 0.25 mg m\n, reporting differences of \u03ea3.8 \u03ee 15% and 6.4 \u03ee 16% for nadir Q\u0351443\u0352 and Q\u0351555\u0352, respectively, and no discernible variation over the dynamic range of C a . Despite this, a regional examination of SCAPA shows the model Q to differ significantly on a station-by-station basis (up to \u03ee20%, as partially indicated by the standard deviations reported above). Uncertainties in Q propagate into derived L wn directly through Eq. (1) and, to a lesser degree, through its \"exact\" normalization [16] . Note that modifying Q by the average SCAPA percent differences listed above shifts the derived spectra in a desirable direction, by raising L wn \u0351443\u0352 and lowering L wn \u0351555\u0352. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, Q is currently not collected at the BATS and HOT sites. Although not significant at BATS, the elevated K d at HOT certainly contributed to the reduced radiances output by the ORM. Unfortunately, the paucity of hyperspectral in situ radiometry and limited dynamic range prohibit robust regional reconstruction Fig. 3 . Validation of the ORM using in situ measurements collected at the BATS and HOT sites. In situ stations with a given C a level were identified (\u03ee an appropriate threshold value) and corresponding \"exact\" R rs were averaged (solid circles) for comparison with the ORM output for 0 \u03ed 15\u00b0(dotted line), 30\u00b0(solid line), and 45\u00b0(dashed line). In situ standard deviations are shown as vertical bars. Sample sizes in figure titles.\nof Eq. (6) at either site. Seemingly, this narrow radiometric dynamic range persists in most low C a waters (see, e.g., Fig. 9 of Werdell and Bailey [39] ), reinforcing the need for biogeographically rich data sets to derive statistical relationships such as Eq. (6).\nThe C a -to-b p relationship described in Eq. (3) was derived using beam attenuation data collected at 660 nm. This is effectively a measurement of particle scattering, as attenuation by dissolved material at that wavelength is negligible in marine environments. Once the contribution of pure seawater is removed from the total attenuation coefficient \u03510.364 m \u03ea1 \u0352, the remaining value is referred to as the particulate beam attenuation coefficient, c p \u0351660\u0352, which is approximately equal [19] to b p \u0351660\u0352. In Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) we compare coincident C a and c p \u0351660\u0352 measurements with the Eq. (6) of Loisel and Morel [19] , which was adopted by MM01 to derive Eq. (3) via a \u03ea1 scattering spectral dependency to migrate the scaling wavelength from 660 to 550 nm. While significant scatter exists for both the BATS and HOT sites, the overall magnitude of the modeled c p \u0351660\u0352 appears to be in line with the in situ observations (i.e., no reported biases). Note, however, that for both sites, c p \u0351660\u0352 varies little with C a , in agreement with that reported for these sites by Behrenfeld and Boss [43] . With a few exceptions, time-series of c p \u0351660\u0352 (not shown) display little annual variation as well, at least for these limited data sets. While the dynamic range in C a -to-c p \u0351660\u0352 at BATS would permit a regional rederivation of Eq. (3) (unlike for HOT), sensitivity analyses suggest that little improvement in the ORM would be realized at this time.\n. A reduction in C a shifts the radiometric spectra in a desirable direction, as reported in Subsection 2.B, by raising L wn \u0351443\u0352 and lowering L wn \u0351555\u0352.\nFinally, we evaluated the combined ability of the model and C a climatologies to reproduce seasonal In parentheses, with the exception of N, where we report the number of samples remaining after application of the semi-interquartile filter. Only these remaining samples are used to calculate the combined BATS \u03e9 HOT \u1e21 _bar. \nA. The R rs were organized by day of year and compared with the modeled R rs calculated using the appropriate C a climatology (Fig. 6 ). In particular, we highlight R rs \u0351443\u0352 because of its predominance in C a absorption spectra. Overall, the ORM-C a climatology combination accurately reproduces the seasonal trends at both sites (residual mean squares of 0.058 and 0.0069 at 443 nm for BATS and HOT, respectively). At BATS, the low radiances in the winter (corresponding to the annual C a bloom) and high radiances in the summer are both well represented in the modeled R rs \u0351443\u0352. The tendency of the model to be subtly low relative to the in situ data, however, reappears in this analysis (biases of \u03ea0.093 and \u03ea0.110 at 443 nm for BATS and HOT, respectively). As for the previous analysis, the biases are spectrally dependent and diminish with increasing wavelength.\n. We further validate the SeaWiFS data products through the generation of mission-long time-series of L wn and C a , following the methods outlined in Franz et al. [56] (reviewed in the caption of Fig. 11 ). Following the rationale previously described, we initially consider only deep-water pixels. In the interest of further evaluating temporal trends for distinct bioregimes, we also stratify the data into three trophic levels by adopting C a values of 0.1 and 1 mg m \u03ea3 as the approximate limits between oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters and between mesotrophic and eutrophic waters [57] . To facilitate the use of common geographic areas for both the MOBY and modelbased processing, we use a mission long SeaWiFS C a composite to define a priori the spatial boundaries of each trophic regime.\nThe radiometric validation statistics are bolstered by these time series comparisons ( Fig. 11 and Table  7 ). As expected, the time series generated using the MOBY and model-based g produce identical seasonal trends and the differences in L wn magnitudes are in the same direction as the differences in g . We see, for The median satellite-to-in situ ratio (with standard deviation).\n). Consider next the typical R rs ratios of 5.2, 1.8, and 1.05 as representative of our three defined trophic levels, which relate to C a values of approximately 0.10, 0.5, and 2.0 mg m\n. The reduction of these ratios by 11% leads to increases in C a of 38%, 25%, and 17%, respectively. If we maintain the magnitude of the difference in g \u0351555\u0352, but change its sign (representing a negative bias in lieu of a positive bias), the related changes in the R rs ratios would be approximately \u03ea3%, which ultimately translates to increases in C a of only 10%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, for the three trophic levels. Thus, we suggest that in the context of future calibration modeling efforts whose ultimate goal is the derivation of a C a timeseries that the L wn spectral shape be potentially considered more significant in the derivation of the ORM than its overall magnitude.\n. With the exception of two outliers, the OCTS C a matchups all also closely agree. The paucity of radiometric data for both CZCS and OCTS prohibits the robust correlation of radiometric error into the C a matchups (as was attempted in Section 5). The OBPG operational CZCS C a algorithm mimics the construction of that for SeaWiFS [2] . Following the logic we presented earlier, one might interpret the satellite-to-in situ C a ratio of 1.3 to indicate either R rs \u0351443\u0352 to be low or R rs \u0351550\u0352 to be high, neither of which appears to be the case in Fig. 14 . Overall, however, given the combined uncertainties associated with the C a climatologies, the ORM, the historical in situ data sets, and CZCS and OCTS systems themselves (their characterization and atmospheric correction approach), we conclude these satelliteto-in situ validation results to be rather encouraging. Despite this, a multitude of other calibration and data processing concerns [61] currently inhibit either sensor's viability as a resource for long-term climate research."}, {"section_title": "B. Model Validation", "text": "Before proceeding, we verified the ability of the ORM to replicate observed radiances through a comparison of modeled remote-sensing reflectance R rs (the ratio of water-leaving radiance to surface irradiance; alternatively calculated using L wn \u035eF 0 ), with in situ measurements collected at the BATS and HOT sites. We also evaluated the C a -based expressions for K d , b p , and Q used within the ORM. Observations of C a and spectral radiometry at both sites were acquired from the NASA SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) [38] . Spectral R rs and K d were derived from the radiometric profiles following Werdell and Bailey [39] . Beam attenuation measurements at 660 nm at both sites were acquired from the Texas A&M University transmissometer database [40] . Average surface values were calculated for each transmissometer profile (using all data collected \u03fd10 m; maximum standard deviations of 0.06 and 0.02 m \u03ea1 for BATS and HOT, respectively). Globally distributed measurements of Q (from profiles of upwelling irradiance and upwelling nadir radiance) were acquired from the NASA Self Consistent AOP Profile Archive (SCAPA) [41] . Here, spectral Q were calculated as the average ratio of upwelling irradiance to the upwelling radiance collected just below the sea surface. All data were paired with a coincident C a value, when available.\nTo review the spectral shape of the modeled radiometry, we first stratified the in situ data into limited ranges of C a centered on 0.05 and 0.25 mg m \u03ea3 for BATS and 0.08 mg m \u03ea3 for HOT ( Figs. 1  and 2 ). In situ stations within \u03ee33% of each typical C a were identified, and coincident observations of R rs were averaged. This mean radiometry was compared with the modeled R rs calculated for each typical C a (Fig. 3) . Such an analysis permits the simultaneous verification of both the shape and magnitude of the modeled spectra without overemphasizing variability associated with the field observations themselves (as would be the case for scatter plots). The ORM visually reproduces the spectral shape of the field observations for all cases, but maintains a slight tendency to be spectrally flat relative to the in situ data (e.g., slightly high at 555 nm for BATS with C a \u03ed 0.25 mg m \u03ea3 and slightly low at 412 nm for HOT with C a \u03ed 0.08 mg m"}, {"section_title": "C a Climatology Development Validation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Site Selection", "text": "We next acquire and evaluate long-term C a timeseries to be used as input into the ORM. In 1988, the U.S. National Science Foundation established the US JGOFS BATS [44] and HOT [45] (Station ALOHA) stations to facilitate deep ocean physical and biogeochemical research. Each hydrostation is visited approximately monthly, resulting in wellstudied, decadal time-series of C a that capture the annual biogeophysical variability of the Sargasso Sea and NPSG. In 1992, routine measurement of in situ radiometry commenced in conjunction with the BATS observational program. Likewise, radiometric measurements were added to the standard HOT suite of observations in early 1998. Just after its launch in late 1997, SeaWiFS began collecting Local Area Coverage (LAC) data \u0351\u03f31 km 2 at nadir) over both hydrostations, which fortuitously precludes the use of the subsampled Global Area Coverage (GAC) data \u0351\u03f320 km 2 at nadir) in this calibration activity. We make several simplifying assumptions about both the BATS and HOT sites to ensure their viable use as ocean color satellite calibration sites. First, in accordance with the calibration guidelines posed by Gordon [5] , we assume that each area experiences (1) predominantly maritime aerosols with an optical thickness of approximately 0.1, and (2) spatially homogeneous L wn \u0351\u0352 on a scale of several kilometers. The former was recently verified by Smirnov et al. [46] , who report annual mean and mode aerosol optical thicknesses at 500 nm of 0.14 and 0.09 for Bermuda and 0.07 and 0.06 for Lanai, Hawaii. For the latter, although mesoscale eddies recur in the western Sargasso Sea [47] , their sizes \u0351100-150 km\u0352 significantly exceed that of the aggregated satellite observations \u03515-20 km\u0352 used in operational vicarious calibration [7] . The western Sargasso Sea remains otherwise relatively unperturbed on such small scales. Horizontal gradients are similarly weak within the NPSG [48] .\nSecond, based on their considerable distance from terrigeneous influences, we assume that the BATS and HOT sites largely maintain Case-1 conditions, which is a prerequisite for an ORM that accepts C a as its only input. The seasonal biogeochemical patterns at BATS and HOT have been analyzed [27, 49] . In the Sargasso Sea, seasonal variation of colored dissolved materials, which are not directly correlated with the algal standing stock, have also been described [50] . As the development of the ORM rests on the use of average empirical relationships, specifically Eqs. (3) and (6) , notable departures with respect to these averages will entail a partial failure in the predictive skill of the model. We acknowledge that such possible failures shape our conclusions."}, {"section_title": "B. Climatology Generation", "text": "We acquired 314 BATS and 147 HOT profiles of fluorometrically derived C a from SeaBASS dating from 1998 to 2004. Near surface values were estimated following Werdell and Bailey [39] . The OBPG archive of MOBY data consists of \u03f3225 days per year on average from 1998 to 2004. Given the relative small volume of BATS and HOT C a data acquired in this time range, and the meager rate of return of suitable stations (i.e., number of matchups) in the vicarious calibration activity [7] (Table 1) , we opted to generate a general climatological expression for these data to increase the sample size ( Figs. 1 and 2 ; see captions for processing details). The annual shapes of the expressions agree well with that reported in Michaels et al. [49] for BATS and Ondrusek et al. [51] for HOT.\nWe verified these curves using C a data from the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center World Ocean Database 2005 [13] (WOD05). From the ocean station data subset of WOD05, we acquired 1578 fluorometric profiles of C a collected near Bermuda dating from 1957 to 1998, and 367 profiles collected near Hawaii dating from 1982 to 1995. Regions were defined as 10\u00b0boxes centered on each hydrostation. The WOD05 C a data were treated as described above and annual expressions were generated for both sites (Fig. 5) . While minor discrepancies exist, the annual WOD05 expressions largely reproduce the curves generated using the SeaBASS data set.\nThe ocean color community largely considers high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to be the preferred method of retrieving C a , as fluorometrically derived values are affected by the presence of accessory pigments. Variations in phytoplankton community structure change the accessory pigment content, and thus fluorometric inaccuracies vary seasonally and geographically [52] . While HPLC provides an advantage in this regard, Hooker et al. [53] report an average uncertainty of 17% for the retrieval of total C a using HPLC. Ultimately, inaccuracies in C a stem from the use of fluorometry in lieu of HPLC, uncertainties associated with both methods, and poor representation of actual conditions by the climatology. As such, we examined the sensitivity of the ORM output L wn to its input C a . If we vary C a from a nominal value of 0.08 mg m \u03ea3 by \u03e910% and \u03ea10%, the modeled L wn \u0351443\u0352 changes by \u03ea3.6% and \u03e94.8%, respectively, and L wn \u0351555\u0352 changes by \u03e91.3% and \u03ea1.4%, respectively. Similar results are obtained for C a \u03ed 0.25 mg m"}, {"section_title": "SeaWiFS Vicarious Calibration", "text": "We refer the reader to Franz et al. [7] for a complete discussion of the OBPG vicarious calibration approach. Before proceeding, however, a few points merit review. First, note that all temporal trends in sensor responsivity are removed a priori [8] and that the NIR vicarious calibration is completed prior to initiating the visible band calibration [7] . The ORM does not play a role in the NIR calibrations, as L w is considered negligible in that process. Second, recall that we ultimately desire a single, temporally independent vicarious gain for each visible band to be applied during operational data processing. The evaluation of many calibration targets results in an accumulation of discrete gain factors g i (one gain for each target i), from which an average vicarious gain g is calculated.\nUsing the annual expressions for C a as input into the ORM, we calculated SeaWiFS-specific L wn for every day of 1998 through mid-2006 at both the BATS and HOT stations. These data were subsequently input into the OBPG visible band vicarious calibration system [7] to generate modeled SeaWiFS gain factors (Table 1) . To explore the utility of a multisite calibration approach, we generated gains separately for the BATS and HOT sites and then assimilated both series for a combined solution (the validity of which is addressed later in this section). At this point, we have ORM-based g for comparison with the MOBY-based g . Before proceeding with these comparisons, however, we review the accuracy and stability of our model-based g .\nTo verify the accuracy of the calibration, we first incorporate the model-derived g into the OBPG satellite data product validation system [4] and calculate radiometric \"matchup\" statistics for the satellite and in situ observations used to derive g ( Table 2 ). We acknowledge that this analysis does not validate the satellite retrievals, but the results provide some useful insight into the uncertainties associated with the gain determination. The average satellite-to-in situ mean ratios and biases approach unity and zero, respectively, as expected in a properly executed calibration, indicating that g accurately represents the central tendency of g i for the series of calibration scenes. The absolute median percent differences, MPD, however, are approximately twice those reported by Franz et al. [7] for the MOBY-based calibration. The C a climatologies represent the eight-year average seasonal cycle of each site. Day-to-day departures from these averages result in under-and overestimates of L wn , and therefore g i , which amplify our uncertainty in the derivation of g . As expected, this additional uncertainty becomes apparent when comparing the ORM average matchup MPD with that from an in situ source that does not suffer from the same discrepancies (such as MOBY, as in Franz et al. [7] ).\nWe next evaluate the temporal and geometric stability of the model-derived vicarious gains. The Fig. 7 . SeaWiFS ORM-derived g i \u0351443\u0352 as a function of time (a), solar zenith angle (b), and sensor zenith angle (c). The solid line indicates the final combined g \u0351443\u0352 for the ORM, and the dashed lines delineate the boundary of g \u03ee 2 (two standard deviations encompass \u03f395% of the data). Likewise, the shaded region demarks g \u03ee 2 for MOBY. Only g i falling within the series semiinterquartile range are shown (symbols), as we limit the final calculation of g to these data. [7, 8] , this suggests that our annual C a climatologies adequately represent both sites, which would otherwise add irregular seasonality. Similarly, g i from both BATS and HOT are consistent with (i.e., independent of) both solar and satellite zenith angles While not evident in these trends, variations with geometry are often symptomatic of problems with the atmospheric correction algorithm or the calculation of \"exact\" L wn [16] within the vicarious calibration procedure.\nFor the BATS site, the MOBY-and model-derived g agree to within approximately \u03ee0.5%, with the exception of 443 and 490 nm, whose absolute differences slightly exceed 1%. The g from the HOT site agree to within a similar range, with the exception of 412 nm (Fig. 9 and Table 3 ). Seemingly, these differences are minor, but as the atmosphere contributes a major portion of the radiance measured at the sensor \u0351\u03f390%\u0352, changes of this magnitude are in fact considerable \u0351\u03f35%\u0352 with respect to derived L wn [54] , as will be explored further in Section 5. Only the HOT g \u0351510\u0352 and BATS and HOT g \u0351670\u0352 are statistically equal to MOBY using a parametric Student's t analysis \u0351\u2423 \u03ed 0.05\u0352, but note that all sites have absolute differences on the order of the uncertainty of their derivation (i.e., standard deviation). Note also how the spectral shape of the difference (negative for the blue bands and positive for 555 nm) mirrors that of the field data comparisons we previously described.\nConsider the following to put the magnitude of these differences in context: a reprocessing of the MOBY time series to correct for instrument stray light effects [55] resulted in changes in SeaWiFS g of \u03f31% on average (incorporated as part of SeaWiFS Reprocessing 4, July 2002). Furthermore, Franz et al. [7] illustrate absolute gain changes of 0.5% with increases in the sample size of g i (i.e., increases in the number of calibration targets).\nMore notably, the BATS and HOT g agree to within \u03ee0.66% in all bands ( Table 4 ). The latter importantly underscores the viability of our approach, particularly considering the lack of regional tuning in the model that would presumably reduce the differences reported above. Relative to MOBY, both sites perform equally well, as the HOT g maintains better agreement (in terms of percent difference) for only three of the six spectral bands despite the geographic proximity of the HOT site and MOBY. We consider the portability of our approach to varied water masses to be an attractive feature that further assists in validating the model-driven calibration system. The remainder of our analyses make use of the combined BATS and HOT g ( Table 1 ). Fig. 8 .

"}, {"section_title": "SeaWiFS Data Product Validation", "text": "Next, to evaluate the practical impact of using modeled g in lieu of that from MOBY, we input the recalculated gains into the OBPG satellite validation system [4] to generate SeaWiFS-to-in situ validation statistics for L wn and C a . These are subsequently compared with the operational SeaWiFS results. Figure 1 of Bailey and Werdell [4] provides a schematic overview of the validation process. We consider only deep-water stations (water depths \u03fe1000 m) in this analysis as they represent the majority of the global ocean and are generally not plagued with atmospheric correction failures (as are some coastal sites with absorbing aerosols, or other atmospheric conditions not currently represented by the existing aerosol correction scheme). C a data were limited to those collected via HPLC. The impact of the differences in g becomes immediately evident when comparing the MOBY and ORM validation results (Fig. 10 and Tables 5 and 6 ). Encouragingly, the regression slopes, coefficients of determination, and roots of the residual mean squares are nearly indistinguishable. The model-based MPD is slightly higher than that for MOBY, but is similar to within a few percent. The most obvious difference appears in the form of the mean satellite-to-in situ ratios, where yet again we see a relative decrease in the model-based blue bands and an increase in 555 nm. For the most part, the 510, 555, and 670 nm ratios are similar for both the MOBY and ORM runs, and one might further argue that the model-based calibration is statistically preferable at 555 nm. Yet, the 412, 443, and 490 nm ratios decrease by 7%-10%, which will have a noticeable consequence on the downstream calculation of C a . As for the radiometric validation results, the C a regression statistics and MPD are similar for the MOBY and ORM runs, but the satellite-to-in situ ratio increases by approximately 20% (from \u03f31 to \u03f31.2).

Analogous radiometric differences are evident in the oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic subsets. The model-to-MOBY time series ratios show the nine-year C a averages to be 30%, 21%, 32%, and 25% higher for the deep-water, oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic subsets, respectively (Table 7) . Alas, seemingly minor differences in g relate to relevant changes in L wn and therefore C a . That said, the model-based deep-water C a average more closely approaches the annual global average reported by Antoine et al. [3] (which, admittedly, includes eutrophic coastal regions). Ultimately, the use of the ORM-based g does not impact either the validation regressions (i.e., the slope and linearity over the observed dynamic range of observations), or the seasonality of the long-term time series, but rather introduces systematic biases in the results (Fig. 12) . Despite these results, differences in radiometry need not always translate to differences in C a . In this regard, the direction of the change in the blue-band g relative to g \u0351555\u0352 is more important than the combined magnitudes of the changes. The operational C a algorithms for SeaWiFS and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) relate sequencing ratios of blue-to-green R rs to C a in the form of a log-log sigmoidal curve such that a reduction in the R rs ratio results in an increase in C a .

Despite their demise in 1986 and 1997, respectively, both data sets continue to be extensively reviewed [3,14,58 -60] , particularly in the context of resolving decadal trends in global marine productivity [3] . The OBPG recently reanalyzed and reprocessed both the CZCS and OCTS data sets to conform their data processing methodology to that of SeaWiFS and MODIS (the goal being a consistently processed time series for all sensors). Such sensor continuity has long been a community goal [3, 59] and we refer the reader to Table 1 of Antoine et al. [3] for a summary of previous CZCS reanalysis efforts. The details of the OBPG reprocessing efforts are provided elsewhere [61] ; however, a review of how our modeling approach was incorporated into the OBPG on- Fig. 11 . Comparison of SeaWiFS L wn (top) and C a (bottom) trends for global deep water \u0351\u03fe1000 m\u0352 using the MOBY (solid lines) and ORM (solid circles) derived g . In the top panel, from top to bottom, the L wn are 412, 443, 490, 510, and 555 nm. As described in Franz et al. [56] , global level-3 daily L wn and C a files were generated, then spatially averaged into approximately 9-by-9 km resolution equalarea bins, then temporally averaged into four-day composites. To minimize data storage requirements and maximize computational efficiency, only one four-day composite per month is considered (i.e., four weeks separate each composite), leaving a total of 107 L wn and C a composites in the time-series. orbit calibration effort is provided in this section, along with a brief CZCS and OCTS calibration history. Attempts to vicariously calibrate CZCS began shortly after launch, when inconsistencies in the water-leaving radiances and derived products began to prevail [54, 62] and degradation in the instrument sensitivity was routinely observed [63] . Evans and Gordon [14] (EG94) performed a full retrospective analysis of the CZCS calibration and derived updated g and temporal degradation factors for its four ocean color bands. Briefly, bands 2 and 3 (520 and 550 nm) were calibrated by repeatedly processing the full CZCS data archive using revised calibration coefficients until the modes of 10-day histograms of L wn \u0351520\u0352 and L wn \u0351550\u0352 for global Case-1 waters remained temporally stable over the life of the mission and centered on the typical oligotrophic values of 0.5 and 0.3 mW cm \u03ea2 um \u03ea1 sr"}, {"section_title": "\u03ea1", "text": ", respectively. Band 1 \u0351443 nm\u0352 was calibrated through forced agreement with in situ radiometric and pigment data collected by the Nimbus Experiment Team (the CZCS-derived pigment values were forced to agree with the ship-determined values when radiometry was unavailable). EG94 minimally calibrated band 4 \u0351670 nm\u0352, minus a small degradation introduced in late 1982. Subsequent reanalyses [3, 59] used the EG94 results, with the exception of an accelerated band 4 temporal degradation.\nGiven that CZCS lacked onboard calibration capabilities, and considering that the current standard temporal degradation model was vicariously determined (EG94 for bands 1-3 and Antoine et al. [3] for band 4), we explored the feasibility of applying our modeling approach to derive the temporal degradation of the instrument. CZCS acquired sufficient temporal coverage of the Sargasso Sea to allow application of our BATS climatology [61] (recall also that this climatology was reproduced using historical C a from the WOD05; see Fig. 5 ). Unlike modern sensors with functional NIR channels, CZCS requires the use of band 4 and some assumption or ancillary knowledge of aerosol type to estimate both the aerosol and water-leaving radiance contributions to the top-of-atmosphere radiance at 670 nm. To start, we adopted the OBPG vicarious calibration approach [7] and retained only the instrument prelaunch calibration. We then determined the temporal calibration of band 4 based on modeled L wn \u0351670\u0352 and estimated aerosol reflectances, where the latter were derived from SeaWiFS climatological aerosol optical thickness and Angstrom exponent retrievals at BATS using the approach outlined by Franz et al. [64] . We then reprocessed the CZCS series at BATS using this band 4 temporal degradation, modeled L wn , and the assumed maritime aerosol model to derive a timeseries of gains for bands 1-3. This was done only for the first CZCS gain setting. Encouragingly, such an approach appears to be practicable given the agreement of the modeled gain time-series with that reported in EG94 (Fig. 13) . Despite this, not wishing to tie the CZCS on-orbit calibration to SeaWiFS aerosol retrievals or to insert additional uncertainties based on the required aerosol assumptions, the OBPG ultimately opted to use the EG94 temporal degradations for its reprocessing effort.\nWe therefore adopted the EG94 temporal calibration for all CZCS bands and, additionally, the EG94 absolute band 4 gain of 1.008 (for the first gain setting), and rederived g for bands 1-3 using the modeled target L wn from the BATS site and OBPG vicarious calibration approach [7] . In doing so, we assumed a constant maritime aerosol model to extrapolate the aerosol contributions from 670 nm to the shorter wavelengths, which is consistent with the operational approach used by the OBPG. As alluded to in the previous paragraph, the absence of multiple CZCS near-infrared bands prohibits aerosol model selection as is currently done for modern sensors [1] . The OBPG decision to assign a constant aerosol type within CZCS processing is debatable, as more ambitious approaches have been implemented elsewhere [3, 59, 62, 65] . Our current intent, however, is simply to demonstrate the value of a temporally varying ORM in vicarious calibration, and therefore a detailed discussion of CZCS atmospheric correction is beyond the scope of this analysis. Note also that we ultimately limited the determination of g to data collected prior to 1982, as uncertainties associated with the appearance of an El Ni\u00f1o, the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n, and a late-mission instrument heating event [66] inhibited our confidence in post-1981 CZCS data processing. Like the temporal calibration results, the modelbased g (Table 8 ) agreed favorably with those reported in EG94, further corroborating the approach.\nAs it was for CZCS, few in situ radiometric measurements were collected during the OCTS era (which ended prematurely after only nine months of data collection). NASDA opted to calibrate OCTS vicariously by forcing the satellite measurements to match this limited series of field observations. Initially, it used a single radiometric profile and ancillary atmospheric measurements collected off the coast of California to calibrate its six visible and two NIR bands [67] . NASDA later recalibrated the two NIR bands (bands 7 and 8) using eight clear satellite scenes with known aerosol types (i.e., aerosol models) and an assumption of perfect prelaunch calibration for band 6 \u0351670 nm\u0352. The remaining five visible bands were recalibrated using two spectra from the Yamata Bank Optical Moored buoy system. In contrast, Gregg et al. [58] assumed perfect prelaunch calibration for band 8 \u0351865 nm\u0352 and recalibrated band 7 \u0351765 nm\u0352 using OCTS scenes contaminated by Sun glint, where they could assume a lack of spectral dependence between 765 and 865 nm. They recalibrated the visible bands using six in situ radiometric profiles collected in the New York Bight, Gulf of Maine, and off Lanai. Most recently, Wang et al. [60] adopted the NASDA band 8 \u0351865 nm\u0352 calibration, but proceeded with the band 7 \u0351765 nm\u0352 and visible band calibration following Eplee et al. [6] , including the sole use of MOBY radiometry (six measurements col- With the exception of 670 nm, as the EG94 value was adopted for our analysis.\nlected from late November 1996 to late February 1997). Note that an on-orbit temporal calibration of OCTS has yet to be applied.\nThe OBPG vicarious calibration of the OCTS NIR bands is described elsewhere [61] , but follows that described in Franz et al. [7] . Consistent temporal coverage of the BATS and HOT sites by OCTS permitted the OBPG to use modeled L wn from both in its vicarious recalibration effort [61] . As was described for SeaWiFS in Section 4, we derived model-based g for the six visible OCTS bands ( Table 9 ), all of which generally agree in magnitude with those reported by Shimada et al. [67] , Gregg et al. [58] , and Wang et al. [60] . As these latter studies made use of very limited and varied in situ data sets, we naturally expect some differences. In its OCTS processing, the OBPG removed a tilt-dependent instrument gain setting and applied bilinear temporal degradations to the NIR bands \u0351765 and 865 nm\u0352. The details of these are provided elsewhere [61] , but they are worth highlighting briefly as both contribute to the differences in g mentioned above. For OCTS, one advantage of the model-based calibration approach is the increased statistical sample size, which, as shown in Franz et al. [7] , decreases the uncertainty associated with the derived vicarious gains. Note also that our derived gains compare well with the clear-water modelbased vicarious gains reported in Gregg et al. [58] .\nTo evaluate the practical utility of the modelderived vicarious gains, we generated CZCS and OCTS L wn and C a satellite-to-in situ validation results [4] , as was done for SeaWiFS in Section 5. We obtained global CZCS-era C a measurements from the WOD05 [13] and radiometric observations from SeaBASS. While the C a span from November 1978 through May 1986, the radiometry is limited to a series of three cruises conducted from November 1978 to June 1979 [66] , representing, to our knowledge, the only CZCS-era radiometry that have been made publicly available. Global OCTS-era pigments and radiometric data were both acquired from SeaBASS and include the 1996 preoperations MOBY deployment. In preparation for the validation activity, all data were treated following Werdell and Bailey [39] . In contrast to that described in Section 5, however, these data were not limited to deep water \u0351\u03fe1000 m\u0352 stations, and only fluorometrically derived C a were available for both satellite missions.\nDespite the diminutive sample sizes, the radiometric matchups are favorable for both CZCS and OCTS (Fig. 14) , reporting satellite-to-in situ ratios that approach unity and MPD that paralleled or exceeded the SeaWiFS results. The CZCS C a maintain high MPD, partly because of the mid-to-late mission uncertainties listed above, but are otherwise fairly well-represented over the dynamic range of 0.1 to 10 mg m"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, we explored using an ocean surface reflectance model to calibrate vicariously SeaWiFS in lieu of in situ data, with the long-term goal of developing a modern baseline technique for the calibration of the visible bands of CZCS and OCTS. In particular, we intended to provide both the technical and analytical foundation for such an approach and, building on Franz et al. [7] , a first-order analysis of the uncertainties associated with changes in visible vicarious gain coefficients as they relate to the development of decadal C a climate data records. We reiterate that our approach is not intended to replace the use of in situ radiometers, for example MOBY and other existing calibration-quality instrument networks [68] , but rather to provide a viable calibration alternative, or complement, in the absence of abundant coincident field data, as is the case for both CZCS and OCTS.\nUsing an ocean surface reflectance model [11, 16] that has been shown to be valid in Case-1 waters, SeaWiFS vicarious gains were recalculated to within \u03ee0.9% of that from MOBY for all six visible bands, with only g \u0351443\u0352 and g \u0351490\u0352 exceeding 0.5% absolute difference ( Table 1 ). The g for BATS and HOT sites are also within \u03ee0.7% of each other, verifying the portability of the model (Table 4) . Ostensibly, these results are remarkably good given that they were acquired using modeled annual C a expressions for two different water masses and a globally parameterized ORM (all of which have compounding uncertainties). Despite the small differences, however, we suspect the ORM-C a climatology combination produces L wn that are subtly, yet overly, spectrally flat (too low at blue wavelengths and too high at green wavelengths), at least in its current form. This is first detectable through temporal comparisons of modeled output with in situ radiometric observations, where the C a climatology provides input into the ORM (Fig.  6) . Later, the spectral dependency becomes clearly recognizable in the SeaWiFS L wn validation satelliteto-in situ ratios (Table 6 ). With regards to derived products, the net effect of the spectral differences in g is a 30% increase in global C a , as represented by our deep-water \u0351\u03fe1000 m\u0352 SeaWiFS subset. At this stage, however, we do not presuppose that either the ORM or annual C a expressions is singularly responsible for the differences between modeled and MOBY g .\nIt is worth recalling that this C a -based bio-optical model relies on average empirical relationships for Case-1 waters, specifically Eqs. (3) and (6) , so that the resulting radiances provide only the average spectra for the given C a used as input. Actually, the natural variability of the bio-optical properties of Case-1 waters introduces considerable scatter around these relationships (see, e.g., Fig. 3 of Loisel and Morel [19] and Fig. 3 of MM01) , and therefore some uncertainties inevitably affect the predicted radiance spectra. Further, we cannot ignore that some systematic differences may temporarily or permanently exist in certain geographic zones, even if they are identified as Case-1 waters. The Mediterranean Sea provides an example of this particular behavior [69] . The Sargasso Sea also experiences seasonal fluctuations in the components of marine absorption [50] .\nSeemingly, the use of regionally acquired in situ measurements would locally improve the empirical expressions within the ORM and assist in the validation of the remaining analytically derived components. Currently, the radiometric and biological parameters required to reconstruct Eqs. (3) and (6) are routinely collected by most marine observational programs using commercially available instrumentation. If the standard suite of radiometric profiles (upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance) were to be expanded to include upwelling irradiance (possible by positioning the irradiance sensor to point to nadir), routine measurements of nadir Q are also feasible using existing technology (many field programs have already adopted this approach). We used a limited suite of regional observations to diagnose problematic empirical expressions within the ORM. While a complete reparameterization of these expressions was appealing, in practice their statistical rederivation proved challenging because of the limited dynamic range in C a and the other products of interest.\nDespite its current lack of regional tuning, we find the demonstrated portability of the ORM calibration approach to be one of its more appealing features. The results presented in Tables 3 and 4 indicate convergence between not only the BATS and HOT g with MOBY, but also with each other. In its current (globally parameterized) state, the approach is geographically limited only by the availability of reliable long-term C a time-series. When C a is unavailable, the approach is economically limited only by the cost of collecting and processing phytoplankton pigments. In this context of economic feasibility, our model-based approach provides a cost-effective alternative for vicarious calibration when compared to what is required to develop and maintain an autonomous mooring or marine platform. Even were regional tuning deemed necessary, the field instrumentation is limited to those needed to evaluate and update the empirical components of the ORM (e.g., commercially available radiometers and transmissometers), as we described.\nWe are not suggesting that the model-based approach be used in lieu of field radiometry to calibrate modern ocean color satellite instruments in the presence of abundant, high quality in situ data. The SeaWiFS L wn and C a validation results ( Fig. 10 and Tables 5 and 6 ) are clearly superior for the MOBYderived g . An emerging body of evidence also exists in support of prerequisite radiometric accuracy for vicarious calibration of ocean color sensors that cannot currently be achieved by the ORM [70] . Rather, we propose that the modeling approach be considered when field radiometry is unavailable, such as for historical missions, or impractical, as would be the case for a recently launched satellite instrument. Franz et al. [7] demonstrated that a minimum of 30-40 g i are required to satisfactorily derive g . For a recently launched satellite, for example, our approach provides a complementary source of target L wn when field data are still being acquired or reviewed or as a supplement to an in situ time-series to increase the statistical sample size.\nWhile we highlight the utility of the ORM for ocean color satellite calibration, it also provides a viable mechanism for radiometric validation in the absence of in situ data. As a case study, consider the earlymission performance of the NASA MODIS onboard the Aqua spacecraft, which was launched in early 2002. Prior to 2004, the derived ocean color products demonstrated a strong latitudinal dependency, which partly stemmed from an incorrect interpretation of the prelaunch characterization of the instrument polarization [71] . This dependency was not fully evident until the MODIS radiometry was compared with SeaWiFS products at high latitudes [56] , as few field radiometric measurements were available to diagnose such a problem. In such a data-poor scenario, the ORM provides a complementary source of plausible L wn .\nThe ORM calibration approach might be further extended to support analytical studies concerning future instrument design and deployment strategies. For example, the ORM provides an opportunity to quantify the minimum resolution required to maintain acceptable levels of uncertainty in g , if subnanometer resolution (as for MOBY) proves too costly to maintain in the future. The ORM approach also provides a mechanism to evaluate the costs and benefits of developing and maintaining multiple, geographically varied calibration sites prior to deploying autonomous instrumentation. Franz et al. [7] suggest that remotely sensed L w retrievals in coastal and inland waters are likely to exhibit systematic biases caused by regionally specific errors in the atmospheric correction process (e.g., localized aerosol conditions). In the absence of radiometric field data, a regionally tuned ORM can provide a cost-effective mechanism for adjusting the remote sensing system to improve the performance of L w retrievals in such locations.\nHere, however, our primary interest is continuity among historical and current ocean color satellite data products. Within the practical context of CZCS and OCTS reprocessing-that is, the generation of decadal C a climate data records-the absolute radiometric calibration is less significant provided the derived multisensor C a are accurate and without instrumentto-instrument biases. If radiometric accuracy were to be moderately sacrificed for consistently derived C a , this would be accomplished using a systematic reprocessing of the relevant ocean color satellites with a consistent vicarious calibration target, such as the ORM. Our intent was simply to develop the methodology and build the analytical framework for a modern model-based vicarious calibration approach. We quantified the ability of our model-based approach to replicate MOBY vicarious gains for SeaWiFS, and subsequently derived CZCS and OCTS gains of equal or superior value to those currently available. Ultimately, the proximity of the SeaWiFS model-based g to that from MOBY is very encouraging (less than absolute 0.9% spectrally), and will be improved upon with additional insight into the absorption and scattering properties of various optically relevant marine constituents.
