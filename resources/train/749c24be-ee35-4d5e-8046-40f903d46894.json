However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on select security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2007-08 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12-through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2007, but they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Figure A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys. Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. For example, in Indicator 11, which reports on bullying using data from the School Crime Supplement survey, the 2007 questionnaire was revised to include information on cyber-bullying. Due to this change, the text of this indicator is no longer presenting trend information. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. Throughout this report, in cases where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (interpret data with caution).

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used when differences among percentages were examined relative to interval categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Although percentages reported in the tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), percentages reported in the text and figures are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to whole numbers, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the corresponding table.

Between the 1992-93 and 2007-08 school years, from 1 to 9 school-age youth committed suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years. 1 data from School Associated Violent deaths Surveillance Study (SAVd) from 1999-2000 onward are considered preliminary.

During the 2007-08 school year, a smaller percentage of teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury by a student from their school than in 1993-94 (12 percent) and 1999-2000 (9 percent), though this percentage was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003-04 (7 percent) (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school, 4 percent, was not measurably different in 2007-08 than in any previous survey year (table 5.2). A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being threatened with injury during the 2007-08 school year (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). Ten percent of teachers in city schools were threatened with injury by students, compared to 7 percent of teachers in town schools and 6 percent each of teachers in suburban and rural schools. A greater percentage of teachers in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4 percent) than teachers in rural schools (3 percent) reported being physically attacked (table 5.2). During 2007-08, teachers' reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students varied according to the instructional level of their school. A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) than elementary school teachers (7 percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student, and this pattern held for teachers in suburban schools as well as for teachers in rural schools (table 5.1 and figure 5.2). The apparent difference in the percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city schools who reported being threatened with injury was not statistically significant. However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported having been physically attacked than secondary school teachers (2 percent), and this pattern held true for teachers in city, suburban, town, and rural schools (table 5.2). A greater percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened with injury (8 vs. 3 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students during 2007-08 (tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in city schools, there were at least five times as many public school teachers as private school teachers who reported being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four times as many public school teachers as private school teachers who reported being physically attacked (6 vs. 1 percent). In all survey years, a greater percentage of male teachers reported having been threatened with injury than female teachers (table 5.1). For example, in 2007-08, 9 percent of male teachers reported that they were threatened with injury by students, compared to 7 percent of female teachers; this pattern held true for teachers in city and suburban schools in 2007-08, as well. Public school teachers' reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked varied among the states and the District of Columbia. During 2007-08, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury during the previous 12 months ranged from 3 percent in North Dakota to 17 percent in the District of Columbia (table 5.3), and the percentage who reported being physically attacked ranged from 2 percent in New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Ohio to 8 percent in Maryland (table 5.4).  \" 1993-94, 1999, 2003-04, and 2007\"Charter School Teacher Data File,\" 1999and \"Bureau of Indian Education Teacher Data File,\" 1999, 2003-04, and 2007.   In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to provide the number of violent incidents, 18 serious violent incidents, 19 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, and other incidents 20 that occurred at their school; 21 public school principals were also asked to provide the number of incidents reported to the police. This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one or more of these specified crimes, the total number of these crimes recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students.

Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session. year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes, had taken place, amounting to an estimated 2.0 million crimes ( figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of 43 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2007-08. During the same year, 62 percent of schools reported one of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to about 704,000 crimes-or 15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. In 2007-08, a greater percentage of schools recorded an incident of crime than reported an incident of crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other crimes. Similarly, the rate of recorded incidents per 1,000 students was higher than the rate of incidents reported to the police per 1,000 students; this held true for violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other crime. In 2007-08, 75 percent of schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 17 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, 47 percent recorded one or more thefts, and 67 percent recorded one or more other incidents. In comparison, 38 percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police, 13 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to police, 31 percent reported at least one theft to police, and 49 percent reported one or more other incidents to police.

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics. In 2007-08, a higher percentage of middle schools than primary schools reported various types of discipline problems (figure 7.1). For example, 44 percent of middle schools compared to 21 percent of primary schools reported that student bullying occurred at least once a week. Also, a higher percentage of middle schools than high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of student bullying. A greater percentage of high schools than middle schools reported any occurrence of gang activities or cult or extremist group activities during the school year. In 2007-08, the percentage of schools reporting discipline problems was generally smaller for schools where 25 percent or less of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than for schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible. For example, 13 percent of schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reducedprice lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers compared to 3 percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the students were eligible.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems happen in their schools. 22 This indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of other students, verbal abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and cult or extremist group activities, and, due to the severe nature of these incidents, presents any reports of gang and cult or extremist group activities that occurred during the school year. During the 2007-08 school year, 25 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis and 11 percent reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse took place on a daily or weekly basis (table 7.1).

Gangs at school can be disruptive to the school environment because their presence may incite fear among students and increase the level of school violence . In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if gangs were present at their school. 23 In 2007, 23 percent of students reported that there were gangs at their schools during the school year (figure 8.1 and table 8.1). During the same year, a greater percentage of male students (25 percent) than female students (21 percent) reported a gang presence at their schools. Overall, a smaller percentage of White students (16 percent) and Asian students (17 percent) reported a gang presence at school than Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic students (36 percent) in 2007. Generally, a smaller percentage of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-graders reported a gang presence at their school than 9th-, 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders. In 2007, between 15 and 21 percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8thgraders reported a gang presence at school compared to 24 to 28 percent of students in the higher grades. In 2007, a higher percentage of students attending public schools (25 percent) reported a gang presence at school than students attending private schools (5 percent). The total percentage of students who reported the presence of gangs at school was higher in 2005 (24 percent) than in 2003 (21 percent); however there was no measurable change in the percentage of students who reported the presence of gangs at school between the two most recent survey years (2005 and 2007) (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).  The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and corrupting influence on the school environment . In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey. 24 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but subsequently decreased (to 25 percent in 2005 and 22 percent in 2007) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1). The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property was lower in 2007 than it was in 2005 (22 vs. 25 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2009", "text": "Reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied by student characteristics. A higher percentage of males than females reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property in each survey year from 1993 to 2007 (figure 9.1 and table 9.1). For example, in 2007, 26 percent of males reported that drugs were available, compared with 19 percent of females. Some differences in the percentages of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property also appeared by grade. In 2007, the percentage of 10th-grade students (25 percent) who reported that drugs were made available to them was higher than the percentage for either 9th-or 12th-grade students (21 and 20 percent, respectively), but not measurably different from that of 11th-grade students. The percentages of students who reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school property differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure 9.2 and table 9.1). Specifically, in 2007, higher percentages of Hispanic and Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students than Black, White, and Asian students reported that drugs were made available to them (29 and 38 percent vs. 19-21 percent). Although it appears that a higher percentage of Pacific Islander/ Native Hawaiian students than Hispanic students reported that drugs were made available to them, the difference was not found to be statistically significant. In 2007, student reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied among the 39 states and the District of Columbia for which data were available. Among these states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 10 percent in Iowa to 37 percent in Arizona (table 9.2).   \niii Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community  has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. All comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Additional information about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A. This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher injury, bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons, availability and student use of drugs and alcohol, and student perceptions of personal safety at school. Indicators of crime and safety are compared across different population subgroups and over time. Data on crimes that occur away from school are offered as a point of comparison where available.\nIn the 2007-08 school year, an estimated 55.7 million students were enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12 . \nix Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2009 provides the most recent national indicators on school crime and safety. The information presented in this report is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and school crime prevention. Accurate information about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem being addressed is essential for developing effective programs and policies. This is the twelfth edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides detailed statistics to inform the nation about current aspects of crime and safety in schools.  Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community . For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;, victimized children are more prone to truancy , poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;, and violent behaviors . For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether ). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety.\n"}, {"section_title": "School Environment 36", "text": "In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words against them, and 35 percent had seen hate-related graffiti at school."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 10 Students' Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing Hate-Related Graffiti", "text": "In the 2007 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation at school. 25 Students were also asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their school-that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building. With regard to hate-related words, students were asked to specify the characteristic to which the word was directed. 26 In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words against them during the school year (figure 10.1 and table 10.1).

For example, in 2007, 5 percent of males compared to 4 percent of females reported using alcohol on school property. However, since 2003, there has been no measurable difference in the percentage of males and females who reported using alcohol anywhere.

A higher percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent) than 9th-graders (3 percent) reported drinking on school property; however, no measurable differences were found among other grade levels. In 2007, a larger percentage of White and Hispanic students reported drinking alcohol anywhere than their Black, Asian, or American Indian/Alaska Native peers, and a smaller percentage of Asian students reported drinking alcohol anywhere than students from other race/ethnicities. Forty-seven percent of White students and 48 percent of Hispanic students reported drinking alcohol any where compared to 35 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students, 34 percent of Black students, and 25 percent of Asian students.

For more information: Tables 20. 1 and 20.2, and Neiman and DeVoe (2009), (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009326). Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures intended to promote the safety of students and staff. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked about their school's use of safety and security measures and procedures. Certain practices, such as locked or monitored doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as metal detectors, security cameras, and drug sweeps, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. In the 2007-08 school year, nearly all public schools required visitors to sign in or check in (99 percent) (table 20.1). Other frequently reported safety and security measures included prohibiting all tobacco use on school grounds (91 percent of public schools) and controlling access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (90 percent of public schools) (figure 20.1 and table 20.1). Fortythree percent of public schools reported that they had an electronic notification system for a schoolwide emergency and 31 percent of public schools reported that they had a structured, anonymous threat reporting system. One percent of public schools required students to pass through metal detectors daily. The use of safety and security measures varied by school level during the 2007-08 school year. In general, a greater percentage of high schools than middle schools and primary schools, and a greater percentage of middle schools than primary schools, reported using the following safety and security measures: drug testing for athletes; drug testing for students in extracurricular activities; 38 requiring students to wear badges or picture ID's; daily metal detector checks on students; 39 random dog sniffs to check for drugs; 38 random sweeps for contraband; 38,40  primary schools reported that students were required to wear badges or picture IDs. However, a smaller percentage of high schools than middle or primary schools reported controlling access to buildings during school hours and requiring students to wear uniforms. A greater percentage of middle schools reported having an electronic notification system for a school-wide emergency (49 percent) than primary schools (43 percent) or high schools (44 percent). In general, a higher percentage of schools with 1,000 or more students than schools with fewer students reported the use of each safety and security measure (the exceptions were controlling access to the building during school hours, drug testing for students in extracurricular activities, and requiring students to wear uniforms). For example, 56 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students had an electronic notification system for a school wide emergency, compared to 49 percent of schools with 500-999 students, 41 percent of schools with 300-499 students, and 31 percent of schools with less than 300 students. The percentage of schools using various security measures has changed over time. Between the 1999-2000 and 2007-08 school years, there was an increase in the percentage of public schools reporting the use of the following safety and security measures: controlled access to the building during school hours (from 75 to 90 percent); controlled access to school grounds during school hours (from 34 to 43 percent); students required to wear badges or picture IDs (from 4 to 8 percent); faculty required to wear badges or picture IDs (from 25 to 58 percent); the use of one or more security cameras to monitor school (from 19 to 55 percent); the provision of telephones in most classrooms (from 45 to 72 percent); and the requirement that students wear uniforms (from 12 to 18 percent) (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). Between the 2003-04 and 2007-08 school years, there was an increase in the percentage of schools reporting the drug testing of student athletes (from 4 to 6 percent) as well as an increase in the percentage of schools reporting the drug testing of students in other extracurricular activities (from 3 to 4 percent).   , 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, and 2007-08 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2008.  Bauer et al. (2008. Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of students, ranging from codes of student conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime Supplement 41 to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether their school used certain security measures. 42 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or police officers, adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2007, nearly all students ages 12-18 observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at their school (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). In 2007, the majority of students ages 12-18 reported that their school had a code of student conduct (96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent). Ninety percent of students reported the presence of school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway, and 69 percent reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers. Fifty-four percent of students reported locker checks, 61 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and 66 percent reported the use of security cameras at their schools. Twenty-four percent of students reported that badges or picture identification were required. Metal detectors were the least observed of the selected safety and security measures: 10 percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their school. The percentage of students reporting the presence of some of the selected security measures increased between the two most recent survey years as well as over longer time periods. For example, a greater percentage of students reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their school in 2007 (66 percent) than in 2005 (58 percent). Over the longer time period of 2001 through 2007, the percentage of students who reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their school increased from 39 to 66 percent. Similarly, a greater percentage of students reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day in 2007 (61 percent) than in 2005 (54 percent). Over the longer time period of 1999 through 2007, the percentage of students who reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased from 38 to 61 percent. In 2007, about 94 percent of students reported that their school had a requirement that visitors sign in compared to 93 percent of students in 2005. Between 1999 and 2007, the percentage of students who reported a visitor sign-in requirement increased from 87 to 94 percent. No significant differences were detected in the percentage of students who reported metal detectors, locker checks, the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers, requirements that students wear badges or picture identification, or a code of student conduct in their schools across all survey years.

Respondents were instructed to respond only for those times that were during normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session, unless the survey specified otherwise.  The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a census of all known entities in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different surveys may appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g., students ages 12-18 or students in grades 9-12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere). All comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the text, figures, and tables are rounded from original estimates, not from a series of rounding. The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used in this report. SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a search of the Lexis/ Nexis newspaper and media database. Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full police report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors.\n(2) 25.7 28.4 27.5 21.5 25.4 (2)  (2) 60.8 52.3 40.0 38.7 48.8 (2) (2) 6.7 12.4 8.5 ! \u2021 8.6 more than one race (2)  In 1993, Asian students and Pacific Islander students were not categorized separately and students were not given the option of choosing more than one race.

For some recent data, the interviews with school and law enforcement officials to verify case details have not been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be identified because of the expansion of the scope of the media files used for case identification. Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier data years using the independent case finding efforts (which focus on non-media sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally be identified while the police and school interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students' participation in after school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.\nReaders should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is followed by a question on race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. do not appear to be due to actual changes in crime during that period. The increases were attributed to the impact of methodological changes in the survey.

For more information on 2007 data see http://www.ojb.usdoj.gov/bjs/publ/pdf/cv07tn.pdf. The number of NCVS eligible households in sample in 2007 was about 45,900. They were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interviewed all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 74,000 persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and included in the survey estimates. After their seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90 percent at the household level. The completion rates for persons within households in 2007 were about 86 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information about the NCVS, contact:  1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students' participation in after school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January to June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item made for 2003 onward). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview has always been included in the SCS data collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6-12, and were not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and household members who attended school any time during the school year were included. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. The prevalence of victimization for , 2003for was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995for , 2003 SCS data files. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS definition of \"at school\" includes in the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. A total of 9,700 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999SCS, 8,400 in , 8,400 in 2001SCS, 8,400 in , 7,200 in 2003SCS, 8,400 in , 6,300 in 2005SCS, 8,400 in , and 5,600 in 2007 In the 2007 SCS, the household completion rate was 90 percent. In the , 2003In the , and 2005 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent, respectively, and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, and 62 percent respectively. For the 2007 SCS, the student completion rate was 58 percent. Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005, and 53 percent in 2007. Response rates for most survey items were high-typically over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007. Due to the low unit response rate in 2005 and 2007, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a common recourse to nonresponse, can lead to the risk of underestimating the sampling error if imputed data are treated as though they were observed data. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999 and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other race/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates.

This report uses 1993uses , 1995uses , 1997uses , 1999uses , 2001uses , 2003uses , 2005uses , and 2007 The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties, subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. Three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/ Alaska Native enrollment.

NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2007, a total of 39 states and 22 districts had weighted data. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 1,100 to 13,400. School response rates ranged from 69 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60 to 92 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 90 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However, NCES publications do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates presented here may not appear in CDC publications of YRBS estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was: How do you describe yourself? A. White-not Hispanic B. Black-not Hispanic C. Hispanic or Latino D. Asian or Pacific Islander E. American Indian or Alaskan Native F. Other to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The coefficient of variation (C V ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C V is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the C V was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where the C V was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the C V was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Jeff Hall", "text": "In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January to June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity item made for 2003 onward).

Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the 1993Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 1995Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 1997Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 1999Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 2001Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 2003Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , 2005Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000 students participated in the , and 2007 The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, and 68 percent for the 2007 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/). Each state and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2007, a total of 39 states and 22 districts had weighted data. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 1,100 to 13,400. School response rates ranged from 69 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60 to 92 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 90 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However, NCES publications do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates presented here may not appear in CDC publications of YRBS estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was:  version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and  (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and (2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students.  found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

The 1993The -94, 1999The , 2003The -04, and 2007  The public school sampling frames for the 1993-94, 1999, 2003-04, and 2007-08 SASS were created using the 1991-92, 1997-98, 2001-02, and 2005 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings apart from a private home. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were treated as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals or school head). Since CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified in order to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the selection of schools. This report uses 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, and 2007-08 SASS data. Approximately 10,000 public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993-94 SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIE-funded schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 1999-2000 SASS, 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIE-funded schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 2003-04 SASS, and 9,980 public schools (9,800 public schools and 180 BIE-funded schools) and 2,940 private schools were selected to participate in the 2007-08 SASS. Within each school, teachers selected were further stratified into one of five teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993-94, approximately 57,000 public school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIE teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, 52,500 public school teachers, 700 BIE teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, 47,440 public school teachers, 750 BIE teachers, and 8,180 private school teachers were sampled. This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted response rate for public school teachers in 1993-94 was 88 percent. In 1999-2000, the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIE and public charter school teachers, respectively (which are included with public school teachers for this report).

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The coefficient of variation (C V ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C V is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the C V was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where the C V was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the C V was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: ( 1)where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula: where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is not rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.

Such violation may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property. Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders. Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks. Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her.

The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and corrupting influence on the school environment . In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey. 24 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but subsequently decreased (to 25 percent in 2005 and 22 percent in 2007) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1).

Among these states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 10 percent in Iowa to 37 percent in Arizona (table 9.2).

For example, a smaller percentage of 12th-graders (6 percent) reported being targets of a hate-related word than 6th-graders (12 percent); 7th-graders, 8th-graders, and 9th-graders (11 percent each); and 10th-graders (9 percent). A higher percentage of public school students than private school students reported being called a hate-related word (10 vs. 6 percent) and seeing hate-related graffiti (36 vs. 19 percent). In 2007, 10 percent of public school students reported being called a hate-related word and 36 percent reported seeing hate-related graffiti compared to 6 percent of private school students who reported being called a hate-related word and 19 percent who reported seeing hate-related graffiti. A higher percentage of White students and students of other races/ethnicities than Asian students reported seeing hate-related graffiti. However, no other measurable differences were found by race/ ethnicity or by sex in the percentages of students who reported being called hate-related words or seeing hate-related graffiti. Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of students who reported being the target of a hate-related word decreased from 12 to 10 percent. Between the two most recent survey years, 2005 and 2007, the percentage of students who reported being the target of a hate-related word was lower in 2007 (10 percent) than in 2005 (11 percent). There was no pattern of increase or decrease in the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti between 1999 and 2007. However, the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti was smaller in 2007 (35 percent) than in 2005 (38 percent). Indicator 10 continued on page 38. With regard to the specific characteristic to which the hate-related word was directed, in 2007, 5 percent of students reported hate-related words concerning their race, 3 percent reported words related to their ethnicity, 2 percent each reported words concerning their religion or gender, and 1 percent each reported words related to their disability or sexual orientation ( figure 10.2 and table 10.2). Students' experiences of being targets of specific types of hate-related words in 2007 differed according to their sex and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). A greater percentage of female students than male students (3 vs. 1 percent) reported being called a genderrelated hate word. However, a greater percentage of male students than female students reported being called hate-related words relating to race and ethnicity. Five percent of male students compared to 4 percent of female students reported being targets of a hate-related word regarding race and 4 percent of male students compared to 2 percent of female students reported being targets of a hate-related word regarding ethnicity. A smaller percentage of White students (3 percent) reported being called race-related hate words than Black students (7 percent), Hispanic students (6 percent), Asian students (11 percent), and students from other race/ethnicities (8 percent). Smaller percentages of both White students and Black students (2 percent each) reported hate-related words regarding their ethnicity than Hispanic and Asian students (7 percent each). 1 In the School Crime Supplement (SCS) questionnaire, students were asked if they had been the target of hate-related words at school. Students who indicated that they had been called a hate-related word were asked to choose the specific characteristics that the hate-related word targeted. Students were allowed to choose more than one characteristic. If a student chose more than one characteristic, he or she is counted once under the \"total\" category. Therefore, the total percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word is less than the sum of the students' individual characteristics. NOTE: \"At school\" includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and going to and from school. Hate-related refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students' personal characteristics.

The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a census of all known entities in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different surveys may appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g., students ages 12-18 or students in grades 9-12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere). All comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the text, figures, and tables are rounded from original estimates, not from a series of rounding. The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used in this report."}, {"section_title": "School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD)", "text": "The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional firearm-related deaths where the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through the present. SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a search of the Lexis/ Nexis newspaper and media database. Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full police report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors."}]
