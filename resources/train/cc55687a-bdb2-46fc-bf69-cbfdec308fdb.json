Methods: Four-hundred and twelve cognitively normal participants were followed over 7 years. Nonlinear methods were used to estimate the longitudinal trajectories of several cognitive outcomes including delayed memory recall, executive function, processing speed, and several cognitive composites by subgroups selected on the basis of biomarkers, including APOE-e4 allele carriers, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Ab 42 , total tau, and phosphorylated tau), and those with small hippocampi. Results: Derived cognitive composites combining Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS)-cog scores with additional delayed memory recall and executive function components captured decline more robustly across biomarker groups than any measure of a single cognitive domain or ADAS-cog alone. Substantial increases in power resulted when including only participants positive for three or more biomarkers in simulations of clinical trials. Interpretation: Clinical trial power may be improved by selecting participants on the basis of amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarkers and carefully tailoring primary cognitive endpoints to reflect the expected decline specific to these individuals. "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Several recent clinical trials targeting b-amyloid (Ab) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown evidence of reducing the accumulation of Ab plaques, but without proving a slowing of cognitive decline. [1] [2] [3] One possible explanation of these failures is that a treatment targeting Ab deposition, an early-stage process, may have little effect on patients in later stages when only a weak correlation between plaques and cognition remains. 4 In later stages of AD, measures of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss, rather than Ab pathology, are associated with continued cognitive worsening, suggesting that although plaques may initiate the disease process, it is tau pathology and atrophy that drive cognitive decline once AD has been diagnosed. [5] [6] [7] These failures led to a wave of trials that attempt anti-Ab treatment in early stages, prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Identifying a successful treatment requires demonstrating a slowing of cognitive decline, a task that becomes difficult and costly when the target population has yet to demonstrate decline, and may not decline in the near future. 8 Minimizing costs of such trials will require accurately predicting future deterioration in a currently asymptomatic population as well as identifying clinical endpoints that capture the earliest evidence of cognitive decline.\nTo identify at-risk individuals, The A4 Study, a trial of solanezumab, an anti-Ab treatment, recruits cognitively normal participants with Ab-positive positron emission tomography (PET) scans. 9 Another trial, The Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative APOE4 Treatment Trial will recruit cognitively normal subjects homozygous for the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic feature increasing the risk of Ab deposition and cognitive decline. 10 Other inclusion criteria, depending on the target of treatment, could be based on alternative histological features of AD including tau pathology or hippocampal atrophy. 11 Recruiting participants for combinations of pathologies such as amyloid, tau and/or genetic markers may increase the likelihood of near-term cognitive decline, consequently reducing sample sizes and trial costs.\nIdentifying the endpoint most sensitive to the earliest cognitive changes is another challenge. Recent guidance from the FDA endorses the need to identify optimal cognitive endpoints for trials in these populations. 12 Delayed memory recall, a domain repeatedly shown to decline early, should comprise a substantial portion of any cognitive composite to capture changes of a cognitively normal population. [13] [14] [15] [16] Several nonmemory domains also shown to decline early include executive function, attention, and pro- cessing speed. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Global composites that assess multiple cognitive domains, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), have also been shown to capture early decline. [23] [24] [25] [26] An optimized trial design will include endpoints tailored to the domains expected to decline based on the biomarkers used for study inclusion criteria.\nOur primary goal in this analysis was to identify the combination of biomarker-based inclusion criteria and cognitive endpoints that will demonstrate the most longitudinal decline, in order to maximize power of treatment trials in a cognitively normal population. We consider several wellestablished biomarkers associated with cognitive decline: APOE-e4 allele, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab 42 , high total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and small hippocampal volume; and cognitive measures associated with early change: delayed memory recall, executive function, processing speed, and global composites."}, {"section_title": "Methods Participants", "text": "Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Participants were considered positive for CSF Ab 42 (Ab+) if CSF Ab 42 was less than the a priori threshold 192 ng/L. 27 Participants were considered biomarkerpositive for t-tau (t-tau+) or p-tau (p-tau+) if they were in the highest quartile of each respective measure, while the hippocampal volume positivity (hippocampus+) threshold was defined to be the lowest quartile, after left and right hemispheres were averaged and the effect of intracranial volume had been removed via residualization. 34 ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 participants were categorized separately for hippocampal positivity, due to the methodological differences between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2.\nIn subsequent analyses, these binary categories were used to further classify participants into multiple pathology groups: participants who proved negative for all five biomarkers (group 0), participants who proved positive for only one biomarker (group 1), positive for two biomarkers (group 2), and participants who proved positive for three, four, or five biomarkers (group 3+). In a separate analysis, and because measures of Ab are invasive (lumbar puncture) or costly (PET imaging, not used in this study due to fewer samples and shorter follow-up time), we considered inclusion criteria based on APOE-e4 positivity and hippocampal volume alone: APOE+ participants with small hippocampi were compared with APOE\u00c0 participants with larger hippocampi. Baseline associations between the biomarker groups and demographic/clinical factors were assessed using Fisher's Exact test for gender and Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables (age and education).\nThe single and multiple pathology classifications were then used to predict longitudinal change in each of the cognitive outcomes and in two derived composites. The two composites were (1) ADAS11, Trails B and Logical Memory II, and (2) ADAS11, Trails B, and dAVLT, differing only by type of additional delayed memory recall component. Each individual cognitive component was first standardized by mean-centering and scaling to the standard deviation of the scores. The standardized components were then summed and standardized again to form the composites.\nUp to 7 years of repeated measures of each outcome were available, with the exception of Digit Symbol Substitution, which was collected for up to 4 years. Cognitive tests were administered annually with an additional test at month 6 for all measures except Logical Memory II. Longitudinal cognitive measures were modeled using linear mixed-effects regression with a random intercept and slope and an unstructured covariance matrix for the random effects. To capture departures from linearity in the trajectory of cognition, continuous time from baseline test was parameterized using restricted cubic splines. 35 For outcomes with 7 years of follow up, spline knots were placed at 1, 3, and 5 years; for Digit Symbol Substitution (4 years of follow up), knots were placed at 0.5, 1.5, and 3 years. With three knots, time is modeled with two parameters. Differences in trajectories among the pathology groups were tested using interactions between the two parameters for time and the pathology group factor, b time 1 :group \u00fe b time 2 :group: Pathology groups were tested within biomarker for trajectory differences, for example, APOE+ versus APOE\u00c0, and also between pairs of biomarkers, for example, APOE+ versus Ab+. When testing pairs of biomarkers, groups were restricted to being positive on only one biomarker (APOE+ and Ab\u00c0 vs. Ab+ and APOE\u00c0, in the above example). Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare models with and without interactions between biomarker and time. The main effect for group was used to compare biomarker groups at baseline. All models were adjusted for age, gender, and years of education. Significance of tests was reported using twosided P-values.\nThe association between biomarker groups and missing data was modeled using generalized mixed-effects regression with a binomial indicator for a missing visit. Separate estimates for each biomarker group were tested to evaluate whether biomarker positivity was associated with increased odds of missing data.\nWe also evaluated the ability of the biomarker groups to improve in each cognitive outcome over the initial year (or 6 months for Digit Symbol Substitution) of testing. Biomarker groups were considered to improve if they demonstrated a statistically significant positive slope from baseline through month 12.\nHypothesis tests for improvement over 1 year and comparisons among different types of biomarker positivity were adjusted for multiplicity using a Hochberg correction. 36 Because of the substantial evidence in the literature demonstrating the deleterious associations between the biomarkers in this study and cognition, we did not correct for multiplicity when testing for differences between biomarker-positive versus negative, for example, APOE+ versus APOE\u00c0. Consistent with this literature, all biomarkerpositive groups in this study declined more than their negative counterparts, making results unlikely due to type I error.\nFinally, we compared the power to detect a hypothetical drug effect in a clinical trial scenario for each combination of biomarker and cognitive outcome. Using the estimates of change from baseline to 3, 4, 5, and 6 years for the biomarker groups and the estimates of the variance of the residual error, subject-specific intercepts and slopes, and the correlation between the intercepts and slopes, we estimated the power to detect a 25% decrease in the difference between the change in the biomarkerpositive group and the biomarker-negative group. Sampling from the above estimates and assuming 750 subjects per arm, we simulated 500 longitudinal clinical trials for each biomarker/outcome combination. Power was estimated as the proportion of significant two-sided P-values for the drug effect, using a mixed-model repeated-measures design. 37 "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohort characteristics", "text": "Four-hundred and twelve participants from either ADNI-1 or ADNI-2 who were enrolled into cognitively normal cohorts were included in the analysis.

See Table S2 for exact sample sizes for all groups over time.\nThere were strong nonlinear trajectories over the 7 years of follow up in all measures of cognition ( Fig. 1) .

The global test for any difference over time among the multiple pathology groups was significant for dAVLT, composite #1 and #2, and marginally significant for ADAS11 and Trails B, with biomarker-positive groups declining faster. The significance of the global test was driven mostly by differences between the biomarker-positive groups (1, 2, and 3+) compared with the biomarkernegative group (0). Although steeper decline was seen in the 3+ group compared with the other biomarker-positive groups, these differences were not significant after multiple comparison adjustment (Fig. 3) .

Greater than 80% power was reached when using composite #1 or #2 when including only participants from the 3+ biomarker group, in trials with at least 4 years of follow up.

However, with only 24 APOE+/hippocampus+ participants, these results should be interpreted with caution."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main findings of this analysis are (1) forming a cognitive composite comprised of measures of delayed memory recall, executive function, and the ADAS11 scale, results in a more sensitive measure of longitudinal decline, thereby providing substantial gains in power when compared with any of the three components alone, (2) increases of 15-20% in power to detect a drug effect can be made by recruiting participants with multiple pathologies at screening, (3) a population with little cognitive impairment can improve on Logical Memory II and Digit Symbol Substitution to the extent where significant positive initial trajectories are observed, and (4) significant decreases in executive function and global cognition at baseline associated with Ab 42 , and also a p-tau associated reduction in processing speed, were observable in this population.\nWhereas the individual cognitive measures were significantly associated with longitudinal decline in two or at most three of the five individual pathology groups, composite #2 was strongly associated with all five groups, and composite #1 was significantly associated with four and marginally associated with the fifth. Measuring decline with either derived composite resulted in a consistent increase in power and was more robust to pathology-type, demonstrating that the earliest cognitive changes occur across multiple domains, not only delayed memory recall. Power suitable for a phase III clinical trial was only reached when restricting inclusion to participants positive for 3+ biomarkers, when using a derived cognitive composite, for at least a 4-year trial. Although the 3+ biomarker group consistently showed the most cognitive decline (Fig. 3) , multiple comparison correction and smaller sample sizes in the multiple biomarker groups militated against statistical significance. However, a substantial increase in power resulted when simulating with sample sizes common in phase III trials, using estimates of decline from the multiple biomarker groups. The majority of participants in the 3+ biomarker group were positive for both Ab and tau biomarkers. This is consistent with the NIA-AA criteria for preclinical AD, which proposes that the combination of biomarker positivity for Ab and neuronal injury in cognitively healthy people indicates that subjects are closer to cognitive impairment than subjects with isolated Ab positivity, 38, 39 or isolated signs of neuronal injury. 40 When considering APOE4+/hippocampus+ participants, 4-year trial simulations resulted in nearly 90% power. Of the 24 APOE+ participants with small hippocampi, CSF data were available for eight. All eight participants were Ab+ and four were also tau/ptau-positive. It is possible that APOE+ participants who also show some evidence of hippocampal atrophy are more likely to harbor Ab and tau pathology, although this analysis was based on a small sample size.\nThe two cognitive composites, differing only in type of delayed memory recall component, Logical Memory II versus dAVLT, demonstrated comparable levels of power in participants with multiple biomarker positivity. However, the power seemed to derive from different sources. Logical Memory II was consistently more closely associated with Ab, whereas dAVLT was more associated with APOE-e4, t-tau, and p-tau, and did not have a significant association with Ab. The associations between Logical Memory II and the different biomarker groups derived from the biomarker-negative groups improving and the biomarker-positive groups remaining flat or declining slightly. These associations contrast with dAVLT, for which there was little improvement in the biomarkernegative groups and steeper decline in the biomarkerpositive groups. Defining power based on a 25% difference between biomarker-positive and negative groups, rather than on a 25% percent slowing of the change in the positive group, had a considerable effect on the power of Logical Memory II given the minimal decline, even in biomarker-positive groups. Although the two delayed memory scales behaved similarly when combined in a composite in participants positive for multiple biomarkers, the differences should be carefully considered in a trial setting, depending on the inclusion criteria and target of the drug. A trial of an anti-Ab therapy may benefit from using Logical Memory II rather than delayed AVLT, given the difference in the strength of association observed here, although delayed AVLT should be considered when evaluating the association between APOE or tau pathology and delayed memory.\nThe ADAS11, a composite itself, captured the most decline among the individual cognitive scales with 76% power in a 4-year trial with participants positive for multiple biomarkers. Including a measure of delayed memory and executive function to form composite #2 resulted in a 9% increase in power for a 4-year trial over ADAS11 alone. Trails B, not powerful alone, did result in one of the steepest declines for participants with small hippocampi (Fig. 2) , and was also the only individual cognitive test to separate Ab+ from Ab\u00c0 at baseline. It is surprising that Ab-positivity was significantly associated with executive function at baseline and not with delayed memory, although it remains unclear how early memory impairment relates to executive function with respect to the accumulation of Ab. Trails B, a measure of executive function, associated with both low CSF Ab and small baseline hippocampal volume may provide a meaningful increase in power when assessed in conjunction with ADAS11.\nSignificant improvement, possibly due to prior exposure, was seen in Logical Memory II and Digit Symbol Substitution. Logical Memory II was not administered at month 6, which may have countered further improvement. One limitation of Logical Memory II in ADNI is the administration of the same version of the test at each time point. Using multiple versions of this type of test would be critical if the effect of practice were a concern. However, in a clinically normal population, the successful effect of a drug may be to restore the ability to improve over time, as opposed to slowing decline, on an assessment like Logical Memory II.\nThere were several significant pathology-related differences in cognition at baseline, none of which was a measure of delayed memory recall alone, as might be expected. Trails B and Digit Symbol substitution, measures of executive function and processing speed, were associated with Ab and p-tau, respectively, suggesting that the earliest changes caused by AD pathology may not be purely memory related. The reduction in Digit Symbol Substitution scores related to p-tau-positivity provides evidence that although tau pathology is considered a driver of late-stage cognitive decline, it is also associated with subtle impairment in what is considered a cognitively intact population. This suggests a need to evaluate the effect of an anti-Ab treatment on tau pathology, even in the earliest stages of disease.\nThe cognitive composite Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC), 26 developed for the A4 study incorporates the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Digit Symbol Substitution, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and the Delayed Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa subtest. With this composite, 80-90% power was estimated for a 3-year trial of 500 Ab+ participants/arm. This is a smaller sample size and trial duration compared with our estimates, however, this can in part be explained by the steeper decline of Ab+ participants (with Ab measured by PET, compared to CSF in this study) and APOE-e4 carriers observed in two of three of their pilot studies The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of aging (AIBL) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Prevention Instrument study (ADCS-PI), whereas in the third study (ADNI), a drug effect of greater than 40% at 2 years was required to reach 80% power, versus the more conservative 25% treatment effect assumed in this analysis. These differences in power may be explained largely by methodological differences, including recent findings that CSF Ab-positivity may be associated with earlier-stage changes compared with PET Ab-postivity. 41 The ADNI cohort is also more educated compared with the other cohorts and may have more cognitive reserve. This could, in part, explain the association between smaller hippocampi and more education at baseline observed in this study. With few studies of cognitive composites, the magnitude of decline expected from a cognitively intact population remains uncertain.\nThis study has several limitations. Sample sizes available for APOE and hippocampal volumes were nearly twice that of CSF biomarkers at baseline, making comparisons of hypothesis tests from separate analyses difficult. Also, while CSF Ab 42 has been shown to correlate well with direct measures of Ab deposition such as PET imaging and autopsy, 42, 43 it is possible that CSF t-tau and p-tau do not correlate as closely with tau pathology in the brains of healthy elders. 44 Another limitation is the mixture of MRI methods (1.5 T vs. 3 T) from the two phases of ADNI. The choice of cognitive measures included in the composites was based on a literature review rather than taking a data-driven approach. These choices were an attempt to represent standard tests of the individual domains, although several other scales could have been used from the extensive battery of cognitive tests available in ADNI. We also did not incorporate attrition into our sample size estimates. Our primary goal of identifying the most powerful endpoint/biomarker combinations will not be affected by this omission. However, the required sample size will increase with increasing dropout rates.\nIn conclusion, recruiting and treating participants with multiple biomarker positivity, especially both Ab and tau pathologies, may increase the power in trials of a presymptomatic population. This could be especially important when evaluating a treatment with the potential to slow the accumulation of both Ab and tau, which may be crucial to achieving clinical effects, given the strong correlations between tau pathology and clinical symptoms. Identifying a truly optimal biomarker/endpoint combination will depend on the mechanism of the drug and its capacity to affect the relationship between the target biomarkers and cognition. However, requiring positivity for multiple biomarkers at screening quickly limits the number of eligible participants, highlighting the tradeoff between recruiting from a large pool of lower-risk participants versus a small pool of higher-risk participants. The cost of measuring additional biomarkers at screening is another considerable hurdle and it remains unknown whether these costs will be necessary to identify the cohort required for a successful trial. Also, if the effect of treatment is greater in milder subjects, selecting on the basis of additional biomarkers may actually reduce power. Finally, careful inclusion of both delayed memory recall and nonmemory measures should be considered when selecting a primary cognitive endpoint. sector contributions are facilitated by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (www.fnih.org).
