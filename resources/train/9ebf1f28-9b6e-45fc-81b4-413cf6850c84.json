For\ngenome sequences containing these Mpro variants, full genome\nalignments were performed using MUSCLE,32 and neighbor-joining trees\nwere generated using MEGA X.33 Overall, the variation in SARS-CoV-2\nsequences observed so far is relatively low, with mutation hotspots not evenly distributed\nthroughout the genome, but localized to specific sequence regions.61\nBecause Mpro is critical for viral replication, mutations that\nhave a large deleterious effect on virus replication are unlikely to be observed in\nclinical isolates; all Mpro variants investigated here are\ntherefore assumed to be enzymatically competent. In general, codon usage and amino acid\nfrequency in viruses of eukaryotes are essentially identical to those of their eukaryotic\nhosts, reflecting the viruses\u2019 use of the host translation machinery.62\nThe known mutations in Mpro are summarized in Figure 1. The tree was generated based on overall\ngenome similarity; however, only sequences containing at least one nonsynonymous mutation\nin Mpro were included in the analysis, along with the WT human\nsequence and two nonhuman reference sequences. The accession numbers and geographical\nsources are listed in Table S1. The solid arcs around the outside of the diagram indicate\nMpro mutations; color coding corresponds to the\ngeographical source. Several mutations appear to have arisen more than once in the\nvirus\u2019s evolutionary history so far. Notably, K90R variants appear in multiple\ndistantly related subtrees; five of these unique evolutionary events can be verified in\nNextstrain\u2019s SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree.63 Further, L89F,\nP108S, and N274D arise at least twice in both trees.\nThese phylogenetic comparisons appear to support a multiple event hypothesis but are\nsubject to errors resulting from the sparsity of testing. The repeated occurrence of the\nsame mutation in seemingly unrelated subtrees may be due to missing data that would show\ntheir evolutionary connectedness. The average branch length of Figure\n1, which shows only topology, is 1.432161 \u00d7\n10\u20134 base substitutions per site (including those from the bat3 and pangolin65); 32.2% of the 1028 branches have, to ten\nsignificant figures, 0 base substitutions per site. For a genome of roughly 30 000\nbase pairs, this amounts to an average of only 4 substitutions per branch. All of these\nunique mutants therefore effectively belong to the same strain, making them difficult to\nplace in an evolutionary context. For more diverged mutants, unfortunately placed\nambiguous nucleotides30 could push them from one subtree to another.\nWith the exception of five double variants, the sequences in Figure 1 arise from single point mutations. Whether and how\nMpro mutations have affected viral fitness is not yet\nknown, but at least three mutants have remained in the population long enough to\naccumulate another mutation: L220F to A191V/L220F, G15S to G15S/D48E and G15S/V35L, and\nK90R to V77A/K90R. It is worth noting, that although a single variant A191V exists, the\nA191V/L220F double variant likely stemmed from an L220F ancestor due to its shared lineage\nwith L220F single variants. A fifth double variant, A193T/R279C, was found but did not\nstem from any single mutation in our data set; its origins remain unclear.\nAlthough a mutation\u2019s prevalence and evolution in a population may be interpreted\nas a sign of robust viral function, the opposite does not necessarily indicate reduced\ninfectivity. Testing rates, social behavior, and time of first infection in each region\nare all factors that contribute to the spread of the disease and the availability of\nsequencing data. For instance, a large number of K90R mutants were collected in Iceland,\nwhere the number of tests per 1000 people is nearly twice as many as the next leading\ncountry\u2019s and more than seven times as many as the United States\u2019 (Iceland,\n141.75; USA, 18.21, as of April 29, 2020).66 Consequently, further\ninvestigation is needed to determine whether Mpro mutations\naffect viral fitness on a global scale. As such, without greater divergence and more\nsequences, it is difficult to tell if the presence of an Mpro\nmutation in unrelated subtrees is evidence of multiple evolutionary events, or an artifact\nof sparse testing. Despite these caveats, it is clear that these 78 variants are\nfunctional enough to infect people within their local populations. In the structural\nanalyses that follow, we focus on the differences in protein properties of the clinically\nobserved Mpro variants relative to WT.\nBecause only sequences harboring Mpro mutations were retained\nfor analysis, certain geographical areas appear to be underrepresented. It is likely that\nthe strains that had spread to underrepresented regions prior to our data collection\nsimply did not have Mpro mutations. Different regions tend to\nbe dominated by different mutants, a feature that might be explained by the timing at\nwhich these mutations arose or arrived. For instance, 83 of the 100\nMpro mutants from Iceland were K90R, and most stemmed from\na single shared ancestor (see Supporting Information). Further, it is likely that heterogeneity in\nsequencing rates have resulted in a less-than-complete data set. As of April 29th, the\nonly North American, South American, and African Mpro mutants\nreported in the GISAID database that passed our filtering parameters were from Costa Rica\nand the USA, Argentina and Brazil, and the DRC respectively. This does not necessarily\nindicate a lack of Mpro mutations in other subregions and may\ninstead reflect differences in sequencing rates.\nIt is worth noting that some nodes in expanded Figure 1 (see Supporting Information) exhibit bootstrap values less than 10 (i.e., their\nbranch relationships were shown in fewer than 10% of replicates). The majority of these\nextremely low values can be found on large subtrees that share an\nMpro mutation, like D248E or K90R, many of which likely\nspread from a common source. Their branches can often be interchanged with no reduction in\naccuracy due to high sequence identity. Low bootstrap values here primarily reflect\ngenotype similarity within subtrees rather than low accuracy. This is a known property of\nthe Felsenstein procedure,35 which bootstraps loci instead of\nsequences; low bootstrap values indicate groupings that are sensitively dependent upon\ndifferences in small numbers of loci but do not necessarily reflect uncertainty due to\nsequence sampling."}, {"section_title": "Mpro Mutations to Date Suggest Selection for Larger, More\nMassive, and More Hydrophobic Residues ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "To reveal the global pattern of substitutions, we visualize mutations in\nMpro independent of sequence position or location in the\nthree-dimensional structure, by a network where the nodes, or vertices, are amino acid\ntypes and the edges (represented by arrows pointing in the direction of substitution) are\ndirectional indicators of how often one amino acid was observed to substitute for another\n(Figure 2). The weights of the edges indicate\nthe frequency of the mutation across known Mpro variants,\nwhile node color reflects residue hydrophobicity on the scale of Kyte and\nDoolittle.67 The most obvious trend observed in the pattern of\nmutation so far is the preferential substitution of larger, more hydrophobic amino acids\nin place of smaller, less hydrophobic ones. The pattern is consistent with increased\nincidence of amino acid types that are more likely to be present in folded domains rather\nthan those found more often in less-structured linker regions.68\nIn particular, it is notable that alanine has very few incoming ties and a large number\nof outgoing ties, mostly to valine, which has a larger and more hydrophobic side chain.\nAlanine is at the same time one of the most common amino acids and one of those with the\nmost variable prevalence in the human genome.69 Similarly, observed\nties to isoleucine are mostly incoming from smaller residues; leucine likewise has more\nincoming than outgoing ties, with the bulk of its outgoing ties going to phenylalanine,\nwhich is also large and hydrophobic. However, aromatic residues per se do not appear to be\nselected. For example, tyrosine has mostly outgoing ties. Also notable are the selection\naway from the secondary structure breakers proline and glycine, both of which have only\noutgoing ties, and the propensity for lysine to be replaced by arginine even though both\nside chains are positively charged. Arginine is both larger and capable of making more and\nstronger hydrogen bonds, as well as cation-\u03c0 interactions not available to lysine,\nleading to its known overrepresentation in interdomain and intermonomer\ninterfaces.70\u221273\nThe mean differences in side chain properties for observed\nMpro mutations are summarized in Table\n1. As observed in the network representation (Figure 2), on average, the mutated residues are larger and more\nhydrophobic than the ones they replace. Although substituted residues are on average\nlarger and more massive, we do not see strong evidence favoring bulky residues over more\ncompact ones, independent of mass: residue bulk (measured as volume/mass) for substituted\nresidues did not differ significantly from WT (mean difference = 0.02\n\u00c53/Da, t = 1.87, p = 0.0650). The\nvariant sequences are not significantly different from WT in charge or aromatic\ncontent."}, {"section_title": "Mpro Mutations Occur Throughout the Protein ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "In order to provide context for the discussion of conformational changes and the\nlocations of mutation sites, a ribbon diagram of the SARS-CoV-2\nMpro monomer is shown in Figure 3A. The three domains, the active site residues, and other\nstructural features are labeled. The dimer is shown in Figure 3B; the dashed box shows the approximate location of the interchain\nsalt bridge shown in Figure 3C. In SARS-CoV-1\nMpro, this salt bridge between Arg4 of Chain A and Glu290\nof Chain B is an important component of the dimer interface,74 and\nsubstitution of either or both of these residues with alanine resulted in shifting the\nequilibrium from dimer to monomer, although dimerization was not abolished\ncompletely.14 Panels D and E show two different views of the dimer\ninterface, with key residues labeled. In addition to important interfacial residues, we\nalso highlight key residues near the oxyanion hole, a structural feature found in many\nserine and cysteine proteases that stabilizes negatively charged, tetrahedral transition\nstates.75\nIn SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, several interactions at or near the dimer\ninterface play a role in keeping the oxyanion hole in the active conformation. An\nintrachain hydrogen bond between the side chain NH2 of Arg298 and the backbone\ncarbonyl of Met6 appears to help hold the N-terminus (also called the N-finger) in place\nto make the appropriate contacts with the other chain.76 In the S1\nspecificity pocket, a ring-stacking interaction between the side chains of His163 and\nPhe140 is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds comprising residues from both\nmonomers. Hydrogen bonding interactions between Glu166 and Ser139 of Chain A with the\nN-terminus of Chain B (Ser1) are also important for stabilizing the dimer interface, along\nwith interactions between the Ser10 residues of both chains. Mutating the adjacent Gly11\nto Ala completely abolishes dimerization due to a dramatic conformational change to the\nN-finger that causes disruption of the interface.21 Although the\nmutational studies discussed here were performed using SARS-CoV-1\nMpro, many of the key residues are also found in\nSARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and we hypothesize that they play similar\nroles.\nFigure 4A shows the\nMpro dimer with mutation sites indicated by spheres. The\nmutations observed so far are relatively evenly distributed throughout the protein.\nNotably, mutations are tolerated close to the active site residues, near the oxyanion\nhole, and at the termini, both of which are involved in modulating the dimer\nconformation.17 Two different views of the dimer interface are shown\nin Figure 4B, with interfacial residues shown as\nspace-filling models and with mutated residues highlighted in light blue (Chain A) or dark\nblue (Chain B). Despite the importance of the dimer interface, several mutations are\nobserved in this region: M6L, A7V, A116V, S121L, C300S, S301L, and G302C. Particularly\nnotable are M6L and A7V, which are part of the N-finger that participates in interactions\nwith the C-terminal domain of the second monomer. In both cases, the hydrophobic character\nof the residue is preserved, with a slight increase in the size of the residue. With the\nexception of A116V, the other mutations represent qualitative changes in side chain\nproperties. These changes in chemical properties are apparently well tolerated, as all of\nthese mutations were found in clinical isolates."}, {"section_title": "Molecular Modeling Suggests Regionally Specific Differences in\nMpro Variant Structure ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "For WT Mpro and each variant, molecular models of the monomer\nand dimer structures were constructed using MODELLER 9.23,37 based on\nPDB structure 6Y2E,36 followed by annealing, correction of protonation states, and all-atom\nmolecular dynamics simulation in explicit solvent (see Materials and\nMethods). Examples of representative models are shown in Figure S2, intramolecular contacts for residue 225 in WT and the T225I\nvariant are shown in Figure S3 and listed in Table S2, and selected double mutants are shown in Figure S4. The positions of all observed K to R and R to C mutations, which\nare commonly observed in interfaces, are shown in Figure S5. In Mpro, two such mutations, K236R\nand R279C, are located in domain III, near the dimer interface. The positions of all\nmutated residues are mapped onto the WT structure in Figure S6, with color coding indicating the change (if any) in side chain\nchemical properties. We do not observe gross differences in structure or dynamics across\nvariants, as expected given that all variants were found in clinical isolates and are\ntherefore necessarily functional; mutations leading to radically altered or misfolded\nstructures would likely be strongly selected against. However, analysis of MD trajectories\ndoes suggest more subtle differences across variants, providing insight into\nfunction-preserving changes.\nTo assess the overall degree to which local structure is conserved across\nMpro variants, we compute the cross-variant variance in\naverage \u03d5,\u03c8 backbone torsion angles by residue within free monomers. In order\nto control for overall flexibility, we normalize this by the estimated variance in torsion\nangles within each trajectory. For arbitrary angle \u03b1i at\nresidue i, this leads to the local variation\nindexwhere\n\u03b1ij is the vector of angles of type\n\u03b1i over the trajectory of variant j\nwith corresponding angular mean ,  is the vector of such means across variants, VarB is the\n\u201cbetween variant\u201d angular variance in mean angles, and VarW is\nthe \u201cwithin variant\u201d angular variance in\n\u03b1ij. Intuitively, high values of\nv(\u03b1i) indicate relatively large\nbetween-variant variation in \u03b1i relative to angular\nvariation seen within the trajectories themselves. For\nv(\u03d5i) and\nv(\u03c8i), such values correspond to\nsystematic changes in local conformation associated with Mpro\nmutations. By turns, low values of\nv(\u03d5i) and\nv(\u03c8i) indicate residues whose local\nstructure does not vary meaningfully across variants. It should be noted that such regions\ncan be either flexible or rigid.\nFigure 5 shows the mean local variation indices\nfor \u03d5,\u03c8 by the residue for the 79 Mpro variants,\nindicated by color on the structure of Mpro WT. (Separate\nvalues for \u03d5 and \u03c8 are shown in Figure S7.) It is immediately noteworthy that, with the minor exception of\ntwo small loop regions around N277 and F223 (respectively), Domain III shows little\nsystematic variation across variants. The \u03b2-sheet-rich structure around the active\nsite is also relatively well-conserved. By contrast, we see relatively high levels of\nbetween-variant difference in the interdomain region involving the termini (residues G2-A7\nand S301\u2013F305) and the double loop \u201cactive site gateway\u201d region\ninvolving (respectively) L50-Y54 and D187-A191. The former is potentially significant in\ninfluencing large-scale flexibility (possibly relevant to dimerization), whereas the\nlatter is of obvious relevance to substrate processing and specificity. This motivates a\nmore detailed examination of variation in the active site, to which we return below.\nThe relatively high levels of conformational variation in the interdomain regions suggest\nfunctionally relevant differences in global cohesion across variants. To assess this, we\nemploy protein structure networks (PSNs), which are well-suited for assessing the\nlooseness or cohesiveness of contacts among chemical groups.\nFor all Mpro variants, moiety-level PSNs were constructed for\neach frame within each variant trajectory, using the definitions found in ref (50) (Figure S1) The assessment\nof global cohesion was performed by computing the mean degree k-core\nnumber for all moieties in each structure; to allow comparison of global cohesion within\ndomains, we also compute mean core numbers within each of the three domains. The mean core\nnumber can be considered an index of structural cohesion, with higher values indicating\ngreater numbers of redundant contacts among chemical groups.55 To\naccount for within-trajectory autocorrelation in comparing mean core numbers,\nautocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors\nwere employed.\nFigure 6 shows global and domain-specific\ncohesion levels (i.e., mean core numbers) for all variant monomers, sorted in descending\norder of mean cohesion. Means and standard errors for each variant can be found in\nTable S3. As suggested from the torsion angle analysis, cohesion differs\nsignificantly among variants, both globally and within domains. On average, the majority\nof variants are estimated to be less cohesively structured than WT, with the exception of\nDomain III (in which WT does not differ significantly from the mean). It is possible that\nthese differences indicate selection for more globally flexible structures (again, with\nthe exception of Domain III). Whether or not this is the case, however, it appears clear\nthat less cohesive structures are not strongly selected against. Such flexibility may\naffect dimerization kinetics, which is relevant to protease function and the development\nof robust dimerization inhibitors.\nWhile cohesion and flexibility within Mpro monomers may\nprovide clues to how mutations may impact dimerization, examination of the interfacial\nregion within Mpro dimers suggests indications of the impact\nof mutations on the behavior and stability of the dimers themselves. Figure 7A shows mean cohesion scores (i.e., mean degree\nk-core numbers) for interfacial moieties in dimer trajectories for all\nMpro variants, together with autocorrelation-corrected 95%\nbootstrap confidence intervals; values are also provided in Table S4. (We here define a moiety to be interfacial if it is adjacent to at\nleast one chemical group in the opposite chain (Figure 7C). This is assessed on a frame-by-frame basis, allowing us to account for\nchanges in contact patterns within trajectories.) Although there is some variation in\ninterfacial cohesion, relatively few trajectories differ significantly from the mean\ncohesion level, and very few are two standard errors away from wild-type (12 being more\ncohesive and 1 being less cohesive). This is consistent with the hypothesis that\ninterfacial cohesion is strongly conserved in Mpro, suggesting\nthat a looser or more dynamic dimer core may impede function. (The fact that, of those\nvariants differing significantly from WT, all but one show greater cohesion is also\nconsistent with this determination, albeit not determinative.)\nFor a different look at interaction across the interfacial region, we also consider the\ntotal number of contacts between the A and B chains over time (the tie volume across the\ndimer interface, e.g., the interfacial ties in Figure 7D). Figure 7B shows mean dimer\ninterface tie volumes and associated confidence intervals for the\nMpro variants, with variants sorted in the order of the\nmean core number to facilitate comparison (panel A). Whereas the mean core number provides\na measurement of overall structural cohesion at the interface (including both interactions\nwithin and between chains), the tie volume directly measures the number of cross-chain\ncontacts and is thus a potential proxy for interaction strength. As with cohesion, tie\nvolume is fairly well-conserved, and few trajectories show significant deviation from\nwild-type (with seven trajectories having higher tie volume than WT, and two lower).\nInterestingly, interfacial tie volume is not strongly related to interfacial cohesion,\nindicating that the tightness or looseness of the structure around the interface is not\nsimply a function of the raw number of interfacial contacts. Both, however, suggest a\nrelatively high level of conservation in interfacial structure in the\nMpro dimer across variants observed to date. While the\nfirst version of this work, which addressed moiety-level networks of\nMpro monomers77 was under review, a\npreprint78 was released, showing similar results using residue-level\nnetwork analysis on MD trajectories of Mpro dimers, and\nsubsequently published.79 Although different methodology is used, the\nconclusions are in broad agreement, with significant flexibility observed in the N-finger\nregion that is important for dimerization, as well as the loops near the active site. The\nauthors also describe key low-frequency motions of the dimer that may be impacted by\nmutation and identify a pocket near the dimer interface that could serve as a potential\ntarget for allosteric inhibitors, underscoring the importance of mutational analysis as a\npart of effective inhibitor design. Moiety-level network analysis of\nMpro dimers was then added to this paper in response to\nreviewers\u2019 comments, again finding substantial agreement with the residue-level\nresults.78"}, {"section_title": "Active Site Networks Suggest Potential Activity Differences across\nMpro Variants ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "The observation of structural variation in loop regions associated with the binding\npocket motivates closer examination of variation in the Mpro\nactive site. To this end, subgraphs of the full protein structure networks comprising\nmoieties belonging to the active site residues and their neighbors were constructed to\nproduce active site networks (ASNs)52 for all conformations. A\nprotein\u2019s ASN describes physical interactions among active site moieties and other\ngroups that are immediately adjacent in the 3D structure, irrespective of their positions\nin the amino acid sequence. Per ref (52), we\ncompute for each ASN a constraint score, a general measure of active site flexibility that\nis associated with substrate specificity. The constraint score is the first principal\ncomponent of a set of several network metrics (see Materials and\nMethods), with higher values indicating a greater tendency for the catalytic\nresidues to be constrained by cohesive contacts with other residues, and lower values\nindicating fewer such constraints. Examples of ASNs corresponding to the maximum, minimum,\nand mean observed constraint values over all observed Mpro\nmonomer conformations are shown in Figure 8. For\nthe dimer structures, we repeat this process for the active site in each chain, yielding\ntwo constraint values per variant; these scores, along with corresponding maximum, mean,\nand minimum constraint ASNs, are shown in Figure 9. Values for both monomers and dimers are also provided in Tables S5 and S6.\nExamination of the mean constraint scores for each variant trajectory suggests potential\nactivity differences across Mpro variants. Figure 8A shows mean constraint scores for each variant\nmonomer, with autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals. Of the\n79 trajectories examined, 22 (28%) were significantly below the grand mean (dotted\nvertical line) and 28 (35%) were significantly above it; similarly, when directly compared\nto WT, 12 variants were observed to be significantly less constrained, while 17 were\nsignificantly more constrained (i.e., bootstrap t-scores less than\n\u22122 or greater than 2, respectively). A total of 43 out of 79\nMpro sequences (55%) showed nominally higher levels of\nmean constraint than WT (discounting significance), suggesting a lack of uniform selection\npressure for active sites that are more or less constrained than WT (the fraction greater\ndoes not differ significantly from random deviation, p = 0.16, exact\nbinomial test). Thus, although we do not see evidence here of systematic selection for net\nchanges in active site constraint in the monomeric state, we do see evidence that variants\ndiffer from each other and from WT in their average active site properties. Turning to the\ndimer trajectories, Figure 9A shows mean\nconstraint scores for A and B chain active sites, with autocorrelation-corrected\nparametric bootstrap confidence intervals for each variant. Consistent with the hypothesis\nthat dimerization can result in asymmetric modification of active site\nconformations,20 we frequently observe large differences in the\nactive site constraint between chains within the same variant; indeed, the\nroot-mean-square difference in mean constraints within the variant is significantly larger\nthan would be expected from the variation across sites alone (p = 0.048,\npermutation test), being approximately 1.65 times the standard deviation in mean\nconstraint across variants. That said, such differentiation is not always present, with\nmany trajectories (including WT) showing similar levels of constraint for both active\nsites, and it may not be necessary for function. (We observe that symmetric active site\nconformations were obtained in the WT dimer structure of Zhang et al.,36 for instance.) Unlike the monomeric case, we see a greater trend here toward reduction\nin dimer active constraint scores versus WT, with 76% of sequences showing constraint\nlevels lower than WT (p < 0.0001, exact binomial test). It is possible\nthat this reflects a higher level of selection for looser active sites in the dimeric\nstate per se. These differences should be considered when designing inhibitors that are\ntolerant of mutational change in Mpro over time. In\nparticular, it is clear that the population of extant Mpro\nvariants already possesses some phenotypic diversity in active site flexibility,\npotentially facilitating its ability to evolve around some types of inhibitors. The\nability of Mpro dimers to sustain active\nsites with different levels of flexibility may also complicate inhibitor design and\nsuggests the importance of inhibitors that are robust to variation in active site\nconstraint."}, {"section_title": "Overall Variation in Mpro Active Site\nConformations Is Related to Cys/His Contact ::: Results and Discussion", "text": "Given the diversity of active site conformations across monomeric/dimeric states,\nvariants, and chains, it is useful to seek specific features that can be used to\ncharacterize those conformations. To examine this, we employ a kernel principal component\nanalysis (kPCA) of a stratified sample of ASNs from the set of monomer and dimer\ntrajectories, taking 25 evenly spaced frames from each trajectory (including both A and B\nASNs in the dimeric case) for a total of 5925 conformations from the entire data set. The\nfeature space for our kernel is the set of all labeled subgraphs on the set of potential\nASNs, allowing us to detect specific patterns of contacts among moieties that characterize\nsubpopulations of conformations. As shown in Figure 10, the combined set of active site conformations falls into two fairly distinct\nclusters obliquely aligned with the first two principal components. These respective\nclusters correspond to a single feature, specifically the presence or absence of at least\none contact between the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues; the cluster aligned\nwith the first principal component consists of \u201copen\u201d conformations lacking\nsuch a contact, while the cluster aligned with the second principal component consists of\n\u201cclosed\u201d conformations in which the contact is present.\nBoth clusters have an ellipsoidal form, with distance along the ellipsoids away from the\norigin corresponding to the average number of contacts per chemical group (mean degree).\nThe cluster ellipsoids are also slightly oblique to one another, an orientation that\narises from their joint respective correlation with the total number of moieties\ninteracting with the active site residues (ASN size); this is shown in Figure 10 via the gradient of the size distribution, indicated\nas contour lines. These three properties (Cys/His contact, mean degree, ASN size) thus\nprovide a parsimonious description of the most important axes of variation in active site\nstructure and may be useful as targets for experimental investigation (e.g., via NMR).\nInterestingly, we observe very little association between conformation and monomer/dimer\nstatus (R2 < 0.6% on the first PC, and no significant\ndifference on the second-highest R2 in the first 10 dimensions\nof 1.4%), indicating that the full range of active site conformations is observed in both\nmonomer and dimer structures and at similar frequencies. Conformation is more strongly\nassociated with the variant, the latter accounting for approximately 14% of the variance\nin the first PC and 7% in the second; adding interaction effects with chain and\nmonomer/dimer status increases this by 30% and 16%, respectively, suggesting that\nMpro mutations tend to affect monomer and\ndimer structures differently. While the mutations observed to date do not radically alter\nactive site conformation (this being a priori unlikely for functional mutations in any\nevent), they do appear to exert a nontrivial influence on the distribution of\nconformational states."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "For clinically relevant variants of Mpro, the observed\nvariation so far is toward larger and more hydrophobic amino acids, leading to reduced\nstructural cohesion on average in the variants relative to wild-type. Although mutations\noccur throughout the protein, the structural effects of those mutations appear to be far\nmore localized, impacting primarily the protein\u2019s interdomain interfaces and several\nkey loop regions near the substrate-binding pocket. These mutations appear to result in\nsystematic variations in both global flexibility and in the extent to which the catalytic\nresidues of the active site are constrained (a factor previously found to be related to\nsubstrate specificity in related systems). Our results suggest that\nMpro may be currently subject to selection for enhanced\nglobal flexibility and that currently circulating Mpro variants\nrepresent a reservoir of phenotypic diversity in active site structure and dynamics that\ncould facilitate an evolutionary response to certain classes of protease inhibitors. These\nfindings are relevant to dimerization kinetics, substrate capture, and the development of\nresistance to inhibitors, as well as our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 more generally.\nOn a more methodological note, these results underscore the potential of comparative\nin silico studies to rapidly probe structural and functional consequences\nof genotypic variation in emerging diseases. Advances in both GPU-enabled hardware and\nmolecular dynamics have made high-volume simulation studies feasible over short time\nhorizons, giving us a powerful tool for selection of experimental targets. At the same time,\ncomparative analysis of large volumes of trajectory data created by such simulation studies\nremains a challenge. Here, we have used both network analytic and machine learning\ntechniques to identify potentially important sources of variation across trajectories.\nAlthough network analytic ideas have been used to study protein structures at least since\n1993,80 systematic use of combined network analytic and MD trajectories\nfor comparative analysis of protein variants is more recent.81\u221284 It is hoped that\napplications such as this one will inspire further development of this promising\napproach."}]
