[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The influence of trade -especially the export behavior -on development has been studied widely. There are always drastically different developing results for industries under globalization. From time to time winners take over new market positions while losers have to exit. Some industries, e.g. computer and kindred manufacturers, had soared during the last couple of decades in 20th century, while other industries simply vanished during the same period. In other words, under the circumstance that trade prospered greatly between different regions in the world, different industries share very little in common when it comes to their growth path. By the term of \"trade\", this paper mainly focuses on the exports. Through exporting to the overseas an industry or a plant has a wider market to operate in, and also more opportunity to access to various advanced production technologies. Therefore, can a sector's exports improve its growth? If yes, is this procedure also influenced by other factors? Looking into the relationship between exports and productivity, we can find a tremendous amount of work demonstrating the positive relationship between them. Traditionally speaking, high productivity is well known as the reason why advanced firms or industries benefit more from international trade; only more profitable and competent firms can afford to export, which is more costly than merely operating domestically. It is well known as a \"self-selection effect\" (Melitz 2003;Bernard et Al. 2004;L\u00f3pez 2004), which has been proven by a large amount of theoretical and empirical evidence. However, this paper focuses on another dimension of the causality between the productivity and the exports: how the exporting behavior affects productivity under an open economy. There are also other studies on this too. For example, learning by exporting (Marin 1992, Ben-David 1993 theory explains how firms grow faster because of their exports; the international trade which the firms participate in would speed their own development. Exporting firms can have more advanced skills accessed via ex-post benefits, especially when these skills are unavailable enough domestically. Such learning process can enhance the firms' innovation and efficiency greatly. So far all the empirical tests based on different samples have shown both positive and negative feedback to this conclusion, indicating that the theory itself is very case-sensitive. For example in Clerides et Al. (1998), the authors use plant-level data from Mexico, Columbia and Morocco yet find no evidence that firms' cost will be affected by previous exporting behaviors. To improve the theory more needs to be considered. However, using information from Indonesia Blalock et Al. (2004) find strong evidence that firms experience a jump in their productivity once they are engaged in exporting. In Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud (2008), a combined conclusion is established; they find that openness increases industry productivity in a level sense, but it has ambiguous effect on its growth rate. Trade liberalization slows down industry growth by raising the expected fixed cost of innovation but not affecting expected benefits."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Instead of seeking a conclusion which is purely for or against the learning-by-exporting (LBE) theory, I will establish my work on a combined evidence, and consider why inconsistent findings exist. This paper is motivated by the empirical evidence that exports do have influence on sectoral productivity, but it is significantly positive only when sectoral R&D funds are high enough. If the R&D funds is low, the correlation between exports and productivity is not significant anymore. Therefore, innovation appears to be an intriguing and important channel for the so-called learningby-exporting (LBE) theory to come into existence. When every sector needs to pay innovation effort to increase its productivity, the innovation effort will play an importance role and vary the impact of export on productivity growth. If the innovation effort is low, then export status only exerts ambiguous influence on productivity and its growth in a neglectable way. However, if the effort is high enough, exports will be able to speed up sectoral development significantly. In studying how the LBE effect is affected by the innovation effort, two estimation steps are proceeded. First, I evaluate the productivity for each industry. Considering the possibility of the potential idiosyncratic productivity shocks, which are contemporaneous with sectoral sectoral exports, a sector's knowledge of its own productivity will cause bias during the estimation of the input coefficients in the production function. Specifically, it will cause upward bias in the estimated coefficients of variable inputs, while inconsistent estimated coefficients of quasi-fixed inputs. This will lead to results that lack precision. To deal with the simultaneity embedded in the choice of production inputs and unobservable productivity shocks, I use the Olley-Pakes (OP) methodology (Olley & Pakes, 1996). Olley and Pakes use a semi-parameter algorithm to solve for the problem of simultaneity and endogeneity. However besides the investment and capital as traditional quasi-fixed inputs, in order to focus on the influence of exports I modify the OP methodology by adding two additional state variables: export share and export growth rate. With these two variables I also control the export behavior from both static and dynamic aspects; thus a more accurate estimation of productivity conditional on exports can be done. Second, I evaluate the effect of LBE. Based on the productivity measured from the modified OP method, I then estimate productivity through a traditional channel which does not concern sectors' export status. By the comparison of these two scenarios of productivity I can know the sectoral productivity gain due to extra consideration of exports, and therefore this LBE effect can be measured by taking the difference between the two scenarios of productivity. This paper looks into the US industry-level data. The reason is obvious: US is a typical developed country with mature market mechanism, and ideal trade circumstance. It fits the paper's crucial assumptions about free market and open economy. Using a panel data of US manufacturing industries, my results show that sectoral productivity rises from increasing exports, and it also rises because of a higher innovation effort. An increase in exports of $10 8 per production worker will significantly raise productivity by as high as 8.22. Also, I use two different variables to indicate sectoral R&D efforts: the ratio of R&D agents and scientists employment against the total domestic employment, and ratio between the company-performed R&D funds and net domestic sales. The results show that once the exports and other variables are controlled, lower R&D input will decrease sectoral productivity (0.05 -0.2 for the R&D employment ratio if it is lower than 0.07, 0.05 -0.08 for the R&D funds rate if it is lower than 0.05). Only the highest level of R&D input can increase it (both around 0.01, if R&D employment ratio is higher than 0.07, and if R&D funds rate is higher than 0.05). Now that we have taken a deep insight into how sectors can learn from exporting, we need to explain how the LBE effects vary because of innovation. Using different R&D levels as the fixed effects, now I have findings that are similar to the previous ones about productivity. Lower R&D input will decrease the LBE effect (0.99 -5.60 for the R&D employment ratio if it is lower than 0.1, 3.55 -4.87 for the R&D funds rate if it is lower than 0.05). Only the highest levels of R&D inputs can increase the LBE effect significantly (3.81 for the R&D employment ratio if it is higher than 0.1, 1.42 for the R&D funds rate if it is lower than 0.05). Following this result, separate regressions across groups of sectors with different ranks of R&D inputs supports the finding. Only among those groups with R&D employment ratio higher than 0.06, or with R&D funds rate higher than 0.05, a significant LBE phenomenon exists; a sector's exports can significantly enhance its productivity. Therefore, the tests along the channel of R&D funds rate are more consistent; they share a common R&D funds rate threshold (5%) above which the LBE hypothesis is significant. There are plenty of research that use the Olley-Pakes methodology and its transformation in the estimation of productivity. For example, in Blalock & Gertler (2004) and Alvarez & L\u00f3pez (2005), using data from Indonesia and Chilean respectively, they estimate plant-level productivity with traditional OP approach, and test its relationship with exporting behavior. Both papers find that exporters have gradually better performance which suggests the existence of learning-byexporting. Furthermore, more sophisticated work can be done. Amiti & Konings (2007) also use Indonesian data to test the influence of trade liberalization on productivity gain. The difference is that their work includes both export and import decision as additional state variables in the OP productivity evaluation. Pavcnik (2000) uses the probability of a plant staying in market to incorporate the problem of exit during the estimation procedure, and Fernandes & Isgut (2004) add firms' dynamic exporting decisions into the calculation. All of these works have made thorough and sophisticated improvement in estimating more consistent productivity. In Levinsohn & Petrin (2000) proves that besides the investment which is used in Olley-Pakes, the intermediate inputs can also solve the simultaneity problem in the correlation between inputs and unobservable productivity shocks. However after the estimation, most of them only end up testing the relationship between productivity gain and exporting behavior or trade liberalization, in order to argue for or against the LBE theory based on their empirical results. Few of them admit the potential ambiguity of LBE effect, and start to wonder why this may happen. This paper's contribution lies in not only to accept both positive and negative evidence for LBE in the consideration, but also start to think why this divarication happens. By using a modified OP methodology which includes a sector's export status into the consideration, I obtain consistent productivity estimation. Furthermore, by evaluating the productivity gain conditional on the exports, I have a new measurement of the LBE effect which has been hardly considered before. According to the estimation each sector has an extra productivity improvement due to its exporting behavior. After the tests of the relationship between the LBE effect and other relevant variables, e.g. R&D inputs, we can answer the question raised previously: how the LBE procedure can be influenced, and why inconsistent conclusions in the existing literature have been found. This paper is organized as the following. Section 1 presents the brief introduction of this paper. Section 2 describes the data source. Section 3 explains the model and estimation methodology. Section 4 presents empirical test results. Section 5 will do sensitivity test to check the robustness of the findings, while section 6 concludes the paper."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "I use three data sets and combine them into a balanced panel. First, the industrial characteristics come from Annual Survey of Manufactures: Statistics for Industry Groups and Industries from 2005 to 2009, which is proceeded by US census bureau. The earlier data cannot be considered as being consistent, since the survey method used to assign industry classifications has been changed; industry-specific estimates after 2004 are not directly comparable with those of previous years. I pick out all the 6-digit NAICS sectors and all their necessary information, e.g. capital expenditure, investment, employment, and so on. In the data, all the costs, benefits, expenditures and value added are measured in $1000. As for the trade information, I use value of exports by 6-digit NAICS provided by US International Trade Statistics. The exports are reported by F.A.S. value basic 1 , while the imports are general imports by customs value basis 2 ; they are also measured in $1000. Descriptive statistics for the entire sample is given in Table 9 in Appendix B."}, {"section_title": "All the relevant R&D information comes from National Science Foundation / Division of Science", "text": "Resources Statistics. Since their data source is only updated till 2008, I now consider the timelagging effect that is brought by the innovation. The influence of R&D cannot be simultaneous with the input; normally, when industries pay more for their R&D department, or hire more scientists, engineers or analysts to make R&D progress, it will always take some time for the actual effects happen, for example manufacturing costs decline, or efficiency increases. Therefore, I allow a oneyear lag for the innovation input. That is, I will look into how sectoral R&D input in 2008 affects its productivity and LBE in 2009, and how its 2007 R&D affects its 2008 performance, and so on. As for the data details, the innovation information in 2008 comes from Business R&D and Innovation Survey, while the information from 2004 to 2007 comes from Survey of Industrial Research and Development."}, {"section_title": "Model and Estimation", "text": "To estimate the sectoral productivity, I use a typical Cobb-Douglas production function: where for sector i at time t, A it is the total factor productivity (TFP), L it is labor, M it is material cost, and K it is capital. Q it is a vector of industrial characteristic measures. Log-linearize (1), we have Hereafter all the lower-case input indicators are the logarithm of the corresponding capital ones, e.g. l it = log L it ."}, {"section_title": "Productivity Estimation", "text": "The estimation is based on Therefore sector specific error term e it is composed of two elements: a sector-specific productivity shock \u03c9 it that is known by the sector but not the econometricians, and a white noise \u03b7 it that is unknown for both the sector and the econometricians. In this paper the former one is the one that matters. According to Olley-Pakes approach the unobserved productivity \u03c9 it follows a 1st order Markov process. Meanwhile, a sector's profit maximization yields an investment decision function I it which depends on capital k it and productivity \u03c9 it . Specifically, The OP methodology includes two steps. First, by inverting the investment function in (5), the unobserved productivity can be explained by investment and capital. Consider the sector's export status variable as additional state variable. Substituting the result back into (3), I can then obtain the consistent estimates of the coefficients of variable inputs, namely \u03b2 l , \u03b2 m and \u03b2 Q . Second, I will separate capital elasticity \u03b2 k from the investment decision. Following Pavcnik (2000), I assume capital at t + 1 is correlated with productivity expectation. Therefore, the expectation of productivity next period E(\u03c9 it+1 ) is a function of current productivity \u03c9 it , which can be substituted by the result from the first step. This means E(\u03c9 it+1 ) can be expressed by investment and capital at time t. Substitute the result back into (3) rewritten at time t + 1. Conditional on the information and elasticities of labor, material and other relevant sector characteristics, consistent estimation of coefficient of capital can be generated. The details of the estimation procedure are in the Appendix A. After all the necessary coefficients are available, the log of the measured productivity is calculated as The results of the estimated input coefficients from the OP methodology are in for fringe benefits, which means an increase of fringe benefits will cause a decrease in the output. However, after the fixed effects are added into consideration, this elasticity turns out to be positive under the OP methodology. Meanwhile, the absolute value of the coefficient on contract work cost is overestimated by both OLS and 2SLS. As for the capital elasticity which is generated during the second step in OP estimation, it is overestimated by both OLS and 2SLS. The productivity therefore can be estimated by (6) based on these information. Under each method I do three different estimates based on different consideration of fixed effects. All of them will be used later for the robustness of the tests. I also do comparisons between different methodology about the estimation of productivity level and growth rate. The details are in  Figure 2 to Figure 4 in Appendix C also depicted the growth trend of different sectors in a more directly way. Furthermore, when calculating the sectoral productivity including fixed effect, 2SLS will generate much volatile results which do not even share the same sign. Also, under both OLS and 2SLS the estimated productivity differs significantly Notes: Table 1 reports all the elasticities of input from the production function. As for the sectoral production characteristic vector Q, I use total fringe benefits (in $10 10 ) as Q1, cost of contract work (in $10 7 ) as Q2, annual payroll (in $10 11 ) as Q3. Regression (1) is just a basic estimation without fixed effect consideration. Regression (2) includes sector fixed effect in the calculation, while regression (3) includes both sector and year fixed effect. across the sectors; even in similar industries, e.g. primary metal products (331) and fabric metal products (332), the difference is very big. This violently changing productivity will cause difficulty in empirical tests, and also inconsistent results. On the other hand, OP methodology, which has removed endogeneity and the problem of idiosyncratic productivity shock during the estimation, generate much more smooth and consistent results. The productivity fluctuates between 2.5 and 3.9 no matter when we compare them across the sectors or between different scenarios of estimates."}, {"section_title": "LBE Effect Estimation", "text": "Based on the estimated productivity yielded above, I will further generate a new estimation for LBE effect for each observed sector. How can we measure the productivity gain contingent on exports? To do this we need to know the productivity with no extra concern of exports. By comparing this scenario of results with the previous one, we can have an idea of how the additional consideration of export status change the productivity, and thus estimate the LBE effect. To calculate productivity without exports as part of the estimation procedure, I use another OP methodology which still includes capital and investment as semi-fixed inputs but not export status variables. I define the TFP resulted this way TFP 1 . Using the difference ratio between this productivity and the previously generated TFP, I measure the LBE effect as: A summary statistics of LBE effect is in Table 2. It shows all the detailed situations in every 3-digit NAICS sector. All the mean values, minimum values and maximum values are positive, suggesting that all the estimated LBE effects are positive. The additional consideration of exports will increase the estimated productivity; it also fits the theory that there will be sectoral productivity gain due to exports. According to the LBE estimation results, I will be able to study how it is influenced by sectoral innovation input."}, {"section_title": "R&D Measures", "text": "Since this paper is about to estimate the role of R&D plays in the LBE process, I also need to find appropriate measures for sectoral R&D. I will use two alternative variables to indicate sectoral innovation input. One is R&D employment ratio, which is the ratio between R&D scientists and engineers employment and domestic employment. The other is company-performed R&D funds ratio, which is the ratio between the company-performed R&D funds 5 and domestic net sales. Therefore I will look into how a sector's productivity, and furthermore its productivity gain because of exports, is going to be affected by its innovation effort from two alternative measures. This provides me with a more robust conclusion."}, {"section_title": "Learning-by-Exporting Estimation Results", "text": "In this section, I will describe the preliminary test results. There are two steps for my estimation: first, how the sectoral productivity is affected by the exports and innovation; to be specific, whether exports can promote productivity and how the result varies due to different innovation input. Next, I will study how the LBE effects is affected by the innovation, and why there are inconsistent empirical evidence about LBE.  Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. The productivity value used here is the one which includes both sector and year fixed effects during estimation. The test results based on productivity estimated from other two methods (one doesn't include fixed effects, the other only includes sector fixed effect) is shown in Table 10 in Appendix B. a : Total export value is measured in $10 11 , employment is measured in $10 3 . * * * Significant at or less than 1%. * * Significant at or less than 5%. * Significant at or less than 10%."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between Productivity and Exports", "text": "The correlation between productivity and exports is specified as: where Export it is export value, X it is a vector of industrial characteristics. \u0398 n is a fixed effect for innovation inputs which belongs to rank n, \u03bb i for sector i, and \u03bd t for year t. The productivity estimation resulted from the OP estimates above with both sector and time fixed effects. In this section I will focus on analyzing the effects of \u03b1 1 and \u0398. The test results of equation 8are presented in Table 3. First I regress productivity only on the export value per production worker (measured in $10 8 ) in order to estimate the influence of sectoral exports on productivity, as a benchmark. Column (i) and (ii) of Table 3 show that both export value can increase sectoral productivity significantly. Specifically, once X it 6 is considered, the elasticity of export value on productivity will rise. An increase in exports value by 10% will increase the productivity by 55.3%; the positive significance is also consistent with the literature. Meanwhile, Larger capital expenditure on computer will increase the productivity, while larger expenditure on machinery will decrease it. Next I add the influence of innovation investment into the study. The fixed effects of different ranks of R&D measures are analyzed. Why do I use fixed effect instead of normal linear regression analysis? To start with, I need to know how different innovation inputs' influences on productivity differ from each other. Furthermore, I need to estimate their different influences on the LBE effect by separating them from each other. Notice that according to the assumption of one-year-lag in the influence of innovation, the emp nit and rdf nit are actually the innovation that was invested in time t \u2212 1 but will take effect in t. I will therefore focus on when the innovation's actual effect happens instead of when the innovation decision is made. In column (iii) and (iv), I include the fixed effect of R&D employment ratio (emp). emp 1it = 1 if 0.015 < emp it < 0.04, = 0 otherwise; emp 2it = 1 if 0.04 < emp it < 0.06, = 0 otherwise; emp 3it = 1 if 0.06 < emp it < 0.07, = 0 otherwise; emp 4it = 1 if emp it > 0.07, = 0 otherwise. When I start to consider emp fixed effects, export value still increases productivity with great significance. In column (iii), as emp increases, the fixed effect also increases while keeps being positive. This means that once export status is controlled, a R&D employment ratio that is located in a higher level will expand sectoral productivity even further. Once X nit is considered the emp fixed effect still monotonically increase, however only the effect of emp 4it -the highest rank of R&D employment ratio -remains being positive. Specifically, if a sector's emp is higher than 0.07 its productivity will be raised by 0.016. If the innovation input is not high enough, the productivity will shrink once the export is controlled; only when a sector employs enough scientists and engineers in their R&D department can their productivity benefit from it. In column (v) and (vi), the fixed effect of company-performed R&D funds ratio (rdf ) is considered instead. rdf 1it = 1 if rdf it < 0.012, = 0 otherwise; rdf 2it = 1 if 0.012 < rdf it < 0.016, = 0 otherwise; rdf 3it = 1 if 0.016 < rdf it < 0.05, = 0 otherwise; rdf 4it = 1 if rdf it > 0.05, = 0 otherwise. Still, higher export liberalization increases productivity with significance. Now no matter before or after the additional industrial characteristic variables are considered, the signs of the fixed effects of R&D funds ratio do not change; only the highest R&D funds ratio rank rdf 4it has positive effect. A rdf higher than 0.05 will increase the productivity by 0.026. This suggests that only if a sector pays for its R&D funds arduously enough can its hard work be repaid to own a higher productivity. Besides, an increase of computer expenditure ratio by 10% can increase productivity by around 4%, while a increase of machinery expenditure ratio decreases it by 1.1% to 1.6%. Both results are significant. As for the analysis based on the productivity scenarios using two other OP methods, the details are in Table 10 in Appendix B. From the table, we can tell that if year or sector fixed effects are not included during productivity estimation, the learning-by-exporting process doesn't sustain anymore, since the export value per worker does not have significant correlation with the productivity. Therefore, whether the LBE hypothesis can be observed in the reality depends on both specific dataset as well as the productivity estimation methodology."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between LBE and Innovation", "text": "So far we have seen the positive influence of sectoral exports on productivity, and a higher R&D inputs can enhance the productivity even further by providing a hospitable environment for it to grow more. However, we still have not reached the conclusion that is convincing enough to explain why there exist different LBE results because of innovation. According to the empirical tests above, we can only know that both sectoral exports and R&D effort can increase the productivity, but these two channels cannot be combined yet; I still need to know how the productivity gain conditional on the exports is influenced by innovation. To solve this problem, this paper finds a way to study the integrated effect of both exports and innovation, and estimates how LBE effect varies because of sectoral R&D behavior. Based on the LBE effects generated above, as what has been described in section 4.2, the correlation between LBE and innovation is specified as: where X it is still a vector of industrial characteristics. \u0398 n is a fixed effect for innovation inputs which belongs to rank n, \u03bb i for sector i, and \u03bd t for year t. The effects of \u0398 will be studied. Notes: valueaddedr is the ratio between value added (in $1000) and total shipments (in $1000). When use OP methodology to estimate the productivity I yield three scenarios of results, one uses no fixed effects during estimation, one uses only sector fixed effect, and the other one use both sector and year fixed effect. These three scenarios of productivity corresponds to regression (1), (2) and (3) respectively. In the estimation of equation 9based on all three productivities, both sector and year fixed effect are included. a : adjusted by 1.e+3\u00d7 the real LBE nit value. b :computerr, machineryr and valueaddedr are adjusted by 1.e-1 times the real values. * * * Significant at or less than 1%. * * Significant at or less than 5%. * Significant at or less than 10%. otherwise; emp 2it = 1 if 0.04 < emp it < 0.06, = 0 otherwise; emp 3it = 1 if 0.06 < emp it < 0.1, = 0 otherwise; emp 4it = 1 if emp it > 0.1, = 0 otherwise. From the estimation we can tell the value of fixed effect increases as emp rises; meanwhile, only emp 4it have positive effect. It suggests that once relevant industrial characteristics are controlled, the influence of higher R&D employment on the LBE will increase. Also, only if R&D employment ratio is big enough can the sector's innovation decision actually enhances its productivity gain due to exports. Let us focus on results generated under OP scenario (3). This is because it contains both sector and year fixed effect during estimation and yields most appropriate results. As in column (v), if R&D employment ratio is less than 0.06, it will decrease the sector's LBE effect by 2.6 or even 5.6 significantly. If R&D employment ratio is higher but still less than 0.1, it will only have neglectable effect on LBE. If this ratio is higher than 0.1, it can improve LBE by 3.81 significantly once the industrial characteristics are controlled. Meanwhile, by a 10% increase, the adjusted capital expenditure ratio of computer equipments will decrease the LBE by 17%, the capital expenditure ratio of machinery will increase the LBE by 5%, and the value added ratio will decrease the LBE by 48%. All three results are statistically significant. Column (ii), (iv) and (vi) present the influence of company-performed R&D funds ratio. rdf 1it = 1 if 0.01 < rdf it < 0.016, = 0 otherwise; rdf 2it = 1 if 0.017 < rdf it < 0.025, = 0 otherwise; rdf 3it = 1 if 0.025 < rdf it < 0.05, = 0 otherwise; rdf 4it = 1 if rdf it > 0.05, = 0 otherwise. Let's also focus on the estimation under (3). From column (vi), similar results are attained; only the highest rank of R&D funds ratio rdf 4it have positive fixed effect on a sector's LBE procedure. However, rdf 's influence is not monotonically increasing; it will decrease first. In other words, if a sector doesn't pay enough funds for its company-performed R&D project, the more it pays, the less productivity it will gain from exports. Specifically, if the R&D funds ratio is less than 0.05, it will decrease the sector's LBE effect from 3.55 to 4.87. Only when the funds ratio is higher than 0.05 can it increase LBE by 1.42. Besides, by a 10% increase, the ratio of expenditure on computer decreases the LBE by 8.8%, the ratio of expenditure on machinery increases it by 3.6%, and the value added ratio decreases the LBE by almost 50%. Among all three results only the last one is significant. in the second group are featured by an emp which is higher than 0.1; for the company-performed R&D funds rate, the sectors in the first group have their rdf between 0.01 and 0.016, while those in the second with a rdf higher than 0.05. Then I regress the sectoral TFP on the export value, the export growth rate and relevant industrial characteristic variables. 2SLS is applied here in order to remove the endogeneity in exports. The estimation results are in Table 6 7 . Panel A of Table 6 shows the case under the R&D employment ratio analysis. Besides sectoral export value per production worker, I choose two other variables to measure export liberalization: sectoral export value per fringe benefit, and sectoral export per annual payroll. Columns (i) to (vi) are for the those sectors with the lowest R&D employment ratio (between 0.03 and 0.06). As we can see, the elasticities of export liberalization, or the so-called LBE coefficient, stays being positive and will increase. However, the results are constantly insignificant; a sector's export value cannot exert meaningful influence on productivity improvement, neither can its export growth. Thus the LBE cannot be detected under this circumstance with low R&D employment ratio (\u00a1 0.06). Meanwhile, columns (vii) to (ix) are for the sectors that have a higher R&D employment ratio (between 0.06 and 0.1). In contrast to the findings just previously, no matter which economic variable is chosen to indicate the export liberalization, the LBE coefficient stays positive and significant; exports can increase productivity significantly. Specifically, a 1% increase of export per production worker by one unit ($10 7 ) will increase the productivity by around 13%; a 10% increase of export per fringe benefit ($10 2 ) can increase the productivity by 29%; a 1% increase of export per payroll ($10 2 ) increases the productivity by 7%. A significant LBE phenomenon exists consistently. As for the tests based on the sectors with the highest R&D employment ratio (> 0.1), things are similar; a 10% increase of export per production worker ($10 7 ) and export per fringe benefit ($10 2 ) will increase the productivity by 17%; a 1% increase of export per payroll ($10 2 ) increases the productivity by 8%. The LBE hypothesis sustains by holding a significant relationship between export liberalization and productivity. Panel B represents the R&D funds ratio analysis. Now columns (i) to (ix) are for the those sectors with the lowest R&D funds ratio (between 0.01 and 0.05). The LBE coefficient also stays being positive but insignificant; a sector's export value cannot improve productivity in a significant way. Thus it is proved that the LBE process cannot be detected under the circumstance with low R&D input, again. Column (x) to (xii) are for the sectors that have the highest R&D funds ratio (> 0.05). Under this condition the LBE coefficient is positive and even more significant than it is in panel A. High R&D input guarantee the existence of a significant LBE phenomenon; only when a sector's rdf is higher than 0.05 can a significant LBE exist. Therefore, Table 6 once more shows that both negative and positive arguments of the LBE 7a : Exports is measured in $10 7 per worker. b : Exports2 is measured in $10 2 per unit of fringe benefit. c : Exports3 is measured in $10 2 per unit of annual payroll. d : valueaddedr is adjusted by 1.e+4 times the actual value added rate under test group of 0.06 < empnit < 0.1. exist, and this divarication is significantly determined by innovation behavior. The new empirical study based on latest-released information proves the consistent coexistence of evidence both for and against the LBE theory. The highest value of innovation investment ensures that the LBE phenomenon happens. In particular, the R&D employment ratio must be higher than 0.06, and the R&D funds ratio must be higher than 0.05; this way the LBE effect can be increased by the R&D input, and a sector's productivity is significantly improved by its exports. Otherwise, if neither of these R&D input standards is fulfilled, there will be no valuable correlation between export status and productivity; the LBE theory then turns out to be invalid under this circumstance."}, {"section_title": "Extension: Alternative Econometric Specification", "text": "So far all the results are based on the levels with R&D fixed effects. As in Table 11 in Appendix B, I implement an alternative econometric specifications and focus on how a change in R&D inputs affects the LBE. Focus on the last panel of Table 11, which uses both sector and year fixed effects when estimating productivity. In column (i) an (ii), the dependent variable is LBE nit , and the explanatory variables are sectoral characteristics and the highest rank of R&D employment ratio as well as funds rate. Both capital expenditure on computer and value added can increase the LBE, while the expenditure on machinery decreases it. This is consistent with the results generated above. After the fixed effect is included, both measures of R&D inputs increase the LBE effect once other variables are controlled. If \u2206emp 4it = 1, it means that sector i had a R&D employment ratio lower than 0.1 at time t \u2212 1, but manages to raise it above 0.1 at time t. Out of the same logic, by \u2206rdf 4it = 1, a sector i had a R&D funds rate lower than 0.05 at time t \u2212 1, but manages to raises it above 0.05 at time t. Specifically, a progress of emp will increase the change of the LBE effect by 2.5, and a progress of rdf increase it by 3.2. Only the second result is significant. Column (iii) and (iv) do the estimation with all the variables in one-period differences. It can remove the unobserved sector heterogeneity, and estimate the dynamic situation. Now the growth of all the industrial characteristics will decelerate the growing pace of the LBE, no matter before or after the R&D fixed effects are considered. After these R&D fixed effects is included, the influence of emp is still positive, however rdf turns out to be negative. Now an upgrade of R&D employment ratio to the highest level can increase the growth of sectoral LBE by 0.77, while the upgrade of company-performed R&D funds ratio decreases the growth of LBE by 3.07. Only the effect of rdf is significant. Thus dynamically speaking, a faster growing R&D employment tends to stimulate the growth of sectoral productivity gain due to exports, while sectoral funds ratio for R&D has a significant opposite influence. The two-periods difference analysis gives us the similar results. The coefficient of R&D employment ratio increases to 1.06, while the coefficient of company-performed R&D funds ratio decreases to \u22122.55. Notice that I use the LBE results from the scenario of productivity which includes both sector and year fixed effects during estimation. For the tests based on LBE generated by other two scenarios, please refer to Table 11 in Appendix B. The results are very similar, only with elasticities with larger absolute values. Specifically, in Panel A where the LBE effect is yielded from the productivity with no sector or time fixed effects in estimation, after the industrial characteristics are controlled, if the R&D employment ratio is updated to be above 0.1 after one period, the change of the LBE effect over the same period will increase by 1.07, insignificantly though. If the R&D funds ratio is updated to be above 0.05, the change of the LBE effect over the same periods will decline significantly by 5.75. In Panel B where the productivity estimates include sector fixed effect during estimation, these coefficients both increase to 1.28 and \u22123.66; the significance and sign do not change. As for the two-period difference analysis, the conclusions are similar. Still, by an increase in its growth, R&D employment ratio will increase the growth of LBE in an insignificant way, while R&D funds ratio decreases the LBE growth significantly."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Test", "text": "So far I have reached the basic conclusion that only when the R&D input is high enough can it increase sectoral learning-by-exporting effect significantly. In this section I will extend the tests to alternative estimations and see if the conclusion still sustains."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Productivity Estimation", "text": "In addition to the Olley-Pakes estimation of productivity, I use value added per worker, OLS and 2SLS estimates, as well as alternative OP estimates described above as alternative measures for TFP. I furthermore estimate their correlation with exports, and how they are influenced by R&D inputs. The results are in Table 12 in Appendix B. Compare Table 12 with Table 3, among all the 4 different measures of TFP, the positive effect of exports on productivity stays robust after different tests. The importance of high innovation for the LBE is not sensitive to the productivity estimates, but its double-faced role partially is. In Table 13.1 column (i) to (iii) presents estimation results under the OLS, while column (iv) to (v) under the 2SLS. Both methods show positive but insignificant correlation between productivity and sectoral export per production worker, while the export growth always have significantly positive elasticities. In OLS a 10% increase in export liberalization will raise the productivity by around 18%, and if the export grows 10% faster the sector's productivity can be improved by 14%. Under 2SLS, both coefficients increase to 28% and 21% respectively. Once R&D behavior is considered, we can see monotonically increasing effects in both R&D employment and funds ratio 8 , and all the effects are positive. It suggests that given the same export status and industrial characteristics, R&D input can always increase productivity, and even the lowest R&D input will not decrease the productivity. The bigger the input becomes, the more the productivity can be improved. However only emp has significant influence. Under OLS estimation if the R&D employment ratio is less than 0.02, it will raise the productivity by 7.69, yet insignificant; this effect increases as emp rank increases, and when emp is higher than 0.06, it raises the productivity by 38.7 significantly. As it comes to 2SLS estimation, the influences are bigger. Now the lowest rank of employment ratio (< 0.02) will increase the productivity by 12.27 insignificantly, while the highest one (emp > 0.06) increase the productivity by 61.47 significantly. Compared with Table 3, all these effects are much larger. In Table 13.2, two more measures are used. Column (i) to (iii) shows us the results based on the real value added per worker, which is defined by difference between real output and real input costs divided by total number of workers. After regressing the log value added per worker on export per production worker (in $10 6 ) and adjusted export growth rate 9 with and without R&D fixed effects, we can tell that both higher and faster-growing export can increase labor productivity, but only the former one has significant influence. The magnitudes of the effects are also higher than previous results in Table 3, but smaller than Table 13.1, consider the export liberalization and export growth rates are measured in different scales. Also, after R&D fixed effects are included in the consideration, increasing R&D employment ratio can raise the productivity but this conclusion does not sustain in the analysis of R&D funds rate 10 . The R&D employment can enhance productivity if it is higher than 0.04; otherwise, it lowers the labor productivity by 0.05. All the results are not significant. The estimation based on the OP methodology which includes both export and import status variables are shown in column (iv) to (vi) in Table 13.2. Now the results are much similar to those in Table 3, due to their similar estimation procedure. Now significant and monotonically increasing R&D effects appear in both emp and rdf channels. If the R&D employment ratio is less than 0.04, it will decrease the productivity by 0.11 significantly. Only when the ratio is higher can the productivity be improved by 0.09, and this results will continue to increase to 0.15 if the employment ratio of R&D workers is higher than 0.1. If the R&D funds ratio is less than 0.05, it will decrease the productivity by 0.08 to 0.05 significantly. Only when the R&D funds ratio is higher can we avoid this negative results; now it can increase the productivity by 0.02, insignificant though. This pattern is consistent with the TFP results of Table 3. To sum up, the positive influence of exports on productivity sustains among all other measures of 9 It is adjusted by 1.e+3 times the actual growth rate. 10 In Table 13.2 the notifications of emp and rdf ranks are also different from Table 3. emp1it = 1 if 0.015 < empit < 0.04, = 0 otherwise; emp2it = 1 if 0.04 < empit < 0.06, = 0 otherwise; emp3it = 1 if 0.06 < empit < 0.1, = 0 otherwise; emp4it = 1 if empit > 0.1, = 0 otherwise. When value added per worker is treated as productivity, rdf1it = 1 if rdfit < 0.01, = 0 otherwise; rdf2it = 1 if 0.01 < rdfit < 0.012, = 0 otherwise; rdf3it = 1 if 0.012 < rdfit < 0.025, = 0 otherwise; rdf4it = 1 if rdfit > 0.025, = 0 otherwise. The notification of rdf under alternative OP method is the same as in Table 3. productivity. As for R&D input's combined role during this LBE procedure, the R&D employment ratio has stronger robustness. A higher value of R&D employment ratio has increasing effects on promoting productivity; only when it is higher than some threshold can the effects start to be significantly positive. This threshold is the same across OLS, 2SLS and alternative OP method (0.04), where the significance exists. However previously in Table 3 this threshold is much higher (0.07)."}, {"section_title": "Alternative LBE & Innovation Result", "text": "From the above analysis this paper have studied whether a sector can increase productivity because of its exports, and how this procedure can be affected by innovation behavior. However, Table   6 shows the results about how innovation affects sectoral productivity gain from trade. In other words, I am considering the effect of \"learning by trading\" (LBT) here. To estimate the productivity, another OP methodology is used. Different from the one that has been described in section 4.1, to yield the sectoral TFP under the influence of trade, I include proportion and growth rate of both exports and imports as additional state variables besides capital and investment during estimation. The summary statistics are shown in Table 14 in Appendix B, and comparison between the three scenarios of productivity that have been estimated is depicted in Figure 1 in Appendix C. Compared with LBE, most LBT effects turn out to be more than halved due to a scenario of smaller productivity estimation. But still, sectors tend to have positive productivity gain under a open economy; only in the sector of guided missiles and space vehicles 11 a negative LBT result appears. In this one and only one case, there is a productivity loss instead of gain due to the additional consideration of international trade. Table 4, in Table 5 column (i), (iii) and (v) present the influence of R&D employment ratio on LBT effect. Again, emp 1it = 1 if 0.015 < emp it < 0.04, = 0 otherwise; emp 2it = 1 if 0.04 < emp it < 0.06, = 0 otherwise; emp 3it = 1 if 0.06 < emp it < 0.1, = 0 otherwise; emp 4it = 1 if emp it > 0.1, = 0 otherwise. Still, the fixed effect of emp monotonically increases as its value rises; but compare to Table 4, the fixed effects are featured by much larger values. Lower emp it s have negative effect. It suggests that once relevant industrial characteristics are controlled, the influence of higher R&D employment on LBT will increase. Also, if R&D employment ratio is low, the sector's innovation decision actually will obstruct instead of helping its productivity improvement during trade. Let us also focus on results generated under OP scenario (3). As in column (v), if R&D employment ratio is less than 0.04, it will decrease the sector's LBT effect by 11.6 significantly. If R&D employment ratio is higher but still lower than 0.1, no significant effects emp can exert on LBT. Only when the employment ratio is higher than 0.1 can it improve the LBT by 17.7 significantly. Notes: Standard errors are in the parentheses. When use OP methodology to estimate the productivity I yield three scenarios of results, one uses no fixed effects during estimation, one uses only sector fixed effect, and the other one use both sector and year fixed effect. These three scenarios of productivity corresponds to regression (1), (2) and (3) respectively. In the estimation of equation (9) based on all three productivities, both sector and year fixed effect are included. a : adjusted by the 1.e+3 \u00d7 the real LBT nit value. b : computerr, machineryr and valueaddedr are adjusted by 1.e-1 times the real values. * * * Significant at or less than 1%. * * Significant at or less than 5%. * Significant at or less than 10%."}, {"section_title": "The same as", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Column (ii), (iv) and (vi) present the influence of company-performed R&D funds ratio. Again, rdf 1it = if 0.01 < rdf it < 0.016, = 0 otherwise; rdf 2it = 1 if 0.017 < rdf it < 0.025, = 0 otherwise; rdf 3it = 1 if 0.025 < rdf it < 0.05, = 0 otherwise; rdf 4it = 1 if rdf it > 0.05, = 0 otherwise. Focus on the estimation under (3). The results are almost the same as those of the emp fixed effects, only the influence of higher company-performed R&D funds on LBT does not increase monotonically anymore, after the industrial characteristics are controlled. The highest rank of R&D funds ratio has the only positive effect. According to column (vi), once a sector's industrial characteristics are controlled, if R&D funds ratio is lower than 0.05, the sector's innovation shrinks its productivity under an open economy. Specifically, it decreases the LBT effect by around 6.2 to 8.3. Only when the R&D funds rate is higher than 0.05 can the LBT be improved significantly; in particular, improved by 13.6. Meanwhile, all the relevant industrial characteristic variables decrease the LBT effect. As in Table 4, the negative roles of both ratio of computer capital and value added in helping productivity grow during trade do not change. However, different from the LBE estimation, the ratio of capital that spent on machinery equipments now makes productivity gain decline. The more capital a sector spends on purchasing or renewing its machinery devices, the less it can benefit from the trade. This effect is also significant."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper follows other studies on learning-by-exporting, the productivity progress a plant or sector can make out of its exporting behavior. However, this paper is one of the first to look into both sides of the inconclusive story, and explain why evidence for and against the theory have both been found. It is the first one trying to find a measure for the learning-by-exporting (LBE) effect. I compile a 2005-2009 US manufacturing industry dataset from different sources. By applying Olley-Pakes methodology during the productivity estimation, I test the correlation between this LBE effect and sectoral innovation input, and new results are revealed. Only when the innovation is higher than some threshold can it starts to improve the LBE significantly; in other words, only when a sector pays enough attention for their R&D department can its effort benefit the productivity and significantly improve its productivity gain from the exports. Specifically, the employment ratio of the R&D scientists and engineers should be higher than 0.1, so it can improve the LBE effect by 3.8. The company-performed R&D funds should be at least 5% of the value of the net domestic sales so that it can increase the LBE effect by 1.4. If these standards are not fulfilled, R&D input can only cause a productivity decline once the sectoral export status is controlled. The scale of the loss shrinks as the R&D effort rises though. By separating the sectors into different groups based on their innovation effort, only the groups with the highest R&D measures have significant LBE (emp > 0.06, rdf > 0.05), which does not exist amid those with the lowest R&D input. I also implement multiple time-difference analysis to see how the change of innovation input affects the change of LBE effect; a faster growing R&D employment ratio can stimulate the growth of LBE, but not significant enough. A faster growing R&D funds ratio decelerate the growth of LBE significantly. The main finding is that only those sectors spend enough effort on innovation can grow more and benefit from exports. This result is robust across other different specifications. For the estimation of productivity, I use the OP methodology which removes simultaneity of inputs and includes both static and dynamic export status as additional state variables, and the finding is not entirely sensitive to the way I estimate the productivity. I also use four other measures of productivity to test the robustness of positive effects of exports, and the role of R&D inputs play during the procedure. The increasing fixed effects of both R&D employment and funds ratio sustain under OLS and 2SLS, in the sense of higher value but not significant enough; only and R&D employment ratio have the increasing fixed effects if the real value added per worker is treated as the productivity. Furthermore, by introducing a new concept \"learning-by-trading\" (LBT), I use another OP method to estimate the productivity out of the additional concern of both export and import conditions, and test how it is influenced by the innovation. Similar findings present themselves. Both R&D measures, especially the R&D employment ratio, have increasing and significant fixed effects. Therefore this paper establish a new and robust insight into the learning-by-exporting theory through the channel of innovation effort. Of course, more work needs to be done. Ideally the effect of LBE should be estimated by comparing productivity before and after export happens to a plant or sector. However due to the limitation of the available data, I can only estimate it by comparing productivity before and after export behavior is considered during the estimation. Because of the additional consideration of export status the productivity estimates turn out to be higher; I therefore treat this extra credit on TFP earned by the exports the effect of LBE and proceed further tests. In order to modify the methodology to be more accurate, empirical evidence including more information about the exit and survival situations across different sectors or plants needs to be found. Still, only when the innovation effort is high enough can sectoral exports improve productivity significantly, and also improve the productivity gain conditional on exports under an open economy. However an importance question still remains: how high is high enough? In this paper I have two thresholds for both R&D employment ratio and company-performed R&D funds rate (0.06 and 0.05 respectively), but they are identified by general fixed effect estimation instead of particular theoretical analysis. Is there an innovation effort threshold which can be well expressed by other sectoral characteristics, for example, export status, trade cost, or growth rate? In a word, more work needs to be done to solve for the theory beneath the learning-by-exporting hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Olley-Pakes Methodology", "text": "The Olley-Pakes methodology treats the error term in equation 3as the sum of two parts: one is a white noise component \u03b7 it , and the other is a sector-specific, time-varying productivity shock \u03c9 it . Therefore in the estimation of production functions, there exist correlation between unobserved productivity shock and the input factors. This will generate inconsistent estimates using OLS. A second problem arises as the endogeneity. Because of the sample selection, sectors with low productivity exit the market, and the remaining ones will have their \u03c9 it chosen from a selected sample. Based on a sector's value function for dynamic maximization: and capital accumulation process: where V l is the sector's value if it liquidates, \u03a0 is the profit, c(I it ) is the cost correlated with investment decision, \u03c3 is the discount factor, \u2126 it is all the information available at time t, and \u03b4 is the capital depreciation rate. Meanwhile, \u03c9 it is assumed to follow a 1st-order Markov process. Profit maximization lead to an investment function that depends on capital k and productivity \u03c9, as specified in equation 5. In Pakes (1994), Van Biesebroeck (2005) the conditions under which the investment is monotonically increasing with productivity is specified 12 , therefore it is possible for us to invert the investment function, then express the productivity as a function of investment and capital. In the first step, I modify the Olley-Pakes method by including the sectoral export status during international trade. As there are sunk costs to enter foreign market and only more productive firms or sectors can afford it, as what's been proved by the \"self-selection\" theory, it is inappropriate to treat the export or import status as exogenous. I follow the work of Van Biesebroeck (2005), De Loecker (2006 and Amiti et Al (2007), and include export variables from consideration of both statics and dynamic situations as additional state variables. Specifically, these two additional variables are: first, the ratio between the exports of a 6-digit industry and the total exports of the 3-digit industry it belongs to; second, the growth rate of the exports of this 6-digit industry. This way the investment function is a function of 4 variables: capital, productivity, export proportion (XP ), and export growth rate (XG). Specifically, we have By inverting (10), we have Substitute equation (11) back into (3), we have where Use a 3rd-order polynomial series expansion of all the four state variables to model \u03c6, as well as sector and year dummies, I can obtain consistent estimates of \u03b2 l , \u03b2 m and \u03b2 Q . In the second step, I need to estimate \u03b2 k . According to the capital accumulation process, the capital at t + 1 depends on investment at time t. Therefore, at time t + 1 capital k is correlated with the expectation of productivity \u03c9, E(\u03c9 it+1 ) = \u03c9 it+1 \u2212 \u03be it+1 , where the future productivity is decomposed into an expected and unexpected components; \u03be it is an unobserved and unexpected productivity shock. Moreover, expectation of future productivity is a function of current productivity; I denote this function as h(\u03c9 it ). Substitute the expression of \u03c9 it from (11) into h() then the expression of \u03c6 it from (13), I yield: Substitute (14) into (3) at t + 1 leads to One more assumption is needed here: the input factors as well as export status are correlated with the expected productivity shock but not the unexpected one. Therefore The expectations of x it+1 can be obtained from the regression of x it+1 on the same 3rd-order polynomials of capital, investment and export status variables mentioned above. Thus a consistent coefficient on capital in production function can be estimated.   a : adjusted by 1.e+3 \u00d7 the real \u2206LBE nit value. b : \u2206computerr, \u2206machineryr and \u2206valueaddedr are adjusted by 1.0e-1 times the real value. * * * Significant at or less than 1%. * * Significant at or less than 5%. * Significant at or less than 10%.
