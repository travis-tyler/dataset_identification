Third grade is a crucial year in elementary school as high stakes exams begin in third grade in most states. The results indicated that the Body Mass Index (BMI) of students, as well as the opportunity for physical activity within the school day aected the students' performance in both reading and mathematics achievement. The implications for school and district leaders are discussed with direction for future research presented. note: This module has been peer-reviewed, accepted, and sanctioned by the National Council of the Professors of Educational Administration (NCPEA) as a scholarly contribution to the knowledge base in educational administration. With the mandates of No Child Left Behind (NCLB, 2001), there is enormous pressure on educators to improve academic skills among students. Schools must accomplish the daunting task of educating all children while preparing them to achieve mastery on high-stakes assessments. For many years, there has been a demand on educators to improve academic skills among students (Symons, Cinelli, Iames, & Gro, 1997). School ocials are constantly searching for the best educational programs or curriculum to ensure that all children learn. Because of the burden of high-stakes testing, many districts are cutting back or even eliminating non-academic subjects in favor of direct teaching in the assessed subjects (American Association of School Administrators, 2006;Vail, 2006). Siegel (2006) opined that many school ocials view non-assessed subjects as superuous (p. 9), thus creating a case for the eradication of any subject that is not directly measured through high-stakes testing. While few educators would voice opposition to the emphasis on academics, there remains a need to holistically educate children to prepare them for the future. Amidst numerous competing issues, educating the whole child involves addressing both the academic and the health needs of students. Linking health and learning is a way to ensure a comprehensive approach to educating the whole child (Laitsch, Lewallen, & McCloskey, 2005). An added benet to focusing on students' health has been proposed by Novello, Degraw, and Kleinman (1992). According to Novello et al., both health and achievement are important in a child's life and health issues are indeed intertwined with students' academic achievement. For that reason, healthful living is as important to quality of life as academic achievement (AASA, 2006, p. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Nature of the Problem", "text": "The topics of obesity and insucient physical activity in childhood have been highlighted over the last few years (AASA, 2006; The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, 2005;Villaire, 2001). The prevalence of children with high blood pressure, type-two diabetes, and obesity has been on the increase (AASA; The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools). The number of adolescents who are overweight has tripled since 1980 and the prevalence among younger children has more than doubled. According to the 1999-2002 National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 16 percent of children age 6-19 years are overweight (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Being overweight during childhood and adolescence increases the risk of developing high cholesterol, hypertension, respiratory ailments, orthopedic problems, depression and type-two diabetes as a youth. Looking at the long-term consequences, overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of becoming overweight or obese adults, which increases to 80 percent if one or more parent is overweight or obese (Torgan, 2002). Obesity in adulthood increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, arthritis, and a general poor health status. In 2000, the total cost of obesity for children and adults in the United States was estimated to be $117 billion ($61 billion in direct medical costs) (Center for Disease Control, 2005). http://cnx.org/content/m14420/1.1/ Because of these health issues, these children are also missing more school than those students who are healthy (AASA; Marx & Northrop, 2000;Smith, 2003). Undeniably, absenteeism places these children atrisk for learning diculties and failures. Yet, even more than being concerned over attendance, schools must consider the role they will play in combating health issues, such as obesity, that may cause impediments to the learning process. Although school programs alone cannot overturn the unhealthful trends, school ocials can partner with families and communities to implement policies and practices that will combat unhealthy living and promote healthful choices (AASA; Deutsch, 2000;Scherer, 2000). Absenteeism is but one issue in the quest for improving the health among students. Although several authors have focused on the health of children and how health issues may aect students in the school setting, there is little research that specically links physical activity and obesity with academic achievement (AASA, 2006). There is a deciency in research-based information regarding how physical activity and obesity inuence academic achievement. This study will ll a void in existing research. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between physical activity within the school day, obesity, and academic achievement. In addition, gender, race, and poverty levels of students were considered as variables that may impact students' physical activity, obesity, and academic achievement."}, {"section_title": "Signicance of the Study", "text": "The high prevalence of obesity among school-age children has made obesity a hot topic in education. The results of this study will be helpful to school leaders as they implement health initiatives to counteract rising obesity rates among children. In addition, the study will serve two practical purposes: a) inform school leaders as they develop and implement broad health-related policies and initiatives, and b) assist school leaders in determining appropriate scheduling of academic and non-academic subjects. Without a doubt, if school leaders are aware of atypical academic practices that could improve academic achievement, they will be able to implement needed changes within the school day schedule."}, {"section_title": "Denitions of Key Terms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Physical Activity", "text": "Physical activity is the bodily movement that results in an expenditure of energy. Physical activity is not synonymous with group sports. Although many children derive physical activity from group sports, children can be physically active by walking, playing freely at recess, or doing yard work. Strenuous activity is not required. Instead, children should aim for getting at least 30-60 minutes of activity three to four days a week (Governor's Conference on Children's Obesity in Texas, 2004). The NASPE (2006) suggested an even higher amount of physical activity. They recommend that children acquire 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Unfortunately, in today's society, very few children meet these guidelines for healthy living.\nAn essential component of a comprehensive school health program is physical activity. The signicance of physical activity on a person's well being and general health was acknowledged in several reports (Dixon et al., 2003;Paige, 2004;Seefeldt, 1986). Regular physical activity and tness topped the list of recommendations needed for a healthy lifestyle (Spain & Franks, 2001). After compiling information from numerous federal and health promotion agencies, Lambert (2000) found that increasing the levels of physical activity was one of the most \"emphatic recommendations\" (p. 34) to improve a person's health. Drawing upon information from a model proposed by Allensworth andKolbe in 1987, Marx andNorthrop (2000) asserted that quality health and physical education programs would emphasize lifelong physical activity. School programs can equip students with the information needed to lead healthier lives through physical activity. Furthermore, schools may greatly inuence the student by providing regular opportunities for physical activity within the school day. There are many ways in which schools can implement programs to http://cnx.org/content/m14420/1.1/ ensure that students have opportunities for physical activity (Garcia, Garcia, Floyd, & Lawson, 2002;Kidd, 2003). School leaders have been encouraged to ensure that students are allowed the opportunity to play at recess and receive physical education instruction on a daily basis. Interestingly, some physical activity advocates have even gone as far to suggest that schools be required to assess students' physical tness levels and identify their individual BMI scores. For instance, the Governor's Conference on Children's Obesity in Texas (2004) recommended that a TAKS test in physical tness be implemented. As of this writing, this proposal has not been implemented. In the spring of 2001, California began mandating that all students in grades ve, seven, and nine be administered a Physical Fitness Test (Grissom, 2005). These tness scores are part of the assessment process, which is disseminated to parents, and also to various stakeholders. In 2003, North Carolina included recess as part of the school day in addition to requirements that were already in place for physical education classes (AASA, 2006). According to AASA, 21 states established requirements in 2005 for physical activity or physical education within the school day. The National PTA and the Center for Disease Control have jointly begun an eort called Rescuing Recess (n.d.). These organizations feel that, in an eort to push academics in the age of high accountability, elementary schools have disregarded the benets of physical activity during a period of the day called recess. The National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE, 2004) has called for the continuation of 20 minute recess periods for elementary school students. The NASPE believes that physical activity can help children to develop healthier bodies. Therefore, ensuring that children receive daily recess will contribute at least a partial amount of the physical activity that children need."}, {"section_title": "Body Mass Index", "text": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated by dividing weight in pounds by the square of height in inches, and then multiplying that number by 703.

By addressing the health needs of children, schools can ensure that the children are in attendance and are physically, emotionally, and mentally in the best situation to learn (Smith, 2003;Deutsch, 2000). In March 2000, an entire volume of Educational Leadership focused on children in public schools and the needed emphasis on the relationship between healthy bodies and minds. In this volume, Scherer (2000) oered the viewpoint that \"the topic of health involves scientic challenges, ethical conicts, (and) social dilemmas\" (p. 7). In reality, providing students with quality instruction in healthy lifestyles has been and will continue to be a challenging task. In spite of this challenge, students can be taught that their healthy development is important when they \"receive consistent health-promoting messages from all aspects of the school environmentin class; in the food choices oered; [and] in the opportunities for daily physical activity\" (Grebow et. al, 2000, p. 65)."}, {"section_title": "Grissom (2005) investigated the link between tness levels of students and their Stanford Achievement", "text": "Test scores.

In the past, the study of hygiene was at the forefront of health education in public schools (Scherer, 2000). However, those simplistic days have ended. Since the mid-to-late 1990s, schools have been asked to promote student health by creating health programs within the school setting (Scherer,2000). By dealing with health issues that might hinder learning, school ocials can proactively develop interventions that inuence and promote learning (Deutsch, 2000). Smith (2003) stated that schools have a unique opportunity to address health issues to promote learning; after all, a large majority of children are enrolled in public schools. Interventions in health can be best integrated into other academic disciplines where every teacher shares in the responsibility of teaching healthy lifestyles (Deutsch, 2000). Through this purposeful teaching, schools can equip students with the information needed to lead healthy lives. Grebow et al. (2000) asserted that when all components of a health program are implemented, \"students are better able to focus on learning\" (p. 65). These components include teaching children about healthy living and making healthy choices by properly eating and getting physical exercise. Wechsler, McKenna, Lee, and Dietz (2004) stated, \"Health and success in school are interrelated. Schools cannot achieve their primary mission of education if students and sta are not healthy and t physically, mentally, and socially (p. 4). School systems may choose to address topics relating to student health in numerous ways. Because children spend a greater part of their weekdays away from home, schools have a unique opportunity to inuence and guide students towards actions and activities that promote healthy lifestyles (Smith, 2003;VanLandegham, 2003). When schools take advantage of this opportunity, healthy students increase the capacity to become better learners (Association for Supervision, n.d.; Deutsch, 2000;Dixon et al., 2003;Novello et al., 1992;Tomlinson, 1999). Laitsch et al. (2005) expressed, \"academic achievement is inextricably linked with the... emotional, physical, and social health of our students (p. 6). Thus, another area where schools inuence a healthy lifestyle is in the instruction of health-related topics. Deutsch (2000) surmised, \"Every teacher is a health teacher\" (p. 10); further; important themes in health are best integrated into other academic disciplines. Ultimately, health instruction should be planned and sequential beginning in Kindergarten and continuing through 12th grade. The physical, emotional, mental, and social aspects of health should be addressed through the curriculum (Cooper & Taras, 2003). Rhiner (2004) expressed, \"policies around. . .physical activity have the power to change the behavior of our children....\" (p. 21). However, Rhiner found that only a handful of over 75 proposed bills addressing http://cnx.org/content/m14420/1.1/ nutrition and/or physical activity have actually passed over the prior four years. Specically, AASA (2006) reported that in 2005, 48 states required physical education, 39 states had contemplated physical activity requirements, and 21 states actually passed some form of physical activity legislation, but specic policies and practices varied widely. And Rhiner asserted that federal and state policies regarding nutrition and physical activity are not usually enforced. In order for students' health needs to be fully addressed, policies should be in place and enforced at the local level. The realization of these laws is ultimately left up to the local education agencies to implement and enforce."}, {"section_title": "Coordinated School Health Programs", "text": "Recently, there have been health initiatives set in motion by legislation and policies, which require schools to be a beacon of information regarding health-related topics (AASA, 2006).

Although these components must be evident in the wellness policy, the federal government has ensured that local districts be given the autonomy to decide the specics of the policy. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act (2004) initiated the prospect that schools can and should be a primary source for the education of students on combating obesity through nutrition and physical activity. The prime objective of the new law is to curtail the growing trend toward childhood obesity (Action for Healthy Kids, n.d.).

An entire American Association of School Administrators (AASA) publication was devoted to the topic of obesity and the role schools play in combating this epidemic. The executive director of AASA, Paul Houston, believed that the topic of childhood obesity has received the attention of the media, which in turn, has caused schools to focus on ways to address this issue (AASA,2006). In recent years, there has been much discussion and controversy over obesity and insucient physical activity in childhood (AASA; The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools, 2005;Villaire, 2001).

Another limitation of the study was that only the amount of time given to recess within the school day has been reported. Therefore, some students may participate in rigorous activity, while others may choose to simply visit with friends during recess. The wide variance in these two scenarios reveals the limitation in using recess as a physical activity variable. However, oering recess to students aords students the opportunity to participate in physical activity. Novello et al.

An often heard argument from educators is that they simply do not have enough time within the school day to instruct students in the subjects that will be tested (AASA). Therefore, non-academic subjects have often times been severely reduced, or even eliminated. http://cnx.org/content/m14420/1.1/ Based on the results of this study, there was a relationship between students' BMI, physical activity, and their academic achievement levels. A positive relationship existed between physical activity and academic achievement. In other words, students that maintained a higher level of physical activity maintained higher grades and learned at a faster rate than those students who were less physically active. Conversely, a negative relationship was observed between obesity, as rated by the BMI, and academic achievement. In other words, obese students performed below their more physically t counterparts regarding academic achievement. Schools that have reduced or eliminated recess times for students should question their stance on this critical issue. The results of this study indicated that the opportunity for physical activity improved students' chances of scoring procient on the reading exam. In addition, since physical activity reduces a person's BMI (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, n.d.) and a high BMI has a negative relationship with academic achievement, schools should be keenly aware of any policies and practices that may inuence a students' BMI. Although schools may have considered that the mind and the body are two separate entities, this research provided evidence that the two items are really not competing factions at all. Instead, they are two elds that need to be connected to ensure that students are given the best opportunity for achieving. Even with the pressure to prepare students for high stakes testing, educators need to nd ways to incorporate physical activity within the school day. Just as Grissom (2005) speculated, conditions that promote a healthy body also promote a healthy mind (p. 24), this study provided information to support this link."}]
