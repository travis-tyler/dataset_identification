[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Body mass index (BMI) has a complex relationship with Alzheimer's disease (AD); in midlife, high BMI is associated with increased risk for AD, whereas the relationship in late-life is still unclear. To clarify the relationship between late-life BMI and risk for AD, this study examined the extent to which genetic predisposition for AD moderates BMI and AD-related biomarker associations. Participants included 126 cognitively normal older adults at baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Genetic risk for AD was assessed via polygenic hazard score. AD-related biomarkers assessed were medial temporal lobe volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Hierarchical linear regressions were implemented to examine the effects of BMI and polygenic hazard score on AD-related biomarkers. Results showed that BMI moderated the relationship between genetic risk for AD and medial temporal lobe volume, such that individuals with high BMI and high genetic risk for AD showed lower volume in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In sex-stratified analyses, these results remained significant only in females. Finally, BMI and genetic risk for AD were independently associated with CSF biomarkers of AD. These results provide evidence that high BMI is associated with lower volume in AD-vulnerable brain regions in individuals at genetic risk for AD, particularly females. The genetic pathways of AD may be exacerbated by high BMI.\nEnvironmental and genetic risk factors rarely occur in isolation, which underscores the importance of looking at their synergistic effects, as they provide insight into early risk factors for AD that prevention methods could target.\nRunning title: BMI, MTL volume, and AD risk"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a global health concern that places an epic burden on families, caregivers, healthcare systems, and the economy.\nAn estimated 5.6 million Americans currently live with AD, and this number is expected to increase rapidly as the number of individuals over the age of 65 increases (Hebert et al., 2013) .\nBrain changes, including atrophy and accumulation of \uf062-amyloid peptide (A\uf062) and tau, begin years before noticeable clinical and cognitive symptoms develop (Braak and Braak, 1991; Jack et al., 2013; Villemagne et al., 2013) , making it imperative to investigate early risk factors that prevention methods could target to delay or prevent progression to AD.\nOne variable that may play a role in development of AD is obesity. Obesity is a serious and growing health concern that impacts 38.9% of U.S. adults (Hales et al., 2018) , and is associated with numerous deleterious health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as impaired quality of life (Dixon, 2010) . One measure of obesity, body mass index (BMI), has a complex relationship with AD. In midlife, obesity is consistently associated with increased risk for dementia, including AD (Albanese et al., 2017; Anstey et al., 2011) .\nAlthough the precise pathways linking obesity and neurodegenerative disease are unknown, likely mechanisms include inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier disturbances (Alford et al., 2018; O'Brien et al., 2017) . However, there is an \"obesity paradox\" when BMI is measured in older adults. There is some evidence that high BMI is associated with lower risk of developing dementia, including AD (Atti et al., 2008; Fitzpatrick et al., 2009; Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2018) . Additionally, studies have shown that lower BMI is associated with increased AD-pathology including A\uf062, total tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (Ewers et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2011) , and accelerated cognitive decline (Cronk et al., 2010) . Possible explanations include changes in olfaction that alter eating habits, damage to brain regions that are involved in controlling weight and food intake such as the hypothalamus and medial temporal lobe (Buchman et al., 2005; Grundman et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1989) , and higher levels of leptin in obesity which may facilitate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and consequently improve learning and memory (Harvey et al., 2006) . However, the relationship between late-life BMI and AD remains to be elucidated. Higher BMI in late-life was associated with increased risk for AD (Gustafson et al., 2003) , while a meta-analysis showed no relationship between latelife BMI (measured continuously) and dementia risk (Anstey et al., 2011) .\nComplex phenotypes such as late-onset AD cannot fully be explained by environmental factors alone, but rather a multitude of environmental and genetic factors and their interactions.\nExamining moderating factors, such as genetic risk for AD, may provide additional insight into the relationship between obesity and AD. It is well-established that genetics contributes to the development of AD, and evidence suggests that late-onset AD is 60-80% heritable (Gatz et al., 2006) . Recent work suggests that polygenic risk scores for AD are better predictors of AD than are single candidate variants such as the APOE \uf0654 allele (Ridge et al., 2013) . A polygenic risk score incorporates multiple genetic variants, identified from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a particular trait, into a genetic propensity score for that trait. Polygenic risk for AD has also been associated with other markers of AD-related pathology, including neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, A\uf062, tau, and volume loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Desikan et al., 2017) . These results suggest that polygenic risk scores may serve as predictors of prodromal AD-related brain pathology.\nThe present study examined the relationship between BMI, polygenic risk for AD, and medial temporal lobe volume (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our analyses focused on these medial temporal lobe regions as they are known to be particularly vulnerable to AD (Braak and Braak, 1991) , and genetic risk for AD is associated with lower volume in these regions (Desikan et al., 2017) . Additionally, given data showing that females have a greater risk of developing AD (Gao et al., 1998) and some evidence that the relationship between BMI and dementia risk is stronger in females (Gustafson et al., 2003; Joo et al., 2018) , we also examined sex differences in the relationship between BMI, polygenic risk for AD, and medial temporal lobe volume. Finally, we examined the relationship between BMI, polygenic risk for AD, and other known ADbiomarkers, including A\uf062, tau, and p-tau. Investigating how environmental and genetic factors interact to influence AD-related pathology has important implications for the development of specific prevention methods aimed at delaying or preventing progression to AD. These factors were examined in cognitively normal individuals in attempt to identify early risk factors that can be targeted prior to onset of clinical symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database For the current study, 180 white, non-Hispanic/Latino subjects were identified to avoid population stratification effects.

We restricted our analysis to the 150 subjects with non-accelerated scans, which typically have fewer image artifacts and better signal to noise ratio than accelerated scans (Jack et al., 2010) . Of these, 20 scans failed one or more regions of the visual quality check performed by the UCSF processing team and were excluded. Three participants had two baseline scans and, in these cases, only one scan was included in our analyses. One participant had a BMI more than three standard deviations above the mean and was excluded from analyses. The final sample included 126 subjects. Four participants had diabetes.

Next, in a step-wise procedure, genotype data from 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 controls in Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium was used to identify the top AD-associated SNPs and develop a survival model for PHS, while controlling for the effects of gender, APOE, and population stratification. In each step, the SNP that most improved model prediction was added, and this process continued until residuals did not improve with the addition of another SNP. In the final model, two APOE variants, the \uf0652 and \uf0654 alleles, and 31 AD-associated SNPs were integrated into a Cox proportional hazard model to generate a PHS that reflects an individual's risk for developing AD based their age and genotype.

There were three main findings. First, results revealed that the combination of two risk factors, being overweight/obese and genetic risk for AD, was associated with lower volume in AD-vulnerable brain regions, and in particular, the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, in cognitively normal older adults. Second, the effect was observed primarily in female participants. Finally, polygenic risk for AD and BMI independently influence levels of CSF biomarkers.\nPrevious work has shown inconsistent relationships between obesity and risk for AD in older adults. The findings reported here may help clarify the relationship between obesity and risk for AD by demonstrating the moderating influence of genetic risk on this relationship. In particular, high BMI may confer greater risk for neurodegenerative processes in the context of predisposing genetic risk for AD. Although the precise mechanisms that underlie the synergistic effects are unknown, it is important to note that there is substantial overlap between the metabolic consequences of obesity and the genetic pathways associated with AD. Genetic pathways of AD include immune response, lipid metabolism, cholesterol, endocytosis, cell adhesion molecules, and inflammation (Jones et al., 2010; Verheijen and Sleegers, 2018) .\nSimilarly, obesity is associated with inflammation, altered lipid metabolism, cholesterol, insulin resistance, and immune response (Jones and Rebeck, 2019; Mart\u00ed et al., 2001; O'Brien et al., 2017) . One interpretation of the findings is the deleterious metabolic cascades associated with genetic risk for AD are exacerbated with high BMI.\nResults of this study also showed that the relationship between BMI and genetics on medial temporal lobe volume was pronounced in female participants. Females are more likely to develop AD than males (Andersen et al., 1999; Farrer et al., 1997; Gao et al., 1998) , which cannot simply be explained by increased longevity among females (Lautenschlager et al., 1996) .\nThe relationship between BMI and dementia risk appears to be stronger in females than males both in mid-life and late-life, although not all studies have found sex differences (Hassing et al., 2009; Kivipelto et al., 2005) . Gustafson and colleagues (2003) showed that females with higher BMI in older adulthood had a greater risk of developing dementia. Previous research has also shown differential genetic influences in women vs. men, whereby healthy older female APOE \uf0654 carriers had the greatest risk for conversion to MCI or AD (Altmann et al., 2014) . In subanalyses, Altmann and colleagues (2014) also showed that among healthy older adults, a single copy of the APOE \uf0654 allele increases risk of conversion to MCI or AD in females, but not males.\nA recent study also found associations between genetic risk for AD, measured both by APOE \uf0654 status and a polygenic risk score that excluded APOE and TREM2, and lower hippocampal volume in older adults, and these associations were more pronounced in females (Lupton et al., 2016) . A potential mechanism contributing to sex differences may be the role that estrogen plays in AD risk (for review, see Merlo et al., 2017; Pike, 2017) , and future studies should investigate how estrogen may interact with genetics to confer risk for AD.\nThe current study also examined the relationship between BMI and genetic risk for AD in two control regions of interest: the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus. BMI, genetic risk, and their interaction did not influence volume in the precentral gyrus or postcentral gyrus. These results suggest that the influence of BMI and genetic risk on brain volume may be specific to AD-vulnerable regions. Although atrophy is observed in normal aging, its neural signature is distinct from AD-related atrophy. The medial temporal lobe regions, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, are typically the first to be impacted by AD-related cortical atrophy (Pini et al., 2016) , however these regions are relatively spared in regards to age-related atrophy (Bakkour et al., 2013; Ohnishi et al., 2001) . This further supports the interpretation that the lower volume observed specifically in the medial temporal lobe regions in the present study may reflect some of the earliest AD-related pathology. As AD progresses, atrophy extends throughout the cortex, following a neuropathological trajectory similar to Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging.\nCortical atrophy spreads through the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions, while sensory and motor regions are minimally impacted until late stages of the disease (Frisoni et al., 2009; Pini et al., 2016) .\nThe lack of interaction between BMI and polygenic risk for AD on CSF biomarkers was surprising, as there is evidence that atrophy reflects the accumulation of A\uf062, tau, and p-tau in the brain (Fagan et al., 2009; Jack et al., 2013) . However, there is additional evidence that MRI and CSF biomarkers may independently relate to and reflect unique parts of AD (Schoonenboom et al., 2008; Vemuri et al., 2009 ). Thus, the pathways implicated by high BMI and genetic risk may differentially impact medial temporal lobe volume and CSF biomarkers. Despite the lack of interaction, there were still independent effects of BMI and PHS on CSF biomarkers. In the present study, individuals with high genetic risk for AD had lower CSF A\uf062 (reflecting greater intracranial A\uf062 burden), higher p-tau, and marginally higher tau, which is consistent with previous research showing that higher PHS is associated with greater AD-related pathology (Desikan et al., 2017) . Furthermore, higher BMI was associated with greater levels of tau and ptau, suggesting that high BMI in late-life may be a risk factor for AD.\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered. First, although this study observed AD-related vulnerabilities using MRI biomarkers, it cannot be determined whether any of the individuals in this study will develop AD in the future. Additionally, ADNI does not collect data on BMI prior to the baseline assessment, and thus the influence of lifetime BMI on the relationship between late-life BMI, genetic risk for AD, and AD-related biomarkers could not be examined. Investigating the relationship between AD-related pathology, BMI, and polygenic risk for AD longitudinally can further elucidate how these variables interact to influence the progression of AD. Furthermore, the sample did not include any individuals with a BMI below 20 and thus the relationship between underweight BMI, genetics, and AD-related biomarkers could not be examined. However, this relationship should be investigated, as previous research has shown that having a BMI below 20 in older adulthood may increase risk for dementia (Fitzpatrick et al., 2009) . Another limitation is the selectivity of the sample. The findings of this study may not generalize to ethnic groups other than white, non-Hispanic/Latino older adults.\nAdditional work is necessary to determine how BMI and genetic risk for AD interact in other samples."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study reports that the combination of high BMI and high genetic risk for AD is associated with lower volume in the medial temporal lobe, and this relationship is more pronounced in females.
