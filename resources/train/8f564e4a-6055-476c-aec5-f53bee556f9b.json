[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: As neurodegeneration is recognized as a major contributor to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), brain atrophy quantification could have a high added value in clinical practice to assess treatment efficacy and disease progression, provided that it has a sufficiently low measurement error to draw meaningful conclusions for an individual patient.\nIn this paper, we present an automated longitudinal method based on Jacobian integration for measuring whole-brain and gray matter atrophy based on anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI), named MSmetrix. MSmetrix is specifically designed to measure atrophy in patients with MS, by including iterative lesion segmentation and lesion filling based on FLAIR and T1-weighted MRI scans.\nMSmetrix is compared with SIENA with respect to test-retest error and consistency, resulting in an average test-retest error on an MS data set of 0.13% (MSmetrix) and 0.17% (SIENA) and a consistency error of 0.07% (MSmetrix) and 0.05% (SIENA). On a healthy subject data set including physiological variability the test-retest is 0.19% (MSmetrix) and 0.31% (SIENA).\nConclusion: Therefore, we can conclude that MSmetrix could be of added value in clinical practice for the follow-up of treatment and disease progression in MS patients.\nbrain atrophy, magnetic resonance images, MSmetrix, multiple sclerosis 1 R&D, icometrix,"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "demyelination, studies have demonstrated that neurodegeneration develops along with inflammation and demyelination (Dutta & Trapp, 2007; Silber & Sharief, 1999) . In addition, it has been shown that the neurodegenerative component of MS is responsible for the irreversible disability and is prognostic for short-and long-term disability and cognitive decline (Bjartmar, Kidd, M\u00f6rk, Rudick, & Trapp, 2000) .\nIn recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans have been increasingly used to measure brain atrophy in MS patients.\nTypically, a volumetric T1-weighted MRI data set is used to calculate the whole-brain, WM, GM, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume or atrophy. It has been demonstrated that brain atrophy, as measured on MRI scans, is already present in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS and in patients with early (<5 years from diagnosis) definite MS (Chard et al., 2002; Chard & Miller, 2009; Henry et al., 2008; Raz et al., 2010) . In addition, it has been shown that brain atrophy occurs in all types of MS, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary and secondary progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS) (De Stefano et al., 2010; Tedeschi et al., 2005) . In contrast to WM atrophy, which is relatively constant across all disease stages, GM atrophy has been correlated with disease progression, physical disability, and cognitive impairment (Amato et al., 2004; Chard et al., 2004; Sanfilipo, Benedict, Sharma, Weinstock-Guttman, & Bakshi, 2005; Sanfilipo, Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman, & Bakshi, 2006; De Stefano et al., 2003) .\nAs neurodegeneration is recognized as an important aspect of MS and a major contributor to disability in MS, brain atrophy has been increasingly used in clinical trials as an outcome measure to assess treatment efficacy and disease progression. Studies with conventional therapies such as interferon-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate have shown only limited effects on brain atrophy (Filippi et al., 2004; Leary & Thompson, 2003; Molyneux et al., 2000) . However, the FREEDOMS study in patients with RRMS demonstrated that fingolimod significantly reduced brain atrophy over 2 years, compared with placebo (Radue et al., 2012; Silber et al., 2014) . In addition, it was reported in the TRANSFORMS study that MS patients on fingolimod had a lower brain atrophy rate compared to patients using intramuscular interferon-\u03b2-1a (Cohen et al., 2013) . Decreases in brain atrophy in RRMS patients have also been reported with laquinimod treatment (Comi et al., 2012) . Brown and Coles (2013) noted decreased brain atrophy in patients treated with alemtuzumab compared to interferon-\u03b2 for RRMS, while Portaccio et al. (2013) had similar findings of lower brain atrophy in patients treated with natalizumab compared to interferon-\u03b2.\nAn additional advantage of measuring brain atrophy in clinical trials is that 10 times less subjects need to be included, when the trial is powered on an outcome of a 50% reduction in MRI lesions and atrophy, compared to using disability endpoints (Polman et al., 2006; Sormani et al., 2001; Sormani, Arnold, & De Stefano, 2014; De Stefano et al., 2010) .\nDespite the importance of neurodegeneration in MS patients and the known positive effect of some drugs on slowing down this neurodegeneration, brain atrophy is currently not used in clinical practice to assess individual MS patients. As MS is a heterogeneous disease with a relatively unpredictable course, there is a clear need for objective measures that can be evaluated for individual patients and used for follow-up and treatment decisions. Several measures for disability are used, such as the Expanded Disability Status Score and the MS Functional Composite scale (Cutter et al., 1999; Kurtzke, 1983) . However, it is known that they can be unpredictable within the same patient, being characterized by phases with predominant occurrence of relapses versus progression. Although neurodegeneration is only one of many aspects of the disease, a reliable measure of brain atrophy on individual MS patients will help in making informed decisions and moving into a more personalized and evidence-based medicine in MS.\nTechniques to measure brain volume or brain volume loss can be subdivided into two main categories, that is, cross-sectional and longitudinal methods (Giorgio, Battaglini, Smith, & De Stefano, 2008; De Stefano et al., 2014) . Cross-sectional methods use a single MRI scan to segment specific tissues or structures. As a result, the volume of these tissue types and/or structures is calculated. Well-known and validated examples of these are BPF (Rudick, Fisher, Lee, Simon, & Jacobs, 1999) , SIENAX , and Freesurfer (Fischl et al., 2002) . In contrast to cross-sectional approaches, longitudinal methods take into account two MRI scans of the same subject from different time points to calculate brain volume changes or atrophy. Longitudinal methods typically try to match the two MRI scans using warping techniques and directly extract small changes in brain volume from this process (e.g., Boyes et al., 2006; Freeborough & Fox, 1997; Smith, De Stefano, Jenkinson, & Matthews, 2001) .\nA longitudinal method that is frequently used in clinical trials (see, e.g., Comi et al., 2013) is SIENA , while a longitudinal processing pipeline that can take more than two time points into account is included in FreeSurfer (Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, & Fischl, 2012) .\nWhen applying brain atrophy measures for individual MS patients, the measurement error of the method and thus the reliability becomes of paramount importance. It is indeed known that the average atrophy rate in MS patients is approximately 0.5%-1.3% per year, compared with 0.1%-0.4% per year in healthy individuals (Barkhof, Calabresi, Miller, & Reingold, 2009; Fotenos, Mintun, Snyder, Morris, & Buckner, 2008; Simon, 2006) . The measurement error of the brain atrophy measure therefore needs to be very low, in order to draw meaningful conclusions in individual patients. This includes a robustness of the method toward daily physiological processes that might affect brain volume.\nIn this paper, an automated longitudinal registration-based method is proposed to measure whole-brain and GM atrophy by performing Jacobian integration within the segmentations, with the Jacobian extracted from the registration. The longitudinal method is initialized by a cross-sectional method providing lesion filled images as well as the segmentations. In order to assess the method's future applicability for atrophy quantification of individual MS patients, the paper is focused on the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method will be evaluated in terms of measurement error, robustness toward physiological processes and consistency.

The affine registration consists of (1) a rigid registration based on the whole image, (2) an affine registration based on the skull to compensate for small scaling differences due to distortions, and (3) a rigid registration on the whole brain in order to correct for small translation and rotation errors in the skull based co-registration.\nThe rigid and/or affine registration is based on a block matching approach (Ourselin et al., 2001) . To improve the robustness of each coregistration, a symmetric approach (Modat et al., 2014 ) is used, which imposes, in theory, that the transformations are diffeomorphic. For the skull image, required in step (2), the region around the brain is used.\nThis region is computed by binary dilating the brain mask, available F I G U R E 1 Schematic overview of MSmetrixlong. MSmetrix-long starts with a quality control of the images. Subsequently, MSmetrix-cross is performed for each time point. The results from the cross-sectional step are used to initialize the longitudinal pipeline. In the longitudinal step, the brain atrophy is calculated based on a Jacobian integration in both directions from the cross-sectional pipeline, with a kernel of 20 mm and subsequently subtracting the brain mask.\nIn the third step, the affinely registered and bias-corrected T1-weighted images are nonrigidly registered. This registration is again performed in both directions, respectively, from the first to the second and from the second to the first time point. The nonrigid registration (Modat et al., 2010) uses normalized mutual information (NMI) as similarity and B-splines to restrict the deformation, with a final grid spacing of two voxels. The registration algorithm makes use of a multiresolution approach with two levels (grid space 4 and 2 mm, respectively) to allow sufficiently large deformation in order to capture the expected maximal atrophy between the time points (\u00b15%). Furthermore, an additional penalty term is added for the Jacobian determinant of the deformation field, which slightly penalizes large local variations in the deformation field. In this way, we ensure plausible deformation fields.\nThus, the objective function is based on the NMI similarity measure and a log of the Jacobian determinant penalty term with weight = 0.95\nfor the former and 0.05 for the latter term.\nIn the fourth and final step, the percentage volume change between the scans is calculated based on a Jacobian integration of the "}, {"section_title": "| SIENA(X)", "text": "SIENA and SIENAX are part of the FMRIB Software Library (http:// www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), and refer to the longitudinal brain atrophy and cross-sectional brain volume measurement, respectively Zhang, Brady, & Smith, 2001 ).

Subsequently, voxels within the obtained brain mask are classified in several classes, depending on the image intensities.

Each row shows test and retest segmentations for Philips (top), Siemens (middle), and GE (bottom). GM segmentation is marked with teal The MSmetrix software pipeline is specifically designed to measure atrophy in patients with MS, by including iterative lesion segmentation and lesion filling based on FLAIR and T1-weighted MRI scans. In this context, it is known that applying brain volume measures without performing lesion filling can introduce errors between 0.3% and 2.5%, depending on the lesion size and lesion intensity (Battaglini, Jenkinson, & De Stefano, 2012; Chard, Jackson, Miller, & Wheeler-Kingshott, 2010; Popescu et al., 2014) .\nWhen brain atrophy measures are introduced in clinical practice for individual MS patients, interpretation of these results should be done with caution. In this context, it is indeed known that there are many confounding factors that can affect the measurement of brain atrophy and therefore the interpretation of the results (Bermel & Bakshi, 2006; Simon, 2006; Zivadinov & Minagar, 2009 ). For example, it is known that brain volume changes are not only caused by neuronal or axonal loss but that also demyelination and inflammation can play a role (Giorgio et al., 2008) . In addition, brain volume loss as measured using MRI is affected by the use of steroids or some disease modifying therapies. It has indeed been demonstrated that their anti-inflammatory properties decrease the brain volume in the first 6 months to 1 year of treatment, typically referred to as pseudoatrophy (Zivadinov et al., 2008) . In this context, it was suggested that the measurement of GM volume loss is less susceptible to this pseudoatrophy compared to whole-brain or WM volume changes (Nakamura, Fox, & Fisher, 2011; Tiberio et al., 2005) .\nSince the difference between brain atrophy in MS patients (0.5%-1.3% yearly atrophy) and healthy subjects (0.1%-0.4% yearly atrophy)\nis small, and clinicians would like to assess if an individual patient is stable on brain atrophy or not, a small measurement error is of paramount importance to draw meaningful conclusions in clinical practice (Barkhof et al., 2009; Fotenos et al., 2008; Simon, 2006) . This paper focuses on the reliability of the methods on MRI data sets from MS patients acquired using a \"clinical\" MRI protocol. In order to introduce brain atrophy measures in clinical practice, acceptable measurement and reproducibility errors are required on MRI scans that can be obtained in a clinical setting with a limited acquisition time.\nIn contrast to most other studies that have investigated such errors of brain atrophy measures, for this paper, repeat scans were acquired on patients with MS instead of on healthy subjects (Cover et al., 2011; Maclaren et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2001) . As a result, the errors presented in this paper can be seen as representative for a clinical setting for patients with MS.\nMSmetrix-long results on data set 1 demonstrated a small measurement error across the three 3T scanners, with a median value of 0.13% over all scanners. These errors are within the tolerance level that might be attributed to normal variations in healthy controls, but are lower than the expected atrophy levels in pathology. Although the results of SIENA were not significantly different based on a parametric and nonparametric statistical test (p > .05), a larger median value (0.17%) over all scanners was observed for SIENA. This error can change when using different parameter settings of SIENA, for example, for this data set, the median absolute error was double if we kept the default parameter values. We tried to use optimal settings, as were described in the literature (Popescu et al., 2012) .\nNote that is has been demonstrated in the past that using crosssectional methods to measure atrophy results in much higher errors compared to longitudinal approaches (Durand-Dubief et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2002) . Our results confirm these findings. The measurement errors for the cross-sectional methods were significantly higher than those of the longitudinal methods (p < .01 for both parametric and nonparametric tests).\nThe test-retest error for whole-brain and GM atrophy computed by MSmetrix-cross was lower than for SIENAX. These relatively lower measurement error for MSmetrix-cross compared to SIENAX might contribute to the lower values of MSmetrix-long compared to SIENA, as they are used as input data. The reported values for SIENA and SIE-NAX are similar to that observed by Smith et al. (2001 Smith et al. ( , 2002 , even though scans in their study were obtained from healthy subjects.\nIn addition to the measurement error, robustness toward daily physiological processes is evaluated using data set 2, where MSmetrixlong still results in a small overall error for whole-brain atrophy, while SIENA shows a significant larger error compared to MSmetrix-long. A median absolute value of 0.19% was observed for MSmetrix-long and of 0.31% for SIENA for whole-brain atrophy. For GM, the median absolute value is 0.23% for MSmetrix-long. This indicates that MSmetrixlong is more robust toward daily physiological effects than SIENA.\nFinally, the consistency of the methods is assessed using data set 3. No significant differences were observed between MSmetrix-long and SIENA in terms of the CI for 6-month intervals compared to the 1-year interval of the whole-brain atrophy.\nIt is important to notice that in addition to small errors, including measurement errors, robustness toward daily physiological processes and consistency, the brain atrophy software should still be sensitive enough to detect small changes. This can be evaluated on longitudinal MRI data of MS patients. Although there is no ground truth available of the exact changes in brain atrophy that should be detected, our results suggest that MSmetrix has a high correlation with SIENA, which has already been used as surrogate outcome measure in several MS clinical trials. Also, the sensitivity of MSmetrix-long has been demonstrated in other domains, that is, the detection of dehydration effects and separating healthy controls from Alzheimer patients . In view of the measurement errors reported in this paper, one should consider as potentially pathological change any whole-brain atrophy levels exceeding, for example, 0.7%-1% per year.\nIn this work, we have also shown that GM atrophy can be measured automatically alongside whole-brain atrophy using MSmetrixlong. Although the absolute measurement errors are higher than those for whole brain, the approach still has potential to detect GM atrophy reliably if this is abnormally large and should prompt immediate therapy re-evaluation (e.g., >1.5% per year).\nNote that the results on GM atrophy measurement were not directly compared against another longitudinal technique in this paper. The widely used SIENA does not return GM atrophy. Other approaches for longitudinal atrophy computations are, like SIENA, not specifically designed for MS, and thus lesion filling is often recommended as a preprocessing step before applying these methods. For instance, the longitudinal brain segmentation pipeline (Reuter et al., 2012) included in FreeSurfer offers the possibility to compute volume changes of brain substructures, after transforming multiple time point images to a common subject-specific template space. In MS patients, a disadvantage might be that large deviations between the individual time points (e.g., large atrophy or the presence of large new lesions)\nmight have an unpredictable effect on the template creation or might bias the results of individual time points toward the common template.\nWe could conclude that due to the low measurement error, MSmetrix-long could be of added value to the clinical practice for the follow-up of treatment and disease progression in MS patients.
