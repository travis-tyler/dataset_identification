[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Head Start program is a large-scale educational and care program for economically disadvantaged preschool children and their families. In particular, it focuses on helping children develop the early reading and math skills. Since its launch in 1965, the mixed effects of Head Start have been debated. One of the main reasons is that there are few studies using randomized experiment design and the most are observational studies. In an observational study, the effect estimates of Head Start can be biased due to the observable and unobservable factors which affect the selection into the Head Start program and the outcomes of participants. In order to obtain causal inference in observational studies, researchers have applied propensity score and instrumental variable (IV) methods to examine the effects of Head Start (e.g., Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007;Zhai, 2007). One of the assumptions for propensity score and IV methods to lead to unbiased estimates of treatment effects from an observational study is that there are no unmeasured confounders for the assignment of treatment and for the assignment of IV variable, respectively (Rosenbaum, 2002b). Hence, it is desirable to learn how the inference about treatment effects would be altered by hidden biases of various magnitudes in an observational study using propensity score or IV method."}, {"section_title": "Purpose/objective/research question/focus of study:", "text": "Description of what the research focused on and why. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), this paper applied optimal propensity score matching method to evaluate the effects of Head Start on children's kindergarten retention, reading and math achievement in fall kindergarten comparing with center-based care. Both parametric and nonparametric methods are used for impact analyses. Sensitivity analysis is conduced to assess the influence of hidden biases of various magnitudes."}, {"section_title": "Setting:", "text": "Specific description of where the research took place. The data come from children's family, kindergarten, and schools. The optimal propensity score matching algorithm is better than greedy matching (the nearest neighbor matching) in that it minimizes the overall distance between propensity scores (Rosenbaum, 2002b). Data are matched using SAS PROC ASSIGN (Coca-Perraillon, 2007;Ming & Rosenbaum, 2001). Backward logistic regression is used to estimate propensity score 2 . Covariate balance is tested for unmatched data and matched data respectively (Table 1 &  The propensity score is the probability that a person with observed covariates receives the treatment rather than the control (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). The optimal propensity score matching is to form the matched pairs to minimize the overall absolute propensity score differences between the matched pairs (Rosenbaum, 2002b). Propensity score method is an effective tool for adjusting for the measured confounders (overt biases). 2 The logistic regression model Wald chi-square = 2106.73, p -value < 0.0001. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness fit test p -value = 0.21, which indicates plausibility of the model. Overall accuracy for identifying presence and absence of assignment to treatment group (Head Start) as based on conjoint maximum sensitivity and specificity levels, corresponding to the area under the receive operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 81.0%. The covariates in matching, covariates are much more balanced, however, there are three slightly unbalanced covariates. Thus, covariance adjustment is used in analyses. Impact analyses using Ordinary Least Square regression (OLS) by regressing outcome difference between treated and control child in each pair on covariate difference between the covariates in each pair. In addition, in order to obtain more robust results, nonparametric estimate (Hodges Lehmann estimate with covariance adjustment) on matched data are conducted since there are some outliers for the outcome measures of reading and math, and the outcome measures are not normally distributed (Figure 3 -6) 3 . Impact estimates using OLS to analyze original unmatched data were provided for comparison. Furthermore, sensitivity intervals of impact estimate with covariance adjustment based on Wilcoxon singed rank statistic are provided to illustrate the effect of hidden biases of various magnitudes (Rosenbaum, 2002a(Rosenbaum, , 2002b . The formula of the 95% Sensitivity Intervals is given in Appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Findings/Results:", "text": "Description of main findings with specific details. 14 points IRT score lower than peers in center-based care in reading and math in fall kindergarten, respectively (pvalue < 0.0001). The corresponding standardized effect sizes are -0.32 and -0.31 for reading and the final propensity score estimate model include: Black, Hispanic, other race, birth weight, disability status, number of sibling, mother working status during pregnancy to kindergarten, mother marriage status in birth, SES, poverty level, location (rural or not), SES*poverty, and black* poverty. 3 P -values of Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling test are all less than 0.01. 4 A sensitivity analysis is a specific statement about the magnitude of hidden bias that would need to be present to explain the associations actually observed in a particular study (Rosenbaum, 2002a(Rosenbaum, , 2002b. Suppose there is an unobserved covariate u that determines the probability of a child participating in Head Start (receiving treatment) in addition to the observed covariates x . The sensitivity analysis model has two parts, a logit form linking treatment \uf070 is the probability that child j receives the treatment (participating in Head Start). ( ) \uf06b \uf0d7 is an unknown function and \uf067 is an unknown parameter. \uf047 = e \uf067 is the odds ratio of j receives the treatment (participating in Head Start) compared to k receiving treatment. If \uf047 = 1, i.e., \uf067 = 0, then study is free of hidden bias. For \uf047 > 1 there is hidden bias. \uf047 is a measure of the degree of departure from a study that is free of hidden bias. Consider the additive treatment effect model A 95% sensitivity interval for impact estimate ( \uf062 ) with sensitivity parameter \uf047 is a random interval that in at least 95% of studies will contain the true \uf062 assuming that the true \uf067 , call it 0 \uf067 satisfies exp( 0 \uf067 ) \uf0a3 \uf047 (Rosenbaum, 2002b). math respectively 5 . Using the same matched data, the nonparametric estimate (Hodges Lehmann estimate) with covariate adjustment gives us smaller results (-1.92 for reading and math both). Furthermore, using unmatched data, OLS gives us slightly different estimate in math (-2.07), but much more different estimate in reading (-2.57). The standardized effect size for reading and math are -0.24 and -0.22 respectively 6 . Table 4 presents the impact estimates of kindergarten retention of Head Start comparing with center-based care. Using logistic regression to analyze unmatched data and matched data gives us almost identical results. The odd ratio estimates of Kindergarten retention for children in Head Start comparing peers in center-based care are 1.04 with 95% confidence interval (0.65, 1.69) and 1.05 with 95% confidence interval (0.71, 1.57), respectively for using matched data and using unmatched data. Neither estimate is statistically significant. It suggests that there is no different impact on kindergarten retention between Head Start and center-based care. Table 5 presents the 95% sensitivity intervals of impact estimates of reading based on Wilcoxon signed rank test with covariance adjustment. If the study is free of hidden bias ( \uf047 = 1), the 95% Hodges Lehmann estimate on reading based on Wilcoxon signed rank test is (-2.51, -1.34). When \uf047 = 1.43, the 95% sensitivity interval would include 0, which suggests the impact is not statistically significant. In other word, if \uf047 = 1.43, matched children differ by a factor of 1.43 times in their odds of participating in Head Start due to differences in the unobserved covariate. In this case, there is no statistical difference in reading achievement between children in Head Start and in center-based care. This indicates that the impact estimate is sensitive to hidden bias. Table 6 presents the 95% sensitivity intervals of impact estimates of math based on Wilcoxon signed rank test with covariance adjustment. Similarly, if the study is free of hidden bias ( \uf047 = 1), the 95% sensitivity interval of impact estimate on math based on Wilcoxon signed rank test is (-2.48, -1.37). When \uf047 = 1.42, the 95% sensitivity interval would include 0, which suggests the impact is not statistically significant. In other word, if \uf047 = 1.42, matched children differ by a factor of 1.42 times in their odds of participating in Head Start due to differences in the unobserved covariate. In this case, there is no statistical difference in math achievement between children in Head Start and in center-based care. This also indicates that the impact estimate is sensitive to hidden bias."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions:", "text": "Description of conclusions and recommendations of author(s) based on findings and over study. (To support the theme of 2009 conference, authors are asked to describe how their conclusions and recommendations might inform one or more of the above noted decisions-curriculum, teaching and teaching quality, school organization, and education policy.) Children in Head Start program tend to perform statistically significantly worse than peers in center-based care in reading and math in fall kindergarten. However, the sensitivity intervals of impact estimate based on Wilcoxon signed rank test with covariance adjustment indicate that the conclusion above is sensitive to hidden bias. When \uf047 > 1.43, i.e., matched children differ by a factor of above 1.43 times in their odds of participating in Head Start due to differences in the unobserved covariate, the impact on reading and math between Head Start and center-based care will have no statistically significant difference. Besides, there is no statistically difference of the effect on kindergarten retention between Head Start and center-based care. Optimal propensity score matching method and OLS regression on unmatched data method gave us almost identical results on estimates of math and kindergarten retention, but a little different of reading. In observational study, in theory propensity score method can perform better than direct OLS regression in terms of adjusting for measured confounders (overt biases). However, the improvement is limited in this case. This conclusion is consistent with Bloom, Michalopoulos, & Hill (2005). Furthermore, since there are some outliers in the outcome measures of reading and math, and the outcome measures are not normally distributed, the distribution-free Hodges-Lehmann estimate based on the Wilcoxon signed rank test is more robust."}, {"section_title": "C-1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Appendix B.
