The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a long history of examining social inequities in health, disease, and mortality and developing programs to reduce health inequities among populations that experience increased risk of poor health based on race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), rural/urban residence, and housing status. [1] [2] [3] [4] One of the earliest studies undertaken more than a century ago examined the impact of poverty, housing condition, sanitation, nutrition, and medical care during pregnancy on infant mortality in the United States. [5] Decades of studies have found marked socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and occupational disparities in mortality and life expectancy among Americans, identifying population groups that have not fully shared the Nation's health and longevity gains.

[1, 9] These social and/or demographic characteristics of individuals, groups, communities, and societies have been shown to have powerful influences on health and well-being at the individual and population levels. Examples of individual or group-level social determinants include gender, race/ethnicity, SES, social class, education, income, occupation, employment status, housing tenure, immigrant status, language use, disability status, and social capital. Social determinants at the population level include socioeconomic deprivation, poverty rate, income inequality, educational opportunity, labor market structure, affordable housing, access to healthy foods/good nutrition, provision of health services, access to essential goods and services, transportation infrastructure, physical and built environments, racial/ethnic population composition, medically underserved or health professional shortage areas, and spending on public safety, social and welfare services. Social determinants at the population level are considered underlying, upstream, or more fundamental determinants of health and disease and are amenable to change through public policy.\nthat are deemed to be unfair, unjust, avoidable or unnecessary that can be reduced or remedied through policy action. [13, 14] The concepts of health inequities and health disparities (broadly defined as systematic differences in health between social groups) are generally similar in that they both involve normative judgements about the nature of socialgroup differences. [14] In this study, the terms, health inequities, health disparities, and health inequalities are used interchangeably."}, {"section_title": "Healthy People Initiative", "text": "In 1980, HHS introduced a national initiative in disease prevention and health promotion called Healthy People. [1] This health initiative presents a national strategy for increasing the span of healthy life among Americans, reducing and ultimately eliminating health disparities among Americans, and providing access to preventive health services for all Americans. [1] Since the launching of this national effort, states and other geographic areas, such as counties, cities, metropolitan areas, and rural communities have become increasingly interested in population health monitoring and in providing background data needed to understand a population=s health equity issues. [11] The health initiative sets objectives for each decade. The current initiative, Healthy People 2020, was launched in 2010, while Healthy People 2030 is currently being developed. [1] Population health monitoring includes documenting health-related data over time for various communities and subgroups of the population. It also involves analyses of health differentials and inequities according to important personal and societal characteristics that are amenable to change through social and public policy interventions. In recent decades, health statistics in the US have become increasingly available according to a wide array of relevant socioeconomic, demographic, behavioral, and health care characteristics. Availability of these data has created opportunities for us to enhance our understanding of the most fundamental reasons for changes in population health or persistent health disparities among various societal groups and geographic areas and to develop and implement effective evidence-based policies. [11] Remarkable achievements have been made in improving the overall health of the US population during the past several decades, particularly in terms of increasing the life expectancy and reducing overall mortality among Americans. [2, 3, 15] However, substantial variations in health among various social groups and geographic areas continue to exist, and, in many instances, health disparities appear to be widening.\n[2,3, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Social factors, whether expressed in terms of education, occupation, income, wealth, social class, ethnicity, family structure, or living arrangements, remain underlying and fundamental determinants of health and disease. While these social characteristics themselves may not be direct determinants of health, they can create conditions or circumstances that give rise to risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol and drug use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, obesity, and hypertension) which cause disease, ill health, and death. [11, 22] The social determinants involve such resources as \"knowledge, money, power, prestige, and social connections that strongly influence people's ability to avoid risks and to minimize the consequences of disease once it occurs\". [26] Inequities in health are closely linked to social inequities through several intervening mechanisms, including health behaviors, medical care, working conditions, environmental exposure, personality, and early life conditions.

Analysis covers a broad range of areas, including maternal and child health, health care access and quality, HIV/AIDS, mental and behavioral health, chronic disease prevention and health promotion, rural-urban and geographic disparities, with a particular focus on social inequalities in life expectancy, infant mortality, and mortality from leading causes of death.\nEmphasizing the role of social determinants of health is important for several reasons.

However, health inequities are not just about addressing differences between the rich and the poor. Rather, the consistently inverse socioeconomic gradients in health found across many industrialized societies indicate that the health deficit of a population is concentrated in the middle classes because of the large numbers of people in those categories. [11, 12] To achieve health equity and to maximize health improvement, it therefore makes sense to focus on health differences across the entire social hierarchy or socioeconomic continuum. Second, documenting health inequities according to social factors can help identify social groups who are at greatest risk of poor health and who are therefore in need of social and medical services. Third, considering social factors along with behavioral and health care factors can help us understand the mechanisms through which social factors affect health. A better understanding of the pathways through which social determinants influence health and disease outcomes should help us develop and implement more effective social and public health interventions for population health improvement.

In the US, data on Hispanic origin and race/ethnicity are collected separately in the census and numerous other programs. [3, 32] Hispanics can be of any race; however, a majority (65%) of Hispanics identify themselves as whites. [32] To develop a mutually exclusive and exhaustive variable of race/ethnicity, the Hispanic-origin item is often cross-classified with race. [32] About 85% of the total white population is non-Hispanic, while 97% of the black or African American population is non-Hispanic. [32] The 2015 data in Figure 1 indicate two times higher poverty rates among American Indians/Alaska Natives [AIANs] (26.6%), black/ African-Americans (25.4%), Hispanics (22.6%), and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (18.9%), compared with non-Hispanic whites (10.4%). [32] Unemployment rates are more than two times higher among AIANs and blacks compared to non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders have 50% higher unemployment rates than non-Hispanic whites. There are substantial disparities in educational attainment; 52.3% of Asian Americans in 2015 had a college degree, compared with 34.2% of non-Hispanic whites, 20.2% of blacks, 14.1% of AIANs, 15.7% of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and 14.8% of Hispanics. [32] Ethnic-minority groups are also more likely to live in low-income and disadvantaged neighborhoods and communities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. [23] Geographic patterns in educational attainment indicate that the population in the Southeastern region of the US has had the lowest percentage of adults with a college degree although education levels in all regions have improved over time (Figure 2 ). The geographic pattern in poverty rates has remained essentially the same over time, with communities in the Southeastern and Southwestern regions experiencing higher poverty rates than those in the other regions of the US (Figure 3 ). The unemployment map shows wide geographic disparities; many counties in the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western United States had at least 9% of their workforce unemployed during the 2011-2015 time period (Figure 4) . The geographic map of English language proficiency shows many counties in the Western and Southwestern United States with at least 10% of the population speaking English not well or not at all ( Figure 5 ).\nEthnic-minority groups are more likely to be without health insurance than non-Hispanic whites. 2015, 22.8% of adults with less than a high school education lacked health insurance, compared with only 3.9% of adults with a college degree. Nearly 28% of unemployed individuals lacked health insurance, compared with 11% of employed individuals. In 2015, 17.2% of those with income levels below 138% of the poverty threshold were uninsured, compared with 3.3% of those with incomes at or above 400% of the poverty threshold.\n[32]"}, {"section_title": "Disparities in life expectancy", "text": "Life expectancy at birth has improved substantially during the past six and half decades, increasing from 69.7 years for the total US population in 1950 to 78.8 years in 2015.

[30] According to the 2011-2012 NSCH, 8.8% of children were reported to have asthma currently (Table 1) . [31] The prevalence of asthma varied by a number of sociodemographic factors, including race/ ethnicity, family structure, household language use, education, income/poverty level, housing tenure, and place of residence. Non-Hispanic black children had two times higher asthma prevalence than nonHispanic white children. Children living below the poverty line were 56% more likely to have asthma than children with family incomes at or above 400% of the poverty threshold. Children living in unsafe neighborhoods or in neighborhoods with poor housing were 32% more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than children in safe neighborhoods or neighborhoods with good housing.

[15, 29] There are marked gender, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in allcause mortality and mortality from leading causes of death. Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) (including heart disease and stroke) mortality rates declined for all major racial/ethnic groups over the past several decades, compared to whites in 2015, blacks had 28% higher CVD mortality and APIs, AIANs, and Hispanics had 29-42% lower mortality ( Figure 13 ). [15, 19] Geographic differences in all-cause and CVD mortality show higher risks of CVD mortality in the Southeastern region of the US even though mortality rates have declined in all regions and states (Figures 14 and 15) . [20] CVD mortality rates are higher among individuals and areas with lower SES. [19] For example, men and women with low education and incomes have 46-76% higher CVD mortality than their counterparts with high education and income levels. Men in clerical, service, farming, craft, repair, construction, and transport occupations, and manual laborers have 30-58% higher CVD mortality risks than those employed in executive and managerial occupations. Among women, those employed in sales and service occupations, respectively, have 17% and 29% higher CVD mortality risks, and those in transport occupations have 2.6 times higher mortality risks than those in executive and managerial occupations. [19] Compared to whites, cancer mortality rates in 2014 were 15% higher for blacks but 34% lower for AIANs, 39% lower for APIs, and 32% lower for Hispanics. [15] SES is inversely related to overall cancer mortality as well as mortality from major cancer sites such as lung, colorectal, cervical, stomach, liver, and esophageal cancer. [22] During the 2003-2011 time period, men with less than a high school education had 68% higher cancer mortality than those with a college degree, whereas men below the poverty level had 80% higher cancer mortality than men with incomes \u2265600% of the poverty level.\nMen with less than a high school education and those below the poverty level had 2.6 times higher lung cancer mortality than their more educated and affluent counterparts. Education and income levels were also inversely related to lung cancer mortality among women. Men and women with less than a high school education had, respectively, 42% and 120% higher colorectal cancer mortality risks than those with a college degree. During the 2003-2011 time period, women with less than a high school education and below the poverty level had 6.3 and 4.0 times higher cervical cancer mortality than women with the highest education and income levels, respectively. [22] Compared to white women in 2014, black women had 3.3 times higher cervical cancer mortality and API, AIAN, and Hispanic women had 1.3-1.5 times higher mortality rates. [15] County maps indicate higher risks of all-cancer mortality in the Southeastern region and Eastern half of the US, with mortality rates declining in several regions during 1998-2014 (Figure 16 ).\nCOPD mortality is highest among whites, who have a 4-fold higher mortality risk than APIs. COPD mortality is also substantially lower in blacks, AIANs, and Hispanics compared to whites. [15] Figure 17 indicates higher COPD mortality rates in Appalachia and the Western half of the US, with rates increasing in many counties over time. Compared to whites, diabetes mortality is two times higher among blacks and at least 60% higher among AIANs and Hispanics. Geographic maps indicate substantially higher rates of diabetes mortality in the Southeast, Southwest and Appalachian regions than elsewhere in the US ( Figure 18 ). Blacks experience 2.5 times higher kidney disease mortality than whites. AIANs have higher unintentional injury mortality than whites, who, in turn, have higher mortality rates than blacks, Hispanics, and APIs. County maps indicate higher rates of unintentional injury mortality in the Western and Appalachian counties, with rates increasing over time in several parts of the country ( Figure 19 ). Unintentional injury mortality rates for non-Hispanic whites rose by 39% during 1999-2015, with steep increases in drug overdose deaths contributing greatly to the rising trend. Suicide rates are 2.7 times higher among whites and 2.0 times higher among AIANs compared to blacks. There has been an upward trend in suicide mortality, with rates increasing consistently from 10.5 in 1999 to 13.3 per 100,000 population in 2015.

The overall homicide rate is nearly 8 times higher among blacks and 2 times higher among AIANs and Hispanics compared to whites. [15] Homicide rates were stable between 1999 and 2015. Homicide rates are higher in the Southeast and Southwest regions than elsewhere in the US (Figure 21 ). Drug overdose deaths have contributed to the recent rise in mortality among middle-aged white Americans. [21] Rising deaths from drug overdose have been identified as a major public health problem in the United States. [35] In 2015, non-Hispanic whites had the highest rate of drug overdose mortality, 79% higher than the rate for Blacks, 7.6 times higher than the rate for APIs, and 2.8 times higher than the rate for Hispanics. [35] Geographic patterns in drug overdose mortality show a marked increase in drug overdose mortality between 2000 and 2015 in most areas, with higher rates of mortality observed in many counties of Appalachia and the Western United States (Figure 22) . [36] Between 2010 and 2015, drug overdose mortality increased more rapidly in rural areas than in urban areas (270% vs. 150%). In 2015, non-metropolitan counties had slightly higher drug overdose mortality than metropolitan counties although rates tended to be the highest in the mid-and small-size metropolitan counties and the lowest in large metropolitan counties (Figure 23 ).\nAlthough HIV/AIDS is not a leading cause of death for the total US population, it is the sixth leading cause of death among blacks aged 20-54 years. [15] In 2014, HIV/AIDS mortality was 9.6 times higher among blacks and 2.2 times higher among Hispanics compared to whites. [15] Although HIV/AIDS mortality has declined dramatically since 1987, socioeconomic disparities remain substantial. During the 2010-2014 time period, individuals in the lowest socioeconomic quintile had 3.0 times higher HIV/AIDS mortality than those in the highest socioeconomic quintile (Figure 24) . [23] County maps in Figure 25 show huge reductions in HIV/AID mortality since the peak years of the epidemic in the early 1990s for most counties and geographic regions, with higher HIV/AIDS mortality being concentrated in the Southern US in more recent time periods.\n[23]"}, {"section_title": "Disparities in prevalence of major chronic conditions and risk factors", "text": "Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and COPD are the leading chronic diseases affecting the US adult population.

However, unemployed adults were 67% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than those working full time. Regarding mental health problems, 8.3 million or 3.6% of US adults in 2015 experienced serious psychological distress during the past one month. Asians reported the lowest prevalence of psychological distress, whereas Native Hawaiians/ Other Pacific Islanders and mixed-race adults had the highest prevalence, 9.3% and 9.5% respectively (Table 3) . Adults without a job or with lower education and income levels were at an increased risk of psychological distress. Adults with an annual family income <$35,000 were 5.4 times more likely to experience serious psychological distress than those with annual family incomes of $100,000 or more.\nSmoking, obesity, and hypertension are major risk factors that are associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity from several chronic diseases such as CVD, cancer, diabetes, and COPD. Marked socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in smoking; adults with annual family incomes <$35,000 have a 3.6 times higher current smoking rate than those with family income \u2265100,000 ( Figure 27 ).

Discussion, Conclusions, and Global"}, {"section_title": "Health Implications", "text": "In this paper, we have analyzed major health inequality trends affecting America's diverse, vulnerable, and socially disadvantaged populations. Although substantial progress has been made in improving the health and well-being of all Americans, health inequities between population groups and geographic areas have persisted and remain marked, which represents a major area of policy concern. Striking disparities are found in a number of health indicators, including life expectancy, infant mortality, CVD, cancer, diabetes, COPD, HIV/AIDS, health care access and utilization, health insurance, mental health, smoking, obesity, drug overdose mortality, suicide, homicide, and unintentional injuries. Social inequalities in health tend to be larger in the US than in many other industrialized countries. This gap is particularly true for infant mortality and life expectancy, where the US lags behind other industrialized countries as the pace of improvements in these indicators has not kept up with that for other nations. [24, 37, 38] There are wide racial/ethnic and gender disparities in life expectancy, including a gap of more than 17 years in life expectancy between black men (72.3 years) and API women (89.7 years). Ruralurban disparities in life expectancy have widened over time as rural residents recorded smaller gains in life expectancy during 1990-2014 than their urban counterparts. Life expectancy currently ranges from 74.5 years for men in rural areas to 82.4 years for women in large metropolitan areas. Although infant mortality rates declined dramatically during the past eight decades, racial disparities widened over time. Currently black infants have 2.3 times higher mortality rates than white infants (11.4 vs. 4.9 per 1,000 live births). Infant and child mortality is markedly higher in rural areas and poor communities. Black infants Causes of the health disparities reported here are multifactorial in nature. Research indicates that differences in social and built environments, socioeconomic and living conditions, health-risk behaviors such as tobacco use, obesity, lack of access to healthy foods, and access to and use of quality health care services are important social determinants contributing to persistent health disparities between population groups and geographic areas. [1, 2, 21] Although reduced smoking, greater physical activity, lower obesity, healthy diet, higher seatbelt use, avoiding substance use, and improved access to and use of health care services can lead to improvements in population health and health equity, these factors are themselves primarily influenced by broader, more upstream social determinants such as education, income, social and welfare services, affordable housing, job creation, labor market opportunities, and transportation. [16, 17, 21, 22] Addressing inequities in these social determinants should be an important area of focus from both research and policy standpoints. Since policy action on many of the social determinants goes beyond the traditional health sector and since health inequities are multifaceted, a multi-sectoral approach involving health, education, nutrition, housing, urban planning, transportation, and economic sectors is needed to tackle health inequalities effectively. [10, 39] Such an approach calls for increased collaboration between public and private sectors and various stakeholders including state and local agencies and emphasizes the need for community-based approaches to reducing health disparities in the United States. [10, 39, 40] Investing in early childhood education and development has been suggested as a cost-effective strategy for preventing disease and increasing productivity later in life. [41] Several US federal programs, such as Healthy Start, Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, and Title V MCH Block Grant Programs, are excellent programmatic efforts that emphasize investments in early child development, leading to positive health outcomes not only during childhood but throughout the life course. [42] Other federally sponsored communitybased programs have proven effective in reducing smoking and obesity-related chronic diseases and promoting positive health behaviors such as good nutrition and increased physical activity. [21] Federal health care programs, particularly the Health Center Program, work to mitigate adverse health effects of social disadvantage, poverty, and unfavorable living conditions by providing increased access to health and social services to vulnerable populations who otherwise would lack or be unable to afford such services.
