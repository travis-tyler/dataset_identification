This relatively 218 weak threshold allows the detection of TDVs at an early stage, but stronger TC-like systems have a 219 too large TDV area at \u0394\u03c60 with ill-defined characteristics. The TDV area is thus computed for a 220 series of deeper thresholds (i.e., < -80m 2 s -2 ) and the first threshold giving an equivalent radius of 221 the TDV area lower than 3\u00b0 of latitude-longitude is retained. For developed cyclones, this 222 threshold may be less than -1200m 2 s -2 . 223\nThe tracking of a given TDV is performed by considering the overlap between TDV areas in two 224 consecutive time steps. If several TDVs are overlapping, only the TDV with the largest overlap is 225 considered for the continuity of the tracking. Each TDV is thus represented by time series for its 226 location and for other characteristics of the TDV area (maximum surface wind, maximum vorticity 227 at 850hPa, maximum geopotential perturbation \u0394\u03c6, minimum surface pressure, etc.). 228\nHere, since we are mostly interested in simulation of the TC activity over the North Atlantic Ocean, 229\nwe only consider TDVs that are initiated south of 40\u00b0N and that spend at least two days over the 230 tropical North Atlantic waters. These TDVs are called Atlantic TDVs, or simply TDVs here. This 231 means that TDVs that initiate over West Africa but dissipate before reaching the Atlantic are not 232 considered. In fact, some TDVs initiated over West Africa near the eastern side of the zoom (see 233 Fig.1 ) are partly forced by the nudging toward ERA-I. However, the dissipation or maintenance of 234 these TDVs as they propagate westward toward the African west coast and over the Atlantic is 235 fully determined by the LMDZ model. 236\nThe strength of a given TDV is characterized by Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) computed on 237 the basis of the maximum surface wind vmax in the TDV area at each time step. The values in the 238 model are not directly comparable to the observed ACE since the maximum surface wind 239 perturbations in the simulation and in the re-analyses are far weaker than the maximum 240 sustained winds in real observed TCs.

This tracking 251 algorithm first identifies TC-like features with a maximum local relative vorticity (850hPa), 252 minimum surface pressure and a warm core (defined by the local temperature anomaly). To be 253 considered as a possible TC-like storm, these features must last at least 2 days (non-consecutive). 254\nOnce these potential TCs are identified, in the 2 nd part of the algorithm, these storms are tracked 255 using a relaxed vorticity threshold (i.e., lower than in the 1 st part of the algorithm) by connecting 256 the vorticity centroid every 6-hours. This algorithm has been extensively used in global (Camargo 257 The CZ02 scheme was initially developed to identify TC-like vortices in low-resolution models, 263 recognizing that the simulated interannual variations of the activity in such models could be 264 simulated well enough to be useful for prediction and some research purposes even when their 265 intensities are well below those observed in real TCs. At the resolution considered here, many of 266 the systems detected by the CZ02 algorithm are weaker than observed TCs and so the phrase \"TC-267 like vortices\" is still to some extent appropriate. We nonetheless denote them as \"TCs\" here, for 268 brevity. The distinction we make between TCs and TDVs is that the former are defined using a 269 wider range of criteria appropriate (qualitatively if not quantitatively) to real tropical cyclones, 270 including a warm core, while TDVs here are defined using simpler and less restrictive criteria 271 which allow, for example, cold-core systems. 272\n4. TDV and TC statistics 273 LMDZ tends to generate more TDVs than does ERA-I with a maximum obtained for ENT (Table 1) . 274\nConsidering the same constraints (systems lasting more than two days over ocean south of 40\u00b0N), 275 there are 139 TCs in IBTrACS between 2000 and 2009. The CZ02 approach tracks fewer TCs than 276 observed for TIE and more than observed for CAPENT and ENT. Despite the different tracking 277 algorithms and/or the different data sources for observations, the agreement between the TC and 278 the TDV tracking is fairly good. TC tracks with at least half of the points in common with a given 279 TDV track represent more than 89% of the TC tracks for the simulations and 92% for 280 observations (despite the very different tracking process for TDVs in ERA-I and TCs in IBTrACS). 281 to 77% in observations. This variability is partly related to the duration of the pre-TC phase and 283 thus also depends on the genesis location for both TDVs and TCs.\nSince the number of systems diagnosed by the tracking schemes can increase dramatically if some 285 thresholds are relaxed (for example, if the minimum duration is reduced from 2 days to 1 day), 286 average TDV characteristics tend to be biased towards the more numerous weaker systems. It is 287 therefore interesting to examine how average TDV characteristics change as the ensemble N 288 (20\u2264N\u2264200) of strongest TDV (largest ACE) increases. The ACE is overestimated in LMDZ 289 compared to ERA-I and is three times larger for ENT for N=20 (figure 2a). This is partly due to 290 African coast, the TDVs are moving northwestward in TIE and more westward in ERA-I and 343 CAPENT (even southwestward for some TDV generated in the \"initiation corridor\" in ERA-I). In 344 TIE, TDVs are thus driven away from regions of highest SST, which may limit their growth and 345 thus their number. The observed TC energy is an order of magnitude larger than the TDV energy 346 in ERA-I and also maximizes over the Gulf of Mexico (around 0.6) and around 60\u00b0W, south of the 347 TDV energy maximum. The TC energy is stronger than the TDV energy in LMD-Z, but the spatial 348 distributions are very similar. This is expected since the TCs detected by the CZ02 algorithm are 349 indeed mostly the strongest TDVs, as shown in figure 2d. The TC energy is locally larger for TIE 350 compared to ENT and CAPENT, confirming that the small TDV and TC numbers in TIE is mostly For western Atlantic, which is the region with the strongest simulated TDVs, many strengthening 384 into TCs (Figure 4) , the average moisture profiles for ENT and CAPENT are in good agreement 385 with ERA-I, but the TIE profile is drier between 850hPa and 400hPa (Figure 6a ). This suggests 386 that the smaller number of TDV genesis events over the western Atlantic Ocean for TIE could beTDV or TC statistics, and environmental differences between low-resolution models has been 394 previously found not to be predictive of differences in the statistics of TC-like disturbances 395 (Camargo et al. 2007b ). That said, convective inhibition associated with drier air in TIE may 396 prevent the deepening of some early-stage TDVs and thus limit their duration to less than two 397 days, so that they do not enter our sample. For developed TDVs (24\u2264vmax\u226427ms -1 ), the TDV RH is 398 too strong above 250hPa for the three LMDZ simulations compared to ERA-I. This shows that the 399 altitude and the strength of the convective moisture detrainment in the central part of strong 400\nTDVs are overestimated by all three versions of the model (due either to resolved or 401 parameterized convection). The TDV RH between 700hPa and 300hPa is larger in ERA-I, 402 especially compared to TIE. The TDV moistening (i.e. the RH contrast between the background 403 and the TDV) in the lower troposphere has maximum near 600hPa for ENT, CAPENT and ERA-I, 404 and below 700hPa for TIE. The larger TDV moistening at low levels in TIE is consistent with the 405 fact that some \"pre-moistening\" is probably necessary for the disturbance to become sufficiently 406 moist to prevent the convective entrainment (related to the moisture divergence in TIE) from 407 inhibiting the deep convection and the TDV growth. 408\nOver the eastern Atlantic Ocean, developed TDVs come from the Guinean region in TIE (Figures 3  409   and 5) . Here, the average TIE moisture profile is closer to that of ERA-I with a relatively dry layer 410 between 700hPa and 900hPa (figure 6b) that presumably inhibits convective development in this 411 region. For developed TDVs (12\u2264vmax\u226415ms -1 ), the moistening has a maximum near 850hPa for 412 the three simulations and for ERA-I with the largest moistening occurring for ERA-I and TIE. The 413 TDV RH is too large above 300hPa in all three simulations compared to ERA-I, suggesting again an 414 excessive moisture detrainment at these levels in LMDZ at the expense of lower levels for 415 equivalent surface winds, and thus excessive deep convection at the expense of convection 416 detraining at midlevel. 417\nOver the Guinean region, TIE generates more Atlantic TDVs compared to ERA-I, ENT and CAPENT. 418\nThe lower troposphere is slightly moister in LMDZ compared to ERA-I, but not significantly 419 different in the TIE case. For developed TDVs (3\u2264vmax\u22646ms -1 ), the RH profiles below 600hPa are 420 also very similar among the 3 simulations and ERA-I (Figure 6c ). For TIE, the RH excess in TDVs 421 compared to the environment is larger above 700hPa despite similar vmax values. This excess is 422 larger in ERA-I than in TIE between 700hPa and 300hPa, but smaller above, suggesting again 423 excessive moisture detrainment at high levels in LMDZ at the expense of middle levels. In TIE, the 424\nTDVs are sustained from their genesis over the Guinean region up to the Atlantic Ocean (where 425 they spend at least 2 days based on the definition of the TDVs). It is possible that the new 426 entrainment, based on the environmental RH instead of the moisture divergence profile, quite 427 realistically (Figure 3 ) inhibits the convection because it is not able to maintain these TDVs over 428 the Guinean region, as the latter is much drier below 850hPa compared to ocean regions. 429\nOne hypothesis is that the inhibition of the parameterized convection favors the triggering of 430 resolved convection that gives higher TDV occurrence and intensity. This is analyzed in Figure 7 African coast around 15\u00b0N. The AEW signal is overestimated over the ocean for TIE and ENT in 479 both V700 and precipitation, and is closer to ERA-I for CAPENT. In LMDZ, the AEW precipitation 480 near the east African coast is overestimated compared to that in GPCP. The most important point 481 is that the AEW patterns for wind and precipitation are stronger over the Guinean region for TIE 482 than for ENT and CAPENT. Compared to ERA-I and GPCP, the amplitudes of the AEW patterns for 483 the larger AEW signal, possibly because of a better phasing between the AEW dynamical and 486 convective perturbations that deepen the vortices associated with the AEWs. Further studies are 487 required to determine how this could be related to the TIE entrainment. An intriguing point is that 488 there are fewer TDVs generated over the Guinean region for ERA-I than for TIE (Figure 3) technique is thus quite different from those used more traditionally for TC tracking and it is 505 interesting to note the good agreement between the two approaches (Table 1) . To a firstapproximation, the TCs detected by the CZ02 tracking scheme are also detected by the TDV 507 tracking. A future possible development could be to join both approaches by adding structural 508 criteria to detect TC in the TDV tracks. 509\nIn most of the statistics evaluated from the distributions of simulated TDVs, the differences 510 between LMDZ and ERA-I are larger than the differences between the three LMDZ simulations. 511\nThe main difference among the three LMDZ simulations is the number of TDVs and TCs. In 512 particular, the TIE simulation generates fewer TDVs and many fewer TCs compared to ENT and 513\nCAPENT. In the western Atlantic, the region of largest observed ACE, the TDV intensity 514 distributions is however clearly shifted toward intense TDVs in TIE (Figure 7a ). More generally, 515 LMDZ clearly overestimates the number of intense TDVs compared to ERA-I. In the western 516\nAtlantic, for example, the numbers of TDV occurrences are the same in ENT and ERA-I for vmax = 517 10ms -1 , but there is a factor of 13 difference for vmax = 25ms -1 . This exaggerated deepening of the 518 TDVs in LMDZ is probably related in part to excessive deep convection at the expense of 519 convection detraining at mid-levels ( Figure 6) . A striking result is that the weaker TDV intensity in 520 ERA-I is associated with a larger propagation speed. Considering only the \u00df-effect, weak TDVs in 521 ERA-I should have smaller propagation speed compared to LMDZ and to observations. The large 522 and realistic propagation speed in ERA-I could thus be due either to the more realistic steering 523 flow or to the assimilation procedure that tends to rectify the ERA-I TDV speed to the observed 524 speed. 525\nOur analysis suggests two factors that may explain the difference between the TDV intensity 526 distributions in the different LMDZ simulations. First, the TIE simulation tends to dry the lower 527 troposphere compared to the new entrainment. This dry lower troposphere, in better agreement 528 with ERA-I over the eastern Atlantic, is likely to inhibit the convection in early stages of the TDV 529 lifecycle and thus decrease the number of TDVs reaching the 2-day duration threshold that are 530 able to further intensify over the North Atlantic. Second, the parameterized convection in 531 developed TDVs is stronger with the new entrainment for all TDV intensities, because it gives 532 smaller entrainment rates for the high RH values that characterize the heart of the TDV. This 533 parameterized convection \"saturates\" for relatively strong TDVs (20ms -1 for CAPENT and around 534 25ms -1 for ENT), but is still more active than the resolved convection. The higher TDV intensity 535 with the new entrainment is thus not due to the inhibition of the parameterized convection. 536\nThe TDV tracking also gives an estimate of the different potential sources of TCs over the North 537\nAtlantic and the sensitivity of these sources to the convective parameterization. The TDV sources 538 are very different between TIE and the two other simulations. The genesis of TDVs over the 539 Atlantic is very rare in TIE, while the number of TDVs generated over West Africa is much larger 540 in that simulation than in the others (or in ERA-I); interestingly, the 20 strongest TDVs are all 541 generated over West Africa in TIE. This appears to be related to a larger AEW activity in TIE, 542 which could be related to a better phasing between the convective activity and the wave. 543\nOur analysis shows the complexity involved in diagnosing the differences in the TDV distribution 544 among different versions of a model. Differences arise not only from the modification of the 545 physical processes in the TDVs and TCs themselves, but also from differences in the average 546 thermodynamic and dynamic structure of the atmosphere. These differences may play a role in 547 the TDV and TC genesis location and frequency, as well as in the intensification and maintenance 548 processes. This demonstrates that the separation between TC initiation and intensification 549 processes may help to understand the sources of TC activity biases in a model and to interpret the 550 differences among models. A match between a TC and a TDV track means that at least 50% of the TC locations are at a 664 distance smaller than 3\u00b0 from a given TDV. "}]
