[{"section_title": "", "text": "For the past three decades scholars and educational policy makers have wondered how much the enrollment of children in private, charter, and magnet schools has impacted racial segregation in traditional public schools. Debates and speculation about the impact of family choices have taken place in the absence of data that can be used to explore how much additional segregation in local, neighborhood schools results from children attending schools other than those serving their residential areas. This issue is pressing given that the introduction and expansion of school voucher programs and other \"free market\" educational reforms may exacerbate segregation as it exists currently. Policies that aim to improve the delivery of educational services by subsidizing the movement of students into private and charter schools must be informed by accurate and comprehensive information describing the impact of student mobility on racial segregation across schools.\nWhile researchers investigating residential racial segregation consistently find that race influences neighborhood choice (Alba and Logan 1993; South and Crowder 1998; Massey and Denton 1993), proponents of \"school choice\" continue to debate whether familial choices for schools are racially motivated. For example, choice advocates argue that the racial composition of a school has little bearing on the choices that families make: \"Only for the most devout racists will the racial and ethnic makeup of the student body matter more than the school's program and pedagogical characteristics\" (Merrifield 2001, p. 136) . Others even argue that \"Choice turns out to be entirely compatible with such traditional social policy objectives as integration-indeed to be a powerful catapult across the neighborhood, district, and even municipal borders that are now the primary barriers to greater racial and ethnic integration\" (Finn, 1990: p. 7) . Choice advocates are buttressed by researchers such as James Coleman (1992) who state that racial segregation in traditional, neighborhood-based public schools is not influenced by the movement of children into private schools. Coleman and his colleagues argued that private school enrollment does \"not increase the level of segregation beyond that which statistical evidence indicates would exist in the public sector if private schools were absent.\" (Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore, 1982b, p. 220 ).\nThis bold hypothesis led to an extensive exchange with Taeuber and James in Sociology of Education (see Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore, 1982a , 1982b Taeuber and James, 1982, 1983) , that can be best summarized by the following passage:\nOne of the policy questions Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore seek to analyze is the segregative effect of programs that would facilitate the movement of students from the public to the private sector... Coleman et al. suppose that in the very recent past private schools did not exist and their students were all in public schools. This would provide a base of comparison for assessing whether the current mixed public and private school system is more segregated than the hypothetical all-public school system...The hypothetical all-public school system is created by absorbing black and white private school students into its public schools in the exact proportion to the existing racial composition of each public school...The ultimate policy conclusion that an expansion of private schooling would not increase segregation in the public schools is thus a simple consequence of the initial assumptions (Taeuber and James, 1982 p. 138) . [emphasis added.] In contrast to Coleman, other scholars contend that allowing greater educational mobility will exacerbate racial segregation. These scholars theorize that white and wealthier students will take steps to maintain their social status by distancing themselves from groups they perceive to be of lower standing (Taeuber and James 1982; Wells and Crain 1992) . A number of researchers make this argument in their assessment of various choice policies (Henig 1996; Lankford, Lee, and Wyckhoff 1995; Lankford and Wyckhoff 1999; Meyer and Glazerman 1997; Saporito and Lareau 1998; Saporito 2003; Smith and Meier 1995; Willms 1996; Wrinkle, Stewart and Polinard 1999; Witte 2000; Saporito 1995a, 1995b) . From this view, broadening the educational options of students will merely add another layer of stratification to an educational system already variegated by race and class (Astin 1992) .\nEven though many scholars have debated the merits of Coleman's hypothesis that increasing choice in private schools would not impact racial segregation in public schools, none of them have tested his arguments empirically. Specifically, no researchers have assessed how much the choices of families for private, magnet, and charter schools impacts racial segregation in neighborhood public schools. Similarly, no one has investigated how enrollment patterns across all schools within a district-including neighborhood, private, magnet, and charter schools-contribute to overall racial segregation within a school district.\nThese questions have been difficult to address because of the difficult task of acquiring original geographic data from multiple school districts and linking them with existing demographic data describing schools and residential areas. We overcome these constraints by collecting maps describing school attendance boundaries for the largest school districts in the country. We then use mapping software to link these maps with complete-count population data from the 2000 U.S. Census. This allows us to describe the racial characteristics of school-aged children living within school catchment areas. Assembling these data enables us, for the first time, to establish a baseline level of racial segregation in school neighborhoods. As suggested in the debates between Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore (1982a , 1982b and Taeuber and James, (1982, 1983) our baseline measure represents a hypothetical level of racial segregation across schools within a district if all children attended the public schools serving their neighborhoods.\nWe link data describing the racial composition of school catchment areas with the National Center for Educational Statistics' Common Core of Data (hereafter called the CCD).\nThe CCD describe enrollment figures by race and grade-level for virtually every U.S. public school (including charter and magnet schools). Linking data describing the racial composition of schools with corresponding data on the racial characteristics of school-aged children within school attendance boundaries allows us to assess the extent to which school populations differ in racial composition from that of their official neighborhood attendance areas. Finally, we use data from the National Center for Educational Statistics Private School Survey and the CCD to determine racial enrollments for each private, charter, and magnet school that is located within the school districts included in this study.\nCompiling these data allow us to answer three key questions. First, how does racial segregation differ between public neighborhood schools and the catchment areas they serve?\nEmpirically investigating these differences allows us to assess the validity of Coleman's claim that the exodus of children from neighborhood schools to private schools has no impact on racial segregation in public schools. Second, how does racial segregation of students across all schools within a district compare with racial segregation of school-aged children living in school catchment areas? This allows us to assess how much the redistribution of some students from neighborhood schools to private, magnet, and charter schools affects overall segregation within a district. Third, how do desegregation policies in school districts affect the link between segregation in neighborhoods and schools? Examining school districts that have \"controlled choice\" desegregation policies enables us to determine whether their policies are effective."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Thomas Schelling was among the first scholars to argue that small differences in racial preferences among individuals belonging to different races could lead to socio-spatial patterns consisting of racially distinct areas (Schelling 1971) . A number of attitudinal studies confirm that individuals from different racial groups do, in fact, base their residential preferences upon 1 These studies rely upon the \"Farley-Schuman show-card\" method to measure preferences of African Americans and whites for neighborhoods that varied in their black-to-white ratios (Farley 1992; Farley and Schuman 1976; Farley et al. 1994) . Respondents were shown cards that depicted houses occupied by whites and African Americans (or where shown cards of empty houses and asked to represent their ideal racial mix of neighbors). neighborhood racial composition. For example, white families are found to be less willing to live in a neighborhood as the number of their non-white, and particularly black, neighbors increases.\nBy contrast, African Americans prefer neighborhoods that are more integrated (CharlesZubrinsky 2000; Emerson, Yancey, and Chai 2001; Farley 1992; Farley and Schuman 1976; Farley et al. 1994; Timberlake 2000) . Other attitudinal surveys of respondents within specific cities indicate that the cumulative result of white preferences for white neighborhoods may contribute to persisting racial segregation (Clark 1991 (Clark , 1992 . While these studies are compelling, they are limited because they rely upon survey questions that elicit responses from people regarding their preferences for hypothetical neighborhoods, rather than their actual behaviors.\n1 As Harris (1999; argues, such questions may not accurately reflect how racial factors likely influence actual choice in real-world settings.\nResearch examining actual neighborhood choices suggest that white and non-white households make efforts to live in predominantly white neighborhoods, while non-white families show greater tolerance for integrated neighborhoods. For instance, Alba and Logan (1993) find that, even with limited economic resources, whites make efforts to avoid residential areas with high percentages of minorities; by contrast, even with sufficient economic resources, black families are not found in areas that are predominantly white. Similarly, South and Crowder (1998) find that white families are much more likely than black families to move away from racially-mixed census tracts to predominantly white tracts. White families are also less likely than black families to move away from predominantly white tracts to racially mixed tracts.\nFinally, Crowder (2000) finds that, among whites:\nThe annual likelihood of leaving the neighborhood increases significantly with the size of the minority population in the neighborhood, and whites are especially likely to leave neighborhoods containing combinations of multiple minority groups. These neighborhood effects persist after controlling for a wide range of micro-level mobility predictors and do not appear to be rooted in the reaction to nonracial social and economic characteristics of the neighborhood.\nAs with studies of residential mobility, researchers studying private school enrollment have been able to describe the school choices of families who live in broad areas identified by zip codes or census areas (Fairlie and Resch 2002; Lankford and Wyckoff 2001; Saporito, Yancey, and Louis 2001) . Theses studies typically find white children are more likely to attend a private school as the percent of non-whites in their neighborhoods increases and this is true even after controlling for other individual-level social and economic factors often associated with school choice (Lankford and Wyckoff 2002) . Similar results are found among magnet school participants. Saporito (2003) uses data describing the movement of magnet school students into and out of high school attendance boundaries in one city; as with studies of private school enrollment, he finds white children are more likely to apply to and enroll in magnet schools as the percent of nonwhites in their school catchment areas increases. This study also demonstrated that the cumulative consequences of these individual choices led to higher levels of racial segregation than would exist if every child attended the school serving his or her residential area.\nAlthough the literature on school selection is not extensive, it uniformly suggests that the differential withdrawal of white and non-whites students from integrated public schools increases racial segregation within public school districts. Still, none of this research documents if and how much student mobility increases segregation in schools compared with racial segregation across residential areas in multiple school districts."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered the Milliken v. Bradley decision, which invalidated courtordered city-suburban desegregation plans.\nIn addition to the literature describing individual choices for schools (and the implications of these choices for educational inequality), there is a second body of literature that examines changes in school segregation over time. These studies are based on the Common Core of Data and consistently show that black/white racial segregation has increased over the last decade. This increase represents a reversal of the desegregation patterns observed between the 1960s and the 1990s (Frankenburg, Lee, and Orfield 2003; Reardon and Yun 2001; Reardon, Yun, and Eitle 2000; Logan and Oakley 2004; Logan 2002) . For example, Logan's nation-wide report found that, on average, school districts experienced a two-point increase in school segregation (as measured by Dissimilarity) between the 1989-90 and 1999-00 school years. This shift is significant because residential segregation declined by four points during that same period. Reardon and Yun (2003) find a similar trend in southern states between 1990 and 2000 in which decreasing residential segregation was accompanied by increasing school segregation. Research also indicates that segregation observed between white and Hispanic students has risen steadily since the 1970s (Frankenburg, Lee, Orfield 2003) . Many of these scholars argue that private schools and other choice options contribute to the growth of racial segregation in public schools.\nIn addition to the impact of school choice, scholars have identified several other factors that might explain the trends noted above. These include an increase in racial segregation between school districts (Reardon, Yun, and Eitle 2000; Reardon and Yun 2001) , the limited ability of suburban and urban school districts to exchange racially diverse students, 2 and the retrenchment of court-ordered desegregation programs. For example, Logan concludes:\nIt should be noted that much of the research combines grade levels when constructing school district segregation indices. Most do not include private schools in their analyses and there are no distinctions made between magnet/charter and neighborhood schools. We disaggregate the CCD by grade-level and school type and marry school information with neighborhood composition to overcome the methodological shortcomings in this literature.\n\"Increased school segregation...did not result from changes in where children lived. It was caused by changes in policies that once worked effectively to reduce school segregation, but that were reversed in the 1990s\" (2002, p.5) . To be sure, researchers have used sophisticated techniques such as multiple segregation indices and complete-count school data from the CCD to document historical patterns in racial segregation.\n3 Still, these studies have not been able to determine whether trends are due to increases in ethnic minority populations, population shifts across school districts, or changes in district desegregation efforts across time (Logan 2004 ). Because we link school enrollment data with data describing school-aged children in their corresponding attendance areas, we can begin to isolate the influence of school choice on racial segregation from other demographic changes."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "While it would be extremely difficult to address all the gaps in the literature assessing the links between school choice and racial segregation, our unique data and methods allow us to make a complimentary contribution to existing work by examining differences in racial segregation between schools and neighborhoods at one point in time for multiple schools districts. Our data allow us to examine the effects of student choices while \"holding constant\" district racial composition and residential segregation. This is because residential segregation serves as a \"baseline\" against which we compare rates of school segregation. Our data provide another advantage; because some of the school districts included in our study use voluntary desegregation programs, we are able to examine their success in reducing racial segregation 4\nOur original goal was to collect maps from the 100 school districts but this proved to be virtually impossible given limits of time and resources and the inability, reluctance, or refusal of some school districts to provide maps of their attendance boundaries. Still, we were able to collect maps of the 22 largest school districts (measured by total student enrollment in 1998-99 school year) and for 22 additional school districts ranked 27 through 92. Since the districts ranked 27 to 92 represent a convenience sample we do not include them in the main body of the paper but, instead, show results for these school districts in Appendix B.\nrelative to our baseline measure of segregation across school attendance boundaries. Thus, compared with studies of national trends, we take a fine-grained look at the dynamics of segregation within school districts.

To do this, in 2000 we began contacting the largest public school districts in the United States to collect maps that depicted their school attendance boundaries. Over the course of four years, we were able to obtain and process maps for the 22 largest school districts in the U.S.\n4 Table 1 shows the number of elementary-aged students in each district, the number of elementary school catchment areas in the district, the form of the original map (i.e., a paper map or computerized GIS map) and the school-year of the map. Some school districts had a department that worked with boundary maps; however, even these maps were maintained in a myriad of forms. Some maps were available in GIS form (typically as ArcView Shapefiles) but many districts maintained paper maps (some of which were drawn on commercially available fold-out street maps). We attempted to obtain and construct maps representing the 1999-00 or the 2000-01 school years for all districts. This was 5 Some school districts did not archive either their paper or digital maps and, where possible, we reconfigured the maps to represent either the 1999-00 or 2000-01 school years.

This was done by \"overlaying\" the digital maps of school catchment areas on top of maps of census blocks. These overlays allowed us to identify the school that served every block in each school district. Because the 2000 census data identify all persons by age and race at the block level, we were able to determine the number and race of children who lived in each school attendance area.\nUsing this information, we tabulated the number of children in each school catchment area who were white, non-Hispanic and between the ages five to nine."}, {"section_title": "Integrating Census Counts of School Attendance Boundaries with the Common Core of Data", "text": "Our unique set of maps allow us to create a baseline measure of racial segregation across school attendance boundaries. The next step is to link these maps with information describing the racial composition of the elementary schools that actually serve these attendance boundaries. We do this by using information from Common Core of Data available from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics. The CCD describe the number of children by grade-level and race for virtually every public school in the country. This enables us In addition to neighborhood-based schools, the CCD also reported on 342 schools that did not serve a specific attendance area. These were either whole-dedicated magnet schools (n=145), charter schools (n=64), or special education schools (n=133). (District totals are shown in Table   3 .) Although charter and magnet schools were supposed to be identified by variables in the CCD, this information was unavailable or unreliable for many school districts and we determined a school's magnet/charter status through web searches or telephone interviews of school district staff.\nDuring the process of identifying non-neighborhood schools, we discovered 794 schools with fixed attendance zones that also drew children from outside their catchment areas. Almost all of these neighborhood-based specialty schools contained charter or magnet programs (e.g., they focused on language immersion, performing arts, or math and science). For each school we constructed a variable noting if it had a \"specialty\" program. Our study includes four school districts that made extensive use of specialty schools for the purpose of reducing racial segregation. Other school districts (most notably Chicago and Fairfax County) also had many specialty schools but such schools were not instituted expressly for the purpose of racial integration. By collecting information on specialty schools, we are able to determine if schools that draw students from outside their official school attendance zones disrupted the relationship between the racial composition of schools and their neighborhoods. As noted in the literature (Smrekar 1999) , some districts made extensive use of magnet schools for the purposes of racial integration. For example, Rossell (1990) demonstrated that magnet school plans achieved more Although we include special education schools and students in our analyses, for the sake of space we do not include these statistics in this table as they represent less than one percent of the student population in these school districts. * Students populations are based on enrollments in grades one through four. ** Data for Fairfax County include attendance boundaries and schools for the school districts of Manassas and Manassas Park. Of concern is the inclusion of a multiracial children (e.g., children whose parents and/or grandparents are of two or more different races) in the 2000 census. Roughly five percent of the children in our data are classified as multiracial and, in about four percent of school attendance boundaries, more than 10 percent of the children are multiracial. This presents a challenge because the CCD assign every child to a single race. Some children who are classified as multiracial in the census are likely \"white\" in the CCD. Unfortunately, we cannot systematically assign multiracial children in the 2000 Census to a single race because we do not know the racial backgrounds of their parents and/or grandparents. Because we cannot assign multiracial children to a single race (in a reliable way) we assume that all multiracial children are non-white. This is the most conservative approach as it underestimates the percent of children in each school catchment area who classify themselves as \"white\" in the Common Core of Data. racial integration than mandatory busing policies. While this is an important finding, a better assessment of the impact of magnet school programs on racial segregation is to determine whether they achieve racial integration across schools relative to existing segregation across residential areas.\nAfter linking the census-based school catchment data with the CCD, we constructed racial variables for both data sets. Although the census' block-level data and the CCD are both censuses, their racial classification systems differ slightly. Fortunately, both data sets count the number of whites who are not Hispanic and, in this respect, the two data sets are comparable (for simplicity, we refer to children who are white, non-Hispanics as \"white\"). We use the CCD to determine the percentage of white children enrolled in grades one to four in each school and match this with the number of white children aged five to nine living in each school's attendance boundary. 6 "}, {"section_title": "Data on Private Schools", "text": "With the exception of Reardon and Yun's (2002) metropolitan-level analyses of racial segregation in schools, most studies of school segregation rely exclusively on public school enrollment information derived from the CCD. To overcome this shortcoming in existing research we locate private schools within schools districts; this allows us to explore racial segregation across public and private schools simultaneously. We use data from the 1999 Private 7 We also pinpointed the locations of magnet and charter schools using the address fields in the CCD.

The availability of private school addresses allowed us to use the address-matching features in ArcView GIS to \"pinpoint\" the location of every private school. Pinpointing private schools enables us to determine the public school district in which every private school is situated. We located 2,853 private, elementary schools within the 22 largest school districts in the county (as shown in Table 3 ). Pinpointing private school locations also allowed us to determine the public school attendance zone in which each private school was found. Counting the number of private schools within each public school attendance area allows us to explore how much nearby private schools influence the racial balance within public schools. "}, {"section_title": "Analyses and Findings", "text": "We conduct four interrelated analyses. First, we create a simple scatterplot that allows us to visually compare the percent of white students enrolled in traditional public schools with the percent of white students living in each school's catchment area. (We do so for all 3,785 schools with catchment areas.) Comparing schools with their neighborhoods allows us to determine if there are lower percentages of whites students in schools than in their corresponding residential catchment areas. Second, we conduct regression analyses to determine whether the proportion of white children in schools is influenced more by the proportion of black children or Hispanic children in their attendance areas. Regression also allows us to determine whether neighborhood public schools with higher numbers of private, magnet, and charter schools within their attendance zones have lower proportions of white students. Third, within each school district we calculate levels of racial segregation of children living in school attendance areas and compare this with levels of racial segregation in their corresponding schools. These analyses allow us to observe, for each district, whether racial segregation in schools is greater than in their corresponding catchment areas. Finally, we compare racial segregation across all schools within a school district's boundaries (i.e., magnet, charter, private, and traditional neighborhood schools). This allows us to determine if the distribution of racial groups across these \"choice options\" reduces or increases segregation in a district across all schools and compares this total school segregation to segregation in school attendance zones."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Racial Enrollment in Schools and Their Attendance Boundaries", "text": "If all children residing in school catchment areas attended their local neighborhood schools then the racial composition of schools and their neighborhoods would be identical. It is also true that if equal proportions of white, black, and Hispanic children within specific school attendance boundaries attended private, magnet, and charter schools then the racial mix of students within a traditional neighborhood school would also be the same. Indeed, Coleman et al. (1982) make this latter claim.\nContrary to these expectations, we find lower percentages of white students in public schools than in their school attendance boundaries, as shown in Figure 1 . To highlight this, the scatterplot in Figure 1 shows a hypothetical regression line (which is dashed) that runs along a perfect diagonal. This reference line shows the hypothetical proportion of white students who would be enrolled in traditional neighborhood schools if all students attended their neighborhood school or white and non-white children left neighborhood schools in the same proportions. This regression is based upon schools that serve only children living in the catchment area and excludes neighborhood-based specialty schools that draw some children from outside the borders of their attendance boundaries."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "The inflection point is calculated using the formula below:\nwhere I is the inflection point and b 1 and b 2 are the regression coefficients in the following quadratic equation:\nThe regression coefficients of b 1 and b 2 are .701 and .002, respectively.\nWhen we compare the actual regression line (i.e., the solid line in Figure 1 ) with the hypothetical reference line, three distinct patterns emerge.\n8 First, the average percent of white students enrolled in schools is five percentage points lower than the hypothetical regression line.\nThis difference is due to white children attending schools of choice, including private, magnet, and charter schools at higher rates than non-white children. The second pattern we find is the curvilinear relationship between schools and their neighborhoods. The curvilinear regression line\nindicates that the exodus of white children from traditional neighborhood schools is the greatest in areas that have substantial proportions of non-white students. Indeed, the point on the x axis at which the curve is the furthest from the expected line (i.e., the inflection point) is 54 percent. 9 At this point on the x axis there are, on average, almost 10 percentage points fewer white children enrolled in schools than living in their corresponding catchment areas.

We also determine whether the impact of nearby private, magnet, and charter schools impacts the percent of white students in neighborhood public schools. To do this, we count the number of private schools within a school attendance zone and create a three dummy variables: whether a catchment area has a) one private schools; b) two or three private schools or; c) more than three private schools. Our expectation is that white students are more apt than nonwhite students to attend private, charter, and magnet schools when they are proximal to their local public school. Our regression results are shown in Table 4 .\nThe first model of the table presents the basic relationship between the percent of white children in schools given two variables: the percent of white children in a catchment area and the square of this variable to capture the curvilinear nature of this relationship.

A noteworthy finding is the relative importance of the quadratic term (which has a standardized regression coefficient of .209) to the model indicating that the relationship between the percent of white children in schools and neighborhoods is curvilinear.

The correlation between black and Hispanic children is -.481. of whites in schools, or do the two groups have different effects? To answer this question we compare the relative influence of the presence of black and Hispanic children in a neighborhood, as shown in Model 2. 11 We find that the presence of Hispanic children has a slightly greater influence than the percent of black children as indicated by the standardized regression coefficients of -.073 for Hispanics versus -.066 for blacks. The relative weight of these coefficients shows that the presence of these two groups has roughly the same impact on reducing the expected percent of white students in schools.\nModel 3 of Table 4 introduces the key question raised in the debates between Coleman et al. (1982a Coleman et al. ( , 1982b Coleman et al. ( , 1983 and James and Taeuber (1982 Taeuber ( , 1983 : Do private schools increase segregation in public schools by disproportionately siphoning white students from the public school sector? Our results provide rather strong evidence that private and magnet schools located within the attendance boundaries of a public school have a strong and negative impact on the percent of white students in those public schools. Indeed, the greater the number of private schools in a zone the greater the impact they have on the percentages of white students in neighborhood public schools. If one private school is within the catchment area of a public school that public school has 1.4 percentage points fewer white students than zones without a private school; if two or three private schools are in a zone, public schools have nearly four percentage points fewer white students. When there are three or more private schools in an area, public schools have 7.4 percentage points fewer white children than expected. Thus, the availability of private school choices has a direct impact on reducing the percentage of white students in public schools. What makes this finding even more powerful is that our data indicate that half of the school attendance boundaries that are racially balanced (i.e., between 40 and 60 percent of the children in them are white) have private schools within their borders. Thus, it is very likely that half of all schools serving racially balanced areas lose a substantial number of white children to nearby private schools. We find similar effects for magnet schools. Attendance boundaries containing at least one magnet school have nearly two percentage points fewer white children than those without magnet schools. In contrast, we do not find a substantial effect for the presence of charter schools."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Segregation in Schools and School Attendance Boundaries", "text": "How much do these patterns impact segregation between whites and various non-white groups across various school districts? To answer this question, we use the Dissimilarity Index (of \"D\") to assess the degree to which racial groups are distributed evenly across schools and school attendance boundaries within a school district. If two racial groups are distributed evenly, each school within a district would have the same racial balance as that of all children enrolled in the entire school district. Dissimilarity values range from zero to one with a value of zero reflecting perfect integration and a value of one reflecting complete segregation. The value of D can be interpreted as the proportion of students from a single racial group that would have to enroll in a different school in order for each school within a district to reflect the racial composition of the entire district. The formula for D is:"}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "In Appendix A we also show why D is more appropriate for this study than other measures such as Exposure (X) and the Theil Information Theory Index (H). Segregation results based upon X and H are available upon request. We find that the substantive results based upon D, X, and H are very similar.\nwhere t i is the total population in school i (and T is the total population in all schools.) In these analyses, the value of T should be interpreted as the sum of the two racial groups under comparison. Similarly, p i is the proportion of school i that is of a given racial group and P is the proportion of a given racial group in all schools within a district.\nDissimilarity is considered the \"work-horse\" of segregation measures. Although it is used widely because it is interpreted easily, our use of D is driven by its suitability for our research question.We argue that greater levels of segregation in schools than school catchment areas results from the disproportionate loss of white students from school-neighborhoods that are racially balanced (i.e., attendance areas in which roughly half of the students are white).\nIn Table 5 , we show how much the disproportionate loss of white students from racially heterogenous schools impacts segregation in the 22 largest school districts in the U.S. To do this, we first calculate white/black and white/Hispanic Dissimilarity for schools and neighborhoods.\nWe then subtract D scores for neighborhoods from D scores for schools. These differences show whether racial groups are more unevenly spread in schools than neighborhoods.\nAs expected, we find that white/black D is higher in schools than their catchment areas for 16 of the 22 school districts and the average difference between white/black D in schools and neighborhoods across all districts is .008 points. Why is this difference small, particularly given the expectation that schools would have higher levels of segregation than their neighborhoods?\nBecause, in four school districts that implement formal desegregation policies through the use of \"specialty schools,\" white/black D is between .076 and .111 points lower in schools than in neighborhoods (these four white/black Dissimilarity scores are highlighted in column four of Table 5 ). These policies have a positive effect on integrating white and black children in schools relative to existing segregation in neighborhoods.\nTo demonstrate the effect of \"specialty\" schools on segregation, we remove all specialty schools from the data and recalculate white/black D scores for non-specialty schools only. When we examine differences in white/black segregation between schools and neighborhoods for non-specialty schools, we find that D is, on average, .032 points higher in schools than their corresponding neighborhoods. In the absence of district policies aimed at increasing white/black integration, the loss of white students from racially mixed schools leads to greater white/black segregation.\nWhen we look at white and Hispanic students we find that the average difference in D scores between schools and their corresponding catchment areas .054 points and, in 19 of the 22 school districts, white/Hispanic D is higher in schools than their neighborhoods. A noteworthy example is Dade County, FL, where white/Hispanic D scores across schools is .204 points higher than in neighborhoods. There is only one school district-San Diego-in which white/Hispanic D The term \"whole dedicated\" magnet school are those schools without an attendance area and in which every student is a part of the school's magnet focus. Thus, these schools are distinct from \"specialty schools\" that have attendance boundaries but that also have magnet programs that draw some children from outside their boundaries.\nis substantially lower (-.069 points) in schools than neighborhoods. San Diego is the one district in this study that focuses upon the integration of multiple ethnic groups-including integration of Hispanics and whites.\nWe also investigate the impact of specialty programs on white/Hispanic segregation in schools. When we remove specialty schools from our analyses we find that the average difference in segregation levels between schools and catchment areas changes little from when specialty schools were included in the analyses. Specifically, differences in white/Hispanic D scores are .054 when we include specialty schools and .058 when they are excluded. It is instructive that specialty schools impact white/black D but make little difference for white/Hispanic D. Although somewhat speculative, we argue that traditional integration programs that rely on speciality schools have been aimed at reducing the impact of segregation between white and black students. As a result even those school districts with racial desegregation policies show little movement toward the integration of white and Hispanic children."}, {"section_title": "Dissimilarity captures the evenness with which racial groups are distributed across schools and thus D captures differences in segregation between schools and their catchment areas that result", "text": "directly from the uneven loss of white students from integrated school attendance zones. This latter issue is a central theoretical concern and, in Appendix A, we show why D specifically captures the influence of losing white children from schools that are racially heterogeneous."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Choice: Racial Segregation in Public, Private, Magnet, and Charter Schools", "text": "The loss of white students from neighborhood schools contributes to greater white/black and white/Hispanic dissimilarity-particularly if there are no desegregation programs in place to allow for the even spread of racial groups across the educational landscape. But these findings raise an important question: is racial segregation across all schools within a district (including private schools, charter schools, and whole dedicated magnet schools) 13 greater than racial segregation across school attendance zones? If racial segregation across all schools within a district is less than across public school attendance areas, the availability of private, charter, and magnet schools contributes to a more integrated school system. Such an expectation would conform with the notion that private/charter/magnet schools draw children from segregated neighborhoods and integrate them in \"schools of choice.\"\nWe examine this hypothesis by comparing Dissimilarity within school districts under three scenarios, as show in Table 6 . The first scenario provides our baseline level of segregation within districts when we assume that all children attend public schools serving their neighborhoods (Column A). The second scenario measures D among students who actually attend the public schools serving their neighborhoods (Column B). The third scenario shows segregation levels across all schools within a school district, including private, magnet, charter and neighborhood-based public schools (Column C).\nThe column labeled (B-A) in Table 6 represent the difference in D between what we expect based on our baseline measure of D in attendance boundaries and D among children who actually attend the school serving those boundaries (this was shown in Table 5 and is repeated here for the convenience of the reader). Similarly, the column labeled (C-A) in Table 6 represents the difference in D between what we expect based on our baseline measure and actual levels of D across all schools in the district. This difference demonstrates the impact of mobility processes on the overall segregation across all schools relative to segregation due to residential patterns.\nWe find that private, magnet and charter schools exacerbate segregation across school districts and the evidence suggests that this is the result of two processes. The first process has been detailed throughout this paper: when white children leave integrated neighborhood schools these schools become more segregated. The second (and related) process that contributes to increased segregation results from the ways in which children choose \"schools of choice.\" We focus on how much racial segregation increases as a result of these two processes.\nAs Table 6 shows, the average difference between white/black D among all schools and school attendance boundaries is .037, as shown in the column labeled \"C-A.\" Indeed, white/black D is greater across all schools than across catchment areas for 17 of the 22 districts in this study. Only in Milwaukee was there a substantial reduction (-.110 points) in white/black D even when private, magnet, and charter schools were included in the analyses. This is due to the district's aggressive desegregation policy.\nThese findings have two important implications for white/black segregation across school districts. First, the way in which white children leave traditional public schools that serve specific neighborhoods and then select \"schools of choice\" has a noteworthy impact on segregation. For the average school district, white/black D increases from .619 in school attendance zones to .656 across all schools (a .037 difference). Second, the ameliorative influence of \"controlled choice\" programs in some school districts is weakened by the re-segregation of white and black students in private/magnet/charter schools. For example, when we take the difference between white/black D scores in Pinellas County's school catchment areas and neighborhood schools we see a .116 point drop in D. Yet, when we examine D across every school in Pinellas County, the difference is only .039 D points. Thus, much of the effectiveness of this school district's desegregation policy is weakened when children re-segregate themselves in private, charter, and magnet schools. In contrast to white/black D, the average increase in segregation of white and Hispanic students is much larger. Whereas D between white and black students increases .037 points (from attendance areas to all schools) this same rise is .088 points between Hispanic and white students. And, as we observed already, the average difference between white/Hispanic D scores in school attendance zones and their corresponding schools is .054 points. These two trends suggest that the combined effect of white students leaving neighborhood schools with higher percentages of Hispanic students and re-segregating themselves from Hispanic students in private/charter/magnet school has the undesirable impact of increasing segregation between white and Hispanic students substantially."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we develop a new way to assess whether public schools are more segregated than they would be if private, charter, and magnet schools did not exist. This allows us to provide an empirical answer to an important policy question raised by James Coleman and his coauthors: if all children attended the public school serving their neighborhoods would racial segregation change in public schools? Our answer is straightforward: racial segregation in traditional neighborhood-based public schools is greater than segregation across school catchment areas because white children disproportionately leave public schools serving more racially integrated neighborhoods. Moreover, public schools that have private and/or magnet schools within their catchment areas have fewer white children than those schools that do not have nearby private or magnet schools. All of this evidence is contrary to Coleman's hypothesis.\nWe find that there are differences in racial segregation between a hypothetical all public school system (based on children living in school attendance areas) and actual levels of racial segregation in neighborhood-based public schools. Indeed, when we consider the racial distribution of all children in all schools-including public, private, magnet, and charter schools-we find that racial segregation is even higher than in the actual public schools.\nThese findings have direct implications for school choice policies-particularly private school vouchers-that might exacerbate racial segregation in public schools. In so far as\nColeman's hypothesis is disconfirmed by our evidence, it appears that an expansion of \"free market\" choice policies would likely exacerbate racial segregation within large, urban school districts. At the same time, we also find that some school districts with racial desegregation policies (in the form of magnet school programs and other controlled choice options) achieved substantial success in reducing racial segregation between black and white students. This suggests that school choice need not be a barrier to racial integration if student mobility is restricted in ways that limit the ability of white children to isolate themselves from non-whites.\nDespite the positive evidence regarding choice programs designed to achieve integration between white and black students, existing desegregation programs included in our study do little to reduce white/Hispanic segregation. On average, school districts would have to move nine percent of their white students across schools (both public and private) to achieve the same level of white/Hispanic segregation found in school catchment areas. In some school districts, white/Hispanic segregation is significantly more segregated than across their school attendance zones. For instance, Miami-Dade County school district would have to move over 24 percent of its white students to achieve the same white/Hispanic racial balance that exists across school catchment areas! Five other districts (Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Dallas, Houston and\nPrince Georges Counties) all have to move at least 12 percent of their white students across schools to reduce segregation to that due to residential patterns. Clearly, districts must consider white avoidance of Hispanic children when they design their policies.\nOur analyses contributes to debates regarding recent proposals to expand \"free market\"\neducational reforms that promote student mobility across public, private, and charter schools. We do this by gathering unique designed to address specific hypotheses proffered by Coleman. Our evidence is clear: children would be less segregated in a hypothetical all-public school system\ngiven the current distribution of children across residential areas. This suggests, contrary to the arguments of many school choice advocates, that expanding the current private school market without proper consideration of existing racial dynamics will exacerbate racial inequality."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A", "text": "This appendix shows how Dissimilarity (D) captures the effect of losing white children from racially heterogenous schools.

In this scenario, every school loses the same proportion of white students (20 percent) and D in schools remains .545 as it was in the first scenario. In the third scenario the loss of all 110 white students occurs in racially balanced schools \"d\" through \"h.\" The result is an .082 increase in D (from .545 to .627), indicating that D is sensitive to the loss of white children from schools that have roughly equal proportions of white and non-white children."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Dissimilarity with Exposure", "text": "In the simulation shown in Table A1 , we calculate the Exposure of blacks with whites ( b X w ) as follows:\nWhere \"w i \" is the number of whites in a subunit i, \"b i \" is the number of blacks in subunit i, \"t i \"\nis the total population in subunit i, and B is the total black population. Here, b X w can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly drawn black student will share an attendance boundary or school with a white student (Reardon and O'Sullivan 2004) . Calculating segregation this way has an important quality: as the overall percent of white children in a school district decreases, the random probability that a black child will be exposed to a white child also decreases. Thus, in contrast to D, the Exposure Index is sensitive to overall shares of minority/majority groups in a school district and not just to the distribution of children across schools or neighborhoods. The consequence of this property can be seen by subtracting white students from each school proportionally (as in scenario 2) and then calculating b X w . When we do this the exposure of blacks with whites is slightly lower across schools than school attendance boundaries; this is the case even though we subtracted white students from each school proportionally. Thus, while D remains unchanged in scenarios 1 and 2, the exposure index changes due to a drop in the percent of white students in schools."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Dissimilarity with the Theil Information Theory Index", "text": "Thiel's Information Theory Index (H) has a number of useful properties.
