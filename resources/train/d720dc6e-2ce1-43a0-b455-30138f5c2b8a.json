Data from hog producer surveys administered in 1998 and 2004 indicate that large hog producers (1,000 animal units or more) are altering their manure management practices to mitigate the environmental effects of increased concentration. In particular, the largest farms removed more manure from their operations (especially by giving it away for free) and applied less commercial fertilizer to crops receiving manure in 2004 than in 1998. Also, in accordance with EPA regulations, large hog operations conducted more nutrient testing of manure, increased the use of microbial phytase in feed (which reduces nutrients in manure), and increasingly followed comprehensive nutrient management plans. Additional trends that suggest greater adherence to environmental regulations by the largest hog farms include: (1) a decline in the spreading of solid manure and liquid manure without physically injecting it into the soil (these two practices increase the risk of nutrient loss to the atmosphere and runoff); (2) a decline in the quantity of manure applied per acre; (3) a decline in the nutrients excreted per animal due to an increase in feed effi ciency; and (4) an increase in the share of farms removing manure from their operation.

The changing farm structure is altering manure practices, as larger operations seek to manage nutrients on a limited cropland base. At the same time, recent changes to the Clean Water Act, State regulations, and local confl icts over odor are infl uencing manure management decisions. Changes in the regulatory climate have been driven by increased environmental risk to air and water associated with the geographic concentration of manure on larger livestock operations. Pollutants such as nutrients, pathogens, ammonia, hydrogen sulfi de, methane, and odor can originate from production houses where animals are kept, from manure storage structures such as tanks and lagoons, or from land where manure is applied. The concentration of animals and manure into smaller geographic areas increases the challenge of managing manure, the risk of environmental contamination, and the nuisance potential of farms. This study uses data from two recent surveys of hog farmers to examine how hog manure management practices vary with the scale of production and how practices changed from 1998 to 2004. The fi ndings provide information about the effects of recent policies and structural changes on manure management technologies and practices, the use of nutrient management plans, and manure application rates."}, {"section_title": "A Primer on U.S. Hog Production", "text": "The production of hogs to be slaughtered for pork involves four phases: (1) breeding and gestation (breeding females and their maintenance during gestation), (2) farrowing (birth of baby pigs until weaning), (3) nursery (care of pigs immediately after weaning until about 30-80 pounds), and (4) fi nishing (feeding hogs from 30-80 pounds to a slaughter weight of 225-300 pounds). Hog producers are commonly classifi ed according to the number of production phases conducted on the operation: (1) farrow-to-fi nish (all four phases), (2) farrow-to-feeder pig (phases 1, 2, and 3), (3) feeder pig-to-fi nish (phase 4), (4) wean-to-feeder pig (phase 3), or (5) farrow-to-wean (phases 1 and 2). The majority of U.S. hog production has historically occurred on farrowto-fi nish operations located in areas with an abundant supply of corn. Hog farmers typically fed corn produced on the farm as an inexpensive source of hog feed and applied manure as fertilizer on farm fi elds. Advancements since the 1970s in breeding and genetics, as well as in animal housing and feeding, have increasingly moved hog production into large factorylike units staffed with specialized labor. Meanwhile, farms became more specialized in hog production, and hog farms increasingly specialized in only one or two of the production phases. By 2004, 77 percent of market hogs were produced on feeder pig-to-fi nish operations, while only 18 percent were produced on farrow-to-fi nish operations (Key and McBride, 2007). The introduction of contract production arrangements also played a significant role in the evolution of U.S. hog production. In contract production, a pig owner (the contractor) engages a producer (the grower) to take custody of the pigs and care for them in the producer's facilities; compensation depends on a predetermined formula. Contractors typically furnish inputs to growers, provide technical assistance, and assemble the hogs to pass on for fi nal processing or marketing. Contractors often market hogs through marketing contracts or other arrangements with packers or processors, who can also contract directly with growers."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "This study uses information from surveys of U.S. hog producers conducted in 1998 and 2004 as part of USDA's annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The detailed surveys cover a cross-section of U.S. hog operations and collect information on production costs, business arrangements, production facilities and practices, and farm operator and fi nancial characteristics. The surveys also provide information about manure storage and handling, fertilizer use, manure application techniques, payments received under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), use of comprehensive nutrient management plans (CNMP), and manure application rates. The data allow us to document the current state of manure management and provide information about producers' emerging responses to existing and anticipated manure-related regulations. The sample of hog farms was chosen from a list of operations maintained by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The target population of each survey was farms having 25 or more hogs at any time during the year. Farms with fewer than 25 hogs were removed to exclude operations that raise hogs primarily for onfarm consumption and other noncommercial activities, such as youth projects. Each surveyed operation represents a number of similar farms in the population as indicated by the surveyed respondent's expansion factor, or survey weight. The sampling resulted in 1,633 responses from 22 States in 1998, and 1,198 responses from 19 States in 2004 (table 1). The expanded samples in each survey represent more than 90 percent of the hog and pig inventory on U.S. farms in each survey year. Estimates from the two surveys are comparable because of the consistent way in which the surveys were conducted and processed. Each survey had broad national coverage, represented the same target population, involved a complex sampling scheme designed to represent the target population, was conducted the same way (hand-enumerated) by the same organization, and collected much the same information in a similar format. More information about the ARMS and the hog surveys, including copies of the questionnaires, can be found at http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefi ng/ARMS/. Data from the surveys are analyzed by farm size according to the number of animal units (1,000 pounds of live animal weight) produced. Because larger hogs produce more manure, animal units provide a consistent measure for comparing farms that produce hogs at different stages of the production cycle. For example, farrow-to-fi nish and hog fi nishing operations produce much larger hogs, and thus more manure per animal than do farrow-to-feeder pig and specialized nursery operations. The environmental implications of hog production depend primarily on the manure management decisions of operations with at least 50 animal units since these operations accounted for 96-98 percent of hog output over 1998-2004. For this reason, and to simplify the tabular presentations, statistics for operations with fewer than 50 animal units are not reported in most tables and fi gures."}, {"section_title": "Structural Change and Manure Management", "text": "Changes in manure management practices partly refl ect changes in the scale and methods of hog production. Between 1998 and 2004, there was a rapid decline in the number of hog operations producing fewer than 300 animal units (fi g. 1), resulting in a shift in production to larger operations (fi g. 2). Over this period, the total number of hog operations fell by about 40 percent, and the average inventory grew from 2,589 to 4,646 head per farm (table 1). Changes in the scale of production have been accompanied by changes in how production is organized. Hog farms that handle all phases of production have given way to operations increasingly specialized in a single phase.     The traditional approach of farrow-to-fi nish production accounted for about half of hog operations in 1998 but only about a third in 2004. Feeder-tofi nish operations that specialize in the growing-fi nishing phase of production increased their share of market hogs sold/removed from 55 percent in 1998 to 77 percent in 2004 (Key and McBride, 2007). Changes in the scale and specialization of production have caused crop and hog production to concentrate more often on different farms and have created concerns about what to do with the growing concentration of manure on larger hog operations. Changes in production scale and specialization have been made possible, in part, by the substantial growth of contract production. Production contracts govern the relationship between hog growers (contractees) and hog owners (contractors) and specify compensation for the inputs provided by each party. Such arrangements allow individual producers to specialize in one phase of production and increase their scale of operations. Over the 6 years between surveys, the share of farms using a production contract almost doubled (Key and McBride, 2007). One concern with production contract arrangements is who has liability for managing the hog manure. Most contracts have required growers to comply with all State, Federal, and local regulations in operating their facilities, while failure to comply can result in contract termination (Ogishi et al., 2003). Since contract growers are heavily invested in facilities, they are highly motivated to avoid liability. Geographical shifts in hog production have accompanied the structural and organizational changes in the industry. Historically, hog production was concentrated in the Heartland, mainly Iowa and Illinois, where an abundant supply of corn provided a cheap source of hog feed and suffi cient acreage on which to spread hog manure. During the 1980s and 1990s, hog production grew dramatically in the Southeast, especially in North Carolina, driven mainly by the growth of large contract operations. Growth in the Southeast has posed the challenge of how to manage an increasing volume of hog manure in areas with a more dense population and much less crop acreage for manure application than in the Heartland. 1 Since 1992, hog production also Note: A farm is defi ned as an operation having 25 or more hogs at any time during the year, and includes independent hog producers and growers who produce hogs under contract. Animal units are defi ned as 1,000 pounds of live animal weight, and the inventory of animal units is based on an estimate of the average number of hogs and pigs on the operation in each year. Farrow-to-fi nish operations are those on which pigs are farrowed and then fi nished to a slaughter weight of 225-300 pounds. Feeder pig-to-fi nish operations are those on which feeder pigs are obtained from outside the operation, either purchased or placed under contract, and then fi nished to a slaughter weight of 225-300 pounds. Source: USDA, ERS, 1998 and 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Surveys. 6 Changes in Manure Management in the Hog Sector: 1998-2004 / EIB-50 Economic Research Service / USDA has moved aggressively into Western States like Colorado and Utah, where a low population density provides fl exibility in managing animal manure. More recently, the size of feeder pig-to-fi nish farms in the Heartland grew rapidly-doubling in average size between 1998 and 2004-while those in the Southeast grew more slowly (though starting from a larger average size). As a result, the Heartland's share of feeder pig-to-fi nish production grew 10 percentage points, while the Southeast's share declined by 7 points (Key and McBride, 2007). Slower growth in the Southeast can be attributed in part to a moratorium placed on the construction of new and expanded hog operations in 1997 (North Carolina General Assembly, 1997). 2 The moratorium was enacted in response to environmental concerns about managing hog manure from increasingly larger operations. Structural change has coincided with substantial effi ciency gains for hog farms, particularly on specialized hog-fi nishing operations. Most of these productivity gains were attributable to increases in the scale of production (scale effi ciency) and technological innovation. The amount of feed used per unit of output declined by 24 percent between 1998 and 2004 on feeder-tofi nish operations, while their real, or infl ation-adjusted, production costs per hundredweight of gain also declined by 24 percent (Key and McBride, 2007, p. 14). Higher feed productivity can reduce the amount of manure produced by hog operations and thus the amount of manure nutrients that must be disposed. "}, {"section_title": "Environmental Policies Affecting Manure Management", "text": "Growing concerns about the potential impacts of these changes on environmental quality have spurred local, State, and Federal action to mitigate environmental impacts of animal manure. Complaints about water quality and air quality (primarily odor) fuel most of the confl icts between the animal sector and the general population. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised Clean Water Act regulations in 2003 for controlling runoff of manure nutrients from the largest animal feeding operations (AFOs). Clean Water Act regulations now require that animal feeding operations designated as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, and needing a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (those that discharge or propose to discharge to surface waters), develop and implement a nutrient management plan. Such a plan sets a limit on the amount of nutrients that can be applied per acre of land. Also under the 2003 regulations, CAFOs that are not required to have an NPDES permit, but wish to claim the stormwater exemption 3 for runoff from fi elds, must develop and implement a nutrient management plan to demonstrate that due care is being taken to minimize polluted runoff from fi elds receiving manure. If a waterway becomes polluted with animal waste from fi eld runoff and a CAFO does not have a nutrient plan, it would be in violation of the Clean Water Act. Atmospheric emissions of pollutants are regulated by the Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA authorizes regulatory programs primarily for protecting human health. EPA has recently initiated development of regulations for reducing fi ne particulates in the atmosphere (referred to as PM 2.5 , for particles less than 2.5 microns in size). The Clean Air Act requires State, local, and tribal governments to identify areas not meeting national air quality standards for fi ne particulates (one of the six criteria pollutants regulated under the Act) (U.S. EPA, 2004b). States with designated non-attainment areas must submit plans that outline how they will meet the standards by 2010. This regulation could affect animal operations because ammonia is a major precursor of fi ne particulates. Controlling ammonia from animal operations would be a likely priority in non-attainment areas with high concentrations of animals (U.S. EPA, 2000). Also covering air pollution are the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Both laws utilize information disclosure to increase the information available to government and citizens about the sources and magnitude of chemical releases to the environment. CERCLA requires that facilities report to EPA when releasing more than a \"reportable quantity\" (e.g., 100 pounds in a 24-hour period) of a hazardous substance. EPCRA requires that a facility report to State and local authorities any releases reported under CERCLA. EPA is authorized to require long-term remedial action that permanently and signifi cantly reduces threats to public health. Originally focused on hazardous wastes from industrial plants, the increased size and consolidation of animal feeding operations may make their ammonia and hydrogen sulfi de emissions subject to the notifi cation provisions of CERCLA. EPA has enforced the CERCLA and EPCRA reporting requirements against AFO release of hazardous pollutants 3 Agricultural stormwater discharges are specifi cally exempted from permit requirements in the Clean Water Act. These include runoff from agricultural fi elds. Changes in Manure Management in the Hog Sector: 1998-2004 / EIB-50 Economic Research Service / USDA in two cases, although use of these laws for agricultural emissions is controversial (Copeland, 2008). Most States have implemented regulations-including permits, licenses, and zoning requirements-for controlling at least some of the environmental impacts of AFOs. North Carolina entered a legal agreement with the State's largest swine producers to develop innovative waste management strategies that would replace uncovered lagoon and sprayfi eld systems to prevent a repeat of the massive damage to water resources caused by Hurricane Floyd in 1995 (Williams, 2004). The purpose of the 1997 North Carolina moratorium was to give the State time to design and enact a regulatory system that would ensure that waste structures were sound, that waste application methods were adequate, and that waste utilization plans were in place. Iowa, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Kentucky have also introduced rules for curbing water pollution, ammonia, and odor from AFOs (Patton and Seidl, 1999;U.S. EPA, 2002). Agricultural-residential confl icts at the rural-urban fringe seem to be increasing as residential development expands further into rural areas, while market conditions push farmers to intensify their production (Bergstrom and Centner, 1989;Jacobson et al., 2006). Confl icts over environmental concerns are most prevalent for animal operations (Duke and Malcolm, 2003;Centner, 2002). Proximity can result in citizen complaints to local authorities and actual or threatened lawsuits over perceived threats to health and environmental quality, even when no laws have been broken. Such confl icts may force farmers to modify their production practices. Adoption of \"acceptable\" or \"qualifying\" management practices is one way farmers can demonstrate due care and possibly protect themselves from confl ict over environmental quality (Centner, 2002). To defray the costs of meeting the regulations, producers can apply for fi nancial assistance from USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program. A farmer may receive up to $450,000 for all EQIP contracts entered during the term of the Farm Act (typically 5-7 years) to help them develop and implement a nutrient management plan, construct appropriate animal and manure handling and storage facilities, or transfer and apply manure to land in an approved manner (USDA/ERS, 2009). Changes in Manure Management in the Hog Sector: 1998-2004 / EIB-50 Economic Research Service / USDA"}, {"section_title": "Manure Management on U.S. Hog Farms", "text": "One consequence of structural change in U.S. hog production has been the manure management challenge posed by concentrating more animals on a limited land base. Hog manure is primarily handled in two types of storage structures, lagoons and pits or tanks (see box, \"Manure Storage and Handling Strategies\"). Lagoons are large earthen containment structures into which manure and wastewater is fl ushed and maintained in liquid form until removed. Manure pits are often located under hog production facilities where, in the typical system, manure drops into pits through slatted fl oors and is stored in a slurry form until removed. These storage structures contain manure until it can be land-applied on the same or nearby farms to meet crop nutrient needs. Technologies for land application include liquid/slurry manure spreaders that may or may not incorporate manure into the soil at application, and sprinkler irrigation systems that are used to spread the liquid lagoon solution on nearby fi elds. The different systems for manure management have a vastly different impact on the nutrient content of the manure, primarily nitrogen, and thus on the amount of land needed to spread manure (McBride and Key, 2003). For example, handling manure in pit or tank storage and using slurry spreaders to inject manure into the soil utilizes the manure for its potential fertilizer value. This system is designed to retain manure nitrogen for crop use, and thus requires more land on which to apply manure if following a nitrogenbased nutrient management plan. In contrast, handling manure in lagoon storage and using sprinkler irrigation for spreading treats the manure as waste for disposal, rather than as a source of valuable crop nutrients. This system handles manure to increase the volatilization of nitrogen into the atmosphere, thus reducing its nutrient content and requiring less land for application."}, {"section_title": "Manure Storage and Handling", "text": "Lagoon use and scale of production have a strong positive association (fi g. 3). Despite this fact and the trend toward larger operations, there was a shift between 1998 and 2004 toward the use of pit/tank systems. By 2004, 56 percent of hogs were raised on farms using pit/tank systems (up from 37 percent in 1998); in 2004, 39 percent were raised on farms using a lagoon system (down from 55 percent in 1998). 4 This shift can be attributed to changes in the manure system used by medium and large-scale operations, but also refl ects regional shifts in hog production and farm structure. Operations in the Southeast more often use lagoon systems, while those in the Heartland are more likely to use a pit/tank system (McBride and Key, 2003). During 1998-2004, hog production expanded in the Heartland relative to the Southeast, as the North Carolina moratorium limited growth in the Southeast. Pit/tank systems generally use a solid or liquid spreader, while sprinkler irrigation technology is used to move and apply lagoon liquid. The method of applying manure can have important implications for air quality, affecting the level of odorous gases (ammonia and hydrogen sulfi de), particulate material (byproducts of ammonia), and greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide) (Abt Associates, 2000). Both solid and liquid manure can be incorporated into the soil, which reduces odor and nutrient volatilization (escape into 10 Changes in Manure Management in the Hog Sector: 1998-2004 / EIB-50 Economic Research Service / USDA the atmosphere) relative to spreading, making more nutrients available for plant uptake. Incorporation also reduces the risk of nutrient runoff. Sprinkler application increases nitrogen volatilization, which reduces the nitrogen available for plant use. Lagoon/sprinkler systems allow producers to dispose of manure from a given operation on fewer acres when a nitrogen criterion is used to determine application levels. There are clear relationships between the scale of production and the use of sprinkler irrigation versus solid or liquid spreaders. Among large farms that"}, {"section_title": "Manure Storage and Handling Strategies", "text": "Comprehensive nutrient management plan-Following a comprehensive nutrient management plan when applying manure and commercial fertilizer to land can reduce potential losses of nutrients to water resources through runoff or leaching (USDA, NRCS, 2005). Nutrient management matches applications to crop needs so that as few nutrients as possible are lost to the environment. A CNMP is a group of conservation practices and management activities that ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. Specifi c elements of a CNMP include background and site information; manure and wastewater handling and storage; farm safety and security; land treatment practice; soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus risk assessment; nutrient management according to criteria in the Nutrient Management Conservation Practice (code 590); and recordkeeping. A CNMP typically includes soil and manure testing for nutrient content, and the balancing of nutrient resources with crop needs. In monitoring the operation's total nutrient balance, the producer must account for nutrients generated, fi eld applied, removed in products, and transferred offsite. Plans can also account for atmospheric losses of nitrogen, as well as atmospheric deposition of nitrogen on cropland. Manure incorporation and injection-Rapidly incorporating manure into the soil, either by plowing or disking solids after spreading or injecting liquids and slurries directly into the soil, reduces odor and gaseous emissions (Abt, 2000;Arogo et al., 2002). It also reduces the risk of nutrients being transferred to adjacent water bodies. Slurry pits-Slurry systems store undiluted, untreated manure in watertight tanks or pits until it can be land applied. Storage can be either under the house or outdoors. The stored slurry is surface applied to fi elds by sprayer trucks or wagons, or incorporated into the soil with chisel plows behind nurse tanks, or directly injected into the soil with drag hoses (U.S. EPA, 2004a). Lagoons-Lagoon systems use open holding ponds to treat diluted manure for an extended period of time. Lagoons stabilize organic matter, reduce the nutrient mass that must be land applied, and vent a large quantity of the manure nitrogen as ammonia. Some of the diluted lagoon liquid is used to fl ush the production houses. The \"digested\" lagoon liquid is eventually sprayed on cropland. Lagoons are used primarily in warmer climates where the anaerobic processes can take place year round (U.S. EPA, 2004a).   5 For the intensity ratio, the denominator is the acres of land on the hog operation on which manure was applied. The numerator is the farm inventory (AU) adjusted for the removal of manure off the farm. For farms that moved manure off the operation, the number of AU was reduced by the equivalent amount of manure removed. For example, if 50 percent of the manure was moved off a 1,000-AU operation, only 500 AU was used to compute the ratio. applied manure to crops, sprinkler irrigation was the most commonly used form of manure application, followed by injection of liquid manure (table 2). Between 1998 and 2004, there was an overall large decline in the share of appliers who spread solid manure. Most of this change occurred because (1) there were fewer smaller farms, which are more likely to handle solid manure, and (2) the remaining small farms less often handled manure in solid form. Growers altered their spreading technologies between 1998 and 2004 to reduce odor, nutrient volatilization, and runoff. The share of all growers who applied liquid manure without injection declined by 9 percentage points. There was also a 10-percent increase in the share of large operations applying liquid manure with injection technologies, although this increase was not statistically signifi cant."}, {"section_title": "Manure Application and Disposal", "text": "There is a strong positive association between scale of production, total cropland available on the hog farm, and the number of acres on which manure is applied on the hog farm (table 3). Between 1998 and 2004, the average number of manure-applied acres and the average amount of cropland per farm did not change substantially. Also, the share of onfarm cropland with manure application remained much the same in 1998 and 2004, and was less than 30 percent among all farms and among farms in each size group. This indicates that the potential exists to spread manure over more crop acreage on these farms. However, higher costs of hauling manure longer distances and the technologies used to spread manure likely limit the acreage on which manure is applied. Figure 4 illustrates the strong positive association between the scale of production and the manure application intensity (animal units per acre). 5 The higher application rates for larger operations refl ect the large amount of manure generated by larger hog operations compared to the cropland on these operations available for manure application. Between 1998 and 2004, Source: USDA, ERS, 1998 and 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Surveys. the increase in total animal units produced outpaced the increase in crop acreage on which manure was applied, resulting in a 43-percent increase in average manure application intensity (table 3). However, this increase was driven mainly by operations with fewer than 300 animal units. For mediumscale operations, the application intensity remained about the same, and for operations with more than 1,000 animal units-which are more likely to be subject to nutrient management restrictions-the application intensity actually declined (fi g. 4). It is important to qualify the measure of manure application intensity. Different storage and handling techniques help determine the quantity of nutrients contained in applied manure, so application intensity does not measure actual nutrient application rates. In addition, increases in feed effi ciency have likely reduced the quantity of nutrients excreted by hogs. Nitrogen and phosphorus enter the production system in animal feed. Some of the nutrients are retained in the animal product (meat), but as much as 95 percent is excreted in urine and manure (Follett and Hatfi eld, 2001). Between 1998 and 2004, feed used per unit of output declined by 24 percent, falling from 282 to 214 pounds of feed per hundredweight gain on feeder-to-fi nish farms (Key and McBride, 2007). Assuming the nutrient composition of feed and meat has not changed substantially over this period, this implies a 24-percent decline in the quantity of nutrients excreted per animal produced. In addition, feed effi ciency is positively correlated with the scale of production-larger operations generally use less feed per hog produced. Hence, the nutrient application intensity (e.g., nitrogen per acre) is generally lower on larger farms than the estimated manure application intensity (animals per acre) would imply. There is a positive relationship between the scale of production and the quantity of manure removed from farms with hog operations, and this relationship grew stronger over time (fi g. 5). The share of farms removing manure grew 50 percent between 1998 and 2004 (table 4), and this increase is attributable mainly to large operations. Manure is most often removed from operations that have limited land for application and can fi nd nearby farms that are willing to make arrangements to have the manure applied to their land. 6 Most of the manure removed from farms was given away to nearby farms-only Source: USDA, ERS, 1998 and 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Surveys.  a small share was sold or required the operator to pay someone to remove it. There is some evidence of an emerging market for manure-the share of farms selling manure increased in all sales categories between 1998 and 2004, albeit from a very low level. Table 5 describes the evolution of manure management practices between 1998 and 2004. Manure nutrient testing, a practice required as part of many State-mandated manure management plans, was positively associated with scale of production (fi g. 6). Larger operations are more likely to face State  regulations that require nutrient management plans. Between 1998 and 2004, the share of farms testing for nitrogen (N) increased from 18 percent to 29 percent, and the share of animals on farms that tested manure for N increased from 51 percent to 73 percent. Nitrogen testing rates increased for all farmsize categories, especially the medium-scale operations (fi g. 6). The large operations did not have as much scope to increase their testing rate because 81 percent of these farms tested in 1998."}, {"section_title": "Manure Nutrient Management Practices", "text": "Commercial fertilizer is applied to crops in addition to manure if the manure's nutrients do not meet the nutritional needs of the crops. Testing the nutrient content of manure thus saves costs by avoiding overapplication of supplemental commercial fertilizer. As expected, there is a strong negative association between scale of production and the application of commercial fertilizer (fi g. 7). Larger operations are more likely to have a surplus of nutrients provided by the manure produced on their operations, and are therefore less likely to require supplemental commercial fertilizer. One strategy for increasing manure disposal on a limited land base is to plant crops that have a high rate of nutrient uptake. Bermuda grass, which is grown primarily in the South and Southeast, is especially appealing to hog producers because it consumes large amounts of nitrogen per acre. There was a strong positive association between the scale of production and the application of manure to Bermuda grass in 2004 (fi g. 8). However, Bermuda grass will consume soil nutrients only if it is harvested periodically, and there is almost no market for Bermuda grass hay in the areas where it is grown. Microbial phytase is used as an additive in fi nishing hog diets to increase the absorption of organic phosphorus, meaning that supplemental inorganic or mineral phosphorus may not be needed and feed costs are reduced. Also, phytase use reduces phosphorus excretion in manure. Lower manure phosphorus content can lead to increased spreading options by reducing the acres required to safely absorb manure nutrients. As expected, there is a positive relationship between scale of production and phytase use (fi g. 9). The share Source: USDA, ERS, 1998 and 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Surveys. of farms using phytase grew in all size categories between 1998 and 2004, with the share of all farms using phytase more than tripling (from 4 percent to 13 percent). The share of hogs raised on farms using phytase increased from 12 percent to 30 percent. Concern about manure phosphorus levels is also evident from the increase in the share of farms testing manure for phosphorus content between 1998 and 2004 (table 5). In 2004, about 30 percent of all farms followed a CNMP that requires growers to apply manure nitrogen at or below the agronomic rate and 62 percent of animal units were raised on farms using a CNMP (see box, \"Manure Storage and Handling Strategies\"). 7 There is also a positive association between the scale of production and the use of a CNMP (fi g. 10). Only about 30 percent of    The goal of manure application is to apply manure at rates that meet crop needs while avoiding over applications that could lead to water quality impairment. Rates that meet this goal are often called agronomic rates. Changes in Manure Management in the Hog Sector: 1998-2004 / EIB-50 Economic Research Service / USDA operations with 50-299 animal units followed a CNMP in 2004, compared to more than 60 percent of those with at least 300 animal units."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Policy and Other Impacts", "text": "Recent policy initiatives may explain some of the changes in manure management practices. Federal and State policies implemented in recent years have set limits on the amount of nutrients that can be applied per acre of land. Restricting application rates may explain increases in the crop acreage receiving animal manure and the amount of manure moved off the farm, as well as the widespread adoption of nutrient management plans observed in the ARMS.    nutrients also grew between 1998 and 2004. In 2004, 30 percent of farms, representing 62 percent of animal units, followed a nutrient management plan. Nutrient application restrictions and the desire to avoid future liabilities and lawsuits could explain the increasing share of operations moving manure off the farm, testing manure for nutrients, and using microbial phytase in feed. While the manure-nutrient application intensity generally increases with farm size, the fact that the application intensity declined on the largest operations between 1998 and 2004 suggests that environmental policy is contributing to the adoption of conservation-compatible manure management practices. The increasing concentration of hog production on large operations is expected to continue, meaning that manure management will continue to be an important issue to the hog industry and others concerned with its environmental impact. Results of this research imply that hog producers have responded to policy incentives, both positive and negative, designed to address the manure management issue. The fi ndings also suggest that there still is signifi cant room for reducing the environmental impact of manure disposal. For example, hog operations, on average, apply manure to less than 30 percent of available crop acreage. Policy incentives, along with technological innovation, are likely to play an important role in the future of hog manure management and its environmental impact."}]
