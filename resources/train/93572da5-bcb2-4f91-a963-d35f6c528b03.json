[{"section_title": "", "text": "Various statistical methods can be used in observational settings to control for bias in estimation of treatment effects. There is a common thread running through such approaches: the idea that an observational study can be considered as a randomized experiment, conditional on certain covariates. The approaches differ in the statistical assumptions they make and the methods they apply to the data. In this article, the focus is on a method of controlling for bias known as the Heckman Model (Greene, 1993; Heckman, 1978 Heckman, , 1979 Heckman & Robb, 1986) .\n1 Although the Heckman Model is a well-established approach among econometricians, its use is less common among educational statisticians. Much of what follows serves as a didactic introduction to the Heckman Model for the benefit of this latter audience, but more generally, this article presents the assumptions that would be necessary before the Heckman Model could be used to draw causal inferences in an observational setting.\nTo give this presentation an applied context, I use the Heckman Model to evaluate the effectiveness of coaching programs in improving performance on the SAT. The SAT is required for admission at almost all competitive 4-year colleges in the United States and has a math and verbal section, each scored on a scale that ranges from 200 to 800, with a standard deviation of about 110 points.\n2 Each year, about 2 million high school students take the test at a cost of about $25 each. Coaching for the SAT (and many other standardized tests) is a multimillion dollar industry. Such companies as Kaplan and The Princeton Review charge roughly $800 for 30-40 hours of instruction and have attributed to their programs average gains of 100-140 points on the combined math and verbal sections of the test (Schwartz, 1999) . Private tutors, books, videos, and computer software are also available, at a price, to help students prepare for the test. It has become widely accepted among the general public that coaching has a large effect on student scores. However, most published research on the topic suggests that the combined coaching effect is fairly small, in the range of about 20-30 points (Becker, 1990; Messick, 1980; Messick & Jungeblut, 1981; Powers, 1993; Powers & Rock, 1999) .\nOne problem for research on SAT coaching has been that coaching effect estimates are usually based on studies with observational designs, making causal inference about coaching effects equivocal. Typically, there is reason to believe that coached students self-select themselves on the basis of higher levels of motivation or academic ability. To the extent that such variables are themselves correlated with SAT performance, an estimated coaching effect will suffer from selection bias. When certain assumptions hold, the Heckman Model is a statistical approach that could be used in such a scenario to estimate an asymptotically unbiased effect of coaching. I discuss these assumptions and the form of the Heckman Model correction in the next section."}, {"section_title": "The Heckman Model", "text": "Consider the following behavioral model for a student taking the SAT:\n(1)\nThe model consists of a response schedule (1) and a selection function (2). In the response schedule, a student's potentially observable SAT score is a function of the variable COACH. Two different scores are possible for student i, depending on whether COACH = 1 or 0. The variable COACH is in theory manipulable-if its value is changed, the SAT score subsequently observed for student i will change as well (unless, of course, there is no coaching effect). The observed covariates in the vector X i are fixed characteristics of each student-they cannot be manipulated by the researcher. The response schedule specified here assumes a linear relationship between the variable COACH and the potentially observable SAT score, with a constant effect across individuals, represented by the parameter b. Likewise, the effect of X i is linear, and c is the same for all students. The \"error\" term \u03c3\u03b5 i represents the deviation of student i's SAT score from its expected value. In an experimental setting, the observed value of COACH for student i would be assigned by the researcher with a known probability. Here, the observed value of COACH is assumed to be governed by the selection function, which specifies that a student's decision to be coached is a function of the vector of observable covariates, Z i and the latent covariate, \u03b4 i . According to the model, observed SAT scores are generated as\nwhere COACH i is determined by Equation 2. Under the Heckman Model, three further statistical assumptions must be made:\nNo restrictions are imposed on the relationship between \u03b5 i and \u03b4 i , so the variable COACH i may be correlated with the error term \u03b5 i . This relationship is captured by the parameter \u03c1, which may take on any value between \u22121 and 1. If \u03c1 \u2260 0, the variable COACH i will be endogenous, and the causal parameter b will suffer from selection bias."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Note that if \u03b5 i and \u03b4 i are not correlated, then \u03c1 = 0, and there would be no selection bias problem, and linear regression could be used to estimate an unbiased coaching effect. Intuitively, \u03c1 \u2260 0 will be the case if an unobserved reason why students decide to get coached is correlated with an unobserved reason that students perform well on the SAT. For example, suppose students with more \"grit\" are the ones most likely to get coached. At the same time, suppose students with more \"moxie\" will perform better on the SAT. (I offer no definition of grit and moxie; the two are distinguishable but latent.) Although use of linear regression to draw causal inferences would require the assumption that grit (i.e., \u03b4 i ) and moxie (i.e., \u03b5 i ) are independent, the Heckman Model allows for the possibility that they are correlated.\nGiven Equations 1 and 2 and assumptions i-iii, if \u03c1 \u2260 0, and parameters a, b, and c were estimated by regressing Y i on a constant, COACH i and X i , the estimates would be biased. Because \u03c1 \u2260 0, the variable COACH i is endogenous, and E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4COACH i , X i ) \u2260 0. The Heckman Model strategy is to get an estimate for this term, and then treat it as an observable confounder of the relationship between coaching and SAT performance. Let \u03bb i = E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4COACH i , X i ). If this value were known for student i, then regressing Y i on a constant, COACH i , X i and \u03bb i would produce unbiased parameter estimates for a, b, c and h, where h is the regression coefficient associated with \u03bb i . Now, E(\u03b5 i \u2212 \u03bb i \uf8f4COACH i , X i ) = 0. If the assumptions of the Heckman Model are to be believed, then selection bias has been purged from the estimate of b.\nIn practice, \u03bb i is not known, but given the assumption that \u03b5 i and \u03b4 i have standard normal distributions, \u03bb i can be calculated as a function of the estimated parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3\u02c6in the selection function (2). Now, assuming that all confounding in the relationship between Y i and COACH i is attributable to X i , and all selection bias is attributable to \u03bb , then regressing Y i on a constant, COACH i , X i and \u03bb will almost control for bias in the estimate of b because of both confounding and self-selection. Heckman (1979) has shown that b will converge to b asymptotically, so b will be biased but consistent. The details of the Heckman Model for the coaching application are sketched out below.\nThe starting point for the Heckman Model is the selection function describing the way students decide whether or not they will seek coaching. The vector Z i contains observable covariates related to the probability that a student is coached. Latent covariates enter the picture through \u03b4 i . The term \u03b4 i is cast as an unmeasured latent continuous random variable with an assumed standard normal distribution. Student i's decision to seek coaching is determined by a linear combination of the measured and unmeasured covariates represented by Z i and \u03b4 i . The selection function specifies that if \u03b1 + Z i \u2425 + \u03b4 i > 0, student i will be coached. Otherwise, student i will not be coached. Given assumptions i and ii, another way of writing the selection function is\nwhere \u03a6 represents the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Given all the Z i s, the COACH i s are assumed to be independent, so Equation 4 constitutes what is known as the probit model. The Heckman Model goes from specifying a selection function to getting an estimate for the bias term, E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4X i , COACH i ) by estimating the expected value of a truncated normal random variable. 4 This estimate is known in the literature as the Mills ratio or hazard function, and can be expressed as the ratio of the standard normal density function, \u03c6(t), to \u03a6(t):\nwhere t is the point at which the distribution has been truncated. When the truncation is from above, then by symmetry of the normal distribution, the expected value of the random variable will be The goal is to estimate a value for the bias term E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4X i , COACH i ) for student i. Fix a value x i for X i . The selection bias term can be decomposed into two parts E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4X i = x i , COACH i = 1) and E(\u03b5 i \uf8f4X i = x i , COACH i = 0). Given the underlying behavioral model (Equations 1 and 2), and the condition that COACH i = 1, it follows that \u03b4 i no longer has a normal distribution, but a truncated normal distribu-\ntion. The conditional expectation of \u03b4 i will be E(\u03b4 i \uf8f4\u03b1 + Z i \u2425 + \u03b4 i > 0). Similarly, under the condition that COACH i = 0, it follows that \u03b4 i again has a conditionally truncated distribution-this time the truncation is from above. Now the conditional expectation of \u03b4 i is E(\u03b4 i \uf8f4\u03b1 + Z i \u2425 + \u03b4 i \u2264 0). The next step is to compute the conditional expectation of \u03b5 i , given X i and COACH i . Under the Heckman Model, \u03b5 i and \u03b4 i have correlation \u03c1. Let \u03be i be a random variable equal to (\u03b5 i \u2212 \u03c1\u03b4 i )/ . It follows from this definition that \u03be i has an expected value of 0 and is independent of \u03b4 i . Think of \u03be i as the random variable that picks up the variance left unexplained if \u03b5 i is regressed on \u03b4 i . Now \u03b5 i can be related to \u03b4 i and \u03be i :\nNote that \u03be i drops out of the equation because its conditional expectation is 0 by definition. The task is to evaluate the conditional expectation on the right side of Equation 8. Taking advantage of the symmetry of the normal distribution leads to the inverse Mills ratio, Likewise,"}, {"section_title": "This again yields the inverse Mills ratio", "text": "It follows from Equations 7-11 that \nwhere\nis equal to \u03c3\u03c1. Consistent estimates for b and h will be obtained by regressing Y i on a constant, COACH i , X i and \u03bb i (COACH i , \u015d i ). Note that while it is \u03c3 \u03c1 that is estimated by \u0125, if an estimate for \u03c1 is desired, it can be obtained by dividing \u0125 by \u03c3, where \u03c3 is estimated as a function of residuals from the regression equation. Because the conditional variance of \u03b5* i depends on Z i , a regression fit by OLS will be heteroskedastic. Estimates for a, b, c, and h will be consistent, but inefficient. The standard errors estimated using OLS will be incorrect. A regression fit by generalized least squares (GLS) will solve the latter problem (Greene, 1981) . If the GLS estimate for h is statistically significant, this suggests that had b been estimated directly using linear regression without the Heckman correction, the estimate would have contained selection bias. Note that \u03bb i (COACH i , \u015d i ) essentially adds an interaction term consisting of COACH i and the inverse Mills ratio to the main effect for COACH i in the regression equation. The difference in expected SAT scores between coached and uncoached students will be The effect of coaching estimated by regressing Y i on a constant, COACH i , X i without the Heckman Model correction is the combination of these two terms: the main coaching effect and the coaching by inverse Mills ratio interaction. The term in brackets will always be positive. The estimate \u0125 has been defined as the product of \u03c3 and \u03c1. Because \u03c3 is always positive, if \u03c1 is positive, this suggests that the coaching effect estimated without the Heckman Model correction would be biased upward. If \u03c1 is negative, it suggests that the coaching effect estimate without the Heckman Model correction would be biased downward.\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6.\nTo summarize, the Heckman Model, as applied to coaching studies, has two main steps 5 :\n1. Specify a selection function for coaching status and estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood. Use these estimated parameters, and the assumed normal distributions of the response schedule and the selection function to compute the inverse Mills ratio when COACH i = 1 and when COACH i = 0.\n2. Include \u03bb i (COACH i , \u015d i ) in a linear regression equation as a covariate. Estimate the coaching effect, b and the selection bias parameter, \u0125 (i.e. \u03c3 \u03c1) using OLS or GLS."}, {"section_title": "The Heckman Model in Practice", "text": "As presented here, the Heckman Model assumes that the functional form of the causal relationship between outcome, treatment, and covariates is linear. In the context of observational studies where the coaching variable is dichotomous, the linearity assumption is violated if some or all of the covariates in X i have a nonlinear relationship with Y i . If the linearity assumption is incorrect, a coaching effect will be estimated as the difference between the wrong two regression surfaces. A constancy constraint; that is, b i = b, is also typically stipulated, so that person i = 1, . . . , N is affected by the treatment in the same way. The constancy constraint is violated, for example, when certain types of students benefit significantly more or less from coaching. Indeed, interaction effects between coaching and student characteristics have been analyzed from the very earliest coaching study by Dyer (1953) to the more recent study by . If the constancy constraint is wrong, then causal inferences about \"the\" coaching effect may be misleading. Such parametric assumptions as linearity and constancy have been discussed in more detail in the context of an alternative approach to causal inference in observational settings known as the Propensity Matching Model. For details, see Rosenbaum (2002) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983, 1984) .\nBecause of the strong assumptions that underlie the Heckman Model, its usefulness has been questioned by some statisticians (Little, 1985; Wainer, 1986) and econometricians (Goldberger, 1983) . In one unusual case (Lalonde, 1986) , the causal estimates from a Heckman Model were put to the empirical test-and the results were not encouraging. Lalonde gained access to data from a federally randomized experiment conducted to determine the average effect of a job-training program. The effect was estimated by comparing the posttreatment incomes of subjects in an experimental treatment group to the posttreatment incomes of an experimental control group. Based on the findings from the randomized experiment, the average effect of the program seemed to be a little over $800, with a standard error of about $300. Lalonde attempted to recreate these results by substituting nonexperimental control groups for the experimental control and using a Heckman Model with different specifications of the selection function to approximate the result of the randomized experiment. The results showed that when using four different selection function specifications while holding constant gender and type of nonexperimental control group, the estimated effect of the program varied from $10 to $670, and in few cases was the estimated effect within a standard error of the exper-imental estimate. Lalonde did not, however, conclude that the Heckman Model's apparent sensitivity to alternate selection function specifications threatened the usefulness of the model, nor did he speculate as to what drove this sensitivity. Powers and Rock (1999) employed both linear regression and the Heckman Model to estimate a causal effect for SAT coaching in an observational setting. The findings from this study were that the two approaches produced relatively similar estimates of coaching effects and that neither approach produced effect estimates considerably different from a baseline comparison with only pretreatment test scores as covariates. In a footnote, Powers and Rock reported that their Heckman Model estimates had been sensitive to specifications of the selection function, but no details were provided.\nThe relationship between the specification of the selection function and subsequent effect estimates would seem to merit closer attention because, as a procedure, the Heckman Model offers no guidance as to the covariates that should be included in its selection function. It is only assumed that {Z i : i = 1, . . . , n} is independent of {\u03b4 i : i = 1, . . . , n}. As a matter of identifiability, it does not matter whether the covariates in the selection function differ from those in the response schedule. The inverse Mills ratio is identified through its nonlinear relationship to X i . In some illustrations of the Heckman Model, it has been suggested that the covariates in the selection function should contain one or more variables related to the probability of treatment selection, but excluded from outcome prediction (e.g., Greene, 1993; Lalonde, 1986) . In other illustrations, only covariates excluded from outcome prediction have been included in the selection function (e.g., Statacorp, 2001 ). In either case, it is typically assumed that the additional variables included in the selection function are strong predictors of treatment assignment, yet uncorrelated with the outcome of interest. These are known as instrumental variables in the econometric literature.\nIn the context of SAT coaching, an ideal instance of an instrumental variable would occur if participation in coaching programs were assigned to interested students using a lottery system. One could imagine some sample of students in which each student was given a randomly generated number. Subsequently, a researcher would decide, based on some cutoff value, whether each student would be assigned to a coaching program or not. The value of the random number generator would be perfectly correlated with coaching assignment but presumably uncorrelated with SAT performance. Specifying a selection function for use in a Heckman Model would seem quite credible in this instance.\nAs in the case above, the ideal choice of covariates to include in the selection function should be based on some theoretical understanding of the selection mechanism. Of course, observational studies seldom present the researcher with this sort of scenario."}, {"section_title": "NELS Data", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88, hereafter referred to as NELS) tracks a nationally representative sample of U.S. students from the eighth grade through high school and beyond. The NELS data can be used for an observational evaluation of coaching effectiveness because it contains SAT scores and information about how students prepared for the SAT. A panel of nearly 15,000 students completed survey questionnaires in the second two waves of NELS in 1990 and 1992. One of the questions asked students to select from a range of options describing how they had prepared to take the SAT. In addition to student questionnaire responses, high school transcripts were collected. Each transcript included information on student grades, course taking patterns, school demographics, and college admission test scores.\nFor the analysis that follows, attention is focused on the NELS panel sample of students who completed surveys in the first (F1) and second (F2) follow-ups and for whom transcript data was collected. This comprises an F1-F2 panel of 14,617 students. The emphasis in most SAT coaching studies has been on those students who have taken the SAT and for whom there is a prior SAT or PSAT score available before a test preparation treatment has been introduced. I similarly restrict attention to the 3,504 students from the NELS subsample who took both the PSAT and SAT, were members of the 10th-and 12th-grade cohorts as of the NELS F1 and F2 surveys, and indicated whether or not they had been coached as a means of preparing for the SAT.\nTo estimate a coaching effect from the NELS data using the Heckman Model requires three types of variables: an outcome variable (Y), a coaching variable (COACH), and covariates to be included in X and Z. I briefly describe each in turn."}, {"section_title": "Math and Verbal SAT Scores", "text": "The outcome variable of interest is a score on either the math or verbal section of the SAT. As of the early 1990s, the SAT was a timed, multiple-choice test lasting for 2 1 \u20442 hours. The test was intended to measure the constructs of mathematical and verbal reasoning, with scores from two different test sections. Each score was based on student responses to about 85 verbal items and 60 math items on the SAT. Because this is a relatively large number of items, and the items are chosen with great care, the SAT has the desirable technical feature of high internal consistency. The reliability of SAT math and verbal scores using Cronbach's alpha is about 0.9, and the standard error of measurement for each test section is usually about 30 points. The mean and standard deviation of SAT-V scores (446 and 102) for the NELS subsample are both slightly lower than the mean and standard deviation of SAT-M scores (501 and 117). 8 The mean scores for all college-bound seniors taking the test in 1991-1992 was about 423 on the SAT-V and 475 on the SAT-M. The mean SAT scores for the NELS subsample are slightly higher than those of the national population of test takers because they are restricted to those students who had previously taken the PSAT."}, {"section_title": "The Coaching Variable", "text": "The treatment variable of interest is whether or not students have been coached before taking the SAT. The NELS F2 questionnaire asked students a targeted question about their test preparation activities. This question is replicated verbatim above. With the exception of studying with a book, all of the methods listed above to prepare for the SAT have been classified as coaching in previous studies. In this analysis, students are classified as having been coached if they have enrolled in a commercial test preparation course. For students answering question B above with a \"yes,\" the dummy variable COACH is coded with a 1. For students answering with a \"no,\" COACH is coded with a 0. The distinction made here is whether a test taker has received systematic instruction over a short period of time. Preparation with books, videos, and computers are excluded from the coaching definition because, although the instruction may be systematic, it has no time constraint. Preparation with a tutor is excluded because, although it may have a time constraint, it is difficult to ascertain if the instruction was systematic. This definition 7 of the term is consistent with that used by Powers and Rock (1999) , and this makes the coaching effect estimates generated from the NELS data somewhat more comparable to those generated from the nationally representative data in the Powers and Rock study. Also, commercial coaching is the most controversial means of test preparation because it is costly, widely available, and comes with published claims regarding its efficacy. About 15% of the students in the NELS subsample indicated that they had taken a commercial course to prepare for the SAT."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "To control for confounding in the estimation of coaching effects, an appropriate set of covariates must be chosen for X i . The choice of covariates can be guided to a great extent by previous investigations of coaching effectiveness. A review of the research literature on SAT coaching (see Briggs, 2002) indicates that previous SAT or PSAT scores, demographic characteristics, academic background, and student motivation may serve to confound coaching effect estimates. These variables, and their relationship to coaching status, are shown in Table 1 . Student motivation can be further divided into variables that represent intrinsic motivation (e.g., selfesteem) and extrinsic motivation (e.g., parental pressure). The latter variables may predict whether students are likely to be coached, but are unlikely to have a direct influence on how students will perform on the SAT. Variables measuring extrinsic motivation, shown separately in Table 2 , might be particularly attractive candidates to include within the matrix Z for a coaching selection function."}, {"section_title": "406", "text": "To prepare for the SAT and/or ACT, did you do any of the following?\nA Take a special course at your high school B Take a course offered by a commercial test preparation service C Receive private one-to-one tutoring D Study from test preparation books E Use a test preparation video tape F Use a test preparation computer program When coached and uncoached students are compared along these sets of covariates in the NELS data, it seems that the coached group is from a higher socioeconomic group and more extrinsically motivated to take the SAT than their uncoached counterparts. It does not appear that the coached group comprises academically \"smarter\" or more intrinsically motivated students-both groups are enrolled in college preparatory classes, both groups performed about the same on NELS standardized tests in reading and math, both report having comparable levels of self-esteem, and both report that they do about the same amount of homework per week."}, {"section_title": "Coaching Effects and the Heckman Model", "text": "I start by specifying all covariates with a theoretical relationship to coaching status and SAT performance in the underlying behavioral model described by Equations 1 and 2.

The specification decision hinges upon what covariates are included in Z i . Ideally, students in the NELS survey would have been assigned to coaching programs by some known process, or at least asked questions about why they did or did not enroll in coaching programs, but because NELS was not designed to answer this sort of question, such data are not available. In many empirical applications of the Heckman Model, the decision of which covariates to include in Z i seems largely to be a matter of ensuring that the model is well identified.\nI consider five plausible specifications of a selection function for coaching: SF1, SF2, SF3, SF4, and SF5. The predictors in each specification are listed in Figure 1 . Which of these is the \"right\" specification of the selection function? A reasonable case could be made for each of the five. In SF1, all the covariates specified as possible confounders in the regression equation are included as predictors in the selection function, and this represents the kind of mechanical use of the Heckman Model to be expected when the data analyst has no operating theory for how students select coaching. Note that the Heckman Model in this case is identified only by the nonlinearity of the selection function. Some have referred to this as \"weak\" identification (Breen, 1996; Vella, 1998) . In SF2, one additional predictor, the dummy variable PARENT, has been added to the selection function. Now the model is overidentified because PARENT is not a covariate in the response schedule. Here, we imagine the data analyst has access to at least one variable thought to predict coaching status but not SAT performance. This is known as a single exclusion restriction. SF2 does not constitute a theory per se, but it is the simplest possible improvement over SF1. For SF3, only covariates excluded from X i in the response schedule (PPRESS, HWTUTOR, and HI_MOT) are included as predictors in the selection function.\n10 Under SF3, there are now four variables thought to predict coaching status but not SAT performance. In addition, the strong and questionable assumption is made that no covariates in X i should be used to predict coaching status. The specification SF3 is meant as an extreme contrast with SF1. In SF1, all covariates in X i are also in Z i ; in SF3, no covariates 11 in X i are also in Z i . In SF4, all predictors included in the selection function are chosen by a stepwise selection algorithm. SF4 is another example of a mechanical approach a data analyst might take in specifying the selection function: all possible covariates are thrown into an algorithm, and an optimal subset emerges. Finally, for SF5, predictors are chosen for two reasons: because they have some theoretical relationship to coaching status (SES, PARENT, PPRESS, HWTUTOR, HI_MOT ) or because they have an empirical relationship to coaching status (AGE, SCH_RUR, MTHGRD). SF5 is an approximation of a theory-based specification approach. Here, the data analyst has taken some care in choosing predictors with a hypothesized relationship to coaching status (i.e., it is well established that coaching programs can be expensive; hence, high SES students are more likely to enroll in them). In addition, the data analyst has analyzed the pair-wise cross tabulations of all covariates with coaching status and included three for which there was evidence of a statistically significant relationship. SF5 has four exclusion restrictions as in SF3, but includes in Z i a subset of covariates from X i , as in SF4. Table 3 presents the parameter estimates generated from a probit model for each of the five SF specifications. It is not at all obvious on statistical grounds that any\none of the five specifications is the best choice for use in the Heckman Model. Unlike linear regression, where model fit is often assessed on the basis of R 2 , there is no such measure of absolute fit for the probit model. When compared using a likelihood ratio (LR) test to a baseline specification with just a constant and no predictors, all five SF specifications would be considered a statistical improvement. A variant of this approach is represented by the \"pseudo R 2 \" values in the third row of Table 3 . The pseudo R 2 for each specification is calculated as (1 \u2212 L)/L 0 , where L is the log likelihood for a given specification of the selection function, and L 0 is the log likelihood for the baseline specification. According to this criterion, the SF4 and SF5 specifications improve model fit the best relative to the baseline model, but not by much-all five specifications are within about 0.04 of one another. Of the five specifications, only SF1 and SF2 are nested and can be compared directly using a likelihood ratio test. The difference in deviance between SF2 and SF1 is 11.7 with an approximate chi-square distribution on 2 degrees of freedom. On this basis, SF1 can be rejected in favor of SF2, but no LR test can recommend SF2 over SF3, SF4, or SF5.\nAnother possible criterion to consider in picking a \"best fitting\" specification is one with the largest proportion of statistically significant probit coefficient estimates. This is fairly important because the next step of the Heckman Model is to calculate an inverse Mills ratio as a function of the estimated coefficients, whether they are significant or not. Naturally, the SF4 specification comes out on top hereall of its coefficients are statistically significant because its predictors were selected with this criterion in mind. The SF3 and SF5 specifications are not far behind, with 86% and 72% of estimated coefficients statistically significant. SF1 and SF2 are particularly weak relative to this criterion, with only 13% and 20% of estimated coefficients statistically significant.\nFor each of the five SF specifications, one can examine the predicted probabilities of being coached as a function of selection function covariates. For SF4 and SF5, the highest estimated probability is about .2 higher than that estimated under SF1, SF2, and SF3. In terms of the actual and predicted number of coached students for each specification, all the specifications tend to underpredict the number of coached students. None of these models correctly predicts the coaching status for more than about 20% of those students who were actually coached.\nThe point of these model comparisons is that in most applications of the Heckman Model, precious little ink has been spent validating selection function specifications. Seldom are alternate specifications compared, and it is even more seldom that there is any theory to bolster the specification ultimately chosen. The decision of what predictors to include or exclude from the selection function is a nontrivial one and can have substantial ramifications on the estimated parameters generated by the Heckman Model."}, {"section_title": "Heckman Model Estimates", "text": "The inverse Mills ratio, \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ), can be estimated for the k = 1, . . . , 5 SF specifications. For the second step of the Heckman Model I, proceed by including \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ) as a covariate in the regression of Y i on a constant, COACH i , and X i . Each regression is weighted by the variable DESWGT to account for the NELS population weights, as well as the design effects caused by the stratification and clustering of students in the NELS sample. The clustering of students in the NELS subsample amounts to a mean of 4 and a median of 6 students per school-relative to a mean and median of 14 for the full F1-F2 panel sample. In the NELS subsample, there is on average just one coached student per sampled school. Given this, the design effect correction of 3 used here will probably overestimate standard errors and should be viewed as a conservative upper bound. Finally, because the conditional variance of \u03b5 i under the Heckman Model is heteroskedastic, a generalized least squares fitting procedure (Greene, 1981 ) is used to get efficient standard error estimates for the regression coefficients. Table 4 reports the results of these regressions for SAT-V and SAT-M test scores. The estimated effects for COACH vary, sometimes dramatically, depending upon which version of \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ) is included in the Heckman Model. For specifications with SAT-V as the dependent variable, the estimated coaching effect ranges from a low of 0 points to a high of 69 points. For specifications with SAT-M as the dependent variable, the estimated coaching effect ranges from a low of 30 points, to a high of 80 points.\nDepending upon the selection function that is specified, the Heckman Model tells a different story about the nature of selection bias in SAT coaching. In models with SAT-V as the dependent variable, the estimated correlation \u03c1 between \u03b4 i and \u03b5 i is \u22120.60 and \u22120.42 for SF1 and SF2, but close to zero for SF4 and SF5. When (HWTUTOR, PARENT, PPRESS, HI_MOT) . SF4 : Z i = covariates chosen by stepwise selection (SCH_RUR, PPRESS, HWTUTOR, REMATH, HI_MOT, SES, MTHCRD) . SF5 : Z i = covariates that were stat sig in coaching crosstabs (AGE, SES, MTHGRD, SCH_RUR, HWTUTOR, PARENT, PPRESS, HI_MOT) .\nSAT-M is the dependent variable, the estimated correlation is \u22120.64 for SF1, but between \u22120.36 and \u22120.10 for SF2 through SF5. Only in the SF1 specification of the model is the parameter estimate for \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ) also statistically significant, indicating the presence of selection bias. For these (as well as most other) specifications, the estimated negative correlations between \u03b4 i and \u03b5 i would suggest that the students who are more likely to get coached are those who are less likely to perform well on a particular section of the SAT. If these versions of the Heckman Model are to be believed, it would indicate that any coaching effects estimated by the linear regression model will be biased downward. On the other hand, most specifications of the Heckman Model considered here suggest that any selection bias in the data is not statistically significant.\nMulticollinearity helps explain why coaching effect estimates vary so dramatically, with large standard errors, under different specifications of the Heckman Model selection function. In particular, the variable COACH i and \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ) are strongly correlated, which follows from the fact that the latter is defined as an interaction with the former. When the variables \u03bb ik (COACH i , \u015d ik ) based on SF1 and SF2 are regressed on a constant, COACH i and X i , the respective adjusted R 2 s are 0.98 and 0.97. Likewise, the regressions based on SF3, SF4, and SF5 have adjusted R 2 s of 0.92, 0.94, and 0.92. The easiest solution to the multicollinearity problem is to omit one or more covariates from the regression equation. However, this is not a real solution to the problem because the underlying behavioral model has now been violated-any decrease in multicollinearity will come with a potential increase in bias. Other solutions have been proposed and applied to handle collinear data without omitting variables (cf., ridge regression and principal components analysis as described in Greene, 1993, pp. 270-273) . A detailed discussion of these methods is outside the scope of this article, but it is important to note that \"solutions\" to multicollinearity have their own associated problems. To the extent that such methods change the structure and relationship of the data under consideration, they will almost certainly change the causal interpretation of the Heckman Model as presented here."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Effect Estimates", "text": "Figures 2 and 3 compare the SAT-V and SAT-M coaching effects estimated by: (1) taking the unadjusted difference in average scores between coached and uncoached students; (2) using the five Heckman Model specifications; and (3) using only linear regression with the covariates X i (i.e., assuming that \u03b4 i and \u03b5 i are independent). I include around each point estimate the corresponding 95% confidence interval. All parameters are estimated with the same design effect correlation.\nFor the SAT-V, the linear regression model produces a statistically significant point estimates of about 11 points for the coaching effect. The Heckman Model produces effect estimates ranging from 0 to 70 points, only two of which (SF1 and SF2) are statistically significant. If the SF1 and SF2 specification of the Heckman Model are ignored, the SAT-V effect estimates from both models are smaller than what would be estimated by simply taking the average difference in SAT-V scores for coached and uncoached students. For the SAT-M, the Heckman Model produces coaching effect estimates ranging from 30 to 70 points-estimates that are generally more than twice as large as the 19-point estimate produced under linear regression. The SAT-M coaching effect estimates tend to be statistically significant under both models. Under the Heckman Model, the estimates tend to be larger (SF 3 is the exception) than what would be estimated by simply taking the difference in the average SAT-M scores for coached and uncoached students, while under linear regression the estimate is smaller. Unlike the Lalonde study, there is no absolute criterion against which to compare the coaching effects estimated by the Heckman Model. Only the Powers and Rock (1999) study has used the Heckman Model to estimate coaching effects. The covariates and predictors available in the Powers and Rock data, although not quite of the same quality as some of those available from NELS, were fairly similar. In their regression equation Powers and Rock included covariates for PSAT or first SAT scores, father's education, student high school GPA, math GPA, race/ethnicity, and two measures of student motivation.\n12 Their selection function included all the same variables and also included the student's GPA in high school social science courses. This specification of the Heckman Model is probably most comparable to my SF2. However, Powers and Rock's SAT-V coaching effect estimate (12 points) produced using the Heckman Model was similar only to those produced under SF4 and SF5 with the NELS data; for the SAT-M their effect estimate (13 points) was generally less than a third of the NELS-based estimates. Powers and Rock also estimated standard errors that were, on the whole, much smaller than those found in the analysis of the NELS data, in part perhaps because their data structure did not require a design effect correction."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The question of when causal inferences can be drawn in observational studies is a subject of perpetual debate. Much attention has been directed at the suitability of the linear regression model for making claims of cause and effect (cf. Berk, 2003; Freedman, 1995 Freedman, , 2002 Holland, 2001) . With respect to the behavioral model presented here, a key difference between linear regression and the Heckman Model is the relaxation of the independence assumption between the error terms in Equations 1 and 2. Another key assumption of the Heckman Model is bivariate normality for those error terms. If normality does not hold, then the Heckman Model as described here falls apart as a correction for the selection bias problem. Note that normality is a necessary condition for consistent estimation under the Heckman Model, but not for linear regression. If the linear regression error term is iid, if the error terms in Equations 1 and 2 are independent, and if confounding covariates are included in the model, then linear regression will produce unbiased causal effect estimates even when the distribution of the error term (\u03b5 i ) is nonnormal.\nAs a correction for the problem of selection bias, the Heckman Model is an intuitively appealing tool. That being said, I have shown that using a selection function specified just with the objective of identifying the model (e.g., SF1 and SF2), results in effect estimates from the Heckman Model that are substantially different than those estimated from a selection function specified on a slightly more theoretical basis (e.g., SF5). I have also shown that once a selection function has been specified, estimated, and used to calculate the inverse Mills ratio, a large degree of multicollinearity may serve to inflate standard error estimates. With access to the right software (e.g., STATA, LIMDEP), the Heckman Model is easily implemented with seemingly obvious causal conclusions. This article suggests successful application of the Heckman Model in social science research must hinge upon a compelling theoretical rationale and a careful scrutiny of the data.\nThe results of the analysis of the NELS data here are consistent with the established notion that much caution must be exercised before applying the Heckman Model as a means of drawing causal inferences about a treatment effect. In the social sciences, bias in the estimated effects from any given study is very difficult to rule out, no matter how intuitively appealing the method. There is, unfortunately, no statistical silver bullet."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1 Three other popular approaches sometimes used in this context include the Propensity Matching Model (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) , two stages least squares (Greene, 1993; pp. 603-610) , and structural equation modeling (J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1996) .\n2 As of 1994, the SAT became the SAT I. For the sake of consistency, the term SAT is used generically throughout to represent a multiple-choice test used for purposes of college admission.\n3 In this context, the tern \"selection bias\" is being used synonymously with the term \"endogeneity bias.\" 4 For details, see Johnson and Kotz, 1971, pp. 112-113 and Greene, 1993, pp. 682-689. 5 The Heckman Model can also be implemented as one-step approach when estimation is done by maximum likelihood, but the two-step approach is more common in the applied literature (Vella, 1998) . 6 That mean SAT-V scores are higher than mean SAT-M scores is an artifact of the original samples used to create the original SAT score scales. The SAT scale was recentered as of 1995 (see Dorans, 2002, for details) . Historical tables with mean SAT scores are now expressed in this metric. The mean scores for the NELS subsample correspond to recentered scores of 543 on the SAT-V and 524 on the SAT-M. 7 Other ways of defining the coaching treatment with respect to the NELS prompt on test preparation activities are certainly possible. Many of these are described and analyzed in Briggs (2004) . 8 The reference categories are WHITE and SCH_SUB for the racial/ethnic and school location dummy variables, respectively. The SES index was developed as part of the NELS database and combines information about parental education, income, and occupation into a single variable. Generally, students with higher SES values come from families with parents who are better educated, wealthier, and have jobs in more prestigious occupations. For the NELS subsample considered here, the SES index has a mean of 0.44, a standard deviation of 0.73, and a range from \u22122.4 to 2.5. 9 College preparatory math courses consist of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus. 10 Values for the predictors PARENT, PPRESS, and HWTUTOR were missing for anywhere from 2 to 10% of the NELS subsample of 3,144 students used in the linear regression model. Missing values for these predictors were coded as three unique dummy variables that took the value of 1 if a student's response was missing, and 0 otherwise. For any selection function specification including one or more of these three variables, the associated missing value dummy variable MPARENT, MPPRESS, or MHWTUTOR was also included.\n11 Strictly speaking, this is not true because HI_MOT is itself a function of PSAT-V, PSAT-M, and MTHGRD. 12 This information was not included in their published study of 1999, but was provided to me in a personal communication (Rock, 2002) ."}]
