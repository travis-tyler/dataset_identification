Their multivariate nature allows them to take into consideration correlations present in the data, overcoming limitations of standard analytical approaches. In particular, the prediction capabilities of machine learning methods are ideal for many clinical applications. One area of neuroimaging research where these techniques have gained attention is in the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since it is very likely that the pathophysiologic processes leading to AD start well before the onset of clinically detectable symptoms, methods of early detection are paramount to facilitate subsequent interventions that might decrease progression and morbidity associated with this devastating disease (Mueller et al., 2005a,b) . Machine learning techniques could be of great utility for their potential to uncover subtle atrophy patterns in the neuroimaging data that otherwise are very difficult to detect by a human expert using traditional analyses and diagnostic techniques (Davatzikos, 2004 ).\nBrain aging classification analyses of structural MRI images (sMRI) are especially challenging due to the high dimensionality defined by the large number of voxels, while the number of available samples is often small. This characteristic makes the classification problem intrinsically ill-posed and regularization is needed to solve it (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977) . One way to alleviate the problem is to use dimensionality reduction, for example, via region of interest (ROI) based measures instead of voxels as input features (Lerch et al., 2008; Magnin et al., 2009) , principal component analysis (Teipel et al., 2007) , or partial least squares (PLS; Phan et al., 2010) . Vemuri et al. (2008) have developed a method composed of several steps that uses down sampling of the sMRI images and feature selection to construct the final feature vectors that are fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM; Boser et al., 1992; Vapnik, 1998) for the final classification step. Davatzikos and colleagues have developed a methodology called COMPARE (Fan et al., 2007) that also consists of several steps that combine filtering, image processing, and feature selection procedures, with the goal of identifying homogeneously discriminative regions that are fed into a non-linear SVM. In the case of COMPARE, the processing steps are preceded by a normalization procedure based on a high dimensional warping method called HAMMER (Shen and Davatzikos, 2002) . Potential drawbacks of all these approaches are the possibility of discarding useful information present in the images during the dimension reduction process and producing features that do not necessarily follow the patterns associated with different disease processes. In order to avoid these problems it would be desirable to have a classification procedure able to directly operate on voxel space. We introduce here a large scale classification method based on penalized logistic regression, as well as on recent methodological developments in optimization and regularization theory. Different versions of penalized logistic regression have been used before in genetics research to analyze microarray and sequence data (Shevade and Keerthi, 2003; Zhu and Hastie, 2004; Liu et al., 2007; Park and Hastie, 2008) , stroke deficits prediction (Phan et al., 2010) , fMRI data analysis (Yamashita et al., 2008; Ryali et al., 2011) , and to study associations of brain tissue atrophy to hormone therapy treatments (Casanova et al., 2011) . Here, our main aim is prediction of cognitive status based on sMRI images via large scale regularization, or, in other words, solving problems of very large size. For this purpose we applied PLR with coordinatewise descent optimization as implemented in the GLMNET library (Friedman et al., 2007 (Friedman et al., , 2010 to solve the classification problem. This family of methods is very efficient and has the ability to deal with very large classification and regression problems, as the one posed by voxel-wise classification of sMRI images. We combine our classification procedures with a high dimensional normalization procedure implemented in the software package ANTS, which is based on symmetric diffeomorphic registration (SyN; Avants et al., 2008) . In the largest evaluation of non-linear brain registration algorithms to date, SyN was found to be a top-ranking performer, providing among the best results according to overlap and distance measures, and delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets (Klein et al., 2009) . Previous work has evaluated ANTS performance when automated labeling of elderly and neurodegenerative brain images is carried out (Avants et al., 2008) and also the impact of ANTS similarity metrics on brain image registration (Avants et al., 2011) . Our work sheds further light about ANTS performance in the context of machine learning analyses of brain imaging data and specifically for automatic detection of AD.\nThere are a few classification methodologies that rely on large scale regularization; most are based on SVM (Ashburner, 2007; Kloppel et al., 2008; Cuingnet et al., 2010a) and the kernel approach. For example, Kloppel and colleagues used linear SVM for automatic classification of gray matter (GM) maps combining it with a high dimensional normalization technique called DAR-TEL (Ashburner, 2007; Kloppel et al., 2008) . We characterize the performance of our approach by reporting the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classifying sMRI images downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) website (Mueller et al., 2005a; Petersen et al., 2009) . We also study how informative different brain tissues and morphometric measures are for automatic classification of sMRI in AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI DATABASE", "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database 1 sponsored by the NIH and industrial partners.

The SyN normalization procedures have been implemented in the freely available ANTS software toolbox.

It models the class-conditional probabilities through a linear function of predictors log\nIn problems where the number of predictors (voxels in our case) is much greater than the number of samples (vectorized GM, WM, and Jacobian images in our case) it is necessary to apply regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977) . In the present study, we evaluate the performance of penalized logistic regression when applied to classification of sMRI images as implemented in the GLMNET library (Friedman et al., 2010) . In general GLMNET solves the problem defined by\nwhere N is the number of samples (98 subjects in our case), x i \u2208R p is the ith sample or feature vector containing the gray and/or white matter voxels entering the analysis, p is the number of voxels entering the analysis, y i \u2208{1,2} is the ith label (1 for CN and 2 for AD participants), \u03b2 0 , \u03b2\u2208R p +1 are the parameters of the model, and \u03bb is the regularization parameter. The regularization scheme described by Eq. 2 contains two terms: a loss term defined by the logistic loss or binomial deviance function and a penalty term called elastic net which is a linear combination of L 1 and L 2 penalties. The first term drives the fidelity of the solution to the data and the second term introduces constrains to the solution in order to stabilize the problem. The regularization parameter \u03bb regulates a tradeoff between these two criteria. In this case we forced \u03b1 = 0 in order to enforce the L 2 penalization in a similar manner to ridge regression (Hoerl, 1962 ). The GLMNET library (Friedman et al., 2010 ) uses a very efficient optimization technique called coordinate-wise descent (Friedman et al., 2007) . The basic idea of the method is to solve a sequence of one dimensional optimization problems by fixing all variables except one. The process is iterated until convergence. This class of methods has been independently developed by different groups (Fu, 1998; Daubechies et al., 2004; Krishnapuram and Hartemink, 2005) and its convergence has been proven for classes of convex optimization problems (Tseng, 1988) . Our software implementation is based on MATLAB where the glmnet library is called using a freely available matlab wrapper developed by Hui Jiang. 3"}, {"section_title": "EVALUATION OF CLASSIFIER PERFORMANCE AND ESTIMATION OF REGULARIZATION PARAMETERS", "text": "To estimate the optimal values of the regularization parameters, we combined a three-way split of the data (training-validationtesting) with 10-fold cross-validations (CV) and grid search. This was done to avoid upward bias in the metrics of performance estimates (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003; Ritchie et al., 2003; Su et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008; Chu, 2009a; Ryali et al., 2010) . We implemented an external K 1 -fold CV where at each step we leave onefold for testing and use the remaining K 1 \u2212 1-folds for training and validation. These last two procedures are implemented by using a nested K 2 -fold CV. We divide the K 1 \u2212 1-folds into K 2 -folds and we leave onefold for validation and K 2 \u2212 1-folds for training combined with a grid search to determine the optimal parameters. The grid we used in our analyses was \u03bb = 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 11, 12. . .98, 99, 100, 200, 500, 1000. At each grid point, the classifier is trained and its performance is assessed using the fold left for validation by estimating the classification accuracy. We select the regularization parameters that produce maximum average accuracy across the K 2 -folds of the internal CV procedure. The classifier is then retrained using the data in the K 1 \u2212 1-folds left for training and validation and the selected optimal regularization parameters. The classifier's generalization capability is then evaluated by computing the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (see below) using the fold originally left for testing in the external CV. This is repeated K 1 times and the average classification accuracy is computed.\nFinally, the discriminative maps are generated. The vector \u03b2 of parameters (or classifier's weights) described in Eq. 2 are estimated using the whole data set and the average values of the selected optimal regularization parameters across the K 1 -folds. These weights (one per voxel) are then employed to generate the discriminative maps which reflect the brain areas that were more informative when discriminating between the two groups of subjects. The discriminative maps presented in Figure 2 represent the average of the weights vectors \u03b2 obtained across 10 repetitions of the computations to evaluate variability due to CV partitioning.\nIn our analyses we used K 1 = 10 and K 2 = 10. We used 10-fold CV (K 1 = K 2 = 10) because it has been recommended in the general machine learning literature (Breiman and Spector, 1992; Kohavi, 1995) . The leave-one-out (LOO) CV is known to be approximately unbiased but highly variable and in addition FIGURE 2 | These are the average discriminative maps computed using the PLR model parameters (voxels weights) that were estimated across the 10 repetitions of the computations.

We have based our analyses on very recent and powerful methodological developments in the fields of optimization and regularization theory. The GLMNET library employed in this work solves the problem described by Eq. 2 using coordinate-wise descent techniques (Friedman et al., 2007 (Friedman et al., , 2010 that provide an efficient mechanism to solve problems of high dimension. The approach applied here is one of the few (Kloppel et al., 2008; Cuingnet et al., 2010b; Hinrichs et al., 2011) reported in the AD classification sMRI literature that directly operate in the voxel space. Some previous approaches (Fan et al., 2007; Vemuri et al., 2008; Davatzikos et al., 2009 ) developed complex image processing steps that are time consuming driven by the need of dealing with the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961; Donoho, 2000) . While the curse of dimensionality is a real problem (which is still poorly understood), its effects on machine learning algorithms vary. One of the main merits of our work is to show that by using PLR and coordinate-wise descent techniques, it is possible to achieve excellent prediction performance when solving very large classification problems. The number of voxels in our analyses for the different tissues varied between 5.7 \u00d7 10 5 (WM analyses), 7.4 \u00d7 10 5 (GM analyses), and 2 \u00d7 10 6 (whole brain analyses Jacobian based), while operating with 98 samples. Our results taken together with those previously reported in relation to SVMs and kernel approaches (Kloppel et al., 2008; Chu, 2009b) suggest that the regularization mechanisms associated to these linear classifiers effectively deal with classification problems of very large dimension. The difference is that the approach presented here operates directly in the voxel space via coordinate-wise descent optimization while previous SVM work (Kloppel et al., 2008) by making use of the kernel approach (representer theorem; Kimeldorf and Wahba, 1971; Scholkopf and Smola, 2002) solve an optimization problem of much lower dimensions. This work provides evidence that is not the dimension reduction implicit in linear SVM kernel based methods what makes them to deal effectively with problems of large size but the associated regularization penalty.\nOn the other hand, the results obtained with PLR predicting cognitive status seem to be very competitive with other previously reported by other researchers. The sensitivities and specificities of 10 of the most successful sMRI classification methods have recently been compared using ADNI data (Cuingnet et al., 2010c) . The best performer in this group achieved sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 95% using a voxel-wise approach with a SVM and the high dimensional DARTEL normalization procedure. Although these results cannot be directly compared to ours for several reasons (differing ADNI samples, sample size, CV procedures, etc.) they serve as a reference, suggesting that our approach reaches similar levels of sensitivity and specificity to the best performers in the comparison.\nOne advantage of penalized logistic regression over SVMs which have dominated the field so far is that logistic regression directly models the class-conditional probabilities providing a decision probability and not just binary classification, which is very desirable property in a classification algorithm that can be very useful in a clinical setting. These probabilities could be used as an alternative to already existing diagnostic metrics such as STAND-scores or SPARE-AD index (Vemuri et al., 2008; Davatzikos et al., 2009 ). There several potential ways to improve the approach presented here, for example: (1) by introducing spatial constraints via regularization operators (Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994; Casanova et al., 2009; Cuingnet et al., 2010b) ; (2) By incorporating feature selection and (3) By using more sophisticated penalties.\nWe found that both GM and WM carry useful information for classification of CN and AD sMRI images, producing high levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The large scale regularization approach used here provides discriminative maps localizing the changes to GM structures known to be involved in AD. For example, changes in GM associated with AD have been described to affect the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus before spreading to other temporal, frontal, and parietal areas, many of which were useful for discriminating AD patients from CN subjects in the present study Braak, 1991, 1997; Gomez-Isla et al., 1996; Laakso et al., 1996 Laakso et al., , 1998 Insausti et al., 1998; Frisoni et al., 1999 Frisoni et al., , 2007 Van Hoesen et al., 2000; Dickerson et al., 2001; Thompson et al., 2003 Thompson et al., , 2007 Apostolova and Thompson, 2008) . The white matter discriminative maps add to a growing body of literature on white matter volume loss in AD (Black et al., 2000; Moon et al., 2008; Di Paola et al., 2010) . Several studies have identified volume loss in various portions of the corpus callosum (Di Paola et al., 2010) . The callosal white matter loss has been related to Wallerian degeneration, receiving axons from the temporo-parietal regions involved in AD. Other regions of white matter loss in AD have been less well studied.\nSeveral methodological aspects of this study are worth noting. We utilized a high dimensional warping algorithm to bring the individual structural images into alignment. In particular, we used the SyN methodology, which has been shown to be a top performing method for image normalization. In addition, we used the SyN methodology in a two-step normalization procedure, with the sole purpose of the first step to perform skull-stripping. While there are a variety of skull-stripping algorithms available, in our own testing, we have found the quality of the SyN full brain normalization to provide consistently excellent results allowing direct masking of the results on the basis of the template brain image, without the need for additional manual editing. This enables a second high dimensional normalization of the skull-stripped brain to a skull-stripped template, allowing for a more accurate registration procedure without confounds of extraneous tissues affecting the normalization. We combined the SyN methodology with the SPM8 new segment tool for primary tissue type segmentation. While there are a variety of image segmentation methods available, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org\nwe have found that the SPM8 multi-class segmentation algorithm performs especially well with elderly brain images as in the ADNI cohort. Proper segmentation in this age group can be very problematic due to the high white matter lesion load, which intensity based segmentation procedures can erroneously classify as GM, adversely affecting classification accuracy. In comparing classification accuracy for modulated GM, modulated white matter, and direct use of the Jacobian, we found the highest accuracy for the modulated GM maps. Interestingly, although classification accuracies were also high for the other input image types, the use of the full Jacobian map (which includes deformation information on gray, white, and CSF) did not improve the classification accuracy (not presented). A limitation of this study is that we did not study here the performance of this approach to detect patients with prodromal AD something that will be pursued in future work."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this work we have introduced a large scale regularization approach based on penalized logistic regression to automatically classify sMRI according to cognitive status.
