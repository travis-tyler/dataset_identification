[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Some policy analysts have raised concerns that racial segregation in American schools is increasing and that such \"resegregation\" is being hastened by certain rulings by federal courts. Analyzing data for the 100 largest school districts in the South and Border states, we ask whether there is in fact evidence of resegregation and whether levels of segregation can be linked to judicial decisions. We distinguish two types of segregation measures -those indicating the extent of racial isolation and those indicating the degree of racial imbalance across schools. Examining enrollment patterns across schools in our sample districts for the period 1993/94 to 2003/04, we find only one measure, a measure of racial isolation, that lends support to the notion that districts in these regions are resegregating. But we find that the increase in this measure is the result of the general increase in the nonwhite percentage in the student population rather than policy-driven increases in racial imbalance. Racial imbalance itself, indicated by measures that correct for such demographic change, shows no trend over this period in our sample districts, except in the Fourth Circuit, which may suggest that rulings in that circuit have exerted some effect on segregation. Furthermore, we find greater imbalance in districts that were declared unitary before 1993, but we do not find any increase in segregation arising from unitary declarations during our sample period."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "1990 is a pair of Supreme Court decisions in 1991 and 1992. These decisions allowed districts no longer under court desegregation orders to return to be deemed \"unitary\" and hence be permitted to use student assignment plans based on neighborhood attendance zones. Owing to the pervasive racial segregation in existing housing patterns, the use of such neighborhood-based attendance zones quite naturally led to de facto segregation in schools. Orfield and Eaton (1996, p. 1) state: these historic High Court decisions were a triumph for the decades-long powerful, politicized attacks on school desegregation. The new policies reflected the victory of the conservative movement that altered the federal courts and turned the nation from the dream of Brown toward accepting a return to segregation. Whatever its causes, not everyone agrees that resegregation is in fact occurring. Logan (2004) argues that increases in measures of racial isolation are merely a reflection of the country's changing racial composition and that schools are no more segregated today than they were before these court decisions were handed down. Using data on public schools from across the country, he documents the general increase in the proportion of nonwhite students between 1990 and 2000. He shows that the proportion of all students attending predominantly white schools declined, for example, while the percentage attending schools 90% or more nonwhite increased (Logan 2004, p. 9) . According to Logan, it is the increase in the nonwhite share and the consequent increase in predominantly nonwhite schools that raises measures of racial isolation such as the percentage of black students attending 90-100% nonwhite schools. the courts have played in whatever resegregation has occurred, with particular attention to judicial declarations of unitary status and the rulings in the Fourth Circuit.\nTo preview our conclusions, we find first that whether and to what extent segregation appears to be reemerging differs according to the construct used to measure segregation. If we define segregation as racial isolation, we find some evidence of increasing segregation across schools within districts during the 1993-2003 period, but only when we use the specific measure cited at the beginning of the paper, the percentage of black students attending schools 90-100% nonwhite. If we define segregation not as racial isolation, but rather as racial imbalance within districts, we find, somewhat to our surprise, no evidence of resegregation. Nor, however, do we find any evidence that segregation is declining. Thus, within districts, the trends in school segregation contrast markedly with the trends for the same period in residential segregation (measured at the metropolitan level), which decreased quite substantially in some Southern metropolitan areas (Glaeser and Vigdor, 2003) . The decline in residential segregation creates the possibility that, even in the absence of rising school segregation, were it not for judicial rulings of unitary status, racial segregation across schools might have declined.\nSecond, we find some suggestive links between the decisions of federal courts and school segregation as reflected in a gap-based measure of racial imbalance, but they are by no means definitive proof that court decisions have opened the door to resegregation. We find higher levels of racial imbalance among districts that were declared unitary before 1993 than among those which have never been so declared. We also find an increase over time in racial imbalance among districts in the Fourth Circuit, which finding could be the result of decisions unique to that circuit. We find no association between judicial rulings or jurisdictions and a measure of racial isolation, probably because that measure is so strongly influenced by demographic changes. Since those demographic changes are outside the control of district policymakers, it is difficult to isolate the effects of judicial action on the school assignment decisions over which they do have control.\nSection II of the paper discusses various measures of segregation and section III documents changes over the 10-year period for our sample of 100 large d istri cts. S ection IV provides an overview of legal issues related to school desegregation cases, with emphasis on the role of declarations of unitary status and decisions in the Fourth Circuit. That historical overview serves as background to the empirical investigation of their effects on segregation in section V.\nThe paper ends with a brief concluding section."}, {"section_title": "II. Recognizing \"Resegregation\"", "text": "The \"segregation\" referred to in the Brown decision was a system of laws whereby 3 The preponderant importance of de jure segregation at the time of Brown is also illustrated by the emphasis placed on state support of segregation in a statement by prominent social scientists that was submitted as part of an amicus brief to the Court in 1953 (\"The Effects of Segregation...\" 1953) . 5 students of different races were assigned to separate schools with separate faculties. 3 In contemporary discussions in the school context, the term segregation has become an attribute of enrollment patterns by race -typically across schools within a district -and is typically measured in quantitative terms so that one pattern can be judged more segregated than another.\nContemporary measures of segregation can be grouped into two main categories: measures of racial isolation and measures of racial imbalance.\nRacial isolation. The measure used at the beginning of this paper, the percentage of black students in schools that are 90-100% nonwhite, is one widely used measure of racial isolation. By summarizing the extent to which black students are in schools primarily with other minority students, it indicates the degree to which black students are isolated from (non-Hispanic) white students. Its focus on the nature of schools attended by black students reflects the historical fact that blacks were both the dominant minority group in the South and the group whose history of subjugation and discrimination made its legal status central to the Brown case.\nIn recent years, owing to the growth in Hispanic and other nonwhite enrollments, the percentage of nonwhite students who are black has fallen in many districts. Thus it is useful to distinguish this first measure from a closely related measure of racial isolation that also focuses on the schools attended by black students: the percentage of black students in schools that are 90-100 percent black. In contrast to the prior measure, this one measures the extent to which black students are concentrated in schools with students like themselves. In the absence of Hispanic or other non-black minority students, the two measures would of course be identical. In districts with a growing number of Hispanic students, however, trends in the two measures could well diverge.\nA somewhat different measure of racial isolation, defined once again from the perspective of black students, is the rate at which they attend school with other black students. Also referred to as the exposure rate of black students to black students, this rate is:\nwhere B j is the number of black students in school j and b j is the school's percentage of black students. Equivalent to the proportion black in the typical black student's school, this exposure rate is one way of indicating how isolated black students are from students of other races.\nImportantly, measures of racial isolation are not independent of a district's overall racial composition. In general the higher is the proportion of black or of nonwhite students, depending on the measu re us ed, the high er wi ll be one of t hese measures of isolation. Stated differe ntly, measures of racial isolation incorporate into a single measure any imbalance in the racial mix of students across schools as well as the overall racial composition of the district. As a descriptive device, measuring segregation by means of an index of racial isolation is undoubtedly useful.\nFrom the perspective of district policy makers, however, who are likely to have far greater control over the extent to which students of different races are distributed among schools in a balanced or unbalanced manner than over the racial mix of students in the district, it is useful to have a segregation measure that isolates the aspect of enrollment patterns over which they have more control. Segregation indexes that measure racial imbalance fit this requirement in that they\nare not a function of a school district's racial composition.\nRacial imbalance. Such indexes are designed to measure the extent to which students of a particular race are unevenly distributed across schools within the district. At one extreme, segregation would be complete if members of each racial group attended schools with members of their own race alone. At the other, there would be no segregation, according to this approach, if all schools had the same racial composition, which by definition would be the racial composition of the district as a whole. The calculation of any measure of racial imbalance must begin with a decision about which racial groups to highlight. For most of our analysis of racial imbalance, we look at the balance between white and nonwhite students.\nOur preferred measure of racial imbalance is a gap-based segregation index, S, which takes the following form for segregation within district k:\nwhere n k is the proportion of the district's students who are nonwhite and in this case E wn is the exposure rate of whites to nonwhites, defined as\nW j is the number of whites in school j, and n j is its nonwhite percentage. The exposure rate E wn can be interpreted as the nonwhite percentage in the typical white student's class, and can range from zero, where schools are fully separated by race, to n j , where they are racially balanced. Thus the segregation index is the difference between the maximum exposure rate of whites to nonwhites, which is simply the nonwhite share of students in the district, and the actual exposure rate, expressed as a fraction of the maximum. The segregation index runs from 0, which represents no segregation, to 1, which represents complete segregation. 4 The index of dissimilarity is defined as\nwhere N and W are total nonwhite and white enrollment in a district, and N i and W i are the nonwhite and white enrollment in school i. 5 In our earlier work, we used classroom-level data on racial composition for the entire state of North Carolina. We found only a minimal amount of within-school segregation in elementary schools. At secondary schools, which are more likely to employ tracking and other curricular policies that separate students on different academic tracks, within-school segregation is more prominent. We found evidence that all forms of segregation, both within-and betweenschool, increased between 1994 and 2001. These increases were found in both urban and rural 8 Another well-known measure of racial imbalance is the dissimilarity index. 4 This index, which also runs from 0 to1, has a simple intuitive interpretation: it indicates the proportion of any one racial group of students that would have to switch schools to achieve racial balance across the district. The closer is the number to 1, the more segregated is the district. Though the dissimilarity index is commonly used in studies of residential segregation, we prefer the gapbased measure of segregation which we have used extensively in our previous research of school segregation in North Carolina. Though not of particular usefulness for this paper, a major advantage of the gap-based measure is that it can be readily decomposed into segregation between and within schools.\nLevel of analysis. Quite apart from the concept of segregation employed, another issue central to the measure of school segregation is the level of analysis. The standard approach is to measure segregation across schools within a single school district. That is the approach implicit in the summary measures cited at the beginning of the paper and also in our discussion of the various definitions of racial segregation. Although we have used data at the classroom level to measure segregation in some of our previous work (Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2003) , we are restricted to data collected at the school level for the analysis in this paper. 5 In some of our work, districts, and in parts of the state varying widely in terms of racial composition. 6 For an explanation of the decomposition into these two parts, see Clotfelter (1999) or Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2003) ; for a discussion of these changes over time, see Clotfelter (2004, chapter 2) . The last of these also includes the effect of private school enrollment, but the quantitative effect of that aspect is not large."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "we have also examined segregation at the metropolitan area level, making it possible to separate segregation attributable to racial disparities within school districts -the basis for conventional measures -from that due to racial disparities between school districts. It turns out that changes in school segregation at the metropolitan level between 1970 and 2000 were affected by contrary movements in these two components: the movement of whites to suburban school districts caused segregation of the second variety to increase at the same time that within-district segregation was declining."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "In this paper, we restrict our attention to segregation within school districts. Consequently changes in measures of segregation based on imbalance, which effectively abstract from any changes in the racial composition of the district, will fail to pick up any new segregation that results from growing racial disparities between districts within a metropolitan area. In contrast, changes in measures of racial isolation at the district level inevitably reflect in part changes in the racial mix of students in each district, changes that may be the result of differential movement of students by race across districts within a metropolitan area. In particular, the movement of white students out of city districts either to suburban districts or to private schools will result in rising nonwhite proportions in city districts, and, most likely, into greater racial isolation. Because they reflect different aspects of racial segregation, we therefore draw attention both to measures of racial isolation and to measures of imbalance to assess whether recent enrollment trends justify 7 Percentage based on K-12 enrollments from the NCES Common Core of Data. For districts that were subject to consolidation or annexation, we included all of the subsequent components throughout the time period of analysis. For school years through 2002/03, the data were generally available in the Common Core of Data. To supplement these publicly available data with information from the most recent school year, we requested from individual districts comparable data on enrollment by race of each school for the 2003/04 year. A complete listing of these districts is given in Appendix Table 1. 10 the characterization of \"resegregation.\" We turn now to that assessment."}, {"section_title": "III. Segregation Trends in the 100 Largest Southern Districts", "text": "We base our analysis on enrollment data for the largest 100 districts in the South and Border regions (based on 2001/02 enrollments), some of which we have collected ourselves directly from the districts. These districts represent some 15% of total K-12 enrollment in the increase in racial isolation of black students appears to have far more to do with the growth in proportions of students who are neither non-Hispanic white nor non-Hispanic black, the majority of whom are likely to be Hispanic, than with changes in enrollment patterns of black and white students.\nConsistent with the view that district-wide demographic changes are driving the growth in the proportion of black students in 90-100 percent nonwhite schools, the measures of racial imbalance show no increase in segregation over time. Thus, abstracting from changes over time in the racial composition of enrollments in the 100 large districts, we find no evidence of a rise in racial segregation. black students, though generally higher for blacks than for students of other races, remained virtually unchanged for students of every race. Whites, Hispanics, and students of other races attended schools that were about 25% black in both 1993/94 and 2003/04. The typical black student attended a school slightly more than 45% black in both years, as indicated by the blackblack exposure rate in Table 1 . In the case of each racial group, the reduction in white student share was almost exactly compensated by an increase in the proportion of Hispanic and other nonwhite students.\nThe relative stability of mean values shown in Figure 1 may mask considerable variation across particular types of districts or between regions. Table 2 shows mean values for two 9 For purposes of this analysis, school districts serving independent cities or cities that attained county-equivalent status prior to World War II are classified as central city districts. Districts affected by this classification rule include Orleans parish (coterminous with the City of New Orleans since 1870), Baltimore City, St. Louis City, Newport News, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Washington, DC. Our choice of cutoff date reflects the onset of rapid 13 segregation indices, one measure of racial isolation and one of racial imbalance, at two points in time for various categories of districts. We categorize districts by region, and, whether central city, suburban or consolidated, and by percent nonwhite enrollment in the initial year of the panel, 1993/94 as well as by federal court circuit.\nThe regional breakdown is of general interest because of the regions' different histories.\nWhereas districts in the Border region generally began to comply with Brown almost immediately, those in the South were famously reluctant, often aggressively so. The table shows that the Border districts in the sample tended to have higher levels of racial imbalance and racial isolation, as well as greater rates of white enrollment loss. However, the ten-year trends in racial separation, whether measured by imbalance or by racial isolation, appear quite similar in both regions.\nAs shown by the next set of categories, school segregation is most severe in districts that serve central cities of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). More than three of every four students enrolled in these districts in the 1993/94 school year was nonwhite. Over the decade analyzed here, segregation as measured by imbalance declined somewhat in these districts while the isolation of black students rose, possibly reflecting the substantial losses in white enrollment over the period. While continued \"white flight\" is a sensible explanation for the increased isolation of black students in central city districts, trends in suburban and city-county consolidated districts imply a more c omplicated story. 9 In these districts, where losses in white suburbanization in the postwar era. Cities consolidating with their overlying counties after World War II, including Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, Augusta, Lexington, and Louisville, are classified as consolidated districts.\nenrollment were much less severe, the proportion of black students in 90-100% nonwhite schools increased just as rapidly, if not more, than in central city districts. Among the 42 suburban districts in the sample, for example, ten experienced increases in their percentage nonwhite of 20 points or more. By 2003/04, seven suburban districts had nonwhite percentages of 80% or more.\nWhite enrollments declined the least rapidly in consolidated districts, which helped served to stabilize their racial compositions. Over the 10-year period, none of the 36 consolidated districts experienced an increase in the nonwhite percentage as large as 20 points.\nClassifying districts by initial percent nonwhite as in the next panel of the tables reveals some noteworthy differ ence s in trends. Rates of white enr ollment loss were l argest in majoritynonwhite districts, a pattern confirmed by the scatterplot in Figure 3 . As white enrollment declined in these districts, the share of black students attending overwhelmingly nonwhite schools increased, as shown in Table 3 . That the segregation indices posted either very modest gains or declines in the face of these losses implies that districts managed to maintain a similar degree of racial balance in attendance patterns across schools despite the change in racial composition. A somewhat different pattern emerges in overwhelmingly white school districts.\nThe final panel refers to differences by federal judicial circuit. 10 We return to these differences later in the paper. In Figure 4 , the gap-based measure of racial imbalance displays some mean-reversion over time.\nDistricts experiencing increases in segregation tended to have low levels to start with, while those with high levels were more likely to decrease than increase. Figure 5 , which plots the share of black students attending 90-100% nonwhite schools in the two years, shows a cluster of points near zero in both years, but a generally larger collection of points above the 45-degree line, highlighting the general increase in this measure of racial isolation."}, {"section_title": "III. Changes in the Legal Landscape", "text": "We now turn to the more complex question of what role judicial actions have played in the segregation patterns just described. The data presented so far suggest that the relaxation of judicial constraints may be far less implicated in the changes than analysts such as Orfield have claimed. Recall that trends in measures of racial isolation such as the percentage of black students in 90-100 percent nonwhite schools have been used to support the notion that racial segregation in schools is increasing. Yet, as we have already shown, the rise in this measure is largely attributable to the changing demographics of the districts in our sample. Because our measures of racial imbalance are not affected by such changes, they provide a \"cleaner\" measure of the segregation that results from district level decisions about student assignment. Given that these measures show no upward trend over time, one might conclude that there is nothing left to be explained by the court decisions. At the same time, however, because residential segregation 11 391 U.S. 430 (1968) . See also Boger (2000 Boger ( , p. 1733 .\n12 \"No per se rule can adequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the competing interests involved; but in a system with a history of segregation the need for remedial criteria of sufficient specificity to assure a school authority's compliance with its constitutional duty warrants a presumption against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26 (1971) . 16 declined during the same 10-year period, it could be that in the absence of judicial decisions, segregation in the schools would have declined. In addition, because court decisions apply to particular districts or sets of districts, such decisions could help explain the variation in trends across districts.\nBefore turning to our empirical analysis we provide an abbreviated history of federal judicial rulings in desegregation cases, with emphasis on those rulings relating to racial balance in school assignments and declarations of unitary status. As we will show, identifying the judicial actions relevant to our empirical analysis is not an easy task. We begin with rulings in which the courts declared districts to be unitary, and, hence, no longer subject to active judicial oversight."}, {"section_title": "Unitary status. The Supreme Court's 1968 decision in Green v. County School Board of", "text": "New Kent County stated emphatically that segregated, or \"dual,\" school systems could not meet the admonition promulgated in Brown unless racially identifiable schools were eliminated.\n11 As one of six factors set down in this case, this pupil assignment criterion suggested, but did not dictate, racial balance as a desideratum. Three years later, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBoard of Education, the Court came close to ordering just that, stating \"a presumption against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition.\" 12 Ratifying a plan that paired schools and transported students across the district to achieve racially balanced schools, the decision set off a series of lower court decisions in the South and Border states that 13 402 U.S. 1 (1971); Armor (1995) .\n14 402 U.S. 1, 31 (1971) . Some critics maintain that lower courts ignored this distinction, instead equating desegregation with racial balance. See, for example, Armor (1995, p. 32) . 15 498 U.S. 237 (1991); 503 U.S. 467 (1992); Boger (2000 Boger ( , p. 1737 . 16 See, for example, Armor (1995, pp. 52-54) ; Orfield and Eaton (1996, p. 2) state: \"These decisions view racial integration not as a goal that segregated districts should strive to attain, but as a merely temporary punishment for historic violations, an imposition to be lifted after a few years. After the sentence of desegregation has been served, the normal, \"natural\" pattern of segregated schools can be restored.\" 17 employed methods such as these to achieve racially balanced schools. 13 In the same decision, however, the Court also implied that court supervision, and thus extraordinary measures to maintain racial balance in schools, along with racial guidelines for schools, would not be a Cir. 1999) . For a discussion of these cases, see Boger (2000 Boger ( , pp. 1721 Boger ( , 1740 Boger ( , and 1780 . 18 determine student assignments for itself. In fact, however, the practical meaning of unitary status has been much more complicated than that, as we discuss below.\nFourth Circuit rulings on race-conscious assignment. A related but distinct legal question is whether a district not under court order to desegregate -either by having been declared unitary or by never having been subject to an order -can base school assignments by race. Needless to say, any desegregation plan that aimed at racial balance had to devise assignment patterns that would keep all schools in a district close to the district's overall racial composition. But in a series of decisions meant to apply to districts not under court order, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that race could not be used in assigning students, presumably making it impossible for a district to maintain racial balance through the adjustment of student assignments. 17 Boger (2000 17 Boger ( , p. 1794 warns that these decisions could have dire consequences:\nif willing school boards cannot assign students by race or ethnicity, we risk a rapid return to a time when each school child could, and did, identify \"white schools\" and \"black schools\" simply by reference to the predominant race of the children attending them. Far more cer tainly than school boards' goo d-faith eff orts to assure o f edu cational diversity, this de facto resegregation of our schools will re-create the conditions condemned in Brown in 1954.\nAs within their own geographic zone. Although the school board expressed a wish that the resulting enrollment patterns would not produce large racial disparities across schools (in the form of a guideline that no school would deviate by more than 20 percentage points from the district's overall nonwhite percentage), no controls were put in place to limit parental choices. Indeed, the plan did lead to racial disparities among schools, which sparked complaints. After investigating these complaints, the Office for Civil Rights, in light of the Fourth Circuit decisions disallowing the use of race in assignment, officially gave its blessing to the plan in 2000, after the district pledged to create several district-wide magnet schools. 19 The resulting measure of racial isolation, like Charlotte's, showed increases. The percentage of black students attending 90-100% minority schools in the district rose from 6% in 1995 to 22% in 2001 and to 23% in 2003.\nBut unitary status has not always meant handing a district a free pass, as might be inferred from these two examples from North Carolina. To be sure, in some cases a court's declaration 20 To illustrate, the decision in Muscogee County stated: \"The district court's conclusions that the school board has eliminated the vestiges of de jure segregation as far as practicable and that the school board has shown a good faith commitment to and compliance with the desegregation plan were not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's final dismissal and declaration that the school board has attained unitary status. racial goals for schools with a plan that allowed students to choose neighborhood schools or magnets but also obligated the district to spend some $200 million over the following five years on construction and renovation of schools, many in predominantly black neighborhoods. 21 Second, in Lee County (FL), a federal judge declared the district unitary in 1999, but did not end supervision until 2004. And these declarations were made only after the school district agreed to consult with a Unitary School System Advisory Committee regarding certain future decisions, including changes in its student assignment plan and school opening or closings. The school district also committed itself to continuing a school choice plan that would keep minority populations in the bulk of its schools within 20 percentage points of the system average. 22 Third, Pinellas County (FL) was declared unitary by a federal district court in 2000, but only subject to the terms of a negotiated settlement that called for a seven-year transition from an existing attendance plan utilizing magnet schools and assignments designed to achieve racial balance to a choice plan that would eventually be unconstrained by racial controls."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Fourth, as part of a settlement in 2003, the Fulton County (GA) school district agreed to continue its longstanding minority-to-majority transfer policy for nine years and to examine enrollments in advanced placement and foreign language courses in its predominantly black southern schools (Fulton Co., p.6). Fifth, a federal court's unitary declaration for East Baton\nRouge was similarly made subject to an agreement, covering in this case the succeeding four school years. This agreement requires the district to continue its existing system of magnet schools, specifying a target racial composition of 55% black for them and appointing an independent overseer for the program, continue and actively recruit for its majority-to-minority transfer policy, with rules for transfers stated in terms of specific racial compositions, provide free transportation for both of these programs, attempt to further desegregation in redrawing attendance lines, make additional expenditures for certain schools, and continue pre-kindergarten programs. 24 A sixth example, though not technically a unitary declaration, was the ending of federal oversight over the St. Louis district in 1999. There the court made this withdrawal subject to a detailed settlement, by which the district agreed to continue operating its group of magnet schools and the state agreed to continue funding the city-to-suburb transfer voluntary busing program and to finance the construction and renovation of schools in the district. 26 The years in which districts in our sample were declared unitary are listed in Appendix Table 1 . A detailed summary of the sources used to make these designations is available at http://www.pubpol.duke.edu/people/faculty/clotfelter/."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "Thus unitary status, or the ending of judicial oversight of a desegregation plan, has meant different things in different districts at different times. Nor can it be assumed that districts never subject to any desegregation order, such as Montgomery County, Maryland or Cumberland County, North Carolina, are not influenced by federal court rulings. As noted above, Montgomery County was the district to which one of the Fourth Circuit rulings regarding raceconscious school assignments applied. For districts not under a specific court order, school boards must worry about potential law suits or federal sanctions arising from the 1964 Civil Rights Act, by which the federal government can cut off funding to discriminating districts. To recap, then, there is no one-to-one connection between unitary status and freedom to return to de facto segregation.\nBecause of the importance attached to unitary status in discussions of resegregation, we have endeavored to ascertain for each of the 100 districts analyzed in the current paper whether the district has been deemed unitary and, if so, when that declaration was made. For this purpose, we have drawn on a variety of sources, including published court decisions, district web pages, and news reports."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "V. The Impact of Court Rulings", "text": "We focus here on two main aspects of judicial rulings: the declaration of unitary status and whether or not a district is located in the Fourth Circuit and, hence, subject to that circuit's admonitions to eschew the use of race in student assignments. We begin with some simple trend analysis and then turn to a more complete multivariate model that permits us to isolate the effects of the court decisions from other changes.\nRole of Fourth Circuit decisions. The bottom panel of Table 2 above provides some initial insight into the role of the Fourth Circuit decisions, with attention to our two preferred measures of segregation, one that measures racial isolation and one that measures racial imbalance. If, as Boger (2000) argues, the admonitions in that circuit against race-based student assignments had teeth, one might expect segregation to rise more over the period in the Fourth Circuit than in other federal circuits. Indeed, the two districts with the largest increases in the segregation index over the period, Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Winston-Salem/Forsyth, are both in the Fourth Circuit. For the circuit as a whole the table entries confirm that pattern. During the 10-year period, racial isolation increased in all of the circuits identified, but it grew far faster in the Fourth Circuit (57 percent) than in the other circuits (10 to 33 percent). With respect to racial imbalance, as measured by the gap-based segregation index, only the Fourth Circuit exhibited an increase -and quite a substantial one at that -in its segregation index. In each of the other relevant federal court circuits, schools became less racially unbalanced over the 10-year period.\nThus we have some initial evidence that the rulings in the Fourth District exacerbated segregation.\nUnitary status. Our initial trend analysis of unitary status leads to a different conclusion.\nFor this purpose we compared the trend in the proportion of students attending schools in districts deemed to unitary to the trends in segregation indexes. The bottom panel of Table 1 shows that by 2003 a far higher percentage of students in our sample districts were attending schools in districts declared unitary than in 1993, and Figure 6 shows how the number of districts The ordinary least squares regression estimates in Table 3 use two segregation measures as dependent variables: a racial isolation measure, the fraction of black students attending schools with nonwhite shares between 90 and 100%, and a racial imbalance measure, the gap- 27 The sample covers years from 1993/94 to 2003/04, with these exceptions necessitated by missing data in the Common Core of Data. Data for Georgia districts in 1992/93 were missing, which necessitated omitting observations in 1993/94, owing to the use of lagged variables. School-level data for Tennessee districts were missing in 1997/98 and 1999/2000 to 2002/03, making it impossible to calculate segregation measures for those years. 28 Nor do F-tests of the coefficients in columns 1 and 2 allow us to reject the hypothesis that either racial isolation or racial imbalance was the same in all years. 27 based measure of segregation between whites and nonwhites. 27 The specifications in columns (1) and (2) include only year fixed effects, to illustrate the overall time trend in each segregation measure. In both columns, none of the coefficients on individual year indicator variables is statistically distinguishable from zero, indicating that we cannot reject the hypothesis that differences in segregation between 1993 and any subsequent year are due to random fluctuations in the data. 28 In general, the coefficients confirm the patterns shown in Figure 1 : the racial isolation measure trends upward over time, while there is no discernible trend in racial imbalance.\nIn columns (3) and (4), we add a number of controls for school district characteristics, including an indicator variable for whether a district had been declared unitary by a particular year. Comparison of columns (1) and (3) reveals that this set of control variables is sufficient to explain the upward trend in racial isolation over time. The only statistically significant coefficient on a time-varying variable in this regression pertains to the lagged nonwhite share of enrollment in the district. As suggested by much of the simple evidence presented above, the best explanation for the increasing proportion of black students attending overwhelmingly nonwhite schools is the relative increase in the nonwhite, non-black population in the districts they attend.\nWe find significant associations between segregation and several time-invariant control variables. Physically large districts tend to be more segregated, holding enrollment levels constant. This may reflect the desire in lower density districts to reduce overall transportation costs by operating more schools. Operating more schools, in turn, enables greater separation of students by race. Districts with a greater proportion of nonwhite students also tend to be more segregated by either measure. Such a pattern would occur, for example, if \"white flight\" tends to occur when the nonwhite share in a white student's school exceeds a certain threshold, and districts take explicit or implied actions to ensure that this threshold is not exceeded (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor 2003) .\nCoefficients on judicial circuit indicator variables show no evidence of persistently higher segregation levels in the Fourth Circuit. In fact, school districts in the Fourth Circuit have the lowest proportion of black students attending 90-100% nonwhite schools, controlling for other factors. It is important to note that this coefficient tests only for a permanent difference in segregation levels across appeals court circuits. In Table 2 above, we found suggestive evidence of differential trends in segregation across circuits. We test the hypothesis of differential trends in a regression framework below.\nAs shown in column (3), unitary stat us is not si gnificantly related to racial isolat ion. In contrast, we find evidence in column (4) that districts covered by a unitary status ruling tend to have higher degrees of racial imbalance across schools. The statistically significant positive coefficient indicates that such districts tend to have white-nonwhite segregation indices three percentage points, roughly one-third of a standard deviation, higher than otherwise equivalent districts without unitary status. Whether this finding represents a causal effect of unitary status or simply a positive correlation between being unitary and having other factors that raise segr egat ion is impossible to say. Table 4 presents results from two alternative specifications that expand the set of control variables to include some related to time. To examine the possibility that the Fourth Circuit's prohibition of race-conscious school assignments might have led to greater segregation over time, in columns (1) and (2) Columns (3) and (4) Table 3 and the first two columns of this table, there is no significant impact of unitary status on our measure of racial isolation, shown in column (3). The final regression in this table shows significant evidence of a latency period of at least three years between the declaration of unitary status and a significant impact on our measure of racial imbalance.\nThere are two reasons to be cautious in interpreting the unitary status results in Tables 3   and 4 . First, we have only a limited number of district-specific control variables available. First, the positive effect of unitary status in Table 3 and for unitary status after three years in Table 4 are identified largely by comparing districts that have had unitary status for the duration of our panel to districts that never received unitary status. Differences between these types of districts could generate significant variation in racial imbalance even in the absence of court rulings.\nSecond is the potential for serial correlation in the outcome measure of interest. In a panel framework such as ours, we must be attuned to the possibility of spurious difference-indifference estimates rooted in serial correlation in outcomes.\nTo address both of these concerns, we present in Table 5 the result of a final empirical procedure, following Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004) . We first estimate regression models similar to those in columns (3) and (4), with the addition of district fixed effects, which effectively control for all time-invariant characteristics of school districts. Restricting our attention to only those districts which attained unitary status during our panel, we then compute the mean residual for the pre-and post-unitary status time period. Using a dataset with two observations per status-switching district, our estimate of the unitary status effect is the average difference in mean residuals for each district. As Table 5 indicates, this procedure produces very different results from our standard panel regressions. There was no significant increase in racial isolation or racial imbalance, controlling for observed factors, in districts that switched into unitary status at some point during our panel. The significant effects estimated in Tables 3 and 4 must therefore be driven by differences in segregation levels between those districts that were already unitary before our sample period began in 1993 and those that have not yet been deemed unitary.\nWhile these district fixed-effects based estimates have their advantages, they also raise some caveats. These estimates discard all permanent variation in segregation across districts, and the contrast in results between Table 5 and earlier tables shows that this variation is an important determinant of estimated effects. Readers particularly concerned that pre-1993 unitary districts differ unobservably from other districts will want to place more weight on the fixed effect estimates. Others may wish to emphasize the results in Table 3 . Taken as a whole, the results provide at most limited support for the notion that court actions have resulted in higher levels of school segregation as measured by racial imbalance. At the same time, all our results indicate that the rise in racial isolation, as measured by the share of black students attending overwhelmingly nonwhite schools, is primarily attributable to changes in the racial composition of school districts, caused primarily by the growth of the Hispanic population, rather than to judicial actions."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusion", "text": "Analysis of the 100 largest districts in the South and Border regions shows unmistakably that public schools in these regions have become more nonwhite over the past ten years. They have not, however, witnessed a systematic segregation of white students. Rather, black and white students alike now attend schools with greater proportions of Hispanic, Asian, and students of other races. This development creates the impression of increasing segregation when segregation is measured by one widely-used index -the proportion of blacks attending 90-100% nonwhite schools -but the rise in this measure is the result of demographic change rather than any growing racial imbalance among schools. As a consequence of the increasing racial diversification of American schools, this particular measure may have lost much of its meaning as a measure of racial polarization. All of the other school segregation measures examined in this paper point to a different conclusion -that the average level of segregation in large Southern school districts has not changed much over the last decade.\nAverages are not the whole story, however. One of our main objectives in this paper has been to investigate the effect of unitary status declarations by federal courts. A fear has been that such a declaration essentially gives a district permission to base school assignments solely on neighborhood residence, which will tend to make schools more racially segregated, given the segregation in existing housing patterns. The case of Charlotte-Mecklenburg -where a neighborhood assignment plan and resegregation did indeed follow quickly on the heels of a\nunitary declaration -appears to offer graphic justification for this fear. In our regression analysis examining the experience of 100 districts over 10 years, we found that unitary status is in fact associated with increased white-nonwhite segregation, in the sense of racial imbalance. Our estimates suggest that, for the districts serving nearly half of all students in the sample where courts have issued unitary status declarations, segregation levels were higher than in other districts. But this result is driven by higher segregation rates in districts that were declared unitary before 1993; we do not observe any effect of unitary status declarations during our sample period. The absence of a contemporaneous effect could be due to the tendency of such declarations to be accompanied by agreements that placed constraints on the freedom of school districts to return to neighborhood school assignment or by other factors that delay the effect. We also find that segregation as racial imbalance increased in districts governed by the Fourth Circuit, the judicial circuit that has most prominently ruled against racially-conscious student assignments, one of the longstanding pillars of desegregation plans.\n29 See Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2003) and Clotfelter (2004) ."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "In regressions explaining the percentage of blacks in 90-100% nonwhite schools, neither unitary status nor Fourth Circuit jurisdiction has any explanatory power, suggesting, as above, that this measure is driven largely by the steady increase in the nonwhite percentage in the public school population, not by increases in racial imbalance.\nA final caveat is worth re-emphasizing. In this paper, we base our measures of segregation and racial isolation on disparities between schools in districts. Our analysis measures neither disparities between districts nor disparities within schools. Nor do our measures account for segregation arising from private school enrollment. Our previous research suggests that the first two of these sources of segregation is generally quite important and that the third can be significant in some localities. 29 Although it considers only segregation across schools in public school districts, however, the current paper is quite relevant to the current concern over resegregation and the role of federal court rulings, for it finds some justification for fears that the two are linked. Participants in these debates need to be wary of the evidence they cite, however, especially when using statistics that reflect diversification rather than division. Source: See Table 1 .
