[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The conversion of grassland, wetlands, and forest to croplands may contribute to environmental degradation and diminished sustainability. This study determined the impact of land use change from 2006 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2014 on the cultivation suitability of grasslands that were not converted to cropland. The model system, which includes nebraska and South Dakota, was selected because it contains climatic conditions ranging from humid continental to semiarid and a large number of farms that produced both crops and livestock. During the study, commodity prices reached historically high values, and a severe drought occurred in 2012. Land use benchmarks were obtained by visually identifying land use at 81,600 sample sites in high-resolution remote sensing images obtained from the national Agricultural Imaging Program. Sampling sites with Land Capability Class values \u00a34 were identified as suitable for cultivation if appropriate practices were followed. In 2006, 2012, and 2014, grasslands accounted for 11.0, 10.76, and 10.78 million ha in nebraska, respectively, whereas in South Dakota, grasslands accounted for 12.12, 11.65, and 11.69 million ha, respectively. In nebraska, the percentage of grasslands relative to working lands (grassland + croplands) decreased from 60.6% in 2006 to 58.9% in 2014, whereas in South Dakota the percentage of grassland decreased from 69.1% in 2006 to 66.0% in 2014. In eastern nebraska and South Dakota, 74.1% of the nonconverted grasslands in 2012 were suitable for crop production. Lower-than-expected conversion rates were attributed to a growing interest in land stewardship and a desire to maintain income diversification."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "\u2022 South Dakota grasslands relative to total working lands decreased 3% from 2006 to 2014.\n\u2022 In 2012, 84,900 km 2 of grassland suitable for crops remained as grasslands.\n\u2022 Land stewardship most likely was the reason why grassland was retained.\nCensus of Agriculture), the amount of South Dakota cropland in 2012 could vary from 5.26 to 7.69 million ha. The implications of Laingen (2015) are that studies using the CDL (Decision Innovation Solutions, 2013; Lark et al., 2015 Lark et al., , 2017 Wright and Wimberly, 2013) may produce answers different from those using the National Resource Inventory (Rashford et al., 2010; USDA, 2015) . In addition, change calculations require the use of multiple data layers obtained from different years that may have different variances. Under these conditions, the assumption of a homogeneity of variance may be violated (Ott and Longnecker, 2016) . For example, the overall accuracies for the South Dakota CDL were 61.2 and 84.0% in 2006 , respectively (USDA-NASS, 2019 . This means that the variances were higher in 2006 than in 2012. Reitsma et al. (2016) also showed that variability was location dependent and that the producer accuracies (% false positive = 100-producer accuracy) for grasslands in 2012 within the South Dakota CDL were 38.9% in the southeast National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) region and 95.2% in the northwest NASS region. Problems are further confounded when a small difference is determined by subtracting two large numbers. To reduce uncertainty, Reitsma et al. (2015) proposed a different approach whereby he visually inspected high-resolution imagery and determined the land use at each point based on the real features (roads, crop rows, houses, trees) on the ground. Land use changes were then determined by comparing the land uses at each point multiple times. Reitsma et al. (2015) identified 14,400 points each year, for total of 28,800 points in 2006 and 2012. Our paper builds on this existing database and expands the number of points from 28,800 collected over 2 yr in South Dakota to 81,600 points collected over 3 yr in South Dakota and Nebraska. A second problem is that different disciplines define land use concepts differently. A good example is the multiple definitions for \"marginal lands.\" Lark et al. (2015) defined marginal lands as those that have Land Capability Class (LCC) values of 3 and 4, whereas others defined marginal lands as locations where crop production is not profitable (Popp et al., 2018; Sawyer et al., 2018) . In addition, land use change can be discussed from different perspectives (Claassen et al., 2011; Decision Innovation Solutions, 2013; Faber et al., 2012; Hubacek and Vazquez, 2002; Laingen, 2015; Lark et al., 2015 Lark et al., , 2017 Motamed et al., 2016; Rashford et al., 2010; Reitsma et al., 2015; Rindfuss et al., 2004; Wright and Wimberly, 2013; . For example, Rashford et al. (2010) suggested that if corn (Zea mays L.) prices continued to increase, 12.1 million ha of grassland in the North American Prairie Pothole region could be converted to cropland between 2006 and 2011. If change were driven by economics and soil suitability, it is likely that their predication would be accurate. However, subsequent work showed that, even though corn prices and profitability achieved historically high levels in 2012 (Davis, 2016) , measurements of the actual conversion of grassland to corn or soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], while appearing high (0.53 million ha) (Wright and Wimberly, 2013) , were relatively low (4.38%) when compared with Rashford et al. (2010) . It is important to point out that these two studies used different data layers and reported on slightly dif-ferent areas. Wright and Wimberly (2013) contained the entire states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Iowa (94.4 million ha), whereas Rashford et al. (2010) considered only portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa (40.9 million ha). In addition, Wright and Wimberly (2013) considered only corn and soybean, whereas Rashford et al. (2010) considered all croplands. The differences between all crops and the two dominant crops vary with location. For example, in 2011, 81 and 65% of the cropland was seeded to corn and soybean in Nebraska and South Dakota, respectively (NASS, 2019) . This discussion leads to the following question: How did interactions between the soil characteristics and climatic conditions influence land use? The objective of this study was to determine the impact of land use change from 2006 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2014 on the suitability of remaining grasslands for cultivation."}, {"section_title": "MATErIALS AnD METHODS", "text": "This paper builds on the data reported by Joshi et al. (2019) , wherein the cultivation suitability of croplands is discussed. Nebraska and South Dakota were selected as a model system because they have a large number of diversified (i.e., containing both crops and livestock) cropping systems (NASS, 2019; USDA, 2015) . In addition, climatic predictions indicate that the number of extreme events (e.g., flooding, drought, temperature extremes, strong storms) and warming trends (e.g., earlier springs, greater growing degree days per growing season) will increase over the next 20 to 50 yr (NOAA, 2019; Shafer et al., 2014) .\nImportant agricultural products in both states include corn, soybean, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), livestock, oil, and ethanol (Decision Innovation Solutions, 2013) (Table 1 ). In the model system, corn serves as the major source for ethanol and its coproducts (distillers grains used as livestock feed; oil for animal or biodiesel production; and CO 2 for food, beverage, and chemical manufacturing)."}, {"section_title": "Assessing Land use Change", "text": "A detailed description of the methods used to identify land uses is provided in Reitsma et al. (2015 Reitsma et al. ( , 2016 . In Nebraska and South Dakota, 1600 sampling points were identified in each of the 17 NASS regions in both states, for a total of 27,200 points. The same 27,200 points were used each of the 3 yr (2006, 2012, and 2014) , resulting in a 3-yr total of 81,600 points. Additional information on the land uses and associated LCC values for each NASS region are available in Joshi et al. (2019) .\nThe sampling points were overlaid onto remote sensed imagery obtained from the USDA, Farm Service Agency (FSA), National Agricultural Imaging Program (USDA-FSA, 2013). Resolution of 2006 National Agricultural Imaging Program imagery was 2 m, whereas in 2012 and 2014 the resolution was 1 m. At each point, land uses based on roads, streams, lakes, wetlands, trees, houses, and crop rows were identified and grouped into five categories: cropland, grassland, nonagriculture (roads or urban areas), habitat (trees and wetlands), and water (streams and lakes). In this paper, nonagriculture, habitat, and water land uses were grouped into the \"other\" category. The visual assessments were compared with data collected from 100 on-farm study sites. One hundred percent of these points were correctly identified. We also compared the 16,000 points assessed by two studies (Joshi et al., 2019; Reitsma et al., 2015) . These two studies had identical classification 97.6% of the time. Points with different land uses were rechecked by overlaying the imagery over the sampling points as discussed above. Corrected values were entered into the data set."}, {"section_title": "Assessing Land Capability Class", "text": "Land Capability Class values were obtained by superimposing the sampling points over the Soil Survey Geographic data set (Soil Conservation Service, 1961; Soil Survey Staff, 2015) . The LCC for each sampling point was the LCC value for the dominant soil series within the mapping unit. In a related paper, Reitsma et al. (2015) used a different technique, where the LCC value was the sum of each of the soil types multiplied by the soil percentage and the associated LCC value. This change in classification approach resulted in slightly different percentages of soils within an LCC category, as reported by Reitsma et al. (2015) . The LCC classifies soil into eight classes based on their agricultural land use capabilities and limitations. The features of the LCC are provided in Table 2 . Within the LCC system, soils are further characterized by soil (s), climate (c), erosion (e), and water (w) limitations. For instance, a soil with a 3e classification has an LCC value of 3 with an erosion limitation. Land that is not profitable to produce a crop (marginal) is not included in the LCC classification system. For example, Sawyer et al. (2018) identified soils with LCC values of 4s (limited due to soil characteristics) and 2e (limited due to past erosion) as marginal, whereas Popp et al. (2018) identified marginal soils as those with fragipan (subsurface soil layers that restrict water flow and root penetration). The classification approach varies by country and purpose.\nSince the creation of the LCC system, cropping system management has changed significantly (Soil Conservation Service, 1961; Wimberly et al., 2017) . In the 1950s and 1960s, it was not uncommon for a field to be plowed, disked, and cultivated for weed control multiple times (Clay et al., 2010 (Clay et al., , 2012 Lee et al., 2014) . In addition, fallow was used to store water in many fields. Since the 1950s, the use of many of these practices, including fallow, has been greatly reduced (Elstein and Comis, 2005) . For example, results from 34,704 producer surveys completed between 2004 and 2010 suggest that 40% of farmers in South Dakota used a no-tillage system (Clay et al., 2012) . Slightly higher levels of conservation tillage adoption were reported in a 2018 survey from 708 farmers in South Dakota Saak et al., 2019) . This study showed that in 2018, 77.9, 48.7, 65.0, and 60.2% of those who responded to the survey used conservation tillage, cover crops, diversified crop rotations, and integrated crop and livestock management, respectively. In Nebraska, similar results were observed, and the use of conservation tillage increased from 68.4% in 2001 to 77.2% in 2005 (Horowitz et al., 2010) . Based on this discussion, soil mapping units with an LCC value \u00a34 were identified as suitable for crop production if appropriate management practices are followed (Clay et al., 2010 Kolady et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2014; Saak et al., 2019) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Sampling points in the eastern and western regions of South Dakota and Nebraska were aggregated into two categories that specified if change had occurred or did not occur. Areas characterized as \"nonagriculture, \" \"habitat, \" and \"water\" did not fit with- (1987) (2015), Elder (1969); and McKnight (1969) . Temporal changes in land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program are available in Decision Innovation Solutions (2013). \u2020 Percentages of cropland or grassland were relative to the total amount of grasslands + croplands.\nin these two groups and therefore were identified as \"other.\" For Nebraska, there were 1.88, 1.90, and 1.77 million ha of land characterized as \"other\" in 2006, 2012, and 2014, respectively, and in South Dakota there were 2.51, 2.74, and 2.28 million ha of land characterized as \"other\" in 2006, 2012, and 2014, respectively. At each sampling point, the LCC value (1-8) was determined by overlaying the digital soil and sampling maps (Soil Survey Staff, 2019). The LCC value was the value of the dominant soil within a mapping unit (Soil Survey Staff, 2019) . Based on proportions of sites within an LCC category, the 95% CIs were determined using Eq.

After the 2012 drought, the amount of land seeded to crops in 2012 and 2014 increased by about 3% to 3.71 million ha. In eastern Nebraska, 9000 ha of cropland was converted to grassland between 2006 and 2014.\nThe amounts of grasslands in western Nebraska (northwest, north, central, southwest, and south NASS regions) in 2006, 2012, and 2014 were approximately 9.44, 9.410, and 9.41 million ha. Most of these grasslands were not suitable for crop production because only 21.60% had LCC values \u00a34. Between 2006 and 2012, 6000 ha were converted from croplands to grasslands. Of the converted land, 21.3% had LCC values \u00a34. Between 2006 and 2012, 120,000 ha of grasslands were converted to croplands. At the converted sites, 56.6% had LCC values \u00a34. The conversion of grasslands to croplands was assisted by transgenic improvements that reduced tillage requirements and increased water use efficiency (Chang et al., 2014; Clay et al., , 2017 Lee et al., 2014; Mamani-Pati et al., 2014; Reitsma et al., 2015) .

Most of the converted land (86.7%) had an LCC value \u00a34.

Similar trends were observed between 2012 and 2014, when 0.67 and 2.03% of Nebraska and South Dakota land was converted from one category to another, respectively. These results suggest that land use in Nebraska was less affected by the multitude of factors influencing agriculture, whereas in South Dakota, farmers were more likely to adjust land use based on available resources, climate, and market expectations. A large percentage of the eastern grassland in both states was located on soils considered suitable for crop production. However, this was not the case in western grasslands."}, {"section_title": "responses to Extreme Weather Events: 2012 to 2014", "text": "The Palmer drought index was used to examine changes in relative wetness during the study period (Fig. 1) . This index uses \u22122 to indicate moderate drought, \u22124 to indicate extreme drought, 0 to indicate normal rainfall, and 8 to indicate abnormally high rainfall (Dai, 2011) . In Nebraska and South Dakota, between 2005 and 2010, the Palmer drought index values ranged from near 0 to near 8. In 2011, the index value started to decrease and reached a minimum value approaching \u22124 in 2012 (Mallya et al., 2013) . In Nebraska and South Dakota, the 2012 drought contributed to a 20.5 and 33.7% decrease in corn yields, respectively. The lower yield loss in Nebraska was attributed to higher irrigation use in Nebraska than in South Dakota (Table  1 ). The US Drought Monitor maps for 20 Nov. 2012 show that most of Nebraska and southern portions of South Dakota were characterized as exceptional drought, whereas in northern South Dakota the condition was rated as severe. Additional information on the drought is available in Haigh et al. (2019) . Historically, agronomic management practices are adjusted based on the expected climatic conditions. For example, in response to an expected drought, nitrogen rates may be reduced, earlier maturing cultivars may be planted, livestock that would normally graze the land may be sold, or cropland may be converted to grassland (Bastian et al., 2006; Dunn et al., 2005; NASS, 2013) . Calf sales in Nebraska and South Dakota were 3.8 and 6.1% higher in 2012, respectively, when compared with sales in 2011 and 2013. In addition, in Nebraska and South Dakota, the number of ranchers who purchased additional hay decreased from 64% in 2012 to 35% in 2014, and the number of ranchers who weaned calves earlier than usual decreased from 55% in 2012 to 16% in 2014 (Haigh et al., 2019) . These findings were attributed to attempts to reduce production costs and to match grazing intensity to available forage (Aadland, 2004; University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, 2015) .\nAlthough the percentage increase in calf sales appears modest, calves are essential to ranchers' overall livelihood, and culling may compromise both the herd and income for future years. In addition, to adjust the number of calves, farmers in eastern South Dakota increased the annual conversion of croplands to grassland from 0.63% yr \u22121 between 2006 and 2012 to 1.03% yr \u22121 between 2012 and 2014 (Table 3 ). In western South Dakota, the annual conversion rate of grassland to cropland decreased from 0.42% between 2006 and 2012 to 0.23% between 2012 and 2014. These responses differed from the 1930 drought, where the combined impact of drought and extensive tillage led to crop failure, high erosion rates, and in some cases land abandonment (Coppock, 2011; Diamond, 2005; Ferdinand et al., 2012; Nurkse, 1952; Parton et al., 2007) . Differences between the 1930s and 2012 droughts were attributed the strength of the drought and to new technologies and educational activities that changed rotations and improved soil health (Clay et al., 2012; Parton et al., 2007; Smith, 1947) .\nIn Nebraska, the amount of irrigated land remained relatively constant and was 3.46 million ha between 2007 and 2010. However, during the drought in 2012, the amount of irrigated land decreased slightly (3.35 million ha), and after the drought the amount of irrigated land increased to 3.75 million ha in 2015 (NASS, 2019) . These values show that a response to the 2012 drought was a decrease followed by an increase in irrigated land. In South Dakota, most farmers do not have access to irrigation water, and therefore this response was not possible."}, {"section_title": "Economics, Land use, and Soil quality", "text": "In South Dakota and Nebraska agriculture, farmers and ranchers obtain income from the sale of grains and livestock and indirectly from the sale of ethanol (Bourlion et al., 2013; Davis, 2016; Dunn et al., 2005) . Grains are produced on cropland, and livestock are produced on feed or forage obtained from cropland or grasslands. For both grain and cattle, selling prices were higher in 2012 than 2006 NASS, 2019 (Wang et al., 2018) . These results show that the period from 2006 to 2012 could be characterized as increasing prices and profits, whereas the period between 2012 and 2017 was a period of declining or relatively stable commodity prices ( Jansen, 2017; Wang et al., , 2018 .\nIt is impossible to directly compare land use changes predicted by the Rashford et al. (2010) economic model with Wright and Wimberly (2013) or with our results because they represent slightly different periods and areas. However, the magnitude of the differences between the economic model predictions and the measured changes is large. The Rashford et al. (2010) economic model predicted that if prices stayed on the trend that was observed between 2001 and 2006 then nearly 12.1 million ha of grassland in the United States Prairie Pothole region could be converted to cropland by 2011. Wright and Wimberly (2013) reported that the conversion of grasslands to corn or soybean production for a larger area, containing North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa, from 2006 to 2011 was 0.528 million ha.\nOne factor not considered by many economic models is the importance of income diversification (Barbieri and Mahoney, 2009; Gasson, 1973) . Because it is difficult to predict future markets, many farmers and ranchers are hesitant to switch from a diversified system to a nondiversified system. Diversification pro- tects farmers from market swings. For example, in 1980, soybeans produced in South Dakota had a profit of $21.83 ha \u22121 , whereas livestock profitability at Cottonwood, SD, was $1.88 ha \u22121 (Bourlion et al., 2013; Dunn et al., 2010) . However, in 2000, a reversal occurred, and soybean and livestock profits were $1.30 ha \u22121 and $52.44 ha \u22121 , respectively. Two years later (2002), commodity prices changed again, resulting in soybean and livestock profits of $70.33 and $54.12 ha \u22121 , respectively.\nMany economic-based models (Claassen et al., 2011; are based on the assumption that the most productive soils (i.e., the best land) will be converted first. Data from our study support this hypothesis. However, the conversion of the grassland soils suitable for annual crop production was relatively slow. For example, in Nebraska only 6.99 and 7.56% of the grassland with a LCC value \u22642 and \u00a34 was converted to cropland between 2006 and 2012, respectively (Table 4 ). Higher conversion rates were observed in South Dakota, where 17.9 and 11.57% of the grassland with LCC \u22642 and \u00a34 was converted to cropland between 2006 and 2012, respectively.\nThese findings suggest that a large percentage of the grassland considered suitable for crop production was not converted to crop production ( Table 5 ). For example, in Nebraska and South Dakota, 87.2 and 77.1% of grassland with LCC \u00a34, respectively, was not converted to cropland between 2006 and 2012. The relatively low total land use conversion during a period of high profitability (Davis, 2016) suggests that the importance of economics was overestimated and that the importance of the noneconomic factors was understated (Doidge et al., 2017; Floress et al., 2017; . These differences imply that many farmers and ranchers were not motivated by economic factors alone and may have been influenced by land and water stewardship (Floress et al., 2017) . Recent surveys conducted by researchers at South Dakota State University support this hypothesis (Floress et al., 2017; Haigh et al., 2019; Kolady et al., 2019; Saak et al., 2019; ."}, {"section_title": "COnCLuSIOnS", "text": "The conversion of nonsuitable grasslands to croplands has the potential to increase erosion, degrade water quality, decrease wildlife and pollinator habitat, lead to wildlife habitat fragmentation, decrease income diversity, and degrade environmental quality. The losses of these services depend on where the land is converted and how the land is managed after the conversion. For example, if conservation practices are adopted, then converting grasslands with LCC values \u22642 to cropland may increase shortterm economic returns (Table 1) (Clay et al., 2012; USDA, 2015) . However, this land conversion also would reduce grazing opportunities, income diversification, flood mitigation, and wildlife/pollinator habitat.\nBetween 2006 and 2012, there were 9.737 million ha of grassland in the model system that had LCC values \u00a34. Of the 0.81 million ha of converted grassland, 91% had LCC values \u00a34. In addition, there were 0.242 million ha of cropland converted to grassland during this period. These results suggest that the amount of grasslands converted to cropland was relatively low. In spite of historically high commodity prices in 2012, most of the grasslands suitable for crop production remained as grassland. These results were attributed to (i) a resistance to change or inertia , (ii) a growing interest in soil health, (iii) an aging workforce, (iv) time constraints and costs, and (v) a desire to maintain diverse income streams (Derner et al., 2018; Gasson, 1973; Rashford et al., 2010; Wang et al., , 2018 . In conclusion, models based only on economics may overestimate the conversion of grasslands to cropland because they do not fully consider the human dimension of change and because many farmers manage cyclic commodity prices by producing both livestock and grains.
