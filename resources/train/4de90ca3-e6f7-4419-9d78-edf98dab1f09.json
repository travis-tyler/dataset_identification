[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Susceptibility genes for psychiatric and neurological disorders -including APOE, BDNF, CLU, CNTNAP2, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1, ErbB4, HFE, NRG1, NTKR3, and ZNF804A -have been reported to affect white matter (WM) microstructure in the healthy human brain, as assessed through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes explain only a small fraction of the overall variance and are challenging to detect reliably in single cohort studies. To date, few studies have evaluated the reproducibility of these results. As part of the ENIGMA-DTI consortium, we pooled regional fractional anisotropy (FA) measures for 6,165 subjects (CEU ancestry N=4,458) from 11 cohorts worldwide to evaluate effects of 15 candidate SNPs by examining their associations with WM microstructure. Additive association tests were conducted for each SNP. We used several meta-analytic and mega-analytic designs, and we evaluated regions of interest at multiple granularity levels. The ENIGMA-DTI protocol was able to detect single-cohort findings as originally reported. Even so, in this very large sample, no significant associations remained after multiple-testing correction for the 15 SNPs investigated. Suggestive associations (1.3\u00d710 -4 < p < 0.05, uncorrected) were found for BDNF, COMT, and ZNF804A in specific tracts. Meta-and mega-analyses revealed similar findings. Regardless of the approach, the previously reported candidate SNPs did not show significant associations with WM microstructure in this largest genetic study of DTI to date; the negative findings are likely not due to insufficient power. Genome-wide studies, involving largescale meta-analyses, may help to discover SNPs robustly influencing WM microstructure."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Population and family studies revealed a key role for genetics in neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that search for genetic risk factors underlying disease have successfully pinpointed common genetic variants found more frequently in affected than unaffected individuals. These genome-wide searches, which consider evidence for association across the genome, use a statistical correction to account for the number of tests performed. In theory, focused tests of candidate risk factors may provide a more efficient evaluation of mechanistic processes that affect gross anatomy and white matter microstructure.\nWe do not generally know the mechanisms by which genetic risk variants impact brain structure and function. The field of neuroimaging genetics may expedite such discoveries. Genetic factors influence variations in brain structure and organization, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultimately, genetic variations may modulate brain function and risk for disease. Recently, large-scale consortia --including the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE) --have identified consistent neuroanatomical associations with specific genetic variants. These collaborative approaches boost statistical power by assessing tens of thousands of people, and yield more accurate estimation of effect sizes [1] [2] [3] [4] .\nBefore the formation of these large-scale consortia, imaging genetics focused on mapping the effects of candidate SNPs and genes from the neuropsychiatric literature in the brains of smaller more targeted samples -often with several hundred individuals. Independent replication of genetic effects on brain anatomy is challenging, as common genetic variations exert small effects, accounting for <1% of the variance. The sample sizes of typical MRI studies do not have sufficient power to reliably detect these effects 5, 6 and are more susceptible to false positive findings. However, without replication, true effects cannot be confirmed, and time and money may be wasted following up false positives. Several candidate SNPs influencing brain volume have been reported, however, most findings have not been replicated in large-scale consortium work: the majority of the candidates did not show even marginal effects in one study 4 . These replication failures indicate that the initial reported effects may have been inflated, due to the 'winner's curse' phenomenon 7 . However, several other reasons for replication failures have been proposed. It could be argued that the meta-analytic approach typically adopted by GWAS consortia was limiting the possible power, or that minor methodological considerations in the imaging protocols were having a dramatic effect. The recent discovery of multiple significantly associated SNPs that account for less than 1% of the variance in regional brain volumes makes this less likely 4 . Here, we aim to investigate these possibilities in the most methodologically comprehensive imaging genetics study to date examining candidate genes on brain structure. We analyzed over 6,000 scans from 11 participating cohorts from the Americas, Europe, and Australia.\nAs shown by ENIGMA and other consortia, MRI can help to discover genetic variants that influence brain and substructure volumes. Genetic studies of diffusion MRI can examine how genetic variants impact white matter pathways. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantifies the microstructural properties of white matter and allows for network type reconstructions of the brain's physical connections. DTI measures are altered in a wide range of diseases, including stroke 8 , Alzheimer's disease (AD) 9, 10 , schizophrenia 11, 12 , bipolar and mood disorders 13, 14 , and addiction 15, 16 , among others. The heritability of many DTI measures has been established; our DTI group within ENIGMA has found these heritability estimates to be reliable and remarkably similar across several cohorts [17] [18] [19] . As approximately half of the variability in many of these DTI measures is due to additive genetic effects, it is expected that genetic association studies will provide insight into the mechanisms, by which these connections are formed and maintained.\nSeveral published works have already proposed genetic associations between candidate SNPs and white matter microstructure as defined by DTI scans (See Table 1 ). Independent replication of these results, however, has been limited. The initial findings were generally made in samples of 100-1000, large for an imaging study, but arguably too small to robustly estimate effect sizes. Similar to several early candidate SNP effects having been disputed in the psychiatric literature 20, 21 , the effects of candidate variants on brain structure have become increasingly controversial 22 . ENIGMA's subcortical volume GWAS identified robust associations accounting for as little as 0.5% of the variance in volumes of specific structures, but the majority of SNPs identified as influencing psychiatric disorders do not reach nominal levels of significance 4 .\nHere, we investigated the effects of candidate variants on the microstructure of white matter pathways as defined by the most common diffusion MRI measure, fractional anisotropy (FA). In these analyses, FA was averaged across the full WM skeleton as well as specific tracts using harmonized protocols described in our prior work [17] [18] [19] . We assembled a sample of 6,165 individuals (4,458 of them of Caucasian (CEU) ancestry) with DTI and genetic information provided by eleven cohorts. We limited the SNPs considered to those previously reported to show associations with FA. While most of the SNPs we targeted were originally reported as risk factors in the neuropsychiatric literature, one SNP was first identified in a genome-wide analysis of DTI-FA traits as being in a promising genetic locus (though it was not shown to be genome-wide significant). We included SNPs in the candidate genes APOE, BDNF, CLU, CNTNAP2, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1, ErbB4, HFE, NRG1, NTKR3, and ZNF804A, summarized in Table 1 .\nWe assessed the association of these variants in the standard meta-analytical framework used for GWAS. We also determined whether the power to detect the genetic effects would be improved in a mega-analytical framework, where the statistical tests are computed on a pooled data set. In addition, we examined the effect within the samples in which the associations had originally been reported. This allowed us to determine whether the harmonized image processing approach taken within ENIGMA would maintain the nominal association within that sample.\nIndependent testing of multiple brain regions of interest may impose an unnecessarily strict multiple comparisons correction requirement on the results, if the average FA across the full brain has similar effect sizes for the individual SNPs as the regional measures. Therefore, as a follow-up analysis, we made statistical inferences across various groupings of the regions of interest to determine if effects would be stronger had we, for example, analyzed bilateral regions separately, or only analyzed the corpus callosum as a whole, rather than including the genu, body, and splenium, separately.\nWe hypothesized that the reported findings may be limited to the discovery samples, and may not generalize to other cohorts, reinforcing the need for replication in imaging genetics. We further hypothesized that the impact of methodological differences in image processing on the association would be limited, so that associations reported in the original findings would be present in the phenotypes produced using the harmonized ENIGMA protocols, and the effect sizes would be similar for each SNP between meta-and mega-analyses of cohort effects. Our study corroborates the inconsistencies in the current literature and provides ample evidence for the need to continue unbiased genome-wide searches with quantitative brain measures."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Our study aimed to determine whether candidate SNPs, that were previously reported to have an association with white matter microstructure (as measured by DTI fractional anisotropy, FA), can be replicated in a large DTI-based imaging genetics study.

This search identified fourteen SNPs within twelve genes (APOE, BDNF, CLU, CNTNAP2, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1, ErbB4, HFE, NRG1, NTKR3, ZNF804A) that had previously been identified as candidate genes within the psychiatric literature (See Table 2 ). GWASs for DTI-FA have also been performed 23, 24 , but no results have met statistical thresholds for genome-wide significance.\nTo determine if the strongest hit from these analyses would reach genome-wide significance if the overall sample size was dramatically increased, this variant was also included as a putative candidate. All of these SNPs are common (present in >5% of the population) and have been previously associated with normal variance in FA values in healthy individuals, in at least one published study.

Cohorts consisted of various twin, family, and unrelated individuals, mainly of European descent. Cohorts of individuals from mixed ethnic populations in the United States, including Latinos and African Americans as well as Caucasians, were also included.

The genetic variability of the individuals in the samples was compared to that of known population cohorts through multidimensional scaling (MDS); the first two components for each individual were plotted against known ethnic samples from the HapMap3 efforts. To avoid effects of population stratification, analyses were performed in the largest ethnic group (corresponding to 4,458 from the CEU population) and subsequently in all individuals.

Briefly, FA images from all subjects were non-linearly registered to the ENIGMA-DTI target FA map. This target was created from the FA images of four participating studies and has been shown to provide stable results for children and adult cohorts, as previously described 17 . Registration algorithms were allowed to vary to ensure optimal alignment per cohort, yet FSL's fnirt 69 was suggested as a default registration, with an optional additional script provided using ANTS (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) registration tools. The data were then processed using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analytic method 70 modified to project individual FA values on the ENIGMA-DTI skeleton. Following the extraction of the skeletonized white matter and projection of individual FA values, ENIGMA tract-wise regions of interest, derived from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white matter parcellation atlas 71 , were transferred to extract the mean FA across the full skeleton and average FA values for a total of 25 (partially overlapping) regions [SI Figure 1 and SI Table 1 ] found to be reliably heritable in our prior work [17] [18] [19] .

Abbreviations and full tract names are listed in SI Table 1 . The protocol also contained 3 additional measures of FA combined for larger tracts, including the entire corpus callosum (3 original regions: genu, body splenium), internal capsule (3 original regions: anterior limb, posterior limb, and retrolenticular), and corona radiata (3 original regions: anterior, posterior, superior); this totals 25 (4 non-unique) measures of FA being tested. FA values were used as-is (raw and un-normalized), as well as after applying an inverse Gaussian normalization to the residuals after adjusting for effects of the covariates. Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was performed to pool resulting inferences on both sets, and mega-analyses were performed on the normalized measures.\nEach SNP (coded in a dose-dependent, additive fashion with respect to the minor allele count 0,1, or 2) was regressed on the average FA in each ROI independently at the site level, and subsequently at the group level for mega-analysis. Linear models were run for all cohorts of unrelated individuals, and mixed effects models using the kinship matrix to model relatedness were used for all cohorts with related individuals. We used SOLAR-Eclipse (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/se_linux) to create kinship matrices for each individual cohort of related individuals after specifying familial relationships. All regressions were performed in the CEU sample only as well as the full cohort.\nSeveral fixed covariates were used in all analyses, including age, sex, age-by-sex, agesquared, and age-squared-by-sex. Nonlinear effects of age (i.e. age-squared, and age-squared-bysex) have been shown to impact FA 59 and were included for all cohorts. The first four components of the MDS analyses were also used as covariates for all groups. Two sites, NeuroIMAGE and BIG, added a covariate to model the two scanners at which the images were collected. NeuroIMAGE also added a covariate to model potential fixed differences between participants with ADHD and controls.\nIn addition to the breakdown of ROIs tested as part of the ENIGMA-DTI protocol, to assess the regional specificity of the associations, we tested various groupings of the ROIs. Bilateral measures were broken down into their lateralized regions, and results of those associations statistically pooled using Stouffer's meta-analysis 72 were compared to the original groupings, which were further pooled and compared to the effects computed on the overall average FA; we aimed to pool regional estimates and therefore reduce the correction needed for ROIs.

A Bonferroni correction threshold accounts for the number of variants tested; here 15 variants were tested, leading to a single trait correction threshold of 0.05/15 = 0.0033. However, as no SNPs reached levels of significance of p < 0.0033, we also report those that reached a nominal significance, defined here as those having an uncorrected pvalue of p < 0.05. While neglecting that multiplicity increases false positive risk, with such negative significance tests, it can only strengthen the evidence of null effects."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "No statistically significant findings were observed when data was pooled across studies, regardless of pooling method, although most SNPs were found to have similar directions of effect across many regions of interest (Figure 1) .\nThe breakdown of SNP counts per cohort is highlighted in SI Table 2 . The minor allele frequency (MAF) for the dysbindin SNP rs1018381 was low (<10%) for all CEU groups. GOBS and NIDA cohorts had a higher rs1018381 MAF, perhaps due to their more diverse ethnic composition. While all other SNPs had a MAF > 10% in the CEU population, the DISC1 SNP rs6675281 had no homozygous carriers in GOBS, and the HFE SNP rs1799945 had no homozygotes in NIDA-IRP, both non-CEU cohorts.\nAs seen in Figure 2 , correlations between the methods were strong in the CEU subpopulation; within the full sample, the mega-analyses revealed weaker correlations, likely due to the population heterogeneity, variations in the MDS component scale as well as SNP frequency, reiterating a known need for cautionary procedures, when combining multiple cohorts. Consistencies between the various meta-analytical approaches confirmed that the FA distributions with current sample sizes were sufficient to use raw-level statistics without inverse Gaussian normalization and parametric approaches.\nWithin the CEU sample, nominally significant (uncorrected p<0.05) associations were found with both meta-and the mega-pooling method for three polymorphisms: the first schizophrenia GWAS-significant SNP in ZNF804A, rs1344706, in the uncinate, COMT rs4680 in the body of the corpus callosum, and BDNF rs6265 in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the hippocampal portion of the cingulum. Forest plots for these findings are shown in SI Figure  4 . The standard errors for the associations computed with mega-analysis were marginally larger than those computed with meta-analysis (shown by width of the markers in the Forest plots in SI Figure 4 ). In the plots, the size of the center square reflects the sample size of the cohort; these can be seen for raw-valued associations and those Gaussian-normalized before regression and joint statistics. Additional nominally significant associations were found with two of the three approaches (both meta, or mega and one meta); these included HFE rs1799945 in the sagittal stratum, ZNF804A rs1344706 in the SLF, PCR, PLIC, and RLIC, and DISC1 rs6675281 in the anterior corona radiata. Nominal associations were also found for DTNBP1 rs1018381, but as previously mentioned, MAFs were too low in the CEU samples for reliable analysis. Our analysis of pooling ROIs through Stouffer's meta-analysis was similar to our individual ROI findings and did not reach statistical significance.\nTo establish whether the negative results were the result of insufficient sensitivity, we conducted a power analysis 73, 74 using a t-test linear multiple regression design in G*Power 3.1 75 . Previous studies had found SNPs that explain 0.5-1% of the phenotypic variance; using these effect sizes with N=4,458 subjects, and 18 fixed effects (11 sites, five age-and sex-related covariates, and two site-specific dummy variables) with an alpha of 0.05/15/25=1.3\u00d710 -4 to reflect the 15 SNPs and search regions (if all 25 were independent), gives a power in the range of 81.5 to 99.8%. Thus, these negative results are unlikely to be explained by insufficient power. Normalized and nonnormalized meta-analyses are very highly correlated for both the CEU subsample (r 2 =0.90) and the full sample (r 2 =0.92). The mega-analysis is also highly correlated for the CEU sample (r 2 =0.8). In the full sample, the megaanalyses revealed weaker correlations (r 2 =0.63). SNPs are labeled according to their gene name; two SNPs in DISC1 and NTRK3 were evaluated DISC1-a refers to rs6675281, DISC1-b to rs821616; NTRK3-a to rs4887348 and NTRK3-b to rs7176429."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We performed a targeted investigation of candidate SNPs implicated in disease risk that have been previously reported to also influence white matter microstructure. SNPs in multiple genes have been claimed to be associated with variation in the white matter microstructure of the brain as measured by FA from DTI. To test the validity of the associations, it is important to ensure that the findings are replicable across populations, and that sample sizes are large enough to detect statistically significant associations. While no single imaging site has the sample size needed, effective ways to harmonize analyses and pool existing data sets from across the world are needed to discover robust associations. Such multi-site, international studies allow discovery of genetic effects in populations around the world, and ensure that these associations are consistent in diverse groups of individuals. The diversity in this context is not genetic diversity in ancestry, which could lead to population stratification effects, but diversity in terms of various environmental and demographic aspects captured through global initiatives within the ENIGMA Consortium. Here, the statistical tests were performed centrally and on the full set of data at once, whereas in a harmonized meta-analytic framework statistics are conducted individually for each dataset and summary results are pooled across studies.\nWhile some SNPs showed nominal associations with localized regions within the FA map, this study did not replicate the association of any of the 15 SNPs previously associated with FA in single cohort studies, suggesting that previously reported associations might not be robust or generalizable. Classic candidate genes long thought to play a significant role in the genetic basis of schizophrenia, including some of those evaluated here, such as COMT and DISC1, were recently re-evaluated in the largest genomic study of schizophrenia published to date 20, 21 . These traditionally studied genetic factors were found not to be as pertinent to the disease as initially hypothesized, and it was suggested that the original findings were perhaps driven by relatively small and underpowered studies. The situation for imaging genetics studies cannot be assumed to be any different from these studies of schizophrenia, or any other complex human traits, in that regard.\nOur findings may potentially be discouraging to researchers whose studies focus on these candidate SNPs, but they do not rule out that effects of such SNPs might be observed in even larger sample sizes. Moreover, we targeted specific SNPs of interest within each candidate gene, and cannot discount potential contributions of other polymorphisms elsewhere in such genes, in regions of independent linkage disequilibrium. Indeed, the genetic architecture of these white matter traits may involve a broad range of common variants not yet identified, but identifiable with GWAS, as we have recently shown for structural MRI 4 . This work shows that the individual associations reported in single cohorts are not reliably replicated in other cohorts. It also shows that meta-analysis approaches have similar power to mega-analysis. As none of the prior candidate SNPs showed widespread associations, we are unable to determine, if mega-analysis offers more power to detect true associations than meta-analysis. In heterogeneous cases, we found that meta-analytic approaches may provide more consistent results than mega-analysis, while both meta-and mega-analysis performed appropriately for cohorts from ethnically homogeneous populations. This is the first large-scale multi-cohort investigation of white matter microstructure assessing multiple candidate SNPs in a statistically rigorous and extensive evaluation. Our results question the reliability of previous findings, despite the historical significance many of these genes may have presented. However, the impact of \"winner's curse\" and publication bias need to be taken into account, when reading imaging genetics literature that does not include evidence for replication. This is not intended to negate previous findings, as there are also population considerations that could perhaps influence the degree and direction of genetic associations, such as age, sex, and environmental effects. In this analysis, all groups span a variety of age ranges from multiple countries around the world. Our aim was to identify generalized associations of previously highlighted candidate SNPs with white matter across multiple populations around the world, not to negate findings within any particular subpopulation, in which they were originally reported; subpopulation associations may be valid and are beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we advocate the importance of reproducing effects, and highlight the need for harmonizing analyses, showing that the ENIGMA-DTI processing method was able to maintain the SNP associations within the cohort in which they were first reported. We show that these historical candidate SNPs are not globally and reliably ones that influence brain microstructure, and instead suggest that to identify the key genetic factors, a large-scale GWAS is needed, as in the successful GWAS reported for MRI-based measures of brain volumes [1] [2] [3] [4] .\nNeuroimaging genetics offers a non-invasive window to observe genetic influences on macro-scale brain structure. However, to fully understand the mechanisms behind any association, more costly and invasive paradigms are necessary. It is important to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the imaging association before investing in in-depth analysis of a gene or specific locus; otherwise, significant resources may be wasted. The ENIGMA-DTI working group is now pooling together a full-scale detailed genome-wide meta-analysis of all common genetic variants in the genome in over 10,000 individuals, to contribute to an unbiased search for common genetic variants that help to shape white matter microstructure in the general population.
