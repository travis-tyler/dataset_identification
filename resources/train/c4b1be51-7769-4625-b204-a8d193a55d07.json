Disturbances are \"relatively discrete events in time that disrupt ecosystem, community, or population structure and change resource or substrate availability or the physical environment\" (White & Pickett, 1985) . Due to their large footprints (TCs signatures extend over hundreds of kilometres and their tracks cover thousands of km, see Chan & Chan, 2015; Knaff, Longmore, & Molenar, 2014) and high intensity (sustained wind speeds of up to 300 km/hr), TCs can cause extensive damages to natural ecosystems and human societies (Costanza et al., 2008; Lugo, 2008; Yih, Boucher, Vandermeer, & Zamora, 1991) . This was recently highlighted by the devastating impacts of Cyclone Winston (2016), Hurricane Irma (2017) and Typhoon Haiyan (2013), some of the most intensive systems ever recorded (Le Page, 2016) .\nThe effects of disturbances on the composition, structure and functioning of ecosystems depend on the disturbance regime, which is for TCs mainly characterized by their frequency, size and intensity Whelan, 1995; White & Jentsch, 2001; White & Pickett, 1985) . The disturbance regime exerted by TCs is highly spatially heterogeneous. For example, forests in the Northwest Pacific and Northwest Atlantic experience frequent, intense and large TCs while forests in South America and Africa experience few TCs (Chan & Chan, 2015; Schreck, Knapp, & Kossin, 2014) . Therefore, on a pantropical scale forests may experience TC disturbance regimes ranging from infrequent TCs to frequent and intense TCs (Figure 1 ). through defoliation and tree mortality, encouraging higher regeneration and turnover of biomass. The projected increase in intensity and poleward extension of tropical cyclones due to anthropogenic climate change may therefore have important and lasting impacts on the structure and dynamics of forests in the future."}, {"section_title": "K E Y W O R D S", "text": "basal area, canopy height, hurricanes, power dissipation index, stem density, tropical dry forest, tropical humid forest, typhoons F I G U R E 1 Global distribution of the frequency and energy released (power dissipation index) by tropical cyclones, and locations of forest structure datasets [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Smith, 2004; Metcalfe et al., 2008; Turton, 2008; Zimmerman et al., 1994) . The gaps and defoliation generate space and allow more light penetration on the forest floor, enhancing regeneration (e.g., Bellingham, Tanner, & Healey, 1995; Uriarte et al., 2004; Whitmore, 1974) .\nBecause TCs tend to disproportionally affect big trees and encourage regeneration (Beard et al., 2005; Everham & Brokaw, 1996; Franklin, 2007; Hjerpe, Hedenas, & Elmqvist, 2001; Murphy, Metcalfe, Bradford, & Ford, 2014; Murphy et al., 2008; Roth, 1992) , forests affected by frequent cyclones would be expected to have lower canopies and higher stem densities. Comparative regional studies support these expectations for Madagascar vs. African rainforests , New Caledonia vs. other Southwest Pacific humid forests , Caribbean vs.\nNeotropical dry forests (Quigley & Platt, 2003; Van Bloem, Murphy, & Lugo, 2007) . Furthermore, stem density increased with TC frequency in lowland rainforests of five South Pacific archipelagos , and was higher in Neotropical dry forests that experienced TCs in the last 25 years compared to regions with no TCs (Gillespie, Zutta, Early, & Saatchi, 2006) . However, a pantropical test for these invisible, medium-to long-term effects (Lugo, 2008) on forest structure is still lacking.\nThe availability of high-resolution historical databases of TCs trajectories and intensities such as the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp, Kruk, Levinson, Diamond, & Neumann, 2010) allows to objectively quantify the cyclone regime at any location (e.g., Schreck et al., 2014) . The frequency or the intensity of TCs (i.e., the maximum sustained wind speed) is often used to estimate the level of disturbance induced by TCs in a given area.\nHowever, it has been suggested that this level of disturbance (or the destructiveness) is better described by the energy transferred by TCs to the land surface, as this parameter combines the frequency, intensity, size and translation speed of TCs (Camargo & Sobel, 2005; Emanuel, 2005) .\nIn this study, we test on a pantropical scale the long-term, invisible effects (sensu Lugo, 2008) of TCs on the structure of tropical forests. We test it by analysing the effects of the frequency and intensity of TCs on structural features of forests (stem density, basal area and canopy height), relative to other climatic variables (mean annual temperature [MAT] and water availability) and human disturbances (human foot print index) that are known to affect forest structure (e.g., Klein, Randin, & K\u00f6rner, 2015; Moles et al., 2009; Tao, Guo, Li, Wang, & Fang, 2016; Zhang, Nielsen, Mao, Chen, & Svenning, 2016) . We hypothesize that TC are an important disturbance that has long-term effects on the structure of tropical forests and that, therefore, areas exposed to frequent and intense TCs would exhibit higher stem densities and lower canopy heights. Our findings are highly relevant to understanding how forecasted changes in the behaviour of TCs (Christensen et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2016 ) may impact forest ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "| MATERIAL S AND ME THODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Structural features", "text": "We compiled the location, stem density (number of stems per ha), basal area (the total cross section area in m 2 /ha, which is a good proxy of above-ground biomass; e.g., Slik et al., 2010) , maximum size (maximum DBH, diameter at breast height, cm), mean canopy height (m) and maximum height for plants with stem diameter \u226510 cm at ~1.3 m above the base (DBH) from published inventories for plots \u22650.1 ha in size (Ibanez et al., 2018) .

We used a total of 438 plots (355 in humid forests, 83 in dry forests) that were pooled into 250 grid cells (203 in humid forests, 47 in dry forests, Figure 1 and Figure S1 .2).\nMulticollinearity was <0.5 (Spearman's rho) for all explanatory variables (Table S1 .1).\nWe first tested whether structural features differed between areas experiencing low-(freq. <0.01 TC/year, i.e., less than one TC per century is expected based on the 35-year IBTrACs dataset), medium-(0.01 \u2265 freq. < 0.1 TC/year, i.e., 1-10 TCs per century) or high-(freq. \u22650.1 TC/year, i.e., at least one TC per decade) TC frequency.\nThis was done separately for dry and humid forests (see distribution of TC frequency Figure S1 .1).

Response variables describing the structure of forests were log-transformed to increase normality ( Figure S1 .3). Because basal area and maximum size, and canopy height and maximum height, were highly linearly correlated for both forest types, we focussed on three relatively independent structural variables: stem density, basal area and canopy height ( Figure S1 .4). We used the MuMIn r package (Barto\u0144, 2016 ) and the dredge function to generate different sets of models representing all possible combinations and subsets of explanatory variables. We then selected the best models based on the Akaike information criterion (\u0394AIC <2 from the best models, Bunnefeld & Phillimore, 2012) .

We show for the first time that stem density and canopy height are significantly related to the frequency of and energy released by TCs in a globally consistent way. Furthermore, our results indicate that these relationships were most pronounced for stem density and for humid forests, which are not limited by water availability and are less impacted by human disturbances (based on lower human foot print) than dry forests. Therefore, forecasted changes in the intensities, sizes and trajectories of TCs are likely to have important impacts on the structure of tropical and subtropical forests (Kossin, Emanuel, & Vecchi, 2014; Mei, Xie, Primeau, McWilliams, & Pasquero, 2015) .\nOur results explained a considerable proportion of the variation in stem density and canopy height in our dataset, suggesting that TCs are important large-scale disturbances that have long-term impacts on forests structure. Our analysis did not capture edaphic and topographic variation known to impact forest structure from local to regional scales, which makes the strong relationship we found between cyclone and forest structure even more remarkable. Indeed, soil depth, nutrient availability and topographical position are known to affect forest structure (e.g., Clark & Clark, 2000; Quesada et al., 2012; Schut et al., 2014; Slik et al., 2010; Webb, Stanfield, & Jensen, 1999 ).\nThe strong, universal relationship between TCs and stem density documented in this study is not surprising. TCs are disturbances that reduce the canopy cover of forests (Comita et al., 2009; Grove, Turton, & Siegenthaler, 2000; Hjerpe et al., 2001; Staben & Evans, 2008) and cause tree mortality (Webb et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2009; Zimmerman et al., 1994) . This results in increased light availability for several years in the undergrowth (Bellingham, Tanner, Rich, & Goodland, 1996; Lin et al., 2011; Luke, McLaren, & Wilson, 2014; Turton, 1992) , creating suitable conditions for regeneration and the release of saplings (Luke et al., 2014; Nicotra, Chazdon, & Iriarte, 1999; Tanner, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Healey, Holdaway, & Bellingham, 2014) . Therefore, frequent cyclones (e.g., one per decade) would be expected to maintain high light availability and, consequently, regeneration. Furthermore, higher mortalities and regeneration reported from TC-prone forests suggest that such forests may experience higher turnover and quicker dynamics than forests not or rarely affected by these disturbances (Swenson et al., 2012; Webb et al., 2011) .\nGiven that TCs are known to trim forest canopies to lower heights (Brokaw & Grear, 1991; Lin et al., 2011) , the moderate effect of TCs on canopy height may seem surprising. Our results suggest that canopy height first depends on hydraulic limitation and then by mechanical pruning by intense TC winds, as canopy height of dry forest (with MAP-PET being on average \u2212177.7 \u00b1 626.7 mm) was less than half that of humid forest (with MAP-PET being on average 700.6 \u00b1 1,030.1 mm). This is in the line with recent global analyses showing canopy height to increase with water availability (Klein F I G U R E 3 Relationships between the energy released by tropical cyclones (power dissipation index), stem density and canopy height (on log scales). Thick lines represent significant linear relationships (***p < 0.001, *p < 0.05) Zhang et al., 2016) and the hydraulic limitation hypothesis (Ryan, Phillips, & Bond, 2006; Ryan & Yoder, 1997) .\nIn humid forests, frequent TC disturbances may result in a greater investment in horizontal over vertical growth, as suggested by the negative relationship between the energy released by TCs with canopy height and its weaker, positive relationship with basal area. This deduction is supported by recent studies comparing height-diameter tree allometries across the tropics, which have shown that areas exposed to frequent strong winds, such as New Caledonia (Blanchard et al., 2016) or Dominica (Thomas, Martin, & Mycroft, 2015) , have lower growth in height relative to diameter. These changes in tree allometry could result from repeated pruning of crown tips by TCs (Brokaw & Grear, 1991) or from evolutionary adaptations to TCs, which have been suggested to explain differential responses of neotropical palms (Areacaeae) to TCs (Griffith, Noblick, Dowe, Husby, & Calonje, 2008) . The latter would imply TCs to have important evolutionary influences. Alternatively lower canopy heights may be due to resprouting, which is commonly observed in trees surviving TC damages (Bellingham, Tanner, & Healey, 1994; Scanlon, Petit, Tuiwawa, & Naikatini, 2018; Van Bloem et al., 2007; Zimmerman et al., 1994) and produces multistemmed trees that tend to be lower in height than single-stemmed trees (Givnish, 1984; Kruger, Midgley, & Cowling, 1997) .\nThe expected changes in the frequency, intensity or geographical distribution of TCs due to anthropogenic climate change are therefore likely to impact the structure and dynamics of affected forests. While the influence of global warming on TCs remains uncertain (Walsh et al., 2016) , there is an emerging consensus that TCs will increase in intensity (Christensen et al., 2013; Kang & Elsner, 2015; Mei et al., 2015) , attain unprecedented sizes and intensities (Lin & Emanuel, 2016; Mei et al., 2015) , and expand their trajectories poleward . Our findings suggest that more intense TCs may alter tropical forest structure (density, height and basal area) and dynamics (higher turnover). Similar changes can be expected in forests at higher latitudes experiencing TCs for the first time. Furthermore, forests subjected to more intense cyclones may experience changes in species composition Webb et al., 2011) and increased vulnerability to drought and other threats, such as fire and invasion by weeds (Beard et al., 2005; Franklin, 2007; Hjerpe et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2008) . The significant, negative relationship of human foot print with forest canopy height and basal area highlights that factors other than TC are impacting forest structure. This relationship could be the result of selective tree removal by humans or edge effects related to fragmentation (Laurance, Delamonica, Laurance, Vasconcelos, & Lovejoy, 2000; Lindenmayer, Laurance, & Franklin, 2012) . While these potential causes are purely speculative, it is well documented that forests are being degraded and destroyed at alarming rates (Crowther et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2013) . A direct anthropogenic influence on forest structure (and hence dynamics) is further supported by the effects of the human foot print being stronger in tropical dry forests, which is known to be extremely disturbed and fragmented (Gillespie et al., 2014; Janzen, 1988; Miles et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "| CON CLUS IONS", "text": "We provide the first evidence that the visible, short-term damages caused by TCs have less obvious, long-term effects on the structure of forests on a pantropical scale. The consistent finding of an increased stem density in regions experiencing a stronger TC disturbance regime suggests that TCs alter the structure of forests in a globally consistent manner. Furthermore, our results suggest that, within humid forests, TCs may have a stronger effect on canopy height than water availability. This implies that the predicted higher intensities and higher latitudes of cyclone impact in future will result in major and predictable changes in forest structure and, hence, global carbon stocks."}, {"section_title": "ACK N OWLED G EM ENTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "T.I. was funded by the Agency for Economic and Environmental", "text": "Development (DDEE) of the North Province of New Caledonia and G.K. was supported by an Alexander von Humboldt fellowship.
