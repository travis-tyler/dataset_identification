The detailed molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of A1-A4 and B clades globally. Indian viruses were found to belong to multiple evolutionary genetic clades (A2a, A3, A4 and B). However, the Indian viruses sequenced in this study were found belong to three clades viz., A2a, A4 and B. Majority of virus were clustered in clade A2a (n=17), whereas seven and two viruses were found belong to clade A4 and clade B respectively. The detailed phylogeny was depicted in There is also a renewed interest to understand the evolutionary path being followed by SARS CoV-2 to undertake effective control and mitigation measures. In spite of large number of reported cases in India, the genomes of few Indian circulating viruses are available. Further, there is a paucity of sequence data on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in central India.\nWe have been investigating COVID-19 suspected cases from mid of March to May 2020, where 136 cases were found positive from central India region (10 different districts including whole Chambal region from Madhya Pradesh state). We report the sequencing of 26 whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses directly from infected patients, from ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in India.\nThe length of RNA genomes was found to be 29.89 kb. SARS-CoV-2, being a RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus is highly prone to mutations. A number of mutations including non synonymous substitutions (responsible for change in protein) were identified across the viruses sequenced in this study. These mutations were spread across the genome including in ORF1ab, spike, matrix, envelope and nucleoprotein regions. High evolutionary activity has been recorded in some regions (district Morena, Shivpuri, Gwalior, Datia) of the genome. An important substitution (Spike: D614G) was identified in 17 SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in this study. D614G mutation in spike protein is an interesting substitution and has been reported with increased tally [Korber et al., 2020; Chnadrika et al., 2020] . Structurally, this mutation is located in the S1 subunit that also contains the RBD domain. Although present outside the functional region, the proximity of D614G around S1 cleavage site implicates an important change in the local environment. In addition, the key mutation in spike protein (D614G) also involves loss of the charged group. These mutations that lead to positively charged groups may cause more severe structural and functional effects. Recently, this mutation has been reported to make the virus more infectious. This mutation was further linked to higher number of cases and significant mortality rate in Europe (Pachetti et al, 2020) . In vitro studies also seem to support the This amino acid substitution is also a specific mutation for clade A2a.\nThe first index case (A) was identified from district Shivpuri from a person with travel history to Hyderabad in southern India. This led to emergence of the virus in this region, prior to which only 10 cases were confirmed from the whole state. During the first lockdown period another important index case (B) was reported from district Morena having travel history to Dubai. This index case led to emergence of SARS CoV-2 from district Morena. The index cases from district Sheopur and Gwalior was traced to patients having travel history to Indore and United States. Since these introductory events happened during stringent lockdown period, the infections were contained rapidly through implementation of contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.\nFollowing the lifting of lockdown, spread of infections was reported from different districts with a remarkable positivity in whole state. The highest number of case positivity (68%) reported from district Morena in post lock down period, primarily due to reverse migration of workforce. The detailed analysis revealed multiple introduction events with diverse geographical linkage. A sudden rise in cases was observed which indicates a rapid evolution of virus in central India region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a very distinct cladding pattern of virus emergence and evolution in different districts. The introductory index cases were found belong to clade B, whereas, virus sequence from same district were found belong to clade A4/ A2a after a gap of one month during post lock down (Unlock 1).\nMajority of Indian viruses sequenced in this study were found belong to clade A2a (n=17). This is a clade having travelers importation links to Italy, UK, France. Another n=7 viruses clustered in clade A4 comprises viral entries from Southeast Asia and central Asia. The index case from district Morena, Sheopur, Shivpuri and Gwalior was having a travel history from Dubai, Indore, Hyderabad and USA. These initial index cases were found belong to separate clusters (Clade B). The further expansions in viral emergence in these districts were found with clear shift to worldwide circulating A2a and A4 clades. The independent grouping with different clusters of infection with region was also observed.
