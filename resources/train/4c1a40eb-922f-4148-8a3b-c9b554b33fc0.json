[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Nearly all broilers produced in the United States are grown under contract arrangement between independently contracting broiler producers and integrated poultry companies. These contracts may vary in some minor points, but all include general provisions stipulating that the integrators are responsible for chick placement, feed provision, and live hauling of slaughter weight broilers (weights and age to be determined by the integrators) with growers providing the housing and equipment (as specified by the integrators), labor, utilities, and management expertise, with periodic consultation by the integrator service personnel. From time to time, it is desirable to look at this production system and compare current structure, costs, and returns with those from past years. The Poultry Federation (comprised of poultry firms in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma) Board of Directors commissioned a study in June 1999 to be conducted later that year to quantify changes that occurred in the structure, costs, and returns in the region's broiler industry during the period 1979 to 1999. Persons considering either entering the broiler business or seeking to expand existing operations can use these results. Lending institutions can use results in evaluation of loan applications for enterprise establishment or expansion. Broiler producers and integrated poultry companies can also use these results to compare costs and returns with past years and evaluate both the future state of the existing industry and opportunities for expansion."}, {"section_title": "DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM", "text": "There has been extensive research addressing the pros and cons of the contracting arrangements under which the poultry industry 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed: haroldg@uark.edu. 2 Lead authorship is shared.\noperates. Even though some of the historic research has dealt with grower returns (notably [1] ), much of the recent research has focused on specific allocation of input and output price risks and management risk between growers and in-tegrators; the treatment has been both theoretical and empirical, albeit with limited actual primary data [2, 3, 4] . The most recent publicly available primary research results are related in the 1999 USDA-Economic Research Service publication entitled \"Broiler Farms' Organization, Management and Performance\" [5] . This research used data from the 1995 USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey and compared earnings of broiler operations with other farming enterprises and US households. Nationwide, mean net farm income, an accrual based measure of income, for broiler farms with sales of $50,000 or more for that year were $15,969, down from $25,401 in 1991. Broiler farms are defined as commercial production facilities under contract with poultry integrators and sales are defined as payments to growers for total annual live weight production. Growers are paid on a per pound basis, generally at a rate of between $0.035 and 0.045/lb, depending on geographic area, size of bird, and overall grower performance in their production pool. Mean net cash farm income, a cash-based measure of income, for 1995 was estimated to be $32,602. Mean net farm income and mean net cash farm income for the Delta (Arkansas is in this region) for 1995 were $15,265 and $34,716, respectively. The primary differences between net farm income and net cash farm income are that net farm income includes depreciation expense and accrual adjustments in beginning and ending inventories. A paucity of research exists that actually utilizes comprehensive contract grower and integrators complex primary data to assess returns to contract growers in a longitudinal fashion from poultry production operations. An exception to this is the research by Cunningham [6] , which used Georgia broiler grower survey data to estimate net returns to land, labor, and management. Thus, a sizable knowledge gap exists in understanding the financial issues confronting contract growers and the resultant integrator responses to these issues over time."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "This study involved 16 poultry production complexes, comprised of 150 to 200 family farms each, in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Each complex was visited to obtain information on house size, building and equipment cost, house capacity, market weight, livability, flocks per year, contract payment per pound, gross income per house per year, and gross income per square foot per year. This information for 1979, 1989, and 1999 is summarized and presented in Table 1 . The 1999 data shown are averages of the 16 complexes surveyed. Information for the 1979 and 1989 data is comprised of 12 and 13 complexes, respectively, as some complexes were yet to be built in 1979 and 1989 and some had changed ownership and were not consistent across all years. A total of 20,090,000 chicks were placed each week in these 16 complexes, an average of 1,255,625 per complex per week.\nPoultry enterprises have followed the patterns experienced in other sectors of agriculture during the last 20 yr, increasing in both size and capital intensity. For example, a 4-house operation in 1979 was comprised of houses of 15,000-bird capacity; in 1999 the same 4-house operation was comprised of houses of 27,451-bird capacity. Much of this capacity increase is due to the advent of larger tunnel-ventilated houses. This change has enabled growers to continue to expand their operating size with little if any change in labor requirements. Similarly, housing and equipment costs per square foot have increased from $3.40/ft 2 Although not shown in Table 1 , the increased substitution of capital for labor under less inflationary conditions is an important factor in the increased revenue in 1999 compared with 1989. The poultry industry has been a leader in in- In addition to the efficiency gains derived from technological improvements in housing and ventilation and reduced labor requirements, numerous other changes have either become available or more widely adopted or have more fully reached their potential in increasing efficiency in broiler production. These include continued breed improvement, use of nipple drinkers, improved feed formulation (i.e., pharmaceuticals, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids), and improvements in flock health and lighting programs. A detailed discussion of these improvements and innovations is not possible in the length limitations of this article; sufficient documentation of the results of these changes is available in both industry and academic literature sources."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Summary information for an average 4-house, tunnel-ventilated broiler unit built in 1999 is shown in Table 2 . Four 43-\u00d7 500-ft broiler houses completely equipped (feeders, waterers, ventilation, lighting, heating, brooders, and so on) costs $525,000 to construct. The houses and equipment are financed at 100% for 15 yr at 9% interest. An unencumbered 75 acres of land (80 acres less 5 acres with family housing) valued at $75,000 is assumed to be offered as collateral in support of the loan. The broiler houses are depreciated over 20 yr, and the original housing equipment is depreciated over 10 yr. Support equipment, which includes a portion of a tractor attributed to the broiler enterprise operation and necessary decaking equipment for between-flock litter removal, is allocated a cost of $35,000. The entire amount for the support equipment is financed for 7 yr at 9% interest and depreciated over 10 yr. Replacement equipment is installed after 10 yr at a cost of $48,000 and is financed for 7 yr at 9% interest and depreciated over 10 yr. The houses and all equipment are assumed to have a 10% salvage value for depreciation purposes. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method [7] .\nIn "}, {"section_title": "Future Perspective-The Analysis", "text": "Utilizing the primary data and information of the operation discussed in the foregoing section, projections of economic data for a new broiler operation for a 21-yr period for 2 labor scenarios (hired labor vs. unpaid family labor) are shown in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. Four analyses of the projected economic data are undertaken. One analysis includes estimates of annual gross revenues and expenses so that a grower's annual net farm income may be computed. A second analysis focuses on estimation of the annual cash flows of the grower. In a third analysis, returns to management and equity capital are estimated to show the economic returns to these specific resources. Finally, the net farm income ratio and term debt coverage ratio are estimated to evaluate the potential efficiency and repayment capacity of the business. Specific formulas for computing these economic measures are contained in footnotes to Tables 3, 4 , and 5. The gross revenue figures shown in Tables  3 and 4 were increased by 1.25% each year (as a result of historical increasing per pound contract payments) from the average base payment of $0.0465/lb. This increase of 1.25% per year was slightly under the historical annual average increase for the 16 complexes sampled. Additionally, these revenue figures do not reflect any increase in bird weight or bird density that may stem from improvements in genetics, feeds, pharmaceuticals, or other technology over the ensuing 21 yr. This analysis assumes a constant weight per bird for the 6 flocks per year, and no value is attributed to the litter. Traditionally, about $15 per ton fertilizer value has been attributed to litter. However, recent regulatory and legal developments in the production region for which this analysis was performed have prohibited, in many cases, the land application of litter to pasture and forage acreage, thus, the decision to allow no positive impact on grower revenues attributable to poultry litter. In several watersheds within the area of analysis, litter may still be used in its traditional manner. If the contract poultry producer has a cattle operation, approximately 700 tons of litter (the amount from the 4 poultry houses) with a value of $15.00 per ton spread on pastureland would result in a value of $10,500 per year to be credited to the total farm operation. If the producer does not have cattle, then the litter would be sold and would generate considerably less revenue, in the range of $6 to $8 per ton, for revenues of $4,200 to $5,600 per year.\nTotal expenses include interest, depreciation, labor, property tax, and other production costs. Labor costs increase by an average of 3.9% per year based on the historical increase in labor costs for the period 1990 to 1999 [10, 11] . Property taxes and others costs are not explicitly shown in Tables 3 and 4 ; however, they are used to estimate total expenses. Property taxes for the broiler houses are computed at rates that are common in the area. Income taxes are omitted from consideration since any assumed rate would be speculative and would depend upon other income that might be generated within the household. Other costs of $1,500 per house per flock include costs for litter, gas, electricity, repairs, and insurance. These costs increase by an average of 2.6% per year based on the historical increase in the cost of farm supplies Includes property taxes and other expenses in addition to interest, depreciation and labor expenses. Other expenses are $1,500 per broiler house per flock and increase at 2.6% per year. 4 Net farm income equals gross revenues minus total expenses before income taxes. 5 The allowance for the contribution of management (mgmt.) increases at 3.9% per year. 6 Opportunity cost of equity capital is the initial equity of $75,000 times the average 10-yr Treasury bill rate for 1990 to 1999 (7%), compounded annually. 7 Returns to management equals net farm income minus the allowance for unpaid labor and the opportunity cost of equity capital. 8 Return to equity capital equals net farm income minus the allowance for unpaid labor and allowance for unpaid management. 9 Net cash flow equals gross revenues plus off-farm income minus family living expenses, principal payments, interest expense, hired labor expense, property taxes and other expenses.\nOff-farm income is assumed to equal family living expenses.

Specific increases are not assumed for fuel prices separate from the increases indicated for total other costs, as conditions are rapidly changing due to political and economic forces worldwide. Net farm income before income taxes is gross revenue minus depreciation, interest expense, property taxes, other expenses, and hired labor. Net farm income before income taxes is interpreted as the return to the grower for unpaid labor, management, and equity capital [8] .\nIf hired labor is used on the farm operation, net farm income before income taxes starts out at $10,208 and slowly rises through the 10th year, averaging $24,015 per year (Table 3) [12]. A significant jump in net farm income occurs in the 11th year because the depreciation expenses for the original poultry equipment and support equipment are completed in the 10th year. Another significant jump in net farm income occurs in the 21st year. Again, the primary reason for the increase is depreciation. The houses and replacement equipment are fully depreciated in the 20th year. Similar changes in net farm income occur for the broiler farm when unpaid family labor is provided instead of hired labor (Table 4) . Net farm income is greater under this scenario, starting at $23,643 for the first year and averaging $40,045 for the first 10 yr.\nA net cash flow analysis is important to determine if the broiler farm with or without hired labor is financially feasible. Net cash flow is gross revenue plus off-farm income minus family living expenses, principal payments, interest expense, hired labor, property taxes, and other expenses. Both nominal (unadjusted for inflation) and real (adjusted for inflation) cash flows are shown for each scenario. Annual family living expenses are assumed to be offset by offfarm income. Results for the hired labor scenario in Table 3 indicate that net cash flow averages $28,749 for the first 15 yr. The primary changes to net cash flow over this period occur in the eighth year when net cash flow increases because the loan for the support equipment is paid off and in the 11th year when net cash flow decreases after the loan for replacement equipment is acquired. Net cash flow increases substantially in the 16th year after the house and original equipment debt is retired and again in the 18th year after the loan for replacement equipment is paid. To account for the effects of inflation over time, net cash flow is put in terms of current dollars by discounting projected cash flows by the average percentage change in the gross national product index for 1990 to 1999, an estimate of inflation. All other values in Table 3 are in nominal or unadjusted dollars.\nA similar net cash flow analysis of this operation with the contract grower providing all labor is shown in Table 4 . The contribution of labor by the grower is assumed to be the same as hired labor in Table 3 , although there is no cash outflow associated with the labor. The difference in net cash flow reported in Table 4 from that reported in Table 3 is attributable to the saving of hired labor. Since the projected net cash flows in Tables 3 and 4 are positive each year, the broiler farm is financially feasible with or without hired labor under the assumptions of this study.\nAlthough net farm incomes are estimated for the broiler farm with and without hired labor, they do not specifically identify the return to management and the return to equity capital; net farm income is the return to the grower for unpaid labor, management, and equity capital. In this analysis a management charge is used to reflect grower efforts in the production process so that this necessary function is not ignored in the return calculations. Additionally, the equity investment of $75,000 (land) assumed earlier is used to compute an opportunity cost of the equity as an allowance for this capital. It is possible, therefore, to calculate return to management and return to equity. Return to management is net farm income minus unpaid labor and the opportunity cost of equity capital. Return to equity is net farm income minus unpaid labor and management [13] .\nThe return to management is $4,958 in the first year and increases over the first 10 yr, averaging $12,468 per year (Table 3) . The return to equity is negative for the first 7 yr before turning positive, averaging ($8,011) per year over the first 10 yr. Because the opportunity cost of equity capital is less than the allowance for unpaid management, the return to management is greater than the return to equity. The significant changes in these returns over time are primarily the result of changes in depreciation expenses, as was the case for significant changes in net farm income.\nThe returns to management and the returns to equity capital are identical for the 2 scenarios, with hired labor and with unpaid family labor, presented in Tables 3 and 4 . The returns are identical because an allowance for the unpaid labor provided in the second scenario, equal to the amount of hired labor in the first scenario, is deducted from net farm income to adequately account for the contribution of this resource.\nOne additional level of analysis was performed to gain insight regarding the relative efficiency of broiler production and the ability of a grower to service their loan. Table 5 contains the results of this analysis for both scenarios (with and without hired labor). Regarding efficiency, the net farm income ratio in Table 5 is calculated as net farm income before income taxes divided by gross revenue [8] . The net farm income ratio measures how efficiently net farm income is generated from gross revenue. Net farm income ratios for the 2 scenarios are 0.07 and 0.16, 0.23 and 0.34, and 0.32 and 0.44 in yr 1, 10, and 11. The large increase in yr 11 is attributable to the reduction of depreciation expense associated with the initial equipment; a second large increase occurs in yr 21 once assets are fully depreciated.\nThe term debt coverage ratio (a sum of net cash flow and principal and interest payments divided by the sum of principal and interest payments) indicates the ability of the broiler grower to make payments to the lender each year. For example, a term debt coverage ratio of 1.40 indicates that the grower could experience an unexpected cash shortfall of 40% of principal and interest payments, and there would still be enough cash available to meet the payments. Up until 1999, the USDA, Farm Service Agency, had required a minimum term debt coverage ratio of 1.10 for loans receiving USDA guarantees. In 1999, the minimum ratio was lowered to 1.0. The term debt coverage ratio for operations with hired labor ranges from 1.34 to 1.39 over yr 1 to 7; for operations without hired labor, the ratio ranges from 1.53 to 1.63 for the same period. The ratio increases in yr 8 due to the payoff of the support equipment debt. After yr 15, when the house and original equipment debt"}]
