This has drawn the attention of both the emergency management and design communities to the design of these types of facilities. The lack of standards addressing the special considerations that must be implemented when designing essential facilities has resulted in the occupants of these facilities being exposed to unfavorable conditions during and after the hurricane event, and in some cases lives have been placed in jeopardy. Post-hurricane building performance assessments have been very beneficial for documenting the types of damage these facilities suffer. The damage sustained during Hurricane Georges, which struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast in September of 1998, was well documented by these building performance assessments. Some of the damage discovered by post-hurricane damage assessments will be described in the following paragraphs. Nearly 14,700 people in Mississippi chose to weather Hurricane Georges inside shelters. The structural soundness of many of these facilities was inadequate in many instances, causing danger to the occupants. After Georges ripped the roofs off two shelters, residents were required to move to new shelters. Strong winds tore the roof off the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College gymnasium in Gautier, MS, forcing approximately 400 residents to flee. Also, some buildings on the campus experienced interior damage due to rainwater entering the buildings through damaged roofs. In Pascagoula, an apparent tornado destroyed the roof of Trent Lott Middle School, where approximately 90 people were seeking shelter. Residents had no choice but to remain in the shelter, however (Rekenthaler, 1998;Kolker, 1998;FEMA, 1999a;Associated Press, 1998;CNN, 1998a). Also, the roof was \"twisted off\" of the Marathon High School cafeteria allowing water to flood the building (SRCC, 1998). Other critical facilities experienced significant damage from Hurricane Georges, putting the residents inside these facilities at risk. The roof of Singing River Hospital, a regional medical center in Pascagoula, MS, was severely damaged, causing patient rooms, delivery rooms, and other sectors to be evacuated. Residents of the Plaza Nursing Center in Pascagoula were required to be relocated after several inches of water flooded the facility due to openings in the building's flat roof. The residents were required to remain in the flooded building for hours until a facility was located that could handle the special needs of the 110 bedridden patients. The patients, along with their beds, medicines, and other necessary items, had to be transported to Spring River Hospital by ambulances and school buses (FEMA, 1999a;CNN, 1998b). The roofing systems of essential facilities also faired poorly during Hurricane Hugo, which struck South Carolina in September of 1989. The roofs of all twenty fire stations and all five police stations in the town of Charleston, SC suffered roof damage. Of the seventy school facilities, which are commonly used as hurricane shelters, forty-nine of them had roof damage (ASCE, 1990).\nPerformance-Based Design is a relatively new methodology that was developed initially for the design of structures in earthquake prone areas. The idea behind Performance-Based Design is to design a structure such that it meets a certain predetermined performance level when exposed to the \"design event.\" Also, some publications specify a certain performance level when the building is subjected to an \"ultimate event.\" The ultimate event is the maximum event that can reasonably be expected to be experienced by the building, whether it is an earthquake, a hurricane, or any other type of event. The performance level used for the design of a given structure is based on a number of factors, including the danger to individuals inside the building during the design event, the function of the facility, the importance of the structure to society as a whole, along with any other relevant considerations. By contrast, prescriptive design, which is the design approach used in most current codes and standards, deems a design to be acceptable as long as it meets certain criteria that have been shown to work in the past (Harris, 2002 andHamburger, 2002). One of the advantages of a performance-based design approach over a prescriptive design approach is that it more easily allows for the use of the latest technology and innovative products and methods in order to solve a design problem. It also allows for the design of structures using different desired performance levels based on the functional classification of the building, which results in a much more efficient and in many cases economical design. Much of the research that has been done related to performance-based design started with work aimed at reducing the damage to structures and the danger to loss of life during an earthquake event. Much of this research was performed through the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). The four agencies that receive funding through NEHRP are: the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS)."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "As shown by the previous examples, facilities designated as essential during hurricane events have experienced damage during recent hurricanes. One of the reasons for this is that, historically, essential facilities have not been designed specifically for hurricane impacts; rather existing buildings have been assessed for their ability to perform satisfactorily enough to meet the functionality requirements needed during the hurricane event. Also, until recently, there have not been design guidelines available that address the special planning and design considerations of a facility with a secondary function as an essential facility during a hurricane event. The design guidelines that are currently available result in a building designed to resist an ultimate (tornadic) wind event, which, in many cases, is not feasible for facilities to be used in hurricanes due to economic or other considerations. The current method of determining loads on a facility, whether it is an ordinary or an essential facility, is based on an acceptable probability of failure. For locations along the hurricane coast, the design wind speed is the wind speed corresponding to the 500 year Mean Recurrence Interval (MRI) divided by a factor of 1.225. This results in a MRI that varies depending on location, but is always in excess of 50 years. For an essential facility, the design wind speed is increased by the use of a 1.15 Importance Factor. Once the design loads have been determined, the building is designed using the governing building code. The design recommendations given in most building codes are based on a prescriptive design approach, which bases the design on a \"no damage\" approach when the facility is exposed to its design event (Harris, 2002 andHamburger, 2002). This type of design methodology is not adequate when designing facilities designated as essential during hurricane events because the special planning and design considerations specific to these types of facilities are not addressed using this method."}, {"section_title": "Goals and Objectives", "text": "A new approach to the design of facilities designated as essential during hurricane events is proposed. The overall goal of this thesis is to create a tool to help improve the safety and serviceability of hurricane evacuation shelters and other essential facilities utilized during hurricane events. This will be achieved by developing a more rational design philosophy appropriate for the design of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event. This new philosophy will entail defining a new design event, developing a set of performance standards, establishing a set of design criteria, and developing design guidelines to be utilized during the planning and design stages of one of these facilities. The specific objectives that will be addressed are: 1) Define a new design event. Instead of designing an essential facility based on a wind speed or flood event corresponding to a given MRI, it is proposed that these facilities be designed based upon a hurricane of a given strength (based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) chosen by the building owner. Considerations for selection of the design hurricane include shelter demand, the available budget, and other considerations deemed important. The associated loads for the design hurricane can then be determined and the building designed accordingly. Then, when a given hurricane is approaching, the building owner can identify which buildings have been designed to meet their intended function for the approaching hurricane and manage the emergency preparedness operations accordingly. 2) Develop a performance-based design approach appropriate for essential facilities. A set of performance standards will be developed by first identifying the different types of \"essential\" facilities and categorizing them according to their use before, during, and after the hurricane event. The required performance levels of each of these categories will then be established. For example, a hospital building does not need to perform to the same level as a building used to store emergency response and recovery equipment. This type of approach allows for the most efficient design. Also, the performance-based design approach allows for the use of the latest products in the design of the facility. These two concepts allow for the best, most up-to-date, and most efficient design of buildings designated as essential during a hurricane event. The performance standards will be developed through a detailed literature survey along with the results of a survey given to members of the emergency management community. 3) Develop appropriate design loads and load combinations consistent with objectives one and two. The specific topics that will be addressed are: a. Formulate a method for determining the design wind speed to use for the design of the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and the Components and Cladding (C&C). This will be based on the design hurricane event and distance inland. e. Determine the appropriate Importance Factor. f. Determine the appropriate rain load. g. Determine the appropriate load factors and load combinations to be used for design. 4) Provide guidance on appropriate debris loads and impact resistance. 5) Provide guidance on other special considerations that must be addressed when designing essential facilities, such as the flooding hazards associated with a hurricane event and mass care issues. 6) Compare design recommendations with current practice. This thesis presents a general methodology for the design of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event. Several aspects are geographically unique, including the filling rate, flooding issues, and rainfall issues. Specific recommendations for these factors will be made only for the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The same methodology could, however, be applied to any region of the country where the design wind speed is controlled by hurricane events."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Hurricane Event", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Life Cycle", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Formation", "text": "The hurricane is the same meteorological event as a severe tropical cyclone and a typhoon. The only real difference between these storms is the body of water over which they are formed. Most hurricanes are formed in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer, which are located 23 degrees, 27 minutes south and north of the equator, respectively (Pielke, Jr., et al., 1997). Many hurricanes begin in low-pressure regions of the atmosphere assembled with a group of thunderstorms."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Growth", "text": "Air has a tendency to move towards the center of the low-pressure region (and away from the high pressure). The rotation of the Earth tends to deflect the air such that it rotates around the low-pressure system counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. This is known as the Coriolis Effect. In order for the system to develop into a tropical storm or hurricane, Pielke, Jr., et al. (1997) gives several criteria that must be met: o The surface temperature of the ocean must be greater than approximately 79 o F so that ample moisture and heat can be supplied into the low-pressure system. This is needed to sustain thunderstorm development. o The vertical wind shear must be less than approximately 17 mph between the upper and lower troposphere (the region of the atmosphere that extends outward about 7 to 10 miles from the Earth's surface, where, generally, temperature decreases rapidly with altitude, clouds form, and convection is active). This keeps the developing thunderstorms over the low-pressure region. o The storm's position must be greater than approximately 5 o latitude from the equator. Near the equator, low and high-pressure systems tend not to rotate. o High-pressure must develop in the upper troposphere above the surface low. This high-pressure ensures that air is evacuated from the cyclone, allowing surface pressures to continue to drop. \u2022"}, {"section_title": "Stages of Life", "text": "The stages of life of a tropical cyclone, the term given to all circulating weather systems that form over water, are shown in Table 2.1.

Pielke Jr., et al. (1997) state that once a tropical cyclone has reached hurricane intensity it will not weaken unless: o The vertical wind shear grows too large. o The hurricane passes over land or relatively cold water, at which time the hurricane's source of heat and moisture is reduced. o Dry, cool air, which retards thunderstorm development, is transported into the hurricane. o The high-pressure in the upper troposphere is replaced by a cyclonic circulation, which, instead of evacuating air, adds air to the hurricane system.

It consists of a large vortex that can be hundreds of miles in diameter, with winds that spiral inward toward the eye at approximately 15 o -20 o , as shown in Figure 2.2. As the wind speed increases inside a hurricane, it becomes more difficult for the wind to reach the center of the storm. This happens because the centrifugal force (the force that tends to impel an object outward from the center of rotation) becomes too large as the stronger winds spiral towards the center of the storm (Pielke Jr., et al., 1997). This leads to the formation of an eye, as shown in Figure 2.1. A typical diameter of the eye of a mature hurricane is 20 miles, but can be much smaller or larger. A hurricane with a smaller eye is generally more intense than a hurricane with a larger eye. The winds are very calm inside the eye of a mature hurricane. The highest winds in a hurricane are found at the edge of the eye, called the eye wall. The winds generally diminish with increasing distance extending outward from the eye wall, except for the strong winds generally found in rain bands. The wind field of a typical hurricane is shown in Figure 2.2. The highest wind speeds relative to the ground are almost invariably found on the right side of a hurricane, relative to the direction of movement. This is due to the additive effect of the forward movement of the storm and the counterclockwise circulation of the wind."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Variation of Wind Speed with Height", "text": "In general, the wind speeds increase with height above the earth's surface. This is because obstructions (trees, buildings, waves, etc.) retard the movement of air close to the earth's surface, which causes a reduction of the wind speed. This is true over both land and water. At some height above the surface, the movement of air is no longer affected by  NOAA, 2002b) obstructions. This height, which is a function of the surface roughness, is called the gradient height. Above the gradient height, the wind speed is relatively constant. This unobstructed wind speed is called the gradient wind speed."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Variation of Wind Speed with Surface Roughness", "text": "The roughness of the surface the hurricane is passing over has an enormous effect on the wind speed. The rougher the surface, the more it retards the movement of air below the gradient height. Figure 2.3 shows how the wind speed in extratropical events differs with both height above the ground and surface roughness. Currently, hurricanes are assumed to have the same wind profile. Recent research, however, has shown that this might not be correct. Franklin, et al. (2000) showed that the unique wind structure of hurricanes may create a wind profile that is quite different from that of extratropical wind events. The researchers also determined that the wind profile of hurricane events may differ depending on the radial distance from the center of the storm. Using the results of dropsonde data from seventeen hurricanes from 1997 to 1999, the researchers established mean wind speed profiles for eyewall and outer vortex locations of hurricanes. The findings (normalized by the flight-level wind speed) are shown in Figure 2.4. \u2022"}, {"section_title": "Gustiness of the Wind", "text": "The flow of air is an inherently turbulent phenomenon. Wind speed can be thought of as having two components, the mean wind speed and the fluctuating component of wind speed. This fluctuating component is called turbulence, and is caused by two things, the convective movement of the air (meteorological turbulence) and the ground roughness (mechanical turbulence). The mechanical turbulence increases in rougher terrain and decreases with increasing height above the ground. It is assumed that above the gradient  (Franklin, et al., 2000) height the mechanical component can be neglected. Figure 2.5 shows the gustiness of hurricane winds. During extreme wind events, it is generally assumed that mechanical turbulence dominates. Figure 2.5 -Gustiness of the Wind (NWS, 1999) \u2022 Pressure Field Central pressure is a good measure of the intensity of a hurricane. In general, the lower the central pressure, the higher the wind speed of the hurricane. The average relation between wind speed and central pressure for Atlantic hurricanes is shown in Figure 2.6. Of course, this relationship does not hold true in all hurricanes; individual storms will vary from this relationship. For example, for two hurricanes with the same central pressure, a smaller storm will have higher winds than a large one because the horizontal pressure difference (which drives the winds) is more compact (Pielke, et al., 1997)."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Distribution", "text": "The lowest pressure is found in the eye of a hurricane and increases radially from the eye until atmospheric pressure is reached.

Four performance levels are defined: The definition of each of the performance levels is as follows (SEAOC, 1995): o Fully Operational -A performance level in which no damage has occurred. If a building responds to an earthquake within this performance level, the consequences to the building user community are negligible. The building remains safe to occupy and it is expected that post-earthquake damage inspectors utilizing the ATC-20 methodology (described in the following note) would post the building with a green placard. The building is occupiable and all equipment and services related to the building's basic occupancy and function are available for use. In general, repair is not required. o Operational -A performance level in which moderate damage to nonstructural elements and contents, and light damage to structural elements has occurred. The damage is limited and does not compromise the safety of the building for occupancy. Post-earthquake damage inspectors utilizing the ATC-20 methodology would be expected to post the building with a green placard. It would be available for occupancy for its normal intended function immediately following the earthquake, however, damage to some contents, utilities and nonstructural components may partially disrupt some normal functions. Back-up systems and procedures may be required to permit continued use. Repairs may be instituted at the owners' and tenants' convenience. o Life-safe -A performance level (damage state) in which moderate damage to structural and nonstructural elements and contents has occurred. The structure's lateral stiffness and ability to resist additional lateral loads has been reduced, possibly to a great extent, however, some margin against collapse remains. No major falling debris hazards have occurred. Egress from the building is not substantially impaired, albeit elevator and similar electrical and mechanical devices may not function. In the worst case, post-earthquake damage inspectors, using the ATC-20 methodology, would be expected to post such a building with a yellow placard. In such cases the building would not be available for immediate post-earthquake occupancy. The building would probably be repairable, although it may not be economically practical to do so. o Near Collapse -An extreme damage state in which the lateral and vertical load resistance of the building have been substantially compromised. Aftershocks could result in partial or total collapse of the structure. Debris hazards may have occurred and egress may be impaired, however, all significant vertical load carrying elements (beams, columns, slabs, etc.) continue to function. In the worst case, post-earthquake damage inspectors, using ATC-20 methodology, would be expected to post such a building with a red placard. The building will likely be unsafe for occupancy and repair may not be technically or economically feasible. * Note: ATC-20 (ATC, 1989) provides post-earthquake building investigators a set of procedures and guidelines to follow in order to make an \"on-the-spot\" determination of the suitability of occupancy and use of a building after an earthquake. A green placard designates the building as being safe to occupy. A yellow placard designates the building as being damaged and limits the occupancy and use of the building accordingly. A red placard designates the building as being unsafe to occupy and prohibits entry into the building. The Vision 2000 document uses three different building use classifications and four earthquake design levels. The definitions of use classifications follow and the earthquake design levels are shown in Table 2.4. o Safety Critical Facilities -Facilities which contain large quantities of hazardous materials, which would cause an unacceptable risk to the public if they were released. o Essential/Hazardous Facilities -Facilities that are critical to post-earthquake operations, including hospitals, police stations, fire stations, communications centers, emergency control centers and shelters for emergency response vehicles. o Basic Facilities -All buildings that do not fit into one of the other two categories.  FEMA 356 and 357 are the replacements to FEMA 273 and 274, which were also known as NEHRP Guidelines for Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings. FEMA 356 (FEMA, 2000b) defines building performance as \"\u2026the safety afforded building occupants during and after the event; the cost and feasibility of restoring the building to pre-earthquake condition; the length of time the building is removed from service to effect repairs; and economic, architectural, or historic impact on the larger community.\" The performance is a direct relationship to the damage sustained by the building in a design event. When designing a building using FEMA 356 as a guide, the first thing that has to be done is to decide upon a rehabilitation objective. In order to meet the rehabilitation objective, the building must perform to a certain level in an earthquake event. In order to determine the performance of the building in an earthquake, FEMA 356 separates building components into two categories, structural and nonstructural. A Target Building Performance Level, which corresponds to a combination of a Structural Performance Level and a Nonstructural Performance Level, is then decided upon. The Structural Performance Levels are:   o Hazardous Materials. Significant hazardous materials are released to the environment, with relocation needed beyond the local vicinity. 1.

This new design approach is called Consequence-Based Engineering and it is in some ways similar to the Performance-Based design approach, but applied at a systems level. The purpose of Consequence-Based Engineering is to \"provide engineers with a new framework for minimizing losses due to property damage, human life, and business interruption, that implicitly considers system-related losses when prescribing mitigation actions.\" In other words, this design approach looks at minimizing monetary loss to the building owner and all \"stakeholders\" from an earthquake or other natural hazard, considering not only the performance of the structure itself, but also the ability to continue with \"business as usual\" as soon as possible after the event with as little interruption as possible. In order to achieve this goal, four processes are outlined in order to define the possible consequences of a natural hazard and ways to reduce the impact of these consequences. These four processes are described below: The first step of the rapid assessment is to define the system of interest. Second, a rapid estimate of the consequences of the natural hazard is performed. Third, the acceptable consequences of the natural hazard are defined. The results of this are used to decide if the consequences of the natural hazard are such that a more detailed study needs to be performed and if major system changes are likely."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Decision Making", "text": "In the decision making process, it is determined if the consequences determined in the rapid assessment are acceptable and if not, what steps need to be taken to rectify the situation."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Damage Synthesis", "text": "The damage synthesis process is a detailed study performed using the latest research and knowledge of the natural hazard event and building performance, and the resulting impact on the system of interest.

Performance-based designs generally result in a more economical building design by allowing for the use of the latest technology, materials, and construction practices (Harris, 2002). Also, the performance-based design approach generally results in a more efficient design by allowing for different levels of damage depending on the relative importance of the building. Several precodes, codes, and standards have been written within the past few years that are committed solely to the performance-based design approach. The general concepts outlined in these documents are adapted to create a set of guidelines for the performance-based design of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event, as shown in Chapter 3.\nThe knowledge gained through research the past twenty or thirty years has greatly advanced the field of wind engineering. Much has been learned about the characteristics of high-wind events, particularly hurricanes. This knowledge has been reflected in each edition of ASCE 7, leading to much more efficient and safer structures, in general.

(1980) \nThe inland portion of basic wind speed map was produced from research performed by Peterka (1992). This research was intended to reduce the sampling error of 50 year wind speeds used in design due to the short data records of many of the sites. The assumption was made that the variation in the fifty year design wind speeds for small inland areas of the country with similar wind climates is due primarily to sampling error caused by short wind records and, in order to prove this assumption, an area in the Midwestern United States that exhibited an unexplained variation in the 50 year design wind speed was chosen for study. The area was composed of 29 weather stations with the same wind climate and exposure (all were located at airports). A wind map for the area enclosed by the 29 weather stations was then produced from the 924 years of data from the superstation along with 10,000 years of data produced by a random function generator with the same Type I distribution as the data from the superstation. The author concluded that the wind speed map produced by creating contours between each individual station was not correct due to sampling error. The author also concluded that combining similar wind stations into a \"superstation\" greatly reduced the sampling error and therefore gave a better representation of the actual 50 year design wind speed. It was suggested that applying this type of procedure over the entire interior region of the United States had the potential to greatly reduce the variability in the design wind speed due to sampling error. This \"superstation\" philosophy for getting inland design wind speeds was applied to the entire inland United States to produce the map for the design wind speed of that region."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Wind Speeds at the Hurricane Coast", "text": "Researchers recognized that a difference existed between extratropical and hurricane winds. At the time, however, the correct extreme probability distribution of hurricane winds was not yet known. The design wind speeds used in this edition of the Standard for the hurricane-prone regions of the United States were determined using research performed by Batts, et al. (1980). The Batts paper takes a great deal of information known about hurricane winds and applies it to produce a number of probabilistic models defining the various characteristics of a hurricane, including maximum gradient wind speed, wind speeds at 10 m above the ocean surface, storm decay, reduction of wind speeds due to friction over land, and dependence of wind speeds upon averaging times. They then broke the hurricane coastline into a number of \"mileposts,\" spaced at 100 nautical miles (approximately 115 statute miles), and ran a large number of Monte Carlo simulations (based on the assumed probabilistic models) to determine extreme wind speeds for the hurricane-prone coast of the United States. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo simulation it was found that the best probabilistic model for fitting 1-min hurricane winds was the Weibull distribution with tail length parameter (g) of 4, as opposed to an Extreme Value Type I distribution. Design fastest-mile wind speeds for the entire hurricane coast of the United States (defined as the region from the coastline to 200 km inland) were then proposed. An important note is that the storm decay was found to be very weak at milepost 650 (in the vicinity of New Orleans.) It was assumed that this was due in part to the configuration of the coastline. They suggest that the probabilistic models be refined to account for this.\nThe hurricane-prone region of the basic wind speed map was produced by synthesizing the data and models of Batts (1980), described in Section 2.2.2, Georgiou, et al. (1983), and Vickery and Twisdale (1995a). The intention of the Georgiou work was to improve the prediction of the design wind speeds for the hurricane-prone regions of the United States through the use of a new hurricane model. Design wind speeds for regions of the United States dominated by hurricanes are predicted by the use of simulation techniques. This is done because the small number of hurricane events and the relatively small landmass exposed to the effects of a hurricane event would result in extremely high sampling errors if wind records were used to determine design wind speeds. A \"Monte Carlo\" simulation is used, which entails using computer techniques to pass a large number of different hurricane events over the hurricane coastline to determine the wind speed corresponding to various return periods. This technique requires simulation of both the frequency characteristics and the wind field characteristics of hurricanes. Table   2.9 summarizes the assumptions that were made in the Georgiou, et al. (1983) model. Table 2.9 -Assumptions Made by Georgiou, et al. (1983)  . Also, the researchers pointed out that the rate of the rate of decrease of the gradient wind of a hurricane once it makes landfall is affected primarily by the CPD and not by the change in surface roughness, which mainly affects the surface wind. The results of research by Vickery and Twisdale (1995a) were also used in ASCE 7-95 to determine the design wind speeds for the hurricane coast of the United States. These researchers produced a new hurricane model, the intent of which was to make new predictions of hurricane wind speeds in coastal regions and in inland regions of the United States. The researchers chose a number of hurricane-prone locations and a series of Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the latest hurricane wind field and filling models. All of the necessary hurricane parameters used in the hurricane model were chosen based on the most recent data and these parameters were then input into an updated Monte Carlo hurricane simulation model. The wind field model was based on work done by Shapiro (1983) entitled \"The Asymmetric Boundary Layer Flow Under a Translating Hurricane.\" The filling model used was presented in a separate paper by Vickery and Twisdale (1995b), which also described the wind field. The 50-year and 100-year MRI wind speeds were found and compared to values obtained by previous researchers. The authors compared their results with those of Batts, et al. (1980), which were used in the previous versions of ASCE 7, and found that the Batts results tended to overestimate the hurricane wind speeds inland. Another important difference between the Vickery and Twisdale (1995a) results and the results obtained by Batts is the higher wind speeds along the coastline from New Orleans to the Florida panhandle that Vickery and Twisdale obtained. It was also found that as the MRI of the hurricane winds increased the difference between the Shapiro and Batts hurricane wind field models became larger, with the Shapiro model yielding higher wind speeds. Vickery and Twisdale also found that for an MRI of 50 to 100 years, the hurricane winds have almost no effect at distances greater than 100 km (62 miles) inland. They also suggest that if the MRI exceeds 100 years, however, the effects of the hurricane winds at distances greater than 100 km inland needs to be investigated, a factor that has been addressed since the publication of their paper."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Importance Factor", "text": "The Importance Factor is used to adjust the design wind speed depending upon the Mean Recurrence Interval (MRI) chosen for the building being designed.

The importance factor used at the hurricane coastline is higher than the one used inland. This is to account for the fact that a difference exists in the probability distributions of extratropical and hurricane winds.\nAs mentioned earlier, ASCE 7-95 only has one importance factor.

The main purpose of the researchers was \"to recommend a methodology and set of load factors and corresponding load definitions for use in the A58 Standard which would be appropriate for all types of building materials\". The basic idea was to get a uniform level of safety against failure for all loadings and building materials. A summary of the procedure used to determine the load factors and load combinations presented by Ellingwood follows: 1) An analysis of the level of safety achieved by the use of the existing standards and specifications was performed. 2) The reliability index (b) achieved by using the available design guides was investigated and a b value to be used was chosen. It was found that a b value of 2.5 was appropriate for use in load combinations involving wind load. The reliability index is defined as a measure of the probability of failure of a structure. 3) The appropriate load factors and load combinations using the desired reliability index (b) were determined. Fastest-mile wind speeds were used for the analysis. The wind speed was assumed to have a Type I extreme value distribution. The wind load used in the load combinations is the result of the 50 year MRI wind speed, which was based on data from seven sites: Baltimore, MD; Detroit, MI; St. Louis, MO; Austin, TX; Tucson, AZ; Rochester, NY; and Sacramento, CA. All of the sites were inland and were chosen because they \"span the range of data reported and provide broad geographical representation.\" None of the sites were exposed to hurricane winds. The load factor included a reduction factor of 0.85 to account for wind directionality effects, which accounts for \"the reduced probability that the maximum wind speed will occur in a direction most unfavorable to the response of (the) building.\" The results of the research were directly integrated into ASCE 7 and are shown in the next section.\nThe wind load factor in ASCE 7-95 was obtained from NBS SP 577 (Ellingwood, 1980), which was unchanged from the previous edition."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Load Combinations", "text": "Load combinations for strength design methods are listed below.

Peterka and Shahid (1998) presented a new design wind speed map for the entire United States, including both the coastal and extratropical regions, to be used in the 1998 edition of ASCE 7. The new map included the effects of the use of a 3-second averaging time (as was done in ASCE 7-95) and new wind speed records that had become available since the 1995 edition. The Vickery, et al. maps presented contours to be used along the hurricane prone areas of the coast. In the extratropical region, Peterka and Shahid used the superstation-type analysis used in the 1995 edition, which combined stations with similar winds to form \"superstations.\" This had the effect of decreasing the sampling error and gave a more accurate design wind speed. This procedure was performed on extratropical 3-second gust data from 487 stations assuming a Type I extreme value distribution. In the hurricane region, the design wind speeds presented by Peterka and Shahid (1998) were updated to account for the hurricane importance factor and were based on Monte Carlo simulations that used the statistical parameters of hurricanes assumed in Batts, et al. (1980), Georgiou, et al. (1983), and Twisdale (1995a and1995b). Peterka and Shahid (1998) used the assumptions inherent in each of these papers to establish a set of contours that most closely matched the results of previous work. For the inland speed of hurricane winds, a compromise was made between the work done by Batts, et al. (1980), which was slow to reduce hurricane winds inland, and the work done by Twisdale (1995a and1995b), which reduced inland hurricane winds more rapidly. The hurricane region of the basic wind speed map in ASCE 7-98 was also updated based on research by Vickery, et al. (2000a and2000b). The authors used the latest data on hurricane winds to produce the best models for the predication of hurricane winds. Maps were given in Vickery, et al. (2000b) containing wind speeds corresponding to MRIs of 50, 100, and 500 years for the hurricane-prone regions of the United States. Peterka and Shahid (1998) used different curves to adjust the wind speed to the 3second averaging time wind speed. For the extratropical regions of the United States, they used the Durst curve. For the hurricane region, however, research by Krayer and Marshall showed that hurricane winds are gustier than extratropical winds. This was accounted for by Peterka and Shahid when converting the averaging times for the hurricane regions. The Krayer-Marshall curve was also used by Vickery, et al. (2000b) for adjusting hurricane winds for different averaging times. ASCE 7-98, however, suggests that the Durst curve be used for both extratropical and hurricane regions. This appears to be a contradiction between some of the data ASCE 7-98 used in making their maps and the recommendations that are made in the standard."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Wind Directionality Factor", "text": "All previous versions of the ASCE 7 standard included a reduction factor of 0.85 in the wind load factor to account for the reduced probability of the worst wind coming from the worst direction.

The only situation in which they are different, however, is for structures designed using an MRI of 25 years. Although the importance factors for the hurricane and non-hurricane regions are different, their use in their respective regions will result in approximately the same level of risk. The difference stems from the fact that, while the same type of probability distribution of wind speeds corresponding to long MRI events can be assumed to be the same for both the hurricane and extratropical regions, the same can not be said for wind speeds corresponding to a 25 year MRI."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Load Factors", "text": "The load factors, with the sole exception being the earthquake load factor, were all derived from NBS SP 577 (Ellingwood, 1980), which was discussed previously. There is a good discussion of NBS SP 577 in Galambos, et al. (1982) and in Ellingwood, et al. (1982). Although derived from NBS SP 577, the wind load factor used in ASCE 7-98 is not the same as the one suggested by that publication. It was increased from 1.3 to 1.6, for the following reasons: o The wind directionality factor of 0.85 discussed in Ellingwood (1981) and in NBS SP 577 (Ellingwood, 1980) has been removed from the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the wind load factor and has been added to the wind load portion of ASCE 7-98 to allow for the latest knowledge of how different structures react differently to wind. This change increased the wind load factor from 1.3 to approximately 1.53. o The value of 1.3 computed in NBS SP 577 (Ellingwood, 1980) for the wind load factor and used in all previous editions of ASCE 7 did not account for hurricane winds; all of the data used to arrive at the load factor was from extratropical regions (Ellingwood, 1981). There is a good discussion on the wind load factor in the hurricane region in Ellingwood and Tekie (1999). Ellingwood and Tekie pointed out the deficiencies of using the 1.3 load factor used in all previous versions of ASCE 7 and points out the following issues of contention about the 1.3 load factor: 1. The use of a reliability index of 2.5 for load combinations involving wind load as compared to 3.0 for load combinations involving only gravity loads is called into question. It is questioned if this gives a lower level of reliability when wind load governs the design. Ellingwood and Tekie (1999) also concluded the following: o The wind load variability is higher for hurricane-prone regions. o For the load case where wind load controls the design (with no account for directionality) the wind load factor should be between 1.5 and 1.6 to achieve the same reliability as the load case where live load controls the design. o For buildings within 10 km of the coastline, it appears that the wind load factor should be between 1.6 and 1.7. This is due to the increased coefficient of variation of hurricane winds as compared to extratropical winds. An interesting note on page 246 of ASCE 7-98 says: \"Of the uncertainties affecting the wind load factor, the variability in wind speed has the strongest influence (Ellingwood and Tekie, 1999), such that changes in the coefficient in variation in all other factors by 25% gives less than a 5% change in load factor.\" \u2022 Load Combinations The main changes in the load combinations were the increase of the wind load factor from 1.3 to 1.6 as shown in the following equations, and changes in the flood load combinations.

The primary changes are to the Exposure Categories and in the definition of debris impact resistant glazing. Specifically, Exposure Category A was completely eliminated and the definition of Exposure Categories B and C were modified. Also, in order for an opening component to be deemed \"debris impact resistant\" ASCE 7-02 requires that the component meet the requirements of ASTM E 1886 and ASTM 1996 (ASTM, 2001;ASTM, 1997). A new load combination was also added. The new load combination is 0.9D + 1.0E + 1.6H, which only affects buildings subject to earthquakes. Simiu (1995) provided an overview of the current knowledge about high-speed wind events. Simiu pointed out that, due to the complex nature of wind, the current state of practice when determining wind load factors to be used in design is to use traditional values that have worked in the past, a practice commonly referred to as \"calibration against current practice.\" Due to advances in the understanding and modeling of wind events, Simiu stated that it is now questionable if the traditional values are conservative enough, especially for hurricane events. A few key points were addressed by Simiu concerning the calculation of wind loads due to extreme wind events, including the effects of turbulence and wind directionality. Also, a number of different methods used to determine wind loads resulting from extreme wind speeds were discussed. Simiu made a very interesting comment, that if nominal loads (50 year MRI) are of concern, the type of probability distribution used makes little difference (less than 5%), but if the extreme loads or load factors are of concern, the use of the incorrect distribution can have a large effect on the results obtained. Simiu suggests that extreme wind speeds may be best fit by a reverse Weibull distribution due to the fact that the reverse Weibull has a finite upper tail, just as wind speeds do.  again stated that the reverse Weibull distribution is best for extreme wind speeds in both the hurricane and non-hurricane regions, but the type of distribution used for nominal wind loads makes little difference. Also, the researchers stated that the use of the wind directionality factor of 0.85 for structures with long MRI may be unconservative. The researchers also stated that using the wind speed map given in ASCE 7-93 for the hurricane regions of the United States can lead to inconsistent MRIs when compared to the MRI obtained using the map for extratropical regions.  also addressed the wind load factor. The wind load factor used in ASCE 7 was determined from results obtained from extratropical regions. The researchers determined that the use of the same load factor for the hurricane regions of the United States is questionable. Even with the use of the \"hurricane importance factor\", which was included in the basic wind speed map of ASCE 7, the MRI of the ultimate wind load (wind load causing collapse) in the hurricane-prone regions of the United States are much shorter than the ultimate wind load for the extratropical regions.  used the \"peaks over threshold\" approach for estimating extreme winds specifically hurricane winds, taking wind directionality effects into account."}, {"section_title": "Additional Recent Research on Hurricane Wind Speed, Distributions, and Load Factors", "text": "They found that for wind events with very large MRI the effects of directionality need to be considered, or the design may not be conservative enough. They also found that for a structure designed using ASCE 7-95; the MRI of the design wind speed for hurricane regions was much lower than the MRI of the design wind speed in extratropical regions, which they suggest may play a role in the large losses incurred during hurricane events. One of the things Rigato, et al. (2001) addressed was the inadequacy of using the 0.85 wind directionality factor proposed by ASCE 7-98 for many buildings located in hurricane prone regions. For wind events with long MRIs (on the order of 500 years or more) the use of the 0.85 wind directionality factor recommended by ASCE 7-98 underestimates the wind load on the structure. A value of 0.95 is recommended until more research can be done. Whalen and Simiu (1998) suggested that the wind load factor used in ASCE 7-95 results in structures in the hurricane-prone region being placed at a higher risk than those in the extratropical region and that for this reason, the wind load factor for buildings in the hurricane regions of the United States should be increased. They also suggested that the reverse Weibull extreme value distribution is best when modeling extreme winds, instead of the Type I distribution. Wind directionality effects were not taken into account in this paper. Heckert, et al. (1998) addressed the apparent increase in the level of risk of a building along the hurricane coast when subjected to the design wind speed using ASCE 7-95 as compared to a building located in the extratropical regions of the country. They used a reverse Weibull (finite upper tail) distribution in order to model extreme winds, as was used in ASCE 7-95. In order to determine the wind speed corresponding to a given MRI, the researchers broke the United States into a number of \"Mileposts\" spaced at 100 nautical mile intervals, and the tail length parameter, c, and the mean hourly wind speed, Xr, was determined for MRIs of 25, 50,100, 1000, and 2000 years. From their research, the authors stated that the risk level for buildings located in hurricane-prone regions and extratropical regions of the country are inconsistent when designed using the wind speed map in ASCE 7-95. More specifically, buildings located in the hurricane-prone region are placed at a higher level of risk. It was determined that the MRI of the ultimate wind speed for buildings along the hurricane coast designed using ASCE 7-95 would be on the order 500 years, while the MRI of the ultimate wind speed for a building in the extra-tropical regions would be two orders of magnitude greater. It was suggested that the load factor in ASCE 7-95 be increased to account for this difference. No recommendation was given; however, as to what the amount the load factor should be increased. Kriebel, et al. (1997) performed a reliability study using the latest information on hurricane characteristics. It was found that in order to achieve a reliability index of approximately 2.5, as is done in NBS SP 577, the load factor on hurricane winds is required to equal 1.8. Minciarelli, et al. (2001) pointed out the fact that the safety indices for wind loads are currently not the same as those for dead and live loads in load combinations. One of the things the researchers attempted to do was determine the required wind load factor in order for wind loads to have the same safety indices as dead and live loads. Also, the increased uncertainty for hurricane winds as opposed to extratropical winds is not taken into account in ASCE 7-98. This paper determined the required wind load factor accounting for knowledge uncertainties. They found that, without consideration for wind directionality factors, the correct wind load factor for hurricane winds should be approximately 2.15."}, {"section_title": "Inland Decay of Hurricane Wind Speeds", "text": "For areas along the Gulf Coast and the hurricane-prone regions of the Atlantic Coast of the United States, the design wind speeds are based on winds produced by hurricane events. An inspection of ASCE 7-02 will show that the design wind speed for coastal regions is a maximum at the coastline and decreases with distance inland from the coast, until the hurricane winds are no longer strong enough to affect the design wind speed. The wind speeds associated with a hurricane decrease once the hurricane strikes the coast. This is due to: o Once the hurricane makes landfall, the source of its energy (the warm, moist waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean) is cut off. o The increased friction over the land as compared to the open water causes the wind speed to be reduced. The rate of decay of hurricane winds once the storm makes landfall has been a topic of much interest and research over the years. A discussion of the state of the practice of predicting the rate of decay of a hurricane once it makes landfall follows. One of the first papers to address the filling of hurricanes over land was Malkin (1959). He provided reduction factors for reducing the maximum winds of a hurricane after landfall, based on time since landfall. The data from thirteen storms was analyzed in order to determine the reduction factors. The maximum wind speeds were assumed to decrease in direct proportion to the square root of the average pressure depth of the thirteen storms studied. Two sets of reduction factors were given. One set reduced the winds based on a change in the pressure depth (p n -p o ) and the other reduced the winds based on change in , where p o = central pressure (mb), p n = pressure at periphery (mb), and D n = average distance from the pressure center to the point where p n is observed (degrees latitude). Two sets of reduction factors were presented because it was noticed that the wind speeds of some storms seemed to decrease in direct proportion to the change in the pressure depth, while others seemed to decrease in direct proportion to the change in the pressure gradient. The two sets of reduction factors are shown in Table 2.10 o Generally, the lower the central pressure, at landfall or after landfall, the higher the corresponding rate of filling, and vice versa. o A higher ratio of water to land in the underlying surface helps maintain the strength of a hurricane. The reduction of the peak gust wind speeds of a hurricane after landfall for three hurricane events since Malkin's study was given in Goldman, et al. (1974).   Goldman, et al. (1974) In summary, Goldman's research determined the reduction factor for the peak gust wind speed of a hurricane event after landfall to be approximately 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70 for locations 50, 100, and 150 km inland, respectively. As shown in Figures 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10, the values for the reduction factors agree somewhat with Malkin's reduction factors. It is pointed out, however, that there are large local differences, which are not accounted for by Malkin's factor, and which should be accounted for in the future. Goldman also pointed out that the wind speed in Hurricane Celia, which struck Corpus Christi Bay, actually increased once the hurricane made landfall. This is assumed to have occurred due to the added time over water because the hurricane entered the coastline at the bay, along with the impact the warm, shallow water had on feeding the hurricane. Schwerdt, et al. (1979) also addressed the filling of a hurricane once it makes landfall. The researchers broke the United States into three separate regions and developed a different formula for decreasing the sustained wind speeds due to filling as a hurricane moves inland. For the Gulf Coast region (Region A), the following equation was given for calculating the reduction factor of the hurricane wind speeds. Note that the formula depends on the time since landfall only, and does not account for the size of the hurricane or the forward speed of the hurricane. where W = overland wind speed at some specified time after landfall (friction effects not considered); W = the overwater wind speed at landfall; and t = time, in hours. A graph of the results of this formula is shown in Figure 2.11. It is important to note that this equation does not address the effect of surface friction on the filling of hurricane winds. Also, the reduction factor presented was for sustained winds, not peak gust wind speeds, as was the case in Malkin (1959).  Schwerdt, et al. (1979) Another publication that addressed the filling rate of hurricane winds is Batts, et al. (1980). When determining the rate of decay of a hurricane once it makes landfall, the researchers assumed the decay of the hurricane was a function of the decrease in the difference between the pressure at the center and the outer edge of the hurricane. (i.e., the difference between the pressure at the outer edge of the storm and at the center of the storm decreases once the storm makes landfall). The relationship was assumed to be: where t = travel time in hours (t at landfall = 0); ) (t p \u2206 and max p \u2206 in inches of Hg; and \u03c6 = angle between the track of the hurricane and the coast (from 0 to 180 degrees). Also noted in Batts, et al. (1980) Oct., 1978Oct., , pp. 1585Oct., -1595 assumed the following relationship between the 10-minute mean wind speed of overland and overwater winds at a height of 10 meters: where the values of the reduction factor (p) and the roughness coefficient ( ) were assumed to be 0.83 and 0.005 m respectively, yielding a reduction factor of 0.79. Batts, et al. (1980) eventually selected a conservative value of 0.85 as the reduction factor between the 10-minute mean wind speed of overland and overwater (at a height of 10 m). This value was conservatively taken to be greater than the value obtained using the preceding equation, due to the fact that the similarity relationships used to formulate that equation were for geostrophic winds, which do not represent the winds in a hurricane.  Figure 2.13. It was found that the results obtained using their decay model differed from those obtained by Malkin (1959) by only approximately 2%. Also, it was found that hurricanes decayed very slowly as they moved inland at milepost 650 (the New Orleans area). It was suggested that this may be due to the large bodies of water near the coastline and that future research needs to be performed on these types of locations. The wind speeds corresponding to various mean recurrence intervals calculated using the model presented in Georgiou, et al. (1983) were given for the entire Gulf Coast and part of the Atlantic Coast. These results are shown in Figure 2.14 along with comparisons with the results obtained by Batts, et al. (1980 Georgiou, et al. (1983) Research by Ho, et al. (1987) also addressed the rate of fill of hurricanes, but did not give a suggestion as to how the filling of hurricane winds affects the wind speed. This paper divided the coastline of the United States into three regions; Region A (the Gulf Coast), Region B (the Florida peninsula), and Region C (the Atlantic Coast) and gives a rate of fill, which is based on the pressure deficit at landfall, for time since landfall. It is important to note that the regions are similar to those used by Schwerdt, et al. (1979), but are not identical. Only the findings for Region A (the Gulf Coast) will be discussed here, as this is the only region covered by this thesis. The filling rate for Region A as the hurricane moves inland is shown in Table 2.11 for various initial (land falling) central pressure deficits. A new hurricane wind model and wind filling model was defined in Vickery and Twisdale (1995b). The wind field model is based on work done by Shapiro (1983). Three different wind filling models were used based on the region of the coast; Gulf Coast, Florida peninsula, and Atlantic Coast subject to hurricanes. The filling model used takes into account the fact that more intense hurricanes fill more rapidly than weak hurricanes. The basic form of the model is: where is the central pressure difference at landfall; t is the time since landfall in hours and the filling constant (a) is equal to: where and are filling rate constants that vary depending on the region of the country and e is a normally distributed error term with a mean of zero. The variation of the filling constant (a) versus the central pressure difference at landfall is shown in Figure 2.15. An interesting thing to note is that, for the Gulf Coast region, the filling model best matched the observed data if a two hour delay was incorporated into the model.  1995Vickery and Twisdale's results were compared to storm data and the results of other wind field and filling models. Their results were found to be slightly conservative for the Gulf Coast, while the Batts, et al. (1980) model was very conservative and that the conservatism increased with distance inland. They noted that the design wind speed (50 year MRI) appears to be influenced by hurricane events as far as 200 km (124 miles) inland using the Batts model, while their model limits the influence of hurricanes on the design wind speed to approximately 100 km (62 miles) inland. Kaplan and DeMaria (1995) developed a model to calculate the maximum sustained 1-minute surface wind speed (MSSW) of a hurricane, based on distance inland, as it moves inland, where, for the Gulf Coast region, V(t) = maximum sustained 1-minute surface wind speed (MSSW, in knots 1 ), V = background wind speed = 26.7 Kt, R = a reduction factor to account for the rapid decrease in wind speed as soon as the hurricane makes landfall = 0.9, V = maximum 1-minute sustained wind speed just before landfall, a = a decay constant = 0.095  "}, {"section_title": "Windborne Debris", "text": "Debris impact is a very important design consideration for any structure that is designed to resist a hurricane event. Many types of objects, including gravel, 2\" x 4\" wooden members, and sheets of plywood can be picked up and carried by hurricane-force winds. The consequences of impact of these types of objects to the building envelope can be quite extreme. If a building envelope component is not designed to resist the penetration of windborne debris, the debris and/or the building component(s) that are carried with it, can severely injure anyone inside the building. It is also possible for debris penetration to lead to a complete collapse of a structure. If the building envelope on the windward face of a structure is breached, positive internal pressurization will result, which increases the uplift on the roof and the negative pressure on the leeward wall of the building. Also, a breach in the building envelope allows wind and water to enter the structure, causing damage to the building interior and contents. There are documented cases where the monetary damage to contents due to wind and rain entering the building have exceeded the value of the structure, while the building itself experienced little damage. This is often the case for an office building that has a large number of its windows broken by flying roof gravel."}, {"section_title": "Windborne Debris and Flight Characteristics", "text": "The debris generated by high-wind events can be classified into three primary categories: (1) Lightweight -roof gravel, etc; (2) Medium weight -timber plank, etc; and 3Heavyweight -utility poles, automobiles, etc (McDonald and Bailey, 1985). The most important missile parameters relative to impact of a building component are the types of missiles anticipated, the speed of the missile, and the length the missile travels. There has been a great deal of research performed to determine the flight characteristics of windborne debris. Much of this research has focused on windborne debris generated by tornados, but there has recently been more research performed on windborne debris generated by hurricanes. Research was performed by Lee and Wills (2002) on three different types of objects (compact objects representative of roof gravel, rod-like objects representative of 2\" x 4\" timber planks, and sheet materials representative of plywood sheeting) in order to determine their theoretical flight characteristics in hurricane events. Their findings are shown in the following Tables. Also, Lee and Wills (2002) determined the minimum wind speed at which an 8' long 2\" x 4\" wooden member would be lifted off of the ground to be approximately 70 mph. It was not clear what the averaging time of the wind speed discussed in both of these papers was. A paper by Wills, et al. (2002) also has information on the flight characteristics of wind borne debris. Table 2.12 gives the formulas given by Wills, et al. (2002) for the threshold of flight for various shaped objects.

In discussion with Holmes, it was determined that the averaging time of the wind speed is not a peak gust wind speed, but rather a sustained wind speed on the order of one to ten minutes.  Minor, et al. (1978). Minor suggested a 12' long 2\" x 4\" wooden member traveling at \u00bd of the design wind speed of the building be used for testing the impact resistance of building envelope components.

(2001) and Lee and Wills (2002) made this same suggestion."}, {"section_title": "Debris Impact Resistance", "text": "Much research has been performed on the impact resistance of materials most commonly used in residential and commercial construction to determine the protection afforded occupants of a building subjected to flying debris generated in a high-wind event. The stud wall results won't be discussed herein because they are not commonly found in commercial or industrial buildings, which is the focus of this thesis. Hollow 8\" unreinforced masonry walls were found to be perforated by 2\" x 4\" wooden missiles traveling at only 65 mph. Also, the back of the 8\" CMU broke into many large pieces (some of them weighting as much as 2 lb), which could be a deadly threat to people on the other side of the wall. This lead the researchers to the conclusion that unreinforced masonry walls were not proficient at stopping the typical missile found in a high wind event. When all of the cells of the 8\" CMU were grouted and reinforced with #4 rebar the wall became essentially impervious to the effects of the missile. At test speeds of up to 130 mph the missile was destroyed when it struck the wall, but the wall was not damaged. Also, 12\" CMU walls were tested, with results very similar to the 8\" wall, leading the researchers to make the following conclusions: o All cells must be grouted and reinforced to stop the missile at high speeds. If the missile hits an unreinforced cell, the wall will be penetrated. o The use of grout only will stop the missile, but the wall will experience a great deal of cracking. o The use of horizontal reinforcement has no impact resistance benefit. o The shape of the nose of the missile had little effect. o A missile impacting the wall at 45 o tends to glance off the wall without causing damage. Concrete panels were also tested by McDonald (1992) to determine their impact resistance. It was found that an unreinforced 4\" thick concrete wall panel is able to resist penetration from a 15 lb 2\"x4\" wooden member traveling at speeds exceeding 130 mph, but it will experience a great deal of cracking. Placing #4 rebar at 12\" on center spacing each direction prevented the cracking. The use of thicker wall panels and higher impact speeds caused the missile to be destroyed. Glazing is vulnerable to debris impact not only from large debris such as 2\" x 4\" wooden missiles, but also to small missiles, such as roof gravel. Research has shown that the three most common types of glass (annealed, heat strengthened, and fully tempered) are all vulnerable to impact from small missiles (Minor, et al., 1978, Minor, 1994. The most common type of small missile found in high-wind events is roof gravel with a weight of between 0.5 g and 5.0 grams (Minor, 1994). There are many products available, including laminated glass and various types of shutters systems, which increase the debris impact resistance of glass openings."}, {"section_title": "Debris Impact Criteria of Various Codes and Standards", "text": "Debris impact resistance is an important consideration when designing for hurricanes. There are a number of different codes and standards that have established criteria for building envelope components to be deemed \"debris impact resistant.\" \u2022 To be deemed acceptable, after the required testing, there must be no tears longer than 5\" or any openings that a 3\" diameter sphere can pass. o For all heights, components on a building located in Wind Zone 1 and Wind Zone 2 must withstand impact from a 9.0 lb, 8 ft. long wooden member with 2\" x 4\" nominal dimensions traveling at 50 ft/s. o Components less than 30' high on a building located in Wind Zone 3 must withstand impact from a 9.0 lb, 8 ft. long wooden member with 2\" x 4\" nominal dimensions traveling at 80 ft/s. The current rate of rainfall used by many building codes for the design of a building is the 1-hour, 100-year Mean Recurrence Interval (MRI) rainfall rate. This is the rate of rain that falls in one hour that has a 1/100 chance of being exceeded each year. This rainfall rate was determined using rainfall associated with extratropical rain events. Research into rainfall rates of past tropical events and extratropical events appears to indicate that design rainfall rates associated with hurricane events has not been proven to be statistically different from that of extratropical events (Schoner and Molansky, 1956;Hershfield, 1961;NOAA, 1977;Grymes, 2002;and Faiers, et al., 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Rain Load", "text": "The most common method of calculating rain load on the roof of a building is the method given in ASCE 7-02. The ASCE 7-02 method of determining the Rain Load is outlined in the following equation: where: o R = rain load on the undeflected roof, in lb/ft 2 . The phrase \"undeflected roof\" means that the deflections from loads (including dead load) are not considered when determining the amount of rain on the roof. i.e., this load does not take into account the effects of ponding. The structure must be designed such that ponding does not occur. o d s = depth of water on the undeflected roof up to the inlet of the secondary drainage system when the primary drainage system is blocked (i.e., the static head), in inches. The static head is simply the distance to the secondary drainage system. For example, if the secondary drains are 2\" from the roof surface, d s = 2\". o d h = additional depth of water on the undeflected roof above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow (i.e., the hydraulic head), in inches. The hydraulic head is a function of a number of factors; the rainfall intensity used for design, the area of roof each drain is assumed to empty, and the type and area of the drainage system used. For example, for a given size drain, the hydraulic head will increase as the rainfall intensity and/or the area the drain empties increases.\nFrom conversations with the state climatologist of Louisiana, Mr. Jay Grymes, along with research into rainfall rates of past tropical events (Keim, 2002), it was determined that the design rainfall rate associated with a hurricane event is not significantly different from that of a severe extratropical event and is not correlated with Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Category. Therefore, it is suggested that the rainfall rate used in the International Building Code (ICC, 2000), which is a one-hour, 100 year MRI event, be used for design purposes of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event. Also, the recommendations made by the International Building Code in terms of the guidelines to follow when designing the primary and secondary drainage systems are followed. Special attention must be paid to the drainage system utilized for flat or nearly flat roofs to ensure that if the primary drainage system becomes inoperable, either from debris or any other means, that the secondary drainage system is sufficient to handle the design rain event so that the rain load the roof experiences does not exceed the design rain load.\nNo change is suggested in the rain load. No research has been found showing a difference in maximum hurricane and extratropical rainfall rates used for design purposes, therefore no change is suggested at this time.

Two such publications were produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and are entitled \"Taking Shelter From the Storm: Building a Safe Room Inside Your House,\" also known as FEMA 320 (FEMA, 1999c) and \"Design and Construction Guidance for Community Shelters,\" also known as FEMA 361 (FEMA, 2000a). As the names suggest, FEMA 320 provides a set of guidelines for the design of small shelters to be constructed within a single-family residence, while FEMA 361 provides a set of guidelines for the design of a community shelter to be used to protect a large number of people. Although both of these publications address hurricane and tornado events, the main focus is the design of tornado shelters. Some of the important guidelines and recommendations given by these publications are given in the following paragraphs."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Wind Speed", "text": "The design wind speed used in both publications is selected to provide the occupants of the shelter \"near-absolute protection from death and injury.\" This means that no matter the magnitude of the wind event, the occupants of the shelter are deemed to be safe. This gives individuals a place to go for any wind event, but results in a very expensive design. The wind speed used for design by both publications, though applicable to hurricane wind events, is controlled primarily by the wind speeds generated by tornadoes. This level of protection is mandated for a tornado shelter because the wind speed associated with a tornado can change very rapidly, and if someone is going to seek shelter in the structure, it is imperative that the structure remains standing if the tornado intensifies. See Figure 2.17 for the design wind speed used by these publications. For a hurricane shelter, however, the wind speed to be anticipated at the shelter location for a given hurricane event can be predicted ahead of time. This enables the designer to design a structure for any given hurricane intensity. When a hurricane is approaching, a decision can be made as to the suitability of a structure to be used as a hurricane shelter based on the hurricane intensity used during the design process. \u2022 Debris Impact Along with being able to withstand the high winds associated with an extreme wind event, all components of a structure also have to be able to resist penetration by flying debris. For a residential shelter, this is the case that will most likely control the design of the shelter due to the small wall area. For a community shelter, however, the large wall areas cause higher wind pressures, which usually controls design. For large and small shelters, the loads Figure 2.17 -Wind Speed Map Used in FEMA 361 and FEMA 320, from FEMA (1999c) produced by both the design wind speed and the debris impact loading must be investigated and designed and the structure designed accordingly. FEMA gives the following criteria for debris impact resistance: o The test member must be able to withstand the impact from a 15-lb wood 2\"x4\" (nominal) member, typically 12' long, traveling at 100 mph for horizontally traveling missiles and 67 mph for vertically traveling missiles and striking the test specimen at a 90 o angle. o All components of the shelter (walls, roof, doors, windows, etc.) must be able to withstand the above criteria. Several recommendations are given as to the best way to ensure that each component is sufficient."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Additional Considerations", "text": "Along with the design wind speed and debris impact, there are a number of other considerations that must be taken into account. Some of these include: o Is the shelter in an area that is susceptible to flooding? If so, the shelter must be designed accordingly. If possible, the shelter should be moved outside of the flood area. o Is the shelter in a seismically active area? If so, the building must be designed accordingly."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Human Factors", "text": "It is important that due consideration is given to the fact that individuals will be sheltering inside the facility during a high wind event. FEMA 320 (FEMA, 1999c), suggests that a minimum of 10 ft 2 per person be provided in a residential shelter. FEMA 361 (FEMA, 2000a) suggests that 20 ft 2 per person be provided for a length of stay of only a few days, but if the length of stay is anticipated to be longer, that 40 ft 2 per person be provided in a community shelter. Also, the local building code should be checked to ensure that all of its requirements are met. In 1999, as part of the state of Florida Statewide Emergency Shelter Plan, the state of Florida produced a set of design criteria that were required to be met when designing an educational facility entitled \"Public Shelter Design Criteria\" (Florida Dept. of Education, 1999). The purpose of the guidelines was to decrease the shelter deficit of the state by designing all educational facilities that were being built such that they could be used as shelters in the event of a hurricane event. Some of the recommendations of the publication are given in the following bullet list: o The entire structure is to be designed using ASCE 7-93 (ASCE, 1993) as a minimum. o It was suggested that the portion of the structure to be used as a shelter be designed using a wind speed of 40 mph greater than that given by ASCE 7-93, with an Importance Factor (I) of 1.0. o All building envelope components were required to resist penetration from flying debris. In 2002, Lee County, Florida produced their own set of hurricane shelter guidelines, entitled \"Lee County Emergency Shelter Guidelines and Criteria\" (Lee County, FL, 2002). Relevant structural design considerations of this publication are: o ASCE 7 procedures are to be used with a design wind speed of 150 mph peak gust. o Importance Factor (I) of 1.0 is to be used for design. In 2001, the state of Florida also produced a new building code (SBCCI, 2001) with assistance from the SBCCI that was intended to improve the performance of structures that are subjected to hurricane strikes. Different guidelines were given depending on location from the coast and many other considerations. This was also done by the state of Texas. In 1998, Texas adopted the \"Building Code for Windstorm Resistant Construction\" (TDI, 1998). Two sets of guidelines were given depending on if the structure was located inward or seaward of an imaginary line dividing the hurricane coastal area an inland areas. A least risk decision making process is then used to determine the suitability of the building for use as a hurricane shelter based on how well the building meets the previously mentioned topics."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Hurricane Shelters", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: FORMULATION OF DESIGN GUIDELINES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Historically, buildings, including facilities designated as essential in a hurricane event, have been designed using a probabilistic approach. Buildings designed using this approach have a certain probability against failure when subjected to the anticipated loads. The acceptable probability of failure is based on a great deal of research along with input from the general public on the acceptable probability of structural collapse. For buildings located in hurricane prone regions, the wind speed used for design is the wind speed corresponding to a 500 year Mean Recurrence Interval (MRI) divided by a factor of 1.225. For a facility designated as essential, the wind speed is increased by an Importance Factor of 1.15 to increase the MRI. After all of the anticipated loads have been determined, the loads are combined in the appropriate load combinations to get the overall loads on each component of the structure. Once the loads to be used for design have been determined, all components of the building are designed. Currently, almost all building codes are based on a prescriptive design approach, which results in a \"no damage\" design when the facility is subjected to the design event (Harris, 2002 andHamburger, 2002). Another option available for designing facilities designated as essential in a hurricane event is to use a publication produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) entitled Design and Construction Guidance for Community Shelters, otherwise known as FEMA 361. The wind speed presented in this publication is an \"extreme\" wind speed with a very small chance of ever being exceeded, i.e., a very long MRI, on the order of 2,000 to 10,000 years, depending on location. This gives shelter inhabitants \"near absolute\" protection from any wind event, but results in a very expensive building. There are also other publications that address the design of hurricane shelters (FEMA, 2000c;FEMA, 1999c;FEMA and Texas Tech, 1999;NSSA, 2001). All of these publications, however, produce an \"ultimate event\" design as well. There have recently been guidelines produced outlining procedures to be used when designing hurricane shelters in the state of Florida. In 1999, the state began requiring that any new educational facilities have an area designated to be used as a hurricane shelter. It was highly recommended by the 1999 \"State Requirements for Educational Facilities\" (Florida Department of Education, 1999) that the wind speed used for design of these facilities be the wind speed from the ASCE 7 map plus 40 mph. Recently, Lee County in Florida produced a hurricane shelter design guideline (Lee County, 2002) specifying a design wind speed of 150 mph peak gust for hurricane shelters. This thesis proposes a totally different approach for the design of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event. When designing a new essential facility, the building owner can select the hurricane strength to be used as the design event for a given facility based on the shelter demand, the available budget, and any other relevant considerations. The associated loads for the design hurricane event can then be determined and the building designed accordingly. Then, when a hurricane is approaching, the building owner will have a much clearer understanding of the strength of the building relative to the strength of the approaching hurricane, and manage the emergency preparedness operations accordingly. For a given hurricane approaching the coast, the approximate wind speed is known. The MRI of the wind speed associated with the approaching hurricane is of little concern to emergency managers. The hurricane is coming and the probability associated with the winds of that hurricane event does not matter. The only thing that matters is that the building performs up to the desired design objective when exposed to the hurricane about to strike. Since there are several types of essential facilities, which are required to perform different functions before, during, and after a hurricane event, all facilities designated as essential need not perform to the same level for a given hurricane event. For example, a building used to store equipment for emergencies during the hurricane does not need to perform to the same level as a hospital that is required to be fully operational during and after the hurricane event. In order to produce the most economical design for each of the building use classifications, a different design approach from the \"no damage\" approach used by most building codes is required. A performance-based design approach is proposed for facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event. Each type of essential facility is assigned a required performance level, and the building is then designed to meet these performance requirements. This type of approach allows for the most efficient building design. The use of the building before, during, and after the hurricane, as well as the building owner's desired design hurricane event, can be taken into account in the planning and design of the structure. Also, the performance-based design approach allows for the use of the latest products in the design of the building. These two aspects of the performance-based design approach make it ideal for the design of essential facilities because it allows for the best, most cutting-edge, and most efficient structural design. This thesis will provide structural engineers and architects a document to use as a reference when building a structure designated as an essential facility during a hurricane event using the previously-mentioned design philosophy."}, {"section_title": "Performance Criteria for Essential Facilities", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Types of Essential Facilities", "text": "Five different categories of essential facilities have been identified for use during hurricane events, as shown in Table 3.1.

Appendix A). The first page of the survey described the five different facility categories. The second page was intended to obtain information about the people filling out the survey. It included a section for the survey participant to give his/her profession, experience with sheltering, and Parish/City. Each of the next seven pages was devoted to the seven topics to be decided upon (six building systems and overall life safety). Definitions were given for building components considered to be a part of the primary structural system and the building envelope. The various damage levels for each system were given along with a table for the survey participant to select what he/she believes to be the appropriate damage level for each of the five facility classifications. Also provided on each sheet was a place for any additional notes that the survey participant felt a desire to provide. The survey was given to two different sets of individuals. The survey was first given to a group of people who attended a Shelter Assessment Training Workshop in St. Tammany Parish that was given by Dr. Marc Levitan of the LSU Hurricane Center on June 27, 2002. Twelve individuals took part in the survey. Most of the respondents were from the emergency management community, but many had little or no experience with sheltering. There were also four people from the engineering and architecture community, as well as a building official. The survey was given out again on July 2, 2002 to twenty-four individuals that attended the Southeastern Louisiana Hurricane Task Force meeting at Lafreniere Park in Metairie. Again, almost all of the survey participants were employed in emergency management, but the respondents of this survey had much more experience in shelter management and selection. Also taking part in the survey were a police officer, two people in the medical profession, and two Red Cross workers. In both instances, a brief overview of the reasoning behind the survey was given. Also, assistance was given to any individuals with questions about the survey. Respondents were given approximately thirty minutes to complete the survey. It is important to realize that this is an initial survey. There was no research performed on survey format in order to achieve the best answers. Also, the sample size was small. It can also be expected that there will be a degree of bias from the survey participants due to the high storm surge associated with hurricane events in coastal Louisiana (where the participants were from)."}, {"section_title": "Survey Results", "text": "The results of the survey are shown in Table 3.3.

The overall results matched closely with anticipated results and also matched closely, in most instances, to the damage levels believed to be acceptable by the author. As mentioned earlier, the second audience was more experienced in hurricane shelter management and selection, which lead to slightly less scatter in the responses. One set of results from the first survey issuance had to be discarded because it appeared that the respondent was confused. The greatest amount of scatter was found in the responses to the \"Danger to Life Safety\" category. A few people seemed to be confused, as indicated by the results, although the overall results follow closely with the results of other categories. A definite trend can be seen in the results. The allowed level of damage decreases as the intended function of the facility becomes more critical. As anticipated, the results obtained for the Function Critical facilities suggested almost no damage would be accepted to any of the building components/systems. Also, the threat to loss of life for an individual inside of a Function Critical facility was very low. The performance of building envelope components (windows/doors and roof and wall systems) was quite important to survey respondents, due perhaps to the perceived danger to building occupants and the consequences of envelope failure. The required performance of the mechanical systems (electrical/lighting, HVAC equipment, and plumbing systems) dropped off quickly, however, as the facility classification became less critical. In order to have another method to view the results of the survey, a numerical average was computed for each building component/ system for each essential facility classification. Each damage level was assigned a numerical value, with the damage level corresponding to the most damage being assigned a number (3) and the damage level corresponding to the least damage being assigned a number (0), as shown in Table 3.4. The number in the box represents the average value of the response for each building component/ system for each essential facility classification. The recommended performance levels to be used for the design of facilities in each of the essential facility classifications were determined primarily by using the results of the surveys that were distributed to members of the emergency management community. Engineering judgment was used in some instances. Also, the performance levels suggested by existing Performance-based design standards (SEAOC, 1995;FEMA, 2000b;ICC, 2001) for facilities similar to the types discussed in this thesis were taken into account when choosing the recommended performance level. In most instances, the recommended performance level corresponded to the results of the survey. This was especially the case for the Function Critical and Base of Operations categories. There were particular instances, however, where the recommendations deviated from the results of the survey. In these instances, engineering judgment was used to determine the recommended performance level. These cases will be addressed in the following paragraphs.  Although the mode for the allowed damage to the Roof and Wall Systems category matched the damage level recommended (\"None to Very Light\") for the Base of Operations for Response category, the average was closer to \"Light.\" The \"None to Very Light\" damage level was recommended because it was determined that the amount of damage associated with the \"Light\" damage level (water entering the building through small holes) may keep the building from being able to meet its intended function. Also, the recommendation made by this thesis and the survey result were different for Roof and Wall Systems for the Refuge of Last Resort category and the Emergency Equipment/ Supplies Storage Facility. Although the survey results deemed the appropriate damage level to be \"Light,\" it is the recommended by this thesis that the \"Moderate\" damage level by used. An investigation of the averages for these two categories will reveal that they are almost one-half-point higher than the Hurricane Shelter category. It is the feeling of this author that there needs to be some type of difference between the performance of the Refuge and the Hurricane Shelter categories, therefore the \"Moderate\" damage level was chosen for design. The \"Danger to Life Safety\" category produced conflicting results for many essential facility categories. This was the case for the Hurricane Shelter. Although the mode and recommendation were different, the average of the responses was closer to the recommendation made by this thesis. Due to this fact along with the fact that the Moderate level was deemed to be more appropriate for a Hurricane Shelter, the Moderate level was chosen for design. Also, the recommended danger level was higher than the survey results for the Refuge of Last Resort category. The recommended danger was chosen to be High, while the survey results determined it to be Moderate. The average of the Refuge category, however, was over one-half-point higher than the Hurricane Shelter category. For this reason, the High danger level was chosen. It is believed that the Emergency Management community would prefer a performance that can not feasibly be provided given economical and other considerations. The recommendations made for the HVAC category for the Refuge of Last Resort and the Emergency Equipment/ Supplies Storage categories were higher than that suggested by the survey results. The higher damage level (Severe) was chosen because it was determined that there is no need for the HVAC to be operational for either of these facility classifications. This is also the case for the Plumbing Systems for the Refuge of Last Resort. The Severe damage level was chosen even though the survey results suggested Moderate. It is the feeling of the author that the Emergency Managers desire more than can be provided economically and feasibly for the Refuge of Last Resort category. It is important to realize that the recommendations given in this thesis are intended to be a minimum Performance Criteria and special cases may require that the recommendations be modified to fit the specific needs of a given facility. Also, the primary function of the facility being designed may require that more stringent performance criteria be implemented. No recommendations are given as to how to meet the required performance levels suggested for the various building components. The design methodologies presented in current building codes can be used for the design of components with a damage level of \"None\" or \"None to Very Light\" using the recommended analysis procedures outlined by this thesis. For the other damage levels, more research needs to be performed to determine how the performance levels would be achieved. There has been much research along these lines performed by the Earthquake Engineering community. There are a number of reasons for using hurricane of specific intensity as the design events. This design methodology allows for facilities to be designed based on the needs of the building owner. For example, if it is determined that there exists a need for the facility to be designed to resist the impact of a Category 4 hurricane, then it can be designed accordingly. If it is determined that the building only needs to be designed to resist a Category 3 hurricane, however, this can also be accomplished. This design methodology also makes the decisions about which facilities are to be utilized during a hurricane event much easier. Since the maximum wind speed of a specific hurricane can be estimated from the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale assigned to the storm, a decision can be made as the hurricane is approaching as to whether or not to use the facility."}, {"section_title": "Determination of Hurricane Wind Loads", "text": "Another consideration that should go into the choice of the hurricane category used for design is the probability of occurrence (MRI) associated with a hurricane of a given intensity for the facility location. The number of years between hurricane strikes for various locations along the hurricane coastline of the United States is shown in Figure 3.1. Boxes (a) and (b) in Figure 3.1 are comparable to the MRI associated with a Category 1-3 and a Category 4-5 hurricane, respectively.  (Simpson and Riehl, 1981) "}, {"section_title": "Wind Speeds at the Coastline", "text": "The wind speeds given in the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale are maximum sustained wind speeds (1-minute averaging time). To design a facility using the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale as the basis for the design wind speed, the wind speed given in the table must be converted into a peak gust wind speed. The conversion of sustained wind speed to gust speed is shown in Table 3.6. Also shown is the wind speed reduction due to the hurricane passing over land. The \"Over Land\" wind speed is the wind speed to use for design purposes. If a building owner determines that the building is to be designed for a Saffir-Simpson Category 3 hurricane, the wind speed at the coastline to use for design would be 156 mph, as taken from Table 3.6. "}, {"section_title": "Reduction of Hurricane Wind Speeds Inland", "text": "The winds associated with a hurricane event decrease as the hurricane makes landfall and moves inland. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the hurricane loses its source of energy; the warm, moist waters of the body of water the hurricane is traveling over. Second, the increased surface friction of the land as compared to the water causes the surface level wind speed to be decreased. The first determination that must be made when estimating the amount the winds of a hurricane will decrease once the hurricane makes landfall is the location of the coastline. Due to the fact that the hurricane may cause extensive flooding and/or tidal surge, the coastline should not be assumed to be the coastline observed from an aerial photograph or map. Because much of the usual coastline could be covered with water from storm surge, the hurricane will continue receiving energy from the water. Also, the surface friction of the land once it is covered with water is not as high as if it was dry, which means the hurricane winds do not decrease as fast. The coastline should be the location of the maximum extent of storm surge flooding during the design hurricane event. One way this can be determined is from a SLOSH model (NWS, 2001). The SLOSH Model (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) is a mathematical model that was developed by the National Weather Service to calculate potential surge heights from hurricanes. From the SLOSH model, the location where the land is determined to no longer be underwater is the new \"coastline.\" This results in the coastline being farther inland for a severe storm than for a minimal hurricane. The shortest distance from the new coastline to the building location is now the distance \"inland\" that the building is located. Once the \"coastline\" has been determined, the correct rate of decay model for the hurricane winds must be determined. There have been a number of papers that address this issue, as discussed in the literature review. A comparison of these is shown in Figure 3.2. It is important to realize that these papers dealt with different wind speed averaging times. Some papers adjusted the peak wind speed, while others adjusted the sustained winds. It is assumed in this thesis that the gust factor (the ratio of peak gust wind speed to the mean wind speed) does not vary with distance inland.  It is important to realize that the adjustment factors presented in Figure 3.2 are to be used only for the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The adjustment factors that were suggested for use by Malkin (1959) were presented previously in this thesis in Table 2.10. The Schwerdt (1979) suggested adjustment factors were also presented previously in Figure   2.11. As presented earlier, Ho, et al. (1987) did not present wind speed adjustment factors, but suggested values to use for the change in hurricane pressure deficits due to overland filling once the hurricane makes landfall, which was shown in Table 2.11 of this thesis. In order to determine a wind speed adjustment factor using the data presented by Ho, it was assumed that the wind speed decreased with the square root of the of the pressure deficit at a specified time over the pressure deficit at landfall, as was assumed by Schwerdt (1979). The resulting wind speed adjustment factors using this assumption are shown in Table 3.7. The wind speed adjustment factor presented in Figure 3.2 as suggested by Kaplan and DeMaria (1995) is the same as the one discussed in Section 2.4 of this thesis. The Kaplan and DeMaria model contains a 0.9 reduction factor at landfall to account for the effect of the increased surface roughness of the land as compared to the open water, where the maximum winds are measured. This effect is accounted for by using the \"Maximum Gust Speed Over Land\" column of Table 3.5 as the input to the model. Therefore, the 0.9 adjustment factor was removed from the Kaplan and DeMaria model plotted in Figure 3.2. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, most publications produce similar results for the adjustment factor of wind speeds of a hurricane once it makes landfall. The Kaplan and DeMaria model, in general, reduces the wind speed the fastest, while Malkin's model, based on pressure depth change once the hurricane makes landfall, produces the slowest rate of wind speed decay. The most beneficial way to present the appropriate decay of hurricane winds for facilities designated as essential during hurricane events is not with time since landfall, but with distance inland. In order to do this, a reasonable maximum forward speed for the design hurricane must be determined. This was done by analyzing the maximum forward speed used by other publications. The forward speed used by the SLOSH model (NWS, 2001)  average, forward speeds in the Gulf Coast are slightly less than for other regions Keim and Grymes, 2002). Therefore, a forward speed of 15 mph is used in this thesis for the determination of the decrease in hurricane wind speeds along the Gulf Coast after landfall. The resulting adjustment factor for the decay models shown in Figure 3.2 based on distance inland and using a forward speed of 15 mph is presented in Figure 3.3. Also in Figure 3.3, the reductions in wind speed suggested by the publications presented in Figure 3.2 will be compared to the wind speed map given in ASCE 7-02 (ASCE, 2002) in two locations, the Texas-Louisiana border and the Louisiana-Mississippi border. The wind speed map in ASCE 7-02 at the Louisiana-Texas coast has a wind speed at the  It is the suggestion of the author of this thesis that the rate of decay used for design follow relatively closely with the decay rate presented in ASCE 7-02, which represents the current state of practice. It is suggested that the wind speed reduction using the data from Ho, et al. (1987) with a forward speed of 15 mph be used for design. This publication follows the contours presented by ASCE 7-02 rather closely and allows for the use of different wind speed adjustment factors depending on the intensity of the hurricane. The curve for hurricanes with a pressure deficit of up to 85 mb should be used for all hurricanes up to a Saffir-Simpson Category 3, the 100 mb curve should be used for Category 4 hurricanes, and the 110 mb curve should be used for Category 5 storms. Although the decay rate presented by Ho does not vary with the size or the forward speed of the hurricane, for a forward speed of 15 mph, the model appears match closely with ASCE 7-02. Also, it should be pointed out that this decay rate did not account for the effect of increased surface friction once the hurricane makes landfall. The effect of friction on reducing the wind speed was accounted for, however, in the wind speed used at the coast. Also, until further research has been performed, it is suggested that the design wind speed used for any facility designated as essential during a hurricane event be no less than that given in ASCE 7-02."}, {"section_title": "Directionality Factor", "text": "The purpose of the directionality factor applied to the design wind speed of a given building is to account for the reduced probability of the worst wind coming from the worst direction. The directionality factor suggested by ASCE 7-02 for both the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and the Components and Cladding (C&C) of regularly shaped buildings is 0.85. There has been research performed over the last few years, however, which suggests that, for buildings subjected to hurricane events, a higher directionality factor should be used. The origin of the directionality factor used in ASCE 7-02 goes back to research done by Ellingwood (1980). All of the data used in this research was for extratropical regions of the United States. None of the sites were subject to hurricane winds. The results of the research determined that the correct directionality factor to be used for design was 0.85. This factor was included in the wind load factor in all versions of ASCE 7 before ASCE 7-98. In ASCE 7-98 the directionality factor was moved outside of the wind load factor such that the varying behavior of different types of buildings and structures could be taken into account. The value of 0.85 was given for the MWFRS and the C&C of regularly shaped buildings. Since that time, however, research has been performed that determined this value may not be conservative enough for buildings subjected to wind events corresponding to long MRIs, such as hurricane events.  and  determined that for wind events corresponding to long MRIs the use of 0.85 for the directionality factor resulted in a design that was unconservative. It was suggested by  that this might be one of the reasons such severe damage is done by hurricane events. Rigato, et al. (2001) also determined that, for wind speeds corresponding to long MRIs, the use of 0.85 for the directionality factor results in a design that is \"only marginally conservative.\" Using the results of many computer simulations of typical rectangular steelframed buildings, the researchers suggested that a directionality factor of 0.95 be used for the design of buildings subjected to wind speeds corresponding to long MRIs. FEMA 361 and NSSA (2001) suggest the use of a wind directionality factor of 1.0 for the design of structures using their publications due to the highly variable winds of a tornado or hurricane event. Since buildings designed using this publication are generally not designed for 50 year MRI wind speeds, but rather wind speeds corresponding to much longer MRIs, it is suggested that a wind directionality factor of 0.95 be used for the design of buildings designated as essential during a hurricane event following the recommendation of Rigato, et al. (2001). The value of 1.0 suggested by FEMA 361 and NSSA (2001) was not used because those publications are intended mainly for the design of tornado shelters. The winds of a tornado change direction much more rapidly than those of a hurricane, and therefore the probability of the worst winds corresponding with the worst building orientation are greater for a tornado than for a hurricane.\nThe Directionality Factor (K d ) is recommended to be set at 0.95, as opposed to a value of 0.85 used in ASCE 7-02 (ASCE, 2002). This is because research has shown that a value of 0.85 may not be conservative enough for long MRI events, such as hurricanes. See Section 3.3.2 of this thesis for a discussion of the Directionality Factor."}, {"section_title": "Site Exposure", "text": "The correct site exposure to use for the design of a facility designated as essential during a hurricane event is questioned. The site exposure categories were greatly changed in ASCE 7-02 as compared to previous versions of ASCE 7. The new definitions of the site exposures are defined in the following bullet list. o Exposure A, which was the site exposure used for large city centers with many tall buildings in previous versions of ASCE 7, was done away with in ASCE 7-02. The authors concluded that the extreme variability of the wind around large buildings disallowed the use of this exposure. o Exposure B is to be used in areas where Surface Roughness B is prevalent in the upwind direction for at least 2630 feet or 10 times the height of the building, whichever is greater, unless the mean roof height of the building is thirty feet or less, in which case Surface Roughness B must prevail in the upwind direction for only 1500 feet. Surface Roughness B is defined as urban and suburban areas, wooded areas, and other locations with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single family dwellings or larger. o Exposure C is to be used when Exposures B and D can not be applied. o Exposure D is to be used where Surface Roughness D prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 5000 feet, or 10 times the height of the building, whichever is greater. Surface Roughness D is defined as flat, unobstructed areas and water surfaces outside of hurricane prone regions. This corresponds to salt flats, smooth mud flats, and open bodies of water that are not located in hurricane regions. ASCE 7-02 states that if a building is located in a transition zone between two Site Exposure classifications that the Exposure classification causing the greatest wind loads is to be used for the design of the building, unless a rational method presented in recognized literature is used to determine the correct Exposure. One possible method of interpolating between Exposures is given in the commentary of ASCE 7-02. When designing a building along the hurricane coast, the possible Exposure Classifications are Exposure B and C (unless an interpolation is performed.) If it is determined that the Exposure for a facility designated as essential during a hurricane event is Exposure B, then the designer needs to consider if it will be Exposure B during the design hurricane event. For buildings nominally in Exposure B, if the design wind speed at the building site is high, what is the likelihood that the surrounding buildings or trees will be destroyed or removed by the hurricane winds? Would the destruction of these buildings or trees result in the surrounding Exposure changing from B to C? An example of the type of damage experienced during Hurricane Andrew is shown in Figure 3  Publications that address the design of hurricane shelters suggest that no matter the location of the building, the building be designed using Exposure C (FEMA, 2000a;NSSA, 2001). These publications, however, result in an \"ultimate\" design, which means that the building is designed to resist the forces of almost any wind event, even tornados. This design methodology results in extremely high design wind speeds, which it can be assumed will destroy most buildings and trees, therefore the building should be classified as being located in an open area. For the design of a building based on a hurricane of a certain intensity, the choice of the Exposure classification to use for design becomes a bit more complicated. For a building nominally located in Exposure B, it would be conservative to use Exposure C for design, but in many cases this would result in an overly designed and overly expensive building. For example, a building located near the coastline designed using a strong Category 3 hurricane as the design event may be subjected to Exposure B winds because it is not likely that a hurricane of this intensity would destroy all of the surrounding buildings. However, if the same building were designed using a Category 5 hurricane as the design event, Exposure C may be more appropriate to use since a hurricane of this intensity is more likely to destroy many of the surrounding facilities. The decision of which Exposure classification to use should be made using sound engineering judgment, based on a number of factors including: the intensity of the design wind speed at the building location; density, size, and type of construction of the surrounding buildings; and any other considerations the engineer feels need to be addressed. For example, consider a building located in the lower portion of each of Figures 3.5 and 3.6. Both figures are examples of Exposure B terrain (ASCE, 2002). In Figure 3.5, the substantial nature of the surrounding buildings makes it likely that although they may experience significant damage, the buildings themselves will still be standing even after a Category 4 or 5 hurricane. In contrast, many of the homes and trees that create the Exposure B classification in Figure 3.6 may be destroyed in an extreme hurricane, changing the exposure from B to C. \nFor a building nominally located in Exposure B, it is suggested that the use of this site exposure for the design of essential hurricane facilities be carefully considered. The extreme wind speeds associated with a hurricane event have the potential of destroying surrounding buildings or removing trees, which could change the Exposure classification of the building during the design hurricane event to Exposure C. The decision as to whether or not change the exposure is based on the wind speed at the building site, not the wind speed at the coastline. See Section 3.3.3 for a discussion of the Site Exposure."}, {"section_title": "Enclosure Classification", "text": "The purpose of the Internal Pressure Coefficient (GC pi ) in ASCE 7 is to account for loads on a building due to differences between internal pressure and atmospheric pressure. ASCE 7-02 (ASCE, 2002) defines three internal pressure coefficients, which depend on the enclosure classification of the building, as shown in Table 3.8. The plus and minus signs in Table 3.8 signify pressures acting towards and away from the internal surface, respectively. Both cases must be investigated to determine which case produces the greatest load on a given member. The definitions of the three enclosure o Partially Enclosed Buildings: In order for a building to be deemed partially enclosed, both of the following conditions must be met: 1. The total area of openings in a wall that receives positive external pressure exceeds the sum of the areas of openings in the balance of the building envelope (walls and roof) by more than 10%. 2. The total area of openings in a wall that receives positive external pressure exceeds 4 ft 2 or 1% of the area of that wall, whichever is smaller, and the percentage of openings in the balance of the building envelope des not exceed 20%. o Enclosed Building: A building that does not comply with the requirements for open or partially enclosed buildings. For buildings located in the hurricane-prone regions, ASCE 7-02 requires that unless openings in a building have debris impact resistant coverings, the building must be designed as being partially enclosed. ASCE 7-02 defines impact resistant glazing as glazing that \"has been shown by testing in accordance with ASTM E 1886 (ASTM, 1997) and ASTM E 1996(ASTM, 2001 or other approved test methods to withstand the impact of wind borne missiles likely to be generated in wind borne debris regions during design winds.\" Any building designed using this thesis will be located in a wind borne debris region, which is defined by ASCE 7-02 as areas within hurricane prone regions located: 1) within one mile of the coast mean high water line where the basic wind speed is equal to or greater than 110 mph and in Hawaii, or 2) in areas where the basic wind speed is equal to or greater than 120 mph. This requirement is specified to account for the likelihood of a building envelope component being breached by flying debris in a hurricane event. Publications that address the design of hurricane shelters, FEMA 361 (FEMA, 2000a) and NSSA (2001), suggest that a building to be used as a community shelter or other essential function be designed as being Partially Enclosed, even if the building envelope openings are debris impact resistant. This provides the building with an added level of safety against failure should the envelope become breached by flying debris. Given the importance of preventing penetration of the building by wind, debris, and rain, this thesis suggests requiring debris impact resistant openings. The simultaneous use of the Partially Enclosed building classification is also suggested for the proposed method. The use of the Partially Enclosed classification provides an additional factor of safety against failure if the building envelope is breached. As will be discussed later in this thesis, the current debris impact testing requirements are not currently adequate for extreme design wind speeds. It is the opinion of the author that more stringent debris impact requirements are needed for a facility designated as essential during a hurricane with extreme design wind speeds.\nThe enclosure classification recommended for design is Partially Enclosed. This results in an Internal Pressure Coefficient (GC pi ) of +/-0.55. This value is recommended for design, even if the building has debris impact resistant coverings, because the uncertainty that the coverings will provide full protection, and the consequences associated with a breach in the envelope, are severe. See Section 3.3.4 of this thesis for a discussion on Enclosure Classification.\n\"Either/Or\" provisions -either provide debris impact protection or design for full internal pressurization \"And\" provisions -provide debris impact protection and design for full internal pressurization"}, {"section_title": "Importance Factor", "text": "The Importance Factor in ASCE 7-02 (ASCE, 2002) is used to adjust the design wind speed of a building based upon the relative danger to life safety resulting from a collapse of the building.

Due to the fact that a design wind speed is chosen when using this publication, an Importance Factor of 1.0 should be used for design.

Higher wind load factors are required to achieve the desired reliability against failure for buildings located on the hurricane coast. This is particularly the case for hurricane winds speeds corresponding to long MRI events, i.e., a Category 4 or 5 hurricane. A summary of the suggestions made by various researchers is shown in Table 3.9.  Ellingwood and Tekie (1999) 1.5-1.6 1.6-1.7 L.F. to achieve same reliability against failure due to wind loads as gravity loads. L.F. for buildings located within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the coast. Kriebel (1997) 1.8 L.F. to achieve same reliability as NBS 577 provided for gravity loads. Minciarelli (2001 The use of a higher wind load factor than the 1.6 provided for in ASCE 7-02 is suggested. There have recently been a number of publications that make the same recommendation, which were outlined in the literature review and summarized in Table 3.9. From a thorough investigation of the assumptions used in the papers, the results of the research, and the conclusions and recommendations made, the recommended load factor to use for the design of facilities designated as essential in a hurricane event was determined to be 1.8. The reasoning behind the use of this value follows. The wind load factor used in all ASCE standards until the release of ASCE 7-98 was based on research performed by Ellingwood (1980), which determined that the correct wind load factor was 1.3. This factor included a 0.85 reduction factor to account for wind directionality effects, or the reduced probability of the worst winds coming from the most unfavorable direction for the building. Also, this wind load factor did not differentiate between extratropical and hurricane winds. All wind data used in the research was from extratropical wind events. In ASCE 7-98, the wind load factor was increased from 1.3 to 1.6. There are a couple of reasons for this. For one thing, the wind directionality factor of 0.85 used in Ellingwood (1980) was taken out to allow for the use of different wind directionality factors depending on the building geometry. This change alone increased the wind load factor from 1.3 to 1.53. Also, the wind load factor in ASCE 7-98 was updated to account for the difference in extratropical and hurricane winds, a consideration that was not accounted for in Ellingwood (1980). Research performed in Ellingwood and Tekie (1999) was used to determine the correct wind load factor accounting for these considerations. Ellingwood and Tekie determined that in order to achieve the same reliability against failure due to wind loading as to gravity loading, and removing the 0.85 wind directionality factor, the wind load factor should be increased to between 1.5 and 1.6 for buildings located at a distance of greater than 10 km (6.2 miles) from a hurricane-prone coast. Also, Whalen and Simiu (1998) suggested that the wind load factor used in ASCE 7-95 resulted in structures in the hurricane-prone region of the United States being placed at a higher risk than those in the extratropical region. The researchers suggested that the wind load factor for buildings subjected to hurricane winds should be increased. The same recommendation was also made in . For all of these reasons, the wind load factor was increased from 1.3 to 1.6 in ASCE 7-98. ASCE 7-98 did not take the suggestion given in Ellingwood and Tekie (1999), however, which said for buildings located within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the hurricane coastline, the wind load factor should be increased to between 1.6 and 1.7 to account for the increased coefficient of variation of hurricane winds as compared to extratropical winds. Other research has been performed that suggests that the wind load factor used in ASCE 7-98 and currently in ASCE 7-02 may be too low for buildings located on the hurricane coastline of the United States. Kriebel, et al. (1997) determined that for the case where wind load controls the design of a building, the wind load factor should equal 1.8 in order for the building to have the same reliability index as if live load controlled the design. Minciarelli, et al. (2001) pointed out the fact that the safety indices used in ASCE 7-98 for wind loads are not the same as those for gravity loads. Also, the researchers state that the increased knowledge uncertainties associated with hurricane winds as opposed to extratropical winds were not taken into account in ASCE 7-98. They found that, without consideration for wind directionality factors, the correct wind load factor for buildings subjected to hurricane winds should be approximately 2.15. By contrast, the load factor they suggested for buildings in which extratropical events control the design was 1.55. The increased load factor for building subjected to hurricane winds was primarily due to the increased knowledge uncertainties associated with hurricane events. From the previous discussion, it would appear that a better wind load factor to use for the design of facilities designated as essential in a hurricane event is 1.8. From the publications listed in Table 3.5, it would appear that the load factor to apply to the wind load factor for a building located along the hurricane coast is required to be in the 1.6 to 1.8 range order to have the same reliability against failure due to wind load as to gravity loads. The wind load factor of 1.8 suggested by this publication from Kriebel et al. (1997) appears to better account for the differences in extratropical and hurricane winds as opposed to the wind load factor suggested by ASCE 7-02, without being overly conservative. The 2.15 wind load factor suggested by Minciarelli (2001) was not chosen for use by this publication because this value accounts for the increased knowledge uncertainties associated with a hurricane as opposed to an extratropical event, a factor that needs more research to prove the correctness of the assumptions made in the paper. The fact that the design wind speed in the proposed method is selected based on hurricane category rather than Mean Recurrence Interval; there is less \"uncertainty\" in the wind speed, which is the most important element of the load factor."}, {"section_title": "Rain Load Factor Methodology and Guidelines", "text": "An investigation was performed on the adequacy of using the rain load factor presented by ASCE 7-02 when rain load controls the design.

The suggested modifications to be made to these load combinations when designing facilities designated as essential during hurricane events are shown in the following bullet list. The terms that have been changed by this thesis are shown in red. o Load Combination 1 It is suggested that the rain load factor in this load combination be increased from 0.5 to 1.6 to account for the increased probability of the design rain event occurring simultaneously with the design live load. o Load Combination (3): Load combination (3) maximizes the effect of roof loads on a structure. It is suggested that a new load combination, called Load Combination (3'), shown next, be investigated along with Load Combination (3). 1.2D + 1.6R + (1.0L or 1.8W) In ASCE 7-02, the live load factor must be increased from 0.5 to 1.0 for places of public assembly. It could be argued that only shelters and refuges should be defined as places of public assembly. It is the belief of the author, however, that the other types of facilities (hospitals, emergency operations centers, fire stations, etc.) are likely to be used as defacto shelters if the need arises. Due to the increased probability of the design wind event and the design rain event occurring at the same time, it is suggested that the wind load factor used for the case where wind load controls design be used in the case where the rain load controls design. As was pointed out in Section 3.5.1, it is suggested that the wind load factor be increased to 1.8. o Load Combination (4): Load combination (4) maximizes the effect of wind load on a structure. It is suggested that a new load combination, called Load Combination (4'), shown next, be investigated along with Load Combination (4). 1.2D + 1.8W + 1.0L + (0.5L r or 1.6R) As discussed previously, it is suggested that the wind load factor be increased to 1.8. Also, it is required that the live load factor be increased to 1.0 because the facility is a place of public assembly. It is also suggested that the rain load factor be increased to account for the increased probability of the design rain event and design wind event occurring simultaneously. Also, for buildings located in Special Flood Hazard Areas, the following load combination must be investigated: 1. For buildings located in V-Zones or Coastal A-Zones, the 1.8W shall be replaced by 1.8W+2.0F a 2. For buildings located in Noncoastal A-Zones, 1.8W shall by replaced by 0.8W+1.0F a . o Load Combination (5): Load combination (5) maximizes the effects of an earthquake on a building. No changes are suggested to this load combination. o Load Combination (6): Load combination (6) maximizes the effects of uplift caused by wind. The load combination suggested for design is: 0.9D + (1.8W or 1.0E) The only change suggested is the increase of the wind load factor from 1.6 to 1.8, which was addressed previously. The effects of flood loads also have to be included. This is the same as was described in Load Combination (4). o Load Combination (7): Load combination (7) maximizes the effects of uplift caused by earthquake events. No changes are suggested to this load combination."}, {"section_title": "Debris Impact Guidelines", "text": "Wind-borne debris impact is a major cause of much of the damage many facilities experience during hurricane events and is a serious danger to building occupants. The breaching of the building envelope has many detrimental consequences and can even lead to a total building collapse. A breach in the building envelope results in internal pressurization of the building, which can double the uplift forces on the roof and the outward acting pressure on leeward and side walls, and in some cases lead to a complete collapse of the building. Also, a breach in the building envelope can cause severe interior and contents damage, which can be more costly than the structural damage the building sustains. The occupants of the building are also endangered because they are subjected to wind and flying debris. The debris impact guidelines for a facility designated as essential during a hurricane event need to be determined. There are a number of different recommendations made depending on the many factors, including the use of the building, the location of the building, and many others. ASTM recommends that, for an \"essential facility\" located within one mile of the coast, all building envelope components be able to withstand impact from a 9 lb 2\" x 4\" wooden member traveling 80 ft/s (55 mph) if located at a height of less than 30' and traveling 50 ft/s (34 mph) if located at a height of greater than 30' (ASTM 2001). The 2001 Florida Building Code (SBCCI, 2001) mandates that all building envelope components located at a height of less than 30' be able to withstand impact from a 9 lb 2\" x 4\" wooden member traveling at 50 ft/s (34 mph) and that all building envelope components located at a height of greater than 30' be able to withstand impact from 10 steel balls each weighing 2 grams traveling at 130 ft/s (89 mph). FEMA 361 (FEMA, 2000a), which is used to design a structure using the ultimate wind event as the design event, requires all building envelope components be able to withstand impact from a 15 lb 2\" x 4\" wooden member traveling at 100 mph. When determining the missile speed to use for the testing of building envelope components to be used in facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event, there are a number of considerations that must be made. One of these is the missile type to use for testing. The most common missile tested is a 2\" x 4\" wooden member with a length of between 9' and 15', depending on the publication. The most common recommendation for building envelope components of \"essential facilities\" and the like is a 12' long 2\" x 4\" wooden member. Another important consideration is the wind speed at which a missile in a high wind event can be picked up and transported. Research performed by Wills, et al. (1992) determined that a 2\" x 4\" wooden member can be transported at a wind speed of approximately 70 mph. Therefore, at a wind speed any lower than 70 mph, this type of flying debris would not be a concern. This means, however, that all hurricane events have the possibility of transporting 2\" x 4\" missiles. There has been much research performed to determine the flight characteristics of debris generated by high wind events, as was outlined in the literature review. The time for a missile to reach a given speed, for a given wind speed, and the distance the missile travels in this time using the equations given in Holmes (2001) and described in Section 2.51. are shown in Table 3.10. The following values were input into the Holmes equations in order to produce Table 3.10: o Density of air = 1.2 kg/m 3 o Density of wooden member = 500 kg/m 3 o Coefficient of drag = 1.0 Many researchers (Minor, 1978;Wills, et al., 2002; have suggested that a missile flight speed of \u00bd the design wind speed (1-minute averaging time) be used for building envelope component testing purposes. As a check to these recommendations, the equations suggested by Holmes (2001), as shown in Table 3.10, to determine the distance a missile travels to reach a given speed results in a distance traveled of approximately one kilometer for a 12' long 2\" x 4\" wooden missile to reach approximately \u00bd of the one-minute averaging time wind speed. Table 3.10 -Missile Flight Times and Distance Traveled for a 12' long 2\"x4\" *The first row represents the time (in seconds) for the missile to reach the designated velocity for the given wind speed. *The second row represents the distance (in meters) the missile travels in this time From all of the relevant considerations to be investigated when determining the correct missile parameters to use for the testing of building envelope components of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane event, the following recommendations are made: o Any building envelope component must be able to withstand impact from a 12' long 2\" x 4\" wooden missile traveling at \u00bd the 1-minute averaging time wind speed. o The requirement for the component to be deemed to have passed the impact test depends on the use classification of the building. For example, the requirement for a building classified as a Function Critical facility is far more stringent than that of a building classified as a refuge. For the requirement that the component must meet, see the Performance-based Design Guidelines section of this thesis. o There are no small missile impact requirements suggested by this paper. As long as the building envelope component is deemed to pass the above requirement, it is assumed that it will be able to resist any type of small missile impact. A comparison of the recommended debris impact guidelines to current practice was performed. Specifically, the recommendation made by this paper was compared to ASTM E-1996(ASTM, 2001. The results of this comparison are shown in Table 3.11. It is important to realize that the missile used by ASTM E-1996 is an 8' long missile, while this thesis suggests a 12' long missile.

The current method of determining if a building is flood prone is to use the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM maps) that are produced by FEMA. These maps give the areas expected to be flooded and the expected height of the flood waters during a 100 year MRI rainfall event. Since this thesis specifies building requirements to resist a hurricane of a certain intensity, and not just the loads with a certain probability, this design methodology is generally not acceptable for the design of facilities designated as essential during a hurricane. It is suggested that more research needs to be performed on the rainfall associated with hurricanes of various intensities. At this time, it is the recommendation of this thesis that essential faculties to be utilized during hurricanes be sited outside of the 100 year MRI rainfall event as given by the FEMA FIRM maps. Consideration should be given to increasing this requirement to the 500 year MRI for the most essential facilities, such as hospitals and emergency management operations facilities. Essential emergency facilities to be utilized during hurricanes must also be investigated for flooding from storm surge. It is suggested that in order to determine if a building is going to be flooded due to storm surge during the design hurricane event, the design hurricane event should be input into a storm surge modeling package such as SLOSH (NWS, 2001), which was described in Section 3.3.1.3, or ADCIRC (Notre Dame, 2003), which developed by the University of Notre Dame, and the resulting storm surge model results must be investigated at the building site. It is suggested that if the results of the storm surge model show that the building will be inundated by storm surge flood waters during the design hurricane that the building should be either raised or moved. If the facility can not be sited such that the threat of storm surge flooding is avoided, then special considerations must be made. Most importantly, the building must be designed to resist the forces caused by storm surge flood waters and the debris that is transported along with it. Guidance on flood loads and designing buildings for flood resistance is given in ASCE 7-02 (ASCE, 2002), ASCE 24-98 (ASCE, 1998), and Kriebel et al. (1997). Also, if a building is expected to flood, special consideration must be paid to ensure the welfare of the people inside of the building. If the building is to house people during and after the hurricane event, the portions of the building expected to flood should not be considered usable. It is very important that the people that are to be inside of a flooding building have a means of escape from the facility and that there is a place for them to go once they are outside of the building. One of the most common methods of egress is through a specially designed hatch. The area that the escape hatch opens onto must also be taken into account. There must be an area large enough for the people to gather. This may lead to the use of a flat roof. If it is expected that people will be gathered on the roof, then a suitable roof should designed in the initial design stages. There must also by a way for rescue personnel to be able to transport the occupants away from the flooding facility after the hurricane event. Also, depending on the performance criteria of the building, the utilities may be required to resist the damaging effects of flood waters. This may entail raising the utilities off of the ground, separating the first and second floor utilities or any other means deemed acceptable. \u2022 Area Surrounding the Building Special consideration must also be given to the area surrounding the building site. Specifically, the potential debris field around the building must be investigated. If there are any areas surrounding the building that require special consideration during the building design process, such as pipe yards or the like, the impact such an item could have on the building in the event of a hurricane must be addressed. The presence of any items that could fall on the building in a high wind event, also known as a lay-down hazard, must be addressed in the building design. A common type of object that could pose a lay-down hazard is a radio or cellular phone tower. Another important consideration is the presence of any objects that could roll into the building in high wind event, also known as a rollover hazard. Such would include manufactured houses or buildings (such as portable classrooms often found at schools), other small buildings, or vehicles. If there are rollover hazards present, this must be considered during the building design process."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Mass Care Considerations", "text": "Due consideration must be given to the needs of people who will shelter inside a building designated as essential in a hurricane event. The only mass care consideration that will be addressed in this paper is the required space per shelter occupant. FEMA 361 -Design and Construction Guidance for Community Shelters (FEMA, 2000a) suggests that for a hurricane shelter 20 ft 2 per person be provided for if the length of stay is anticipated to be only a few days, but if the length of stay is anticipated to be longer than a few days that 40 ft 2 per person be provided. Obviously, for other facilities, such as emergency management facilities, etc, the spacing will be that required for normal operations. FEMA also notes that if the shelter occupancy exceeds the normal operating occupancy, the emergency escape requirements of the Building Code may not be met. If this is the case, this should be addressed with building code officials. The American Red Cross also produces a publication addressing hurricane sheltering entitled \"ARC 4496 -Standards for Hurricane Evacuation Shelter Selection\" (ARC, 2002). ARC 4496 suggests that for a hurricane evacuation shelter a minimum of Guidance on all of these issues can be found in FEMA 361 (FEMA, 2000a), ARC 4496 (ARC, 2002, ARC 3041 (ARC 1998), and other publications produced by FEMA and the American Red Cross. It is wise to consult with local emergency management officials about decisions made concerning any of the previously-mentioned considerations before they are implemented into the design of the building. For any building designated as essential during a hurricane event, there must be a plan addressing the use and functionality of the building before, during, and after the hurricane event. This plan must be well-known by all of the usual occupants of the building as well as individuals that will be inside the building during and after the hurricane event."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Design Guidelines", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Select the Design Hurricane Event", "text": "The first step in the design of a facility designated as essential using the guidelines presented in this thesis is the selection of the design hurricane event.

The velocity pressure used in ASCE 7-02 is defined as: where: Another factor affecting the wind load is the change in the wind load factor. Although the wind load factor is part of the load combinations, it in effect becomes a linear multiplier on the wind load. The net effect of the recommended values to be used for K d , I, and the wind load factor is rather small. Excluding the velocity term and changes in the internal pressure coefficient (considered later), the ratio of the factored wind loads for the method presented in this thesis and ASCE 7-02 is: (0.95/0.85)*(1.0/1.15)*(1.8/1.6) = 1.093, or a 9.3% higher factored wind load, where the bracketed terms represent the ratio of (recommended value/ASCE 7-02 value) for Directionality Factor, Importance Factor, and wind load factor, respectively. + Note: The reduction factors determined for the inland location were determined using Figure 3.7. Since the proposed design event is the \"strongest\" hurricane in each category, that results in a step change in design speed at various locations along the coast. If ASCE 7-02 wind speeds are used as a minimum speed, that means that for any region with ASCE 7-02 design speeds between 109 and 130 mph, the minimum design hurricane should be a Category 2 with 130 mph winds. Similarly, coastal areas with wind speeds from 131 to150 mph (maximum ASCE 7-02 speed anywhere), the minimum design event is a Category 3 hurricane with 156 mph winds. The recommended minimum design events corresponding to the ASCE wind speeds in Table 4.3 are shown in bold. From the comparison shown in Table 4.3, it can be seen that for a building located on the coast where the design wind speed is 125 mph (as given in ASCE 7-02), the minimum wind speed required for design using this thesis is 130 mph (corresponding to a Category II hurricane). This results in an increase in the factored load of (130/125) 2 *1.093 = 1.18, or an increase of 18%. The squared term represents the effect of changes in design wind speed and the second term represents the increase do to the combined effect of changes in K d , I, and the load factor. Similarly, for a building located anywhere along the coast with an ASCE 7-02 design wind speed of 131 mph, the minimum wind speed allowed for design is 156 mph. This results in an increase in the factored wind load of (156/131) 2 *1.093 = 1.55, or an increase of 55%. The minimum increase would occur at a location on the coast where the design wind speed given in ASCE 7-02 is 130 mph, which actually covers much of the coast. In this case, the only difference in the wind load would be due to the changes in K d , I, and the load factor, which results in an increase of 9.3%, as presented previously. Another helpful way to compare the proposed design wind speeds and ASCE 7-02 speeds is shown in Figure 4.1. Here, the wind speeds for each design hurricane are compared to ASCE 7-02 wind speeds versus distance inland. ASCE 7-02 wind speeds shown are for a line normal to the coast, along the Louisiana-Texas border. It is important to realize that the ASCE 7-02 decay rate varies somewhat with location along the Gulf Coast, so the ASCE 7-02 wind speeds shown at various distances inland would not necessary correspond with other locations along the coast. The effects of the enclosure recommendations also need to be investigated. ASCE 7-02 uses an \"Either/Or\" provision for facilities located in wind borne debris regions -either provide debris impact protection or design for full internal pressurization. This thesis recommends an \"And\" provision -the facility is to have debris impact resistant envelope components and is to be designed for full internal pressurization. For a facility already having debris impact resistant envelope components, this change results in an increase in the ASCE 7-02 Internal Pressure Coefficient from +/-0.18 to +/-0.55. For a building without  where p = design pressure (psf); q = velocity pressure (psf); q h = velocity pressure evaluated at a given height (psf); G = gust effect factor; C p = external pressure coefficient; q i = internal velocity pressure; (GC pi ) = internal pressure coefficient For purposes of comparison, it will be assumed that q h = q i = q, which is commonly the case for low-rise buildings, and G is taken as 0.85. The relative effects of a change in the internal pressure coefficient (GC pi ) can be analyzed for various surfaces of the building by selecting the largest and smallest external pressure coefficients for typical cases and combining these with each internal pressure coefficient (+/-0.18 and +/-0.55) to give a range in variation. This analysis is shown in Tables 4.4 and 4.5. It is likely that a change in the Enclosure Classification and the resulting change in the Internal Pressure Coefficient would be experienced for most buildings designed using this thesis. This is because if the essential facility was designed using ASCE 7-02 the openings would most likely be protected, which would allow for the use of an Enclosed classification and a smaller internal pressure coefficient as compared to the Partially Enclosed classification requirement of thesis.   Figure 6.11 Assuming a Large Effective Wind Area (worst case) Note: Plus and minus signs signify pressures acting toward and away from the surfaces, respectively. The effect of the increased design pressure has a tremendous impact on the design of the Components and Cladding elements. The increase does not significantly effect the design of the MWFRS, however, except for the uplift on the entire roof or gable frame structure. The effect of the modified load combinations also needs to be investigated. The increase in the wind pressure due to the change in the wind load factor has already been addressed. The increased load factor on the rain load for the cases where wind and live load are the maximized loads, while a significant increase, is not anticipated to produce a substantial increase in overall design loads. This is because the rain load, as compared to the wind and live loads, is generally modest in magnitude. The recommendation that all of these facilities be considered as defacto shelters, and therefore be considered as places of public assembly, would result in an increase in the load factor for live load in Load Combination numbers (3), (4), and (5). This change may result in a significant gravity load increase for some facilites. The changes in the debris impact requirements were outlined in Chapter 3 and will not be discussed here. CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS"}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The unacceptable damage experienced by facilities designated as essential during hurricane events has lead members of the design community, as well as the general public, to question the current method of design of these types of facilities. The goal of this thesis was to provide a tool for designers of facilities designated as essential during hurricane events to use to improve the safety and serviceability of these facilities. In order to achieve this goal, a more rational design philosophy was developed for the design of these facilities. The following objectives were achieved: 1) A new method for determining the design event was adopted. The basis of this method is to select a hurricane of a specific category (from the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) that the owner chooses the building be designed to withstand. The building should then be designed to resist all of the hazards associated with a hurricane of that intensity. The current design wind speed given in ASCE 7-02 is the wind speed associated with an acceptable probability of failure. A design wind speed based on Hurricane Category has several advantages: First, it allows the building owner to choose the design level of the facility based on shelter demand and available budget. Second, it makes emergency management operations easier and more reliable. For a given hurricane approaching the coast, emergency management personnel can review the design basis of each facility and compare it to the forecast hurricane intensity at landfall, providing crucial information to help make evacuation and sheltering decisions. 2) A performance-based design methodology for essential facilities was developed. Such an approach was used because it allows for different levels of damage depending on the use of the functionality requirements of the building, resulting in a much more efficient design. The performance-based design approach also allows for the use of the latest available analysis and design methods, as well as building construction products. This objective consisted of the following tasks: a) Five different types of essential facilities were identified, through contact with emergency management officials, based on required usage before, during, and after the hurricane event. b) Appropriate performance levels for each of the five facility types when subjected to their design event were determined, through the use of a survey given to members of the emergency management community. 3) Methods for assessing design loads and load combinations consistent with objectives one and two were developed. Specific changes to current practice (ASCE 7-02) include: a) The Directionality Factor (K d ) was modified. The value of 0.85 used for buildings in ASCE 7-02 was changed to 0.95, reflecting the higher value more appropriate for longer recurrence interval design events. b) Guidance was given on selecting the site exposure used in analyzing wind loads. Buildings located nominally in Exposure B (urban, suburban, and wooded) must be evaluated -considering if the surrounding roughness elements are likely to remain standing during the design hurricane. If not, Exposure C should be used. c) The enclosure classification was required to be Partially Enclosed, even if the building envelope includes debris impact resistant coverings, due to the extreme increase in loads caused by a breach in the building envelope. This results in an Internal Pressure Coefficient (GC pi ) of plus and minus 0.55, even if the building envelope includes debris impact resistant coverings. d) The Importance Factor (I) of 1.15 required by ASCE 7-02 for the design of essential facilities was changed to 1.0. This was done because the current Importance Factor adjusts the MRI of the design wind speed, a factor that is not needed using the guidelines presented in this thesis. e) The determination of the design wind speed was changed. i) At the coast, the maximum wind speed for each hurricane category was used, converted to peak gust over land at 10m height. Values for Category 1-4 hurricanes are 108 mph, 130 mph, 156 mph, and 191 mph, respectively. ii) For inland locations, peak gust values at the coastline are reduced using decay models. These were developed as a function of distance inland. f) Several revised load factors and load combinations were recommended in Section 3.5. These were based on the special considerations that must be addressed when dealing with a facility subject to the effects of a hurricane. Specific changes include: i) Increasing the load factor on wind from 1.6 to 1.8 to achieve the same probability against failure due to winds in a hurricane event as to gravity loads. ii) Increasing the load factor on rain in several combinations from 0.5 to 1.6 to account for the potential simultaneous action of the design rain load and the design live or wind load. iii) Use of 1.0 factor on live load in place of 0.5, by interpreting any facility designated as essential during a hurricane event as a defacto shelter, and therefore a place of public assembly. 4) A set of guidelines was presented on the debris impact requirements of essential facilities. The specific objectives addressed are: a) It was suggested that debris impact resistant coverings or windows should be used on all openings in the building envelope. Also, the building envelope itself should be debris impact resistant. b) A suggested missile speed to be used for design purposes was given. The missile test speed should be a function of the wind speed associated with the design hurricane event. c) A comparison was made between the current impact standards and the recommendation made herein. Guidance was given on the use of current impact standards as it relates to the recommendations given in this thesis. 5) Guidance was given on other considerations to be addressed when designing essential facilities; such as the flooding hazards associated with a hurricane event and mass care issues. 6) A comparison was made between the design pressure resulting from the use of the recommendations given in this thesis to the current state of practice. a) The change in the directionality factor, importance factor, and wind load factor combined to cause a 9.3% increase in the factored wind load. b) The change in the design wind speed potentially causes the most variation from the ASCE 7-02 wind load. Depending upon the hurricane category chosen for design and distance inland, the resulting wind speed could possibly be smaller than that of ASCE 7-02 or much greater. It is recommended, however, that under no circumstances may the wind speed used for design be less than that recommended by ASCE 7-02. c) A change in the site exposure causes a significant of change in the design wind load. A jump from Exposure B to C increases K z , and subsequently the wind load, by as much as 40%, depending on the height of the building. d) A change in the enclosure classification from Enclosed to Partially Enclosed, which results in a change in the Internal Pressure Coefficient from +/-0.18 to +/-0.55, increases the magnitude of the design pressure on the walls and roof very significantly."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "The following recommendations are made concerning future research: \u2022 The methodology presented in this thesis concerning the reduction of hurricane wind speed inland should be expanded to hurricane-prone regions beyond the Gulf Coast. \u2022 A more in-depth survey to determine appropriate performance levels should be performed.

Specifically, there needs to be a relative performance level given. For example, there should be a score given differentiating components that barely meet the debris impact requirements as compared to components that perform much better when tested. \u2022 The storm surge and rainfall flooding associated with hurricanes of various intensities needs to be more thoroughly researched in order to obtain more detailed and more accurate storm surge and rainfall flood elevations.
