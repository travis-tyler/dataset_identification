[{"section_title": "I Introduction", "text": "Hurricane Katrina (hereafter referred to as \"HK\") was a unique event in terms of severity and media coverage. It was the deadliest natural disaster in the United States in nearly a century, causing 1,836 deaths in total. The city of New Orleans in Louisiana took the brunt of its impact on August 29, 2005, and the damage extended to states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. 24/7 news coverage transferred images of HK-induced death and destruction to households across the United States. A few examples of this ubiquitous news coverage are that the Los Angeles Times had a HK front-page headline and lead image for 15 days straight, and the New York Times had a HK front-page headline for 13 out of 15 days (Kimball et al. 2006). In polling conducted a week following HK, 93% of Americans believed HK to be the worst natural disaster in their lifetime (Gallup News Service 2005a). The public was mostly unhappy with the government's response, with various aspects of government receiving approval ratings of between 36-42% for their response (Gallup News Service 2005b). The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resigned two weeks following the disaster. This paper examines secondary effects of HK in areas that were not directly impacted by the damage of the storm but are susceptible to future hurricanes. The objective of this paper is to examine how large-scale disasters influence the demand for behavioral health, which I define as mental health and lifestyle behaviors, and health insurance. Changes in demand following HK may be mediated by changes in risk perceptions, as Americans living in non-impacted areas vulnerable to future hurricanes may have become aware or reminded of hurricane risks by 24/7 media coverage. I explore the impact HK had on self-reported stress, smoking, binge drinking, exercising, and having health insurance (hereafter referred to as \"behavioral health responses\") that may be impacted by a sudden change in risk perceptions. Stress may increase following a sudden change in risk perceptions, as individuals feel threatened in new ways. Individuals may attempt to use lifestyle behaviors of smoking, drinking, or exercising in an attempt to self-medicate this stress. Individuals may also obtain health insurance to either lower the costs of potential future hurricane-related injuries that they feel newly threatened by, or as another self-medication option by potentially obtaining improved access to mental health professionals and stress-reducing prescription drugs. Health insurance increases self-reported happiness (Finkelstein et al. 2012), so demand for it may increase during times of stress or associated negative feelings. My key hypothesis is that smoking, binge drinking, exercising, and holding health insurance increased following HK in non-impacted areas that are vulnerable to future hurricanes in comparison to non-impacted areas not subject to the same vulnerability, and I exploit the fact that individuals reside in counties with different hurricane risks (proxy for risk perceptions) using county-level meteorological and geographical data. Additionally, I also hypothesize increases in stress following HK in the treatment group of non-impacted vulnerable areas if self-medication devices did not fully sterilize the increase in stress. counties after HK, perceptions of these risks may have changed, in particular for individuals residing in areas of greater vulnerability to hurricanes. I estimate the increase in outcomes, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, month indicators, state indicators, and time-varying environmental and policy characteristics that could affect the outcomes (e.g. cigarette prices). A key identifying assumption is that HK provided variation in behavioral health responses across regions of differential hurricane risks exogenous to migration and economic climate, and I provide evidence to support this. Ceteris paribus, in non-impacted, vulnerable counties, HK was associated with an increase in stress of six hours per 30 days (6.8% of the mean), an increase in smoking of 2.1 percentage points (10.2% of the mean), and an increase in health insurance coverage of 1.0 percentage points (1.2% of the mean). In counties with the largest exposure to storm surge, binge drinking increased by 2.1 percentage points (14.1% of the mean). I argue that these results exhibit evidence of causality after ruling out the possibility of non-parallel time trends in the pre-HK period and observable population shifts across the different non-impacted hurricane risk regions after HK. While stress, smoking, binge drinking, and health insurance coverage appear to have increased, I do not find evidence that exercise increased after controlling for seasonal considerations. I demonstrate that effect sizes are higher in areas with higher risk, are insensitive to excluding counties within 400 miles of New Orleans, are insensitive to using a synthetic control group analysis, and are insensitive to using a longer pre-HK time trend. A key challenge for my identification strategy is potential confounding from migration to and from the disaster area. Outcomes may be different for HK evacuees than native residents. If this is true, then the DD estimators will be biased to the extent that evacuees disproportionately moved into the treatment and control groups. Additionally, a large presence of evacuees could endogenously produce changes in employment and crime associated with the outcomes. For example, the population of the Houston, Texas metropolitan area is estimated to have increased by 7 percent from HK evacuees (Hussey, Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, and Pacurar 2011)-a demographic shift associated with a decline in wages and employment among native Houstonians (McIntosh 2008), as well as an increase in violent crime (Hussey, Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy, and Pacurar 2011). I address the issue of migration in several ways. First, I exclude counties that were directly impacted by HK, as measured by counties receiving HK federal assistance through a FEMA disaster declaration, because there was large migration throughout this region. I instead focus on areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes but were not impacted directly by HK. For remaining counties, I test for observed differences in socio-demographic characteristics of gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and income before and after the adverse event in the control and treatment groups. I find no evidence of a change in population between these two groups based on observable characteristics. As an additional sensitivity analysis, I use information from approximately 1.3 million FEMA disaster aid applications to identify HK evacuees and the ZIP code of their post-HK dwelling. I use this information to create a county-level variable for evacuees per capita that I include in the analysis as a sensitivity check. Results are unaffected by the inclusion of this control variable. Finally, in another sensitivity analysis, I remove all counties within 400 miles of New Orleans, which includes Houston, home to a large number of refugees and mega-shelters, and find that results are not affected by this removal. In sum, I am able to substantially mitigate confounding from migration. This paper is related to two strands of literature. The first strand uses home sales data and DD methodologies to estimate the impact of hurricanes as sources of new risk information on property prices. New risk information, such as from an information campaign on radon exposure, has been found to raise risk perceptions (Smith and Johnson 1988). Following Hurricane Andrew that struck Florida in 1992 and controlling for damage and changes in insurance, property values were found to decline in Dade County, which was directly impacted. Property values also decreased in Lee County, a near-miss county, by less than in Dade County (Carbone, Hallstrom, and Smith 2006;Hallstrom and Smith 2005). These results suggest that households notice disasters, even \"near miss\" disasters, and update risk perceptions in response to this new information. Market responses follow. These responses appear to be temporary rather than permanent: property value differentials disappeared after five years (Bin and Landry 2013). The second strand of literature relevant to my research relates to the mental health of individuals directly impacted by large-scale disasters. Using longitudinal data, Smith found that a proxy for risk perception, longevity expectations, declined for older adults in Dade County due to a direct hit from Hurricane Andrew (Smith 2008). A recent contribution by Currie and Rossin-Slater used vital records data to explore the impact of exposure to hurricanes during pregnancy on the probability of stress-related abnormal birth conditions. Stress was found to be a residual explanation on some abnormal birth outcomes after accounting for migration, changes in medical care, and changes in maternal behavior (Currie and Rossin-Slater 2013). This paper attempts to bridge the literature on market responses in near-miss areas due to risk information provided by hurricanes with literature on behavioral health responses to hurricanes. The paper exploits HK as a unique natural disaster with destructive force not seen in generations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides information on hurricanes and the damage they can cause, Section III describes the data, Section IV articulates the empirical strategy, Section V presents the results, shows evidence of causality, and shows evidence of risk perceptions as the causal mechanism, and Section VI concludes."}, {"section_title": "II Background on Hurricane Risks", "text": "Hurricanes/typhoons are rapidly-rotating storm systems formed over water with sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour. Storm surge poses the greatest risk from hurricanes and occurs when a column of water pushed inside and in front of the storm is released over land, causing hydraulic impacts and debris collisions far inland. Storm surge from HK was as high as 25-28 feet and pushed up to 20 miles inland. The United States is particularly vulnerable to storm surge, as much of the country's densely populated Atlantic and Gulf Coast coastlines are less than 10 feet above sea level (NOAA 2013). Further, residents may be unaware and uninsured against the dangers of coastal storm surge flooding because FEMA special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) are defined only for areas at-risk of fresh water flooding. 1 The percentage of homes in storm surge zones, but not in SFHAs, is greater 1 SFHAs are defined by FEMA as areas with a 1% or greater chance of fresh water flooding in a given year. Since 1973, flood insurance has been required to purchase homes in the SFHA using a mortgage from a federally regulated or insured lender. than 50% for 11 of 14 major coastal metro areas (Botts et al. 2012). A secondary danger of hurricanes is wind damage, which can extend as far inland as Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee (Kaplan and Demaria 1995) and can spawn tornadoes. Hurricane-induced tornadoes are heavily concentrated in the immediate coastal areas and typically occur within 12 hours before to 48 hours after the hurricane makes landfall (Schultz and Cecil 2009). Due to warmer climates and geographical considerations, southern coastal states are more prone to being hit by hurricanes than others. In the 10 years prior to HK, the states with more than two hurricane landfalls are Florida (9), North Carolina (6), and Louisiana (3). The states of Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia were each hit by one or two hurricanes during this time period. Prior to HK, the northeast states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island had not seen a hurricane since Hurricane Bob in 1991 (NOAA 2008)."}, {"section_title": "III Data A Primary Data", "text": "The primary data are provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). State health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collect these cross-sectional data on risky personal health behaviors via landline telephone surveys of individuals aged 18 years and older. The data are nation-and staterepresentative of the non-institutionalized population. The data identify 100% of respondents' states and counties of residence and date of interviews, as well as a variety of socio-demographic characteristics including gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, employment/labor force participation, marital status, and income. For the primary analysis, I use data from 2004, with HK roughly in the middle, on August 25, 2005. I also perform a sensitivity analysis by adding data from 2002 and 2003 to the pre-HK period, and find that baseline results and time trend parallelism changed little when using a longer pre-HK time trend. I use the shorter window of time for my primary analysis to reduce the computation burden. As a proxy for stress, survey respondents are asked a standard question of recent emotional and mental distress: \"Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?\" These data are heavily rightward skewed, with 65.6% of individuals reporting having 0 days of stress and 4.8% reporting having 30 days of stress. The remaining 29.6% report integer values between 1 and 29.  Table A1. Men, racial/ethnic minorities, and younger individuals are underrepresented in the raw data, so I use the population weighted data in all regression analyses. In the sample, from 2004 to 2006, 76% of individuals exercised, 20.2% smoked, and 14.9% binge drank (all three defined over the course of 30 days). Health insurance was held by 83.9%. On average, individuals experienced 3.4 days of stress over the past 30 days."}, {"section_title": "B Secondary Data", "text": "Data from the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) system are used to determine counties at-risk of storm surge depending on hurricane category strength. 2 I use these data to proxy increases in risk perception following HK. In addition to strength, this system takes into account land elevation, unique bay and river configurations, water depths, rainfall, and physical features such as bridges, roads, and levees. The SLOSH data were overlaid with county borders to determine for each category of hurricane if any part of the county was in the SLOSH plane. Coastal counties are always in the SLOSH plane, and in some areas the SLOSH plane extends deeper inland. I use the inland wind decay model developed by Kaplan and DeMaria to identify counties outside of the storm surge region but potentially still vulnerable to wind damage, including tornado damage, from hurricanes (Kaplan and DeMaria 1995). This model takes into account increased penetration of dangerous wind speeds for stronger hurricanes, but it does not take into account the changing topography or other possible local factors that may affect wind speed. Similar to the SLOSH data, the wind data were overlaid with county borders to determine for each category of hurricane if any part of the county could be affected by strong gale strength wind damage of 47 miles per hour. This wind strength category was chosen because this is the point at which winds begin to cause structural damage. The wind data extend much further inland than in the SLOSH model and vary more greatly by hurricane category strength. To avoid confounding from the actual disruption in the HK-impacted counties, two additional sources of data are used. The first identifies counties that received any federal assistance because of HK. These counties include all of Louisiana and Mississippi, west Alabama, and west and south Florida. 3 These counties are excluded from the analysis to avoid capturing disruption from the actual hurricane rather than changes in risk perception. The second source is ZIP code-level FEMA application information for aid as of September 23, 2005, approximately one month after HK, providing evacuee information for 1.3 million applicants with valid ZIP codes in the continental United States. I was able to match 97% of these ZIP codes to a county. 4 In my preliminary analysis, confounding from migration is addressed using two mechanisms: 1) removing counties directly impacted by HK as measured by counties receiving federal disaster assistance, and 2) controlling in some specifications for FEMA applicants per capita in the post-HK period to address the possibility that influxes of evacuees caused changes in outcomes. I also confirm that the population composition did not change between hurricane risk regions in the post-HK period. A map showing counties at risk of storm surge and wind damage from a category 3 hurricane, as well as excluded directly impacted counties (that received federal disaster aid), is presented in Figure 1. [Insert Figure 1] Also shown in Figure 1 is six regions that I create from counties not impacted by HK and not vulnerable to storm surge or wind damage from hurricanes. I use these regions in later synthetic control group analysis. 5 Other merged data are used to control for environmental differences. Cigarette price data from the Tax Burden on Tobacco (Orzechowski and Walker 2009) and smoke-free air law data from the ImpacTeen project were included in the smoking prevalence model. The American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association (ACCRA) Cost of Living Index quarterly beer data were aggregated to the state level and was used as a proxy for alcohol prices 6 in the binge drinking model, along with pub smoking restrictions. All monetary values were deflated to 2004 dollars using the consumer price index, city average. Monthly state-level unemployment data are used to construct a state-level unemployment rate to control for spillover effects of unemployment beyond individual-level employment status."}, {"section_title": "IV Empirical Framework", "text": "In this paper, I test the conjecture that HK led to behavioral health responses in nonimpacted, but vulnerable areas. In the most basic specification, I separately estimate the amount of stress or the probability that an individual smokes, binge drinks, exercises, or is insured as a function of individual controls and DD estimators for post-HK counties at risk to hurricanes. Using the BRFSS data and excluding counties directly impacted by HK, I estimate this preliminary model: where y irt is one of five outcomes. It is either equal to 1 if individual i living in region r at time t has smoked, binge drank, or exercised in the past 30 days or has health insurance, or is equal to the number of days of stress over the past 30 days (outcomes analyzed separately I re-estimate (1) by adding environmental characteristics of state-level unemployment rates to all models, smoke-free air laws and after-tax cigarette prices to smoking models, and pub smoking restrictions and after-tax alcohol prices to binge drinking models. Following, I iteratively add state indicators and then month indicators. My baseline model is specified as: "}, {"section_title": "V Econometric Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Associations", "text": "In all analyses, I exclude counties directly impacted by HK. The DD estimators for both the storm surge region and wind damage only region are provided for each of the five dependent variables (days of stress, smoking, binge drinking, health insurance, and exercise) across five different specifications that iteratively adds controls for socio-demographic characteristics, environmental characteristics, state indicators, month indicators, and a DD estimator for evacuees per capita. My variable of primary interest is the DD estimator for the storm surge region. These preliminary results for stress and substance use outcomes are provided in Table   1. I initially regress socio-demographic controls and the DD estimators for the storm surge region and wind damage only region on stress in the first column. I show that HK was associated with 0.25 days of extra stress (7.4% of the mean) per 30 days in the storm surge region for the period from September 10, 2005 to the end of 2005. I next rule out the possibility that this increase in stress is associated with changing state-level unemployment rates after HK (column 2), time-invariant unobservables across states (column 3), and timeinvariant unobservables for a given month (column 4). Finally, I find no effect of the number of evacuees per capita being associated with the increase in stress in the storm surge region (column 5). The coefficient on the DD estimator for the storm surge region remained stable across these five specifications. The finding that stress in the wind damage only region had insignificant coefficients roughly 20% of that in the storm surge region provides evidence of internal model validity, as I would not expect the coefficient in this region to be larger than that for the storm surge region due to the higher risks in the storm surge region. [Insert Table 1] For the two substance use dependent variables, I repeat the same sequence of estimations. For smoking and binge drinking, price data and smoking restriction data are included as environmental controls in addition to unemployment rates. Smoking prevalence was associated with HK in the non-impacted storm surge counties, increasing by 2.1 percentage points (10.2% of the mean) in the column 4 baseline specification. This effect was roughly three times greater than the insignificant coefficient in the wind damage only region, and remained consistent across the different specifications. Unlike smoking, I do not find evidence of an increase in binge drinking associated with HK when using all storm surge counties. 9 I next turn to analyzing when and for how long increases in stress and smoking occurred. I first re-estimate  Table A2 that there is no evidence of an association with stress or smoking in the 16 months following HK, suggesting that the association is temporary and stress and smoking return to baseline relatively quickly. But how quickly? In online Appendix Table A3, I remove wind damage only counties and present a breakdown of the results for the first three quarters after the disaster. In my baseline specification HK was only associated with increases in stress and smoking in the storm surge region in the quarter immediately following the disaster. In Table 2, I further decompose the associations for the first 90 days after HK. I find that HK was associated with stress in only the first 30 day interval after HK (Sept. 9-Oct. 9, 2005). During this period of time, individuals in the storm surge region experienced nearly a half of an extra day of stress per 30 days (13.2% increase from the mean). Coefficients remain positive in periods 2 and 3, but decline to 1 5 th and then to 1 7 th of an extra day of stress, and these differences are no longer statistically significant. Smoking declined to baseline more slowly, potentially due to addiction, as statistically significant differences were observed in the first two 30-day intervals post-HK. Binge drinking did not increase in any of the first three months, consistent with earlier findings of no increase in the 4 months post-HK when using the full sample of storm surge counties. To answer how quickly stress and smoking returned to baseline, it appears that stress remained elevated for roughly one month and smoking for two. [Insert Table 2] Results for health insurance and exercise are presented in Table 3. DD estimators for four months after HK are presented in panel A (i.e. 2004-2005 sample) and sixteen months after HK are presented in panel B (i.e. 2004-2006 sample). For health insurance, the baseline specification (column 4) suggests that coverage increases by 1.0 percentage points (1.2% from the mean) in the storm surge region relative to the control region in both the 4 month and 16 month period after HK, although this difference is only significant across all specifications in the longer term. 10 The coefficient is also positive, but smaller, for the wind damage only region. HK may have encouraged individuals residing in non-impacted vulnerable counties to obtain health insurance. [Insert Table 3] In specifications 1-3 I initially find evidence of an increase in exercise in the non-impacted storm surge region following HK compared to the control region in the first four months after HK, but this association disappears after controlling for month-region indicators in specifications 4-5. 11 In the sixteen month post-HK period I find no association between exercise and HK in any specification. In sum, exercise appears to be the only behavioral health response that did not increase after HK. I stratify health insurance results by age. Most United States citizens 65 and older have access to government-provided health insurance through Medicare, so I do not expect changes to occur within this population in response to HK. Young adults, however, are the population least likely to be insured and so changes in their demand for health insurance could lead to more purchases made on the open market, or migration to employment with health insurance benefits. In online Appendix Table A4, I present a breakdown of the health insurance results for age categories of 18-30, 31-64, and \u226565. I find that in the four months after HK, HK was associated with a self-reported health insurance coverage increase of 3.2 percentage points (4.5% of the mean) in the storm surge region relative to the control region for the 18-30 year old population. This is in comparison to an insignificant increase of 0.2 percentage points for the other two age groups. The increase for young adults in the storm surge region is attenuated over the 16 month post-HK period to a 2.4 percentage point increase (3.4% of the mean). In sum, it appears from this analysis that HK was associated with an immediate increase in health insurance coverage among young adults \u226430 years of age residing in the storm surge region compared to the control region. In these results, level of risk perception has been explored by comparing effects in regions of different hurricane risks: storm surge counties, wind damage only counties, and control counties. I further explore the influence of risk perceptions on these results by excluding the wind damage only counties and dividing storm surge counties into a high-exposure group with above the median surface area exposure to storm surge from hurricanes (7.2% of the mean), and another with at or below the median surface area exposure to storm surge from hurricanes. Surface area exposure is an imperfect measure of risk because it does not capture where individuals actually live, work, and visit, which may be disproportionately clustered in or out of the storm surge plane. Nevertheless, to the extent that residents are equally dispersed throughout a county, a high amount of the county being vulnerable to storm surge is predicted to increase risk perceptions for more people. I expect behavioral health responses to be larger in counties with larger storm surge exposure. Table 4 provide further evidence in support of level of risk affecting outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Results in", "text": "In the baseline specification (column 4), stress increased by 1 3 rd of an extra day per 30 days (9.8% of the mean) in counties with high surface area exposure to hurricanes. Smoking increased by roughly similar percentage points in both regions. Binge drinking is also found to increase in high risk counties by 2.1 percentage points (14.1%). While the coefficients on health insurance and exercise are not statistically different from zero, both are larger in the high exposure storm surge counties than in the lower exposure counties. Taken together, these results provide evidence that larger risk (proxy for risk perceptions) is associated with larger behavioral health responses. [Insert Table 4] HK was associated with substantive behavioral health responses. Approximately 44.4 million adults lived in the storm surge counties in 2005, so estimates suggest that these individuals experienced a total of 19.8 million days of extra stress in the first 30 days, and 930,000 of these individuals smoked in the first quarter than would have if HK had not occurred. Binge drinking increased in high exposure storm surge counties by 510,000 individuals. Self-medication devices did not fully sterilize the increase in stress. While these effects were short-lived, in the conclusion I discuss how even short-term smoking may have life-threatening consequences for both smokers and others. Potentially in response to this deterioration in behavioral health, approximately 440,000 young adults were insured for at least a year that would not otherwise have been."}, {"section_title": "B Causal Evidence", "text": "A key assumption in a DD model for claims of causality is that the event must be uncorrelated with pre-existing differences in outcome trends. If this assumption is violated, then the DD estimators will be biased. I test for this by estimating (3) using a flexible functional form for time, 13 quarters from 2004 to 2006, 12 and controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, time varying controls, and time invariant state and month characteristics. In particular, I estimate: Following, I examine the joint significance of the interactions between the regions and the quarters in the pre-HK period to determine if the parallel time trends assumption is violated. The parallel time trends assumption is met for all outcomes except exercise. Results available in online Appendix Table A5 show that smoking and health insurance coverage were not different between the storm surge region and control region in the pre-HK period in any quarter (compared to the first quarter) or jointly (i.e. across all quarters). Stress was different in one quarter (compared to the first quarter), exercise in two quarters, and binge drinking in four quarters, but joint tests of significance found that the time trends were jointly different for only exercise across these two regions in the pre-HK period. A linear regression of these coefficients suggests that exercise is increasing in the storm surge region relative to the control region over time, which overestimates any causal effect. I do not find evidence of an effect regardless, since HK is not associated with exercise in the storm surge region relative to the control region. In results available upon request, I also redid the time trend analysis excluding wind damage only counties and dividing storm surge counties into groups with above and below the median of storm surge surface area exposure and again found that the time trend only differed in the pre-HK period for exercise. Results were identical for both analyses when using a period of 2002-2006, with the exception that health insurance also had a divergent time trend. A linear regression of the coefficients suggests that health insurance declined over the longer pre-HK period in the storm surge region relative to the control region, which underestimates the causal effect. Graphical evidence from (3), replacing quarter time intervals with month time intervals, is provided in Figure 2 for the four outcomes besides exercise. To produce this graph, I first subtracted the predicted value for the storm surge region from the predicted value for the control region for each month for each outcome. Following, to standardize these predicted value differences, I subtracted the predicted value means and divided by the predicted value standard deviations. Spikes in the outcomes can be interpreted as that outcome being relatively large in the storm surge region relative to the control region. [Insert Figure 2] The graphical evidence shows discontinuous increases for behavioral health responses in the storm surge region relative to the control region following HK. The differences appear to decay relatively quickly for stress and less quickly for smoking and health insurance coverage. Binge drinking is not displayed on this graph for 2006 because of the question wording change affecting women, but in online Figure 1, I provide graphical evidence for women in [2004][2005] and for men in [2004][2005][2006]. This graph suggests that the response following HK was similar for both women and men in 2005, and for men the temporary increase in binge drinking subsided four months after HK. This graphical evidence suggests that stress declined to baseline first, followed by substance use a few months later. Health insurance coverage remained elevated throughout the study period. Another key assumption for valid inference is that observable population characteristics for each region should not diverge between the pre-HK period and the post-HK period. modeling and suggesting that evacuees did not disproportionately move into any region. [Insert Table 5] In a later section, I investigate the possibility of HK evacuees affecting the composition of the hurricane risk regions in ways that lead to spurious results. I remove all counties within 400 miles of New Orleans, including Houston, which sheltered an unusually high number of evacuees. I find that my results are unaffected by using this more restrictive sample. I perform two sets of falsification exercises. The first uses a date of HK of one year prior. If there are any differential time trends between the storm surge and wind damage only counties and control counties, then I may observe significant, spurious effects in the year prior to HK. The results are presented in online Appendix Table A6 and suggest that the model passes the test for the storm surge region, with none of the coefficients statistically significant. However, there is evidence that the time trend for stress may be different between the wind damage only region and the control region. This finding is not particularly troublesome given that I use the wind damage only counties solely as a validity check on my main results of interest for the storm surge counties. For a second falsification exercise, I perform a synthetic control group analysis (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010). I adopt this methodology for use with survey data. The idea behind the synthetic control method is that a combination of units often provides a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention than any single unit alone. I used survey data and control variables of socio-demographic characteristics, environmental characteristics, and state indicators to produce predicted values for each dependent variable in each month in each of seven regions. 15 I used all 20 pre-HK lagged levels of the predicted values for the outcome as matching variables and constructed a synthetic control group to calculate a DD estimate for the storm surge region. Following this, I perform a series of placebo studies by iteratively applying this same process to estimate the effect of HK in each of the other six regions previously used in the donor pool. 16 That is, I proceed as if individuals living in other regions, rather than the storm surge region, had reason to suddenly increase behavioral health responses following HK. This iterative procedure produces estimated effects of HK in each region. I hypothesize that the estimated effect should be largest in the storm surge counties compared to the placebo regions. Results from the synthetic control group analysis for all storm surge counties (Table 6, panel A) are in line with baseline results. 17 Stress was found to increase to 0.19 days per 30 days in storm surge counties using the synthetic control group analysis compared to 0.23 days per 30 days in baseline results. Smoking increased to 2.6 percentage points (compared to 2.1), binge drinking to 1.0 percentage points (compared to 1.0), and health insurance coverage to 1.3 percentage points (compared to 1.0). The effect sizes in the storm surge counties were the largest for all outcomes except stress, where the effect size was the second largest. This means that only 1 falsification exercise out of 24 failed (4.2%). Also of comfort is that except for the storm surge counties, there is no discernable pattern of effect sizes being larger or smaller in any one region in particular. [Insert Table 6] In line with earlier estimates, effect sizes are larger in counties with greater storm surge surface area exposure ( (compared to 2.1), binge drinking to 0.7 percentage points (compared to 1.0), and health insurance coverage to 1.0 percent points (unchanged from before). In sum, using a longer pre-HK time trend results in a strengthening of the effect size for stress and smoking, and an attenuation of the effect size for binge drinking, but coefficients do not change dramatically. Taken together, these results suggest that associations reported earlier for stress, smoking, binge drinking, and health insurance exhibit evidence of causality. Parallel time trends appear to be met by finding that a flexible functional form for time did not vary across regions in the pre-HK period, and falsification exercises provide additional assurances. I find no evidence of a changed population composition after HK. Results in Table 7 are largely unchanged from baseline results. To the extent that economic disruption is correlated with proximity to New Orleans after HK, this finding provides evidence that economic disruption is not driving the observed behavioral health responses."}, {"section_title": "C Mechanism", "text": "[Insert  Table 8 supports this theory. The DD estimators in models of stress, smoking, and binge drinking are larger in southern storm surge counties, the region with a greater chance of any hurricane in a given year, than in the north. The coefficients on stress, smoking, and binge drinking are respectively 1.5, 2.2, and 2.5 times larger in the southern regions. These differences became larger when I removed counties with below the median surface area exposure. However, in both regions the increase in health insurance does not display this same variation depending on hurricane probability region, remaining near the one percentage point increase range observed in the baseline results. Taken together, these results provide evidence that risk perceptions are a possible mechanism through which HK affects stress, smoking, and binge drinking. [Insert Table 8 due to wider reach of wind damage from hurricanes. The number of control counties are reduced when the wind damage only counties increase, so DD estimators in this sensitivity analysis are calculated using different control counties. If risk perceptions are a mechanism through which HK affects outcomes, then I would expect the DD estimators to be larger for a category 5 hurricane than for a category 1 hurricane, as well as larger in the storm surge region than in the wind damage only region. Results from this sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 9. Regardless of hurricane category strength, results are broadly consistent with baseline findings. For all four outcomes, the DD estimate becomes larger for the category 5 storm surge region compared to the category 1 storm surge region. This provides additional evidence that risk perceptions are a mechanism underlying the causal relationship between HK and outcomes. [Insert Table 9] I provide evidence that risk perceptions are a possible mechanism through which HK affects stress, substance use, and health insurance. I exploit disproportionate risks from hurricanes by considering: 1) storm surge versus wind damage only, 2) storm surge counties with high versus low surface area exposure to hurricanes, 3) hurricane category strengths with larger as opposed to smaller impacts, and 4) regions with higher versus lower probabilities of any hurricane. With few exceptions, these results suggest that when\"risk\" is increased, so are the effect sizes on outcomes of stress, smoking, binge drinking, and health insurance. "}, {"section_title": "VI Conclusion", "text": "This study uses an unprecedented large-scale disaster, HK, as a natural experiment to study how increases in risk perceptions affect behavioral health and health insurance. A DD analysis is used to exploit differences in risks from hurricanes across counties of residence. I find causal evidence that HK increased stress in storm surge counties compared to the control counties by 6.8%, smoking by 10.2%, and binge drinking in the highly vulnerable storm surge counties by 14.1%. Health insurance increased by 1.2% in the 16 months following HK in the storm surge region, contributing to an estimated 440,000 young adults holding health insurance for at least a year that would not otherwise have been insured. The effects of HK on stress, smoking, and binge drinking appear to have been shortlived; nevertheless, even short-term use of these substances has health consequences and negative externalities according to a report issued by Doe and colleagues (2009). Smoking immediately increases blood pressure, heart rate, and constricts blood vessels, leading to increased risk for sudden strokes and myocardial infarction. Additionally, smoking immediately increases susceptibility to pneumonia. Smoking and second-hand smoke interferes with drug breakdown processes for certain blood-thinners, antidepressants, and anti-seizure medications, causing prescription drugs to not work as effectively and for drugs to potentially stay in the body at dangerous concentrations for longer. Finally, infants and children are especially susceptible to secondhand smoke exposure, so temporary smoking may have affected outcomes of birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, and infant middle ear and respiratory infections (Doe et al. 2009). Impaired driving is a possible consequence of short-term increases in binge drinking. Research suggests that the most effective government response to the public's miscalculating of small probabilities may be information and education (Becker and Rubinstein 2011;Sunstein 2003). An example of a benefit of information and education is that following a Mississippi River flood, home prices fell only in flooded areas outside the SFHA, but prices did not fall in the SFHA. This may have been because individuals in the SFHA were more likely to know of flooding risks ex-ante because of notification and insurance requirements, and so home prices already reflected accurate risk perceptions (Carolyn 2010 "}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1.
