We determined 35 whether physiological biomarkers (neuroplasticity, immune, stress, epigenetic) explain why 36 females are more susceptible to AD than males using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 37 Initiative (ADNI) database. 38 Methods: Using the complete ADNI cohort, we analysed the effect of sex and APOE genotype 39 (number of \u03b54 alleles) and sex and diagnosis (cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive 40 impairment (MCI), AD) on (1) AD related endpoints: memory scores, executive function scores, 41 hippocampal volume, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau and p-tau; (2) markers of the 42 immune system (interleukins, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins), neuroplasticity 43 (intercellular adhesion molecule, ICAM1), and stress (cortisol); and (3) epigenetic age. 44 Results: Females had higher levels of tau and p-tau compared to males and increasing alleles of 45 APOE\u03b54 disproportionately increased tau and p-tau compared to males. Females had larger 46\nhippocampal volume (corrected with intracranial volume) and better memory scores (that include 47 verbal memory) than males, regardless of APOE genotype and diagnosis. There were also sex 48 differences in biomarkers with females having higher levels of plasma C-reactive protein and 49 lower levels of CSF IL-8, IL-16, immunoglobulin A, and ICAM1. We did not observe an 50 association between sex, diagnosis, or APOE genotype and blood epigenetic age acceleration or 51 intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration.\nConclusion: In females tau pathology was increased but memory scores were higher and 53 corrected hippocampal volume were larger compared to males suggesting females have a reserve 54 against brain damage that delays either the onset of cognitive decline or diagnosis. In this ADNI 55 cohort more males than females were diagnosed with MCI but with no significant difference in 56 3 AD diagnosis, although more females presented with AD, suggesting the progression from CN, 57 MCI to AD may be sex-specific. We found sex differences in immune biomarkers indicating that 58 the underlying physiology may participate in differential aging with and without a diagnosis of 59 AD or MCI between the sexes. 60 61"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction 64 12 were significantly lower in females with no APOE\u03b54 alleles compared to males, whereas levels 260 were similar between the sexes with one or two APOE\u03b54 alleles (Fig 1 C and D) . 261 Both sex and APOE genotype were independently (main effects of sex or APOE 262 genotype) associated with memory z-scores and corrected hippocampal volume (Table 3) . 263 Females had higher memory z-scores and larger corrected hippocampal volume across all APOE 264 genotypes (Fig 1 E and F) . Lower memory z-scores were associated with increasing number of 265 APOE\u03b54 alleles in both sexes. Similarly, corrected hippocampus volume was significantly lower 266 with increasing number of APOE\u03b54 alleles in both sexes. Increasing APOE\u03b54 alleles was also 267 associated with lower executive function z-scores, lower amyloid beta, and lower C-reactive 268 protein (Table 3 ; Fig 1 G-I) , however there was no additional association of these variables with 269 sex. Finally, results were similar for biomarkers in plasma ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Sex and diagnosis are associated with changes in memory, hippocampus volume, AD and CSF 272 inflammatory markers 273 We next tested whether sex and dementia status (CN, MCI, and AD) influenced cognitive 274 ability, corrected hippocampal volume, and CSF biomarkers of AD and inflammation. There 275 were no significant interactions between sex and diagnosis for any of the tested variables 276 (memory, executive function, corrected hippocampal volume, CSF tau, p-tau, amyloid beta, and 277 CSF and plasma inflammatory markers). However, overall both sex and diagnosis were 278 independently associated with memory z-scores, corrected hippocampal volume and CSF tau and 279 p-tau (Table 4 ). Females had higher memory scores, larger corrected hippocampus volume, and 280 higher tau and p-tau compared to males, irrespective of diagnosis. As expected, increasing 281 13 severity of diagnosis was associated with lower memory and executive function scores, smaller 282 corrected hippocampus volume, and higher CSF tau and p-tau irrespective of sex (Fig 2 A-D) . 283 We found that although females had higher CSF levels of interleukin 16 (IL-16), and 284 lower levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and intercellular adhesion 285 molecule 1 (ICAM1), controlling for age, compared to males, there was no association between 286 these variables and diagnosis (Fig 2 E-H) . Finally, there were associations between diagnosis and 287 executive function z-scores, and amyloid beta, controlling for age, but not between these 288 variables and sex (Fig 2 I and J) . 289 The results for biomarkers and inflammatory markers in plasma were similar 290 ( Supplementary Table S4 ), with the exception of a significant relationship between plasma C-291 reactive protein (CRP) and sex (adjusted p=0.03), and also between plasma cortisol and baseline 292 diagnosis (adjusted P=0.01; Fig 2 K and L) . Males have lower levels of CRP compared to 293 females and we observed a trend between diagnosis and CRP levels in plasma with lower CRP 294 levels in late MCI and AD (adjusted P=0.08). Plasma cortisol was lower in late MCI compared 295 to CN but higher in AD compared to CN. In summary, although we detected associations 296 between sex and diagnosis and various parameters, we did not find evidence for a clear sex and 297 diagnosis interaction."}, {"section_title": "299", "text": "Epigenetic age, sex, dementia diagnosis, and AD biomarkers 300 We investigated the hypothesis that sex and dementia diagnosis affect epigenetic age 301 acceleration in blood samples of ADNI participants (see Table 5 ). 302 Epigenetic age acceleration was not associated with sex, dementia diagnosis (CN, EMCI, 303 LMCI, and AD), or the interaction of sex and diagnosis after multiple test correction (Figure 3 ). 304 14 Intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration was also not significantly associated with participant sex, 305 diagnosis, or their interaction term. 306 To assess the effect of sex and more broadly defined dementia-associated cognitive 307 impairment on epigenetic age acceleration, we compared epigenetic age acceleration between 308 participants with any form of clinically ascertained cognitive impairment (AD + LMCI + EMCI, 309 n=423, proportion female 41%) and those without (CN, n=217, proportion female 50%). By two-310 way unbalanced ANOVA neither sex, dementia status, nor their interaction were significantly 311 associated with epigenetic age acceleration after correction for multiple comparisons."}, {"section_title": "312", "text": "Matched biochemical data including APOE\u03b54 genotype and CSF concentrations of 313 amyloid beta, tau, and phosphorylated tau was available for a subset of participants with EPIC 314 DNAme data (n=533).

None of these variables was significantly associated with epigenetic age 319 acceleration ( Table 6 , results for intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration not shown)."}, {"section_title": "320", "text": "In addition to dementia diagnosis for all participants, we also had access to two 321 composite scores designed by ADNI collaborators to reflect executive function and memory; 322 these scores have been demonstrated to be independently predictive of the transition from mild 323 cognitive impairment to a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Gibbons et In the present study, we found that females have significantly higher baseline tau and p-353 tau levels in CSF than males and these are indicative of the formation of neurofibrillary tangles 354 and AD pathology (Blennow et al., 2015; Henriques et al., 2018) . This is in agreement with a 355 recent ADNI study (Sundermann et al., 2018 ; but see an earlier ADNI study Holland et al., 356 2013) and with animal models (Lewis et al., 2001) . Intriguingly, we also found that levels of tau 357 and p-tau were disproportionately elevated with APOE\u03b54 allele expression in females compared 358 to males. Previous studies indicate that females with the APOE\u03b54 allele are at a greater risk for 359 developing AD than are males with this allele (Altmann et al., 2014) , and sex differences in tau 360 and p-tau may be one underlying mechanism by which this occurs. In females (65-75 years of 361 age) one allele of \u03b54 increases the risk of AD by 4-fold relative to males, indicating that genotype 362 may affect females differently (Neu et al., 2017) . Levels of CSF tau are hypothesized to increase 363 after CSF amyloid beta declines and amyloid beta aggregates and deposits in the brain (Blennow 364 et al., 2015) . However, in this study although we found sex differences in CSF tau and p-tau 365 levels, no significant differences were seen in CSF amyloid beta after controlling for age (see 366 below) indicating that the pathway may be different in females compared to males or that the 367 timeline of tau and amyloid beta deposition may not be consistent."}, {"section_title": "368", "text": "In this ADNI cohort, more females presented with a diagnosis of AD compared to males."}, {"section_title": "369", "text": "Although the ADNI cohort is relatively small, this result supports the prevalence observed in have better memory scores than males that may have been driven by verbal memory 380 In the present study, we found that increasing APOE\u03b54 alleles and AD diagnosis was with one or two APOE\u03b54 alleles (Fleisher et al., 2005) . Although in the present study we did not 398 examine longitudinal data, we found that increasing APOE\u03b54 alleles reduced corrected 399 hippocampal volume similarly in males and females. In contrast, when CN, MCI and AD 400 individuals were analysed separately in the ADNI database, APOE\u03b54 was associated with a 401 smaller corrected hippocampal volume in CN males only, controlling for age and education 402 (Sundermann et al., 2018) . In addition, also using the ADNI database, found 403 that females with low CSF amyloid beta had more hippocampal atrophy and faster decline in 404 memory and executive function than males and this sex difference was more pronounced in 405 APOE\u03b54 carriers. Therefore, sex and APOE genotype can interact to affect corrected 406 hippocampal volume reduction with age in certain subgroups and across time (e.g., in CN or 407 individuals with low CSF amyloid beta). Differences in results between studies are likely due to 408 differences in statistical analyses (e.g., analysing diagnosis groups separately, partitioning the 409 data based on amyloid beta levels, and differences in covariates included) and/or whether 410 longitudinal data analyses are included. 411 We found that in addition to larger corrected hippocampal volume, females also had 412 better composite memory scores (but not executive function scores) than males, regardless of composite cognitive score that includes memory and executive function (Preclinical Alzheimer's 420 Cognitive Composite score with semantic processing, PACC5) using ADNI and two other 421 cohorts. In this study using the current ADNI cohort, males were slightly more educated than 422 females, and although we did not use education as a covariate, one would expect education levels 423 would have positive effects on memory, suggesting that education is not a factor for the observed 424 sex difference in memory. Altogether, we found that in females tau pathology was increased but 425 memory scores, which included verbal memory, were higher and corrected hippocampal volume 426 were larger compared to males suggesting females have a reserve against brain damage that 427 delays either the onset of cognitive decline (Stern, 2002) 433 We found that AD diagnosis was associated with lower CSF amyloid beta, as expected, 434 and this was irrespective of sex, which indicates greater amyloid deposition with AD (Henriques In this study, we investigated whether sex interacted with APOE genotype or dementia 448 diagnosis to influence inflammatory, neurotrophic and neuroplasticity markers. We found that differences in CRP in relation to AD. 461 We also found that CSF IL-16 was affected by sex and APOE genotype. CSF IL-16 462 levels were lower in females with no APOE\u03b54 alleles compared to males, but with increasing suggest that APOE genotype can modulate levels in a sex-dependent way. We also found 467 biomarkers that were affected by sex but not diagnosis or APOE genotype for example, females 468 had lower CSF levels of ICAM1 compared to males, but there was no influence of APOE We did not observe an association between either sex or diagnosis and epigenetic age 489 acceleration or intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration. To our knowledge, no other study has 490 similarly probed epigenetic age acceleration in peripheral tissue in the presence of AD, or 491 whether epigenetic age acceleration in AD is associated with sex."}, {"section_title": "AD affects amyloid beta similarly in both sexes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "492", "text": "This study was partially undertaken to investigate whether epigenetic age acceleration 493 that has been associated with the AD brain is reflected in peripheral tissues.

AD biomarkers (CSF tau and p-tau 545 but not amyloid beta) were disproportionately affected by APOE genotype in females compared 546 to males supporting the idea that females share a higher burden of the disease. Interestingly, 547 although females in this cohort had elevated AD biomarkers, they also had larger corrected 548 hippocampal volume and higher memory function scores compared to males, regardless of 549 APOE genotype and dementia diagnosis. Therefore, it is possible that females may have a 550 reserve that protects the brain from damage to delay cognitive decline or delay diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "551", "text": "Finally, we found that females had lower cytokine and immunoglobulin levels but higher CRP 552 levels compared to males. Together our work suggests that that the underlying physiology of 553 aging and AD may be sex-specific. "}]
