Nephropathy progression was similar to adults with T2D, allowing for disease duration. Youth with T2D had a worse cardiovascular (CV) risk profile than youth with T1D, and a faster progression to CV death.

However, age at diagnosis and diabetes duration may also be misleading metrics, as the time between disease manifestation and clinical diagnosis may vary greatly between individuals.\nThe methods used to diagnose diabetes and measure outcomes also varied between studies. Most studies did not make direct comparisons with adult patients with T2D and, therefore, we have used data from other adult-only studies as a comparison, introducing yet other study designs and methodologies. The collated data generally showed a faster disease progression in the pediatric T2D population, but as the duration of disease differed, it is difficult to compare the proportions of patients with a complication across studies. Also, as with most research studies, these studies of pediatric patients with T2D were typically conducted in tertiary centers, which may limit the applicability of the data to patients normally seen in primary care.\nFinally, this was not a systematic review or meta-analysis, so it is unknown how applicable our results are to the general pediatric population."}, {"section_title": "| CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Through collating data from 31 papers and abstracts, we have shown that children with T2D are physiologically different to adults with T2D.

Possible reasons for this large variation include the ethnicity/race and BMI/weight of patients, which are known risk factors for T2D. 56 Some of the studies we reviewed enrolled young people from specialist centers, whereas others were population-based. It is likely that these population/ recruitment differences accounted for some of the variation in findings."}, {"section_title": "| Implications for practice", "text": "These findings confirm the rapid progression of beta-cell failure in youth-onset T2D and show that complications arise early in the course of the disease. Moreover, they highlight the importance of screening for T2D complications from diagnosis, and then repeating these screens at least annually (as recommended by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines). 56 This approach should enable earlier intervention to reduce the development and progression of these complications and help mitigate the often devastating consequences of this disease in young patients.\nProgression of T2D in children and young people is rapid in terms of beta-cell function deterioration, time to treatment failure and development of complications. Generally, these events occur more rapidly in children than adults. As poor glycemic control is associated with these three parameters, it is vital these young patients achieve and maintain target HbA1c levels as early as possible. Thus, new treatments approved for this age group are urgently required."}]
