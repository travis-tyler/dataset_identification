[{"section_title": "", "text": "Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne (hereafter abbreviated as HF and HJ) made landfall on Florida's east coast only 20 days apart in September 2004. Both storms passed over the north end of Lake Okeechobee, a large subtropical lake located in central-south Florida. Because it is extremely shallow relative to its surface area, Lake Okeechobee is easily disturbed by wind events (Havens et al. 2001, Jin andJi 2004). Denivellation (wind-induced horizontal water movement; Hutchinson 1957) of the lake during both hurricanes produced a large standing wave or surface seiche. The vertical rise in lake stage on a basin's leeward shore during storms is referred to as wind set-up or storm surge. Water moves faster at the surface in the direction of the wind than the returning underflow due to resistance imparted by the sediments, aquatic vegetation and other obstacles; hence, the downwind rise in water level (USACE 1977, Henderson-Sellers 1984. The height of storm surge in a particular water body is influenced by a number of factors, such as: storm size, strength, direction of movement and duration; basin size and shape; shoreline topography; sheer stress at the air/water and water/sediment interfaces; and water depth and impediments to water movement, such as islands and aquatic vegetation (USACE 1955, Bode andHardy 1997). Impacts from wind set-up and accompanying wave action (e.g., flooding, shoreline erosion, damage to structures) are usually of greater interest to lake managers than the corresponding decrease in lake stage, or set-down, on the opposite shore (USACE 1977). The potential for storm damage to the levee that surrounds Lake Okeechobee is of particular concern to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the South Florida Water Management District (District), the agencies responsible for the operation and maintenance of the lake. Reliable estimates of storm surge are essential for the design of coastal engineering works (USACE 1977, Bode andHardy 1997). Before the widespread use of computers, numerical and graphical techniques were developed to provide engineers with approximate solutions to the hydrodynamic equations that govern wind set-up, including steady-state models based on empirical relationships or physical phenomena thought to be important by the investigator (USACE 1955(USACE , 1977. Today, the USACE relies on SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes), a hydrodynamic model developed by the National Weather Service (Jarvinen andLawrence 1985, Jelesnianski et al. 1992) to forecast wind set-up on Lake Okeechobee during hurricanes. Emergency managers along the United States Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts use SLOSH as a planning tool to make decisions about evacuations in advance of a storm. SLOSH predicts wind set-up throughout its model domain based on topographic variation of the shoreline and dynamic changes in storm intensity and direction. Other hydrodynamic models exist for the lake that can simulate the impact of hurricanes, such as the District's Lake Okeechobee Hydrodynamic Model (LOHM; Jin et al. 2000Jin et al. , 2002. In addition to storm surge, LOHM can simulate changes in water circulation patterns, sediment resuspension and the force of wave energy on the levee. On a global scale, a number of sophisticated storm surge models have been developed for other areas of the world (Bode and Hardy 1997). Despite their simplicity, however, steady-state wind set-up models continue to be used for design (e.g., levees surrounding large constructed wetlands built by the District in south Florida) and in other engineering applications (e.g., RIKZ 2004). Simple models remain one of the tools available to lake managers for forecasting storm impacts. This study had two main objectives. The first was to document the surface seiche and wind set-up that occurred on Lake Okeechobee during HF and HJ. The second was to evaluate the accuracy with which selected steady-state models predicted the maximum wind set-up that occurred on the lake. Predictions of wind set-up by the steady-state models were compared with those generated by the SLOSH model and presented only as a point of reference. This paper is not intended as a critique of SLOSH model performance during these storms."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Site", "text": "Lake Okeechobee (26\u00b058'N, 80\u00b050'W) is located about 75 km northwest of Miami, Fla. (Fig. 1). This large lake (surface area = 1,730 km 2 ) has an exceptionally long fetch in relation to its depth (mean/maximum depth = 2.7 and 5.5 m, respectively). Lake stage is monitored at many of the water control structures that surround Lake Okeechobee (see Fig.  1 in James et al. 1995). Data from 11 of these sites ( Fig. 1) were used in this study. Deflection of the water surface during HF and HJ (see below) was evaluated along \"transects\" between four pairs of opposing stations: S133-S3, S135-S4, S308-S131 and S352-S129 (Fig. 1). The distance along these transects ranged from 40.4 km for S352-S129 to 56.2 km for S133-S3. Weather conditions (air temperature, wind speed at 10 m, wind direction, barometric pressure and relative humidity) and water temperature at 2 m were monitored at two in-lake platforms (LZ40 and L006; Fig. 1). Lake Okeechobee and its environs are described in Aumen (1995), Flaig and Havens (1995), James et al. (1995) and Steinman et al. (2002)."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "Wind set-up on Lake Okeechobee was calculated as: where \u03b6 o is the wind set-up (m), h t = the lake stage measured at time t (m) and h 0 = the stillwater lake stage prior to the onset of each hurricane (m), which was defined as 00:00 hr on Sept. 2 for HF and 00:00 hr on Sept. 24 for HJ. Negative values for \u03b6 o represented set-down. Four steady-state models (Models 1-4; Appendix) were selected from the literature and used to predict wind set-up (\u03b6 p ) based on average weather conditions and water temperature during the period when maximum wind set-up occurred on the lake. All models were implemented in Excel (Excel 2002 SP3; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). This study focused on predicting the maximum wind set-up (hereafter referred to as wind setup) because the highest lake stage is frequently of greatest concern to engineers (USACE 1977). The free surface of any water body requires time to respond to changes in wind speed and/or direction (Haurwitz 1951), and dramatic changes in wind speed and direction occur quite rapidly during a hurricane. In an attempt to account for the dynamic nature of HF and HJ and the response lag of Lake Okeechobee to changes in wind forces, the models were run using two approaches: (1) lake stage, weather and water temperature data were averaged over 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240-min intervals (i.e., time-averaged data); and (2) 15-min average weather and water temperature data were lagged behind 15-min average lake stage by 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120-min intervals (i.e., timelagged data). The time-averaged and time-lagged data, in effect, were used as quasi steady-state input to the models. Weather and water temperature data from LZ40 were used preferentially as input to the models; conditions at this site were judged representative of average conditions across the entire lake because this platform is closest to the lake's center. However, some sensors at LZ40 malfunctioned during the hurricanes; in these cases, data from L006 were substituted. The constant (c) in Model 2 was calibrated to the time-averaged data using Excel's Solver routine to minimize the sum of the squared differences between predicted and observed wind set-up. The bottom friction coefficient (r f ) in Model 4 was calibrated using Solver in the same fashion. The surface seiche in any given direction on Lake Okeechobee was the summation of wind set-up and set-down (sometimes referred to as the statical tide) along that fetch and represented the cumulative effect of wind force and water reaction throughout the entire lake (USACE 1955). Deflection of the water surface during the storms (\u2206S) was calculated as the difference in lake stage between the pairs of opposing perimeter stations listed above. Model prediction errors (\u03b5 \u03b6 ) were calculated as the difference between predicted (\u03b6 p ) and observed wind setup (\u03b6 o ), where \u03b5 \u03b6 > 0 signified over-prediction by the model, while \u03b5 \u03b6 < 0 indicated model under-predication."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Weather Conditions", "text": "Weather conditions on Lake Okeechobee during HF and HJ typified a tropical cyclone. Wind speed increased in response to steadily falling air pressure as the storms approached and then decreased when air pressure rose as both storms receded (Fig. 2, middle panels). These hurricanes generated very strong winds; the National Hurricane Center reported maximum wind gusts of 48.4 and 57.1 m/s at the time of landfall for HF and HJ, respectively (Beven 2004, Lawrence andCobb 2004). However, hurricanes typically weaken as they move inland and wind speed declines with distance from the storm's center. The eye of both hurricanes passed to the north of the lake. Although peak wind gusts exceeded 40 m/s at both in-lake platforms during the storms, 15-min average wind velocity reached hurricane strength (33.1 m/s) only briefly during HJ (maximum velocity of 33.2 m/s). Winds in a hurricane circulate counter-clockwise around the storm's center. As a result, wind direction reverses itself as the storm approaches and then passes a fixed location; the rate of change in wind direction is dependent on factors such as the size of the storm, how fast it is moving and position of the observer relative to the storm's center. Wind direction reversed itself in approximately 10 and 6 hrs during HF and HJ, respectively (Fig. 2, top panels). In comparison, wind direction on Lake Okeechobee shifted 180\u00b0 in as little as 3 hr during a 1949 hurricane (USACE 1977). The forward speed of HF was slower and the size of its wind-field much larger than the speed and size of HJ. As a result, it took approximately four days for HF to move over Lake Okeechobee, while HJ passed over the area in only two days."}, {"section_title": "Lake Stage", "text": "Abrupt changes in lake stage occurred at many of the Lake Okeechobee perimeter stations during both hurricanes (Fig.  3). The largest variation in lake stage was at S133, the northern-most station (Fig. 1); maximum and minimum water levels at this site differed by 3.06 and 4.91 m during HF and HJ, respectively. In contrast, minimal fluctuation in lake stage occurred at stations on the west side of the lake (S4, S77, S131, S129 and S127). These sites are well protected by a large littoral zone that extends far out into the lake and extensive beds of aquatic vegetation ( Fig. 1 in Havens et al. 2001). While some western stations experienced moderate set-down (seen as a decrease in lake stage), there was little evidence of wind set-up on this side of the lake. The magnitude of variation in lake stage at the remaining perimeter stations was intermediate between that observed at S133 and the western stations."}, {"section_title": "Surface Seiche and Wind Set-up", "text": "The wind during both hurricanes was initially from a northerly direction (Fig. 2, top panels), which pushed water onto the south and east shores. This caused lake stage to fall along the north shore and rise in the south and east; change in lake stage (\u2206S) decreased between S133-S3 and S135-S4 (the decrease in \u2206S for S135-S4 was minimal during HJ) and correspondingly increased along the S352-S129 and S308-S131 transects (Fig. 2, bottom panels). When the wind shifted to a more southerly direction, denivellation reversed itself and caused lake stage to increase on the north shore and fall elsewhere. Consequently, \u2206S increased between S133-S3 and S135-S4 and decreased between S352-S129 and S308-S131. The largest surface seiche (i.e., the largest \u2206S) occurred along the S133-S3 transect. It took approximately 4 hrs during HF for a complete reversal of the N-S surface seiche (i.e., a transition from peak \u2206S at the south shore to peak \u2206S at the north shore) but only 2 hrs for the N-S surface seiche to reverse itself during HJ. The time lag for Lake Okeechobee to respond to changes in wind forces in previous storms has been as little as 1 hr (USACE 1955). The maximum \u2206S during HF and HJ for the S133-S3 transect (2.6 and 3.5 m, respectively) was comparable to the surface seiche observed during other major hurricanes (0.3 to ~5.4 m; USACE 1955USACE , 1977; the larger \u2206S during HJ was attributed to higher wind speeds during this storm. Oscillations in the S133-S3 \u2206S curve during HF corresponded with fluctuations in wind speed during the approach and recession of this storm (Fig.  2, middle panels); the surface seiche built up in a \"pulsed\" fashion as the lake responded to sudden changes in storm intensity. In contrast, fluctuations in wind speed during HJ were much reduced and the resulting \u2206S curve for S133-S3 did not display any noticeable pulsing. In general, wind set-up will be equivalent to set-down only under idealized circumstances, that is, a constant unidirectional wind blowing over a symmetrical basin that has uniform bottom roughness and depth (USACE 1977). Natural systems rarely, if ever, conform to these criteria. There are marked dissimilarities in bottom topography and the distribution of aquatic vegetation in Lake Okeechobee. For example, the lakebed adjacent to S133 is steeper with few obstructions to water movement compared to the area near S3, which has a broad littoral zone that contains spoil banks, a small island, abundant aquatic vegetation (largely Chara sp. in September 2004) and other obstructions (see Fig. 1 in Havens et al. 2001, Sharfstein 2005). In addition, wind velocity is not constant everywhere in a hurricane's curved wind field (Houston et al. 1999). It was not surprising, therefore, that large differences occurred between wind set-up and set-down during HF and HJ. Wind set-up at S133 was greater than the corresponding set-down at S3 during both storms and greater at S3 compared to S133 during HF (Fig. 4); lake stage differences for some time-averaging periods exceeded 2 m. In contrast, set-down at S3 was substantially greater than wind set-up at S133 during HJ. As already noted, little wind set-up was evident at the well-protected western stations compared to the other perimeter stations (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the slope of the water surface on Lake Okeechobee was far from symmetrical at the height of both storms. Wind set-up and wave action associated with HF and HJ had considerable impact on Lake Okeechobee. Substantial quantities of submersed and emergent aquatic vegetation in the lake's littoral zone were uprooted and deposited on shore. In addition, moderate bank erosion occurred along more exposed portions of the perimeter levee (Fig. 5). This level of damage was consistent with damage inflicted by previous hurricanes (Havens et al. 2001). A companion paper describing the long-term effects that HF and HJ had on water quality and the aquatic plant community in Lake Okeechobee will be forthcoming (Sharfstein et al. in prep).  "}, {"section_title": "Model Predictions", "text": "Wind set-up was modeled only for S3 and S133 because the largest surface seiche occurred along the N-S axis of the lake (Fig 2.). The steady-state models used in this study predicted wind set-up with varying levels of accuracy ( Fig. 6). Model accuracy was not improved by using averaging periods >15 min in length or by lagging weather and water temperature data behind lake stage. In fact, the accuracy for Models 2 and 3 at S133 during HJ decreased markedly as the lag period increased. Further discussion of these models will be restricted to predictions based only on the 15-min averaged data. Prediction errors for Models 2 and 4 (the models with calibrated parameters) at S3 and S133 ranged from -0.34 to 0.41 m and -0.33 to 0.63 m, respectively (Table 1). In comparison, prediction errors for Models 1 and 3 (the uncalibrated models) were \u22651.7 and 0.6 m at S3 and S133, respectively. Based on the magnitude of prediction errors, the calibrated models performed better than the uncalibrated models. Calibration values for r f in Model 4 were 9.6 x 10 -4 and 5.2 x 10 -5 at S3 and S133, respectively. The larger friction coefficient at S3 agreed with the expectation of increased flow resistance at this location due to the obstructions to flow described above. Bottom friction coefficients typically range from 2 x 10 -3 to 5 x 10 -3 (USACE 1977). However, calibrating this parameter to the data not only accounted for energy dissipation at the lakebed, but also adjusted for any other errors in the model (USACE 1977). The calibrated r f was more analogous to a constant and no longer represented only bottom roughness. All models, whether simple or sophisticated, have constraints. Steady-state wind set-up models incorporate a number of simplifying assumptions: a uniform basin shape, depth and bottom roughness; constant wind velocity and direction and uniform wind stress over the entire lake. A number of these models also assume that water motion is parallel to the fetch (USACE 1955(USACE , 1977. Departures from these assumptions can lead to erroneous predictions. For example, the uncalibrated models greatly over-predicted wind set-up at S3, but not at S133 (Fig. 6). These differences can be attributed to variability in the physical characteristics of each station. The shoreline at S133 (steeper slope with little aquatic vegetation or other obstructions) more closely resembled the idealized conditions described above than the lakebed near S3; hence, results from the uncalibrated models were more accurate at S133. Conversely, the calibrated models in this study were specific to conditions during HF and HJ. Model coefficients derived for these storms may not be appropriate for hurricanes that reach different intensities or that take different tracks over Lake Okeechobee. Simple models for predicting wind set-up need to be validated with field data that represent a range of storm conditions (USACE 1977). The SLOSH model typically has a prediction error of \u00b120% (NOAA 2004); errors in forecasting maximum storm surge were within \u00b10.6 m 79% of the time when the hurricane track and intensity were well known (Jarvinen and Lawrence 1985). The magnitude of prediction errors for wind set-up  during HF and HJ by SLOSH were comparable to errors in the steady-state models (Table 1). Steady-state wind set-up models should be viewed as complements rather than alternatives to using the LOHM and SLOSH models for managing Lake Okeechobee during hurricanes. Simple models can provide lake managers with estimates of storm surge well before results from the more computationally intensive hydrodynamic models are available, thereby increasing the lead-time available for initiating any District response to the storm. Simple models also can be quickly rerun to address different storm scenarios. However, routine use of simple models as predictive tools for Lake Okeechobee will require that they be calibrated against data from other hurricanes. Lake Okeechobee is somewhat unusual in that resources were available to implement a number of hydrodynamic models for this water body. In other lake systems where developing a hydrodynamic model is unfeasible, a steady-state model can provide managers with reasonable estimates of wind set-up, provided there are sufficient data to validate the model. For example, steady-state models have long been used to predict storm surge in impoundments and along the Dutch coast (e.g., Seelye 1960, USACE 1955, TUDelft 2004. The necessity of calibrating simple models to the data versus using uncalibrated models will depend on how closely a particular lake approximates the steady-state assumptions listed above."}]
