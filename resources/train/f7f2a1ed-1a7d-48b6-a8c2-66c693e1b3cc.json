Disease-modifying drugs with anti-amyloid effects are designed to eliminate aggregated A\u03b2 [4] [5] [6] . The results of phase I and phase II trials of these anti-amyloid drugs reveal their ability to eliminate A\u03b2 plaques in the brains of patients with prodromal AD [7] [8] [9] . To prove the efficacy of these drugs, trials target prodromal AD patients with confirmed A\u03b2 pathology for recruitment. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment identified participants' characters and severities [10, 11] . A\u03b2 pathology is confirmed by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) [12] [13] [14] . However, amyloid PET scans are expensive, and the availability of amyloid PET is limited. Widespread use of amyloid PET imaging in the pre-screening phase of clinical trials is thus not feasible. A pre-screening tool with low cost and high efficiency for evaluating the probability of PET positivity/negativity (PET+/PET\u2212) is thus needed.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are an alternative way to diagnose cerebral A\u03b2 pathology. Many studies showed that the A\u03b2 1-42 concentration in the CSF decreases in patients with dementia due to AD [14] [15] [16] [17] .\nThe accuracy of discriminating AD from healthy subjects by the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio can reach 80% [14] . Furthermore, the negative correlation between the CSF A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 ratio and A\u03b2 deposition assessed by amyloid PET is strong [18] [19] [20] . However, lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure that may cause discomfort and side effects such as headache, back pain, swelling, and bruising. Therefore, CSF biomarkers are not widely assessed in clinical practice. Alternative methods of pre-screening that are comfortable, low risk, and low cost are needed; these pre-screens can be administered before high-cost amyloid PET scans, especially in trials for amyloid modulation therapy.\nBlood tests are easy, low cost, low risk, and highly available. A total of 30-50% of blood A\u03b2 protein may come from the brain [21] . However, blood A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 1-40 levels are extremely low, and it is difficult to determine blood A\u03b2 levels precisely [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Some reports have indicated that immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) is sensitive enough to assay ultra-low concentration of A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 in human plasma [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Using this technique, the concentrations of plasma A\u03b2 have been shown to differentiate healthy elderly subjects from subjects with all stages (mild, moderate, and severe) of AD [25] . A previous study demonstrated the accuracy of using the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio as a diagnostic parameter in differentiating healthy subjects from patients with either mild or severe AD [25] . In addition, the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio increases with increasing amyloid load, as assessed by amyloid PET imaging in normal subjects and patients with dementia due to AD [28] . These results show the feasibility of assaying plasma A\u03b2 1-42 and A\u03b2 1-40 for evaluating whether to perform amyloid PET scans.\nGenetic factors influence amyloid aggregation in both normal subjects and patients with AD. It has been reported that the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele is associated with greater A\u03b2 deposition in the brain [29] [30] [31] . Once Apolipoprotein E (APOE) protein binds with A\u03b2, the complex becomes unstable and easily forms fibrillary A\u03b2 [32] [33] [34] . The co-existence of APOE and A\u03b2 in amyloid plaques is supported by histopathological findings [35] . Previous studies have found subjects with the APOE \u03b54 allele have a higher chance of presenting with amyloid PET+ than those without \u03b54 [14, 36] .\nIn the present study, we sought to develop an algorithm using plasma A\u03b2 1-42 , A\u03b2 1-40 , tau, and APOE genotypes as a pre-screening tool to enhance the accuracy of predicting amyloid PET+ in clinically suspected mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD patients."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Recruitment of subjects", "text": "Through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative in Taiwan (T-ADNI), subjects were enrolled at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei VGH), Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH), and Kaohsiung CGMH.\nEnrolled subjects were required to be 55 to 90 (inclusive) years of age and to have at least 6 years of education.

Given that APOE \u03b54 status and plasma A\u03b2 1-42 level enhanced the success rate in early stage AD, we further examined the contribution of combining APOE \u03b54 allele count and plasma A\u03b2 to the detection of PET+ cases in those clinically suspected MCI and mild AD.

Figure 3a plots the observed plasma A\u03b2 1-42 levels for PET\u2212 and PET+ patients and for APOE \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers.

The AUC was 0.875. The cut-off value for (A\u03b2 1-42 ) \u22121 was found to be 0.054 (pg/ml) \u22121 , which corresponds to 18.68 pg/ml of plasma A\u03b2 1-42.

All seven APOE \u03b52 carriers among the APOE \u03b54 non-carriers were found to be PET\u2212, as shown in Fig. 3b .

Recent clinical trials in clinically suspected AD found a high failure rate for ascertaining amyloid PET+. An effective pre-screening tool for amyloid PET imaging is needed. In the present study, we propose an algorithm using plasma A\u03b2 1-42 , A\u03b2 1-40 , tau, and APOE allele status to enhance accuracy in detecting amyloid PET+ in clinically suspected early stage AD (Fig. 4 ). We found that the factors APOE genotype and plasma A\u03b2 1-42 level enhance the success rate for detecting amyloid PET+ patients in clinically suspected aMCI and mild dementia.\nIn line with previous studies, the current study found a 42.3% occurrence of amyloid positivity in clinically suspected early stage AD patients. This result implies that the failure rate for detecting amyloid PET+ in clinically suspected early stage AD could be more than 50%. Our algorithm, combining APOE genotype and plasma amyloid level, increases the success rate for detecting amyloid PET+ in early-stage AD from 42.3 to 70.4%. Significantly, the success rate is especially enhanced in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers.\nThe presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele may increase the possibility of amyloid PET+ from 42.3 to 70.4% in clinically suspected early stage AD ( Fig. 4 pathway II) . This result is consistent with evidence that the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with greater amyloid deposition [41, 44, 45] . However, only approximately 30% of APOE \u03b54 non-carriers were amyloid PET+. This finding implies that APOE \u03b54 non-carriers are the population responsible for the high failure rate in detecting amyloid PET+ in clinically suspected early stage AD. However, more than 70% of subjects are APOE \u03b54 non-carriers in the general population. Even in early stage AD, more than 60% of patients are APOE \u03b54 non-carriers [30, 46, 47] . It is not possible to exclude APOE \u03b54 non-carriers in studies or trials focused on early stage AD. Other factors should be taken into account in this APOE \u03b54 non-carrier population to reduce the failure rate for detecting amyloid PET+. It has been reported that the APOE \u03b52 allele is able to prevent A\u03b2 aggregation or plaque formation [30, 41] . Thus, the APOE \u03b52 allele should also be accounted for in predicting amyloid PET+ (Fig. 5 ). Although this is a cross-sectional study, our results showed that the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentration may increase as SUVR becomes higher in amyloid PET\u2212 patients; however, plasma A\u03b2 1-42 drops steeply at the early stage of amyloid PET+ status, as indicated by the gray solid line in Fig. 2 . Our findings echoed previous consensus that PET+ subjects show lower levels of plasma A\u03b2 1-42 than PET\u2212 subjects [22, 28, 48, 49] . Although the longitudinal change in plasma biomarker is inconclusive [22] , these results may imply that the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 level becomes lower once the formation of A\u03b2 plaques occurs in the brains of early stage AD patients. Remarkably, the correlation between CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and SUVR is not a linear interrelationship and is closer to a hyperbolic model [19, 50] . In the current study, the relationship between the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentration and SUVR may be more complicated than the hyperbolic model. Further investigations to clarify this complicated relationship should be conducted in future work. The proposed dynamic changes in plasma A\u03b2 1-42 level have important implications for the selection of participants in drug trials. Amyloid-negative subjects with higher levels of A\u03b2 1-42 may be not recruited for drug trials that target aggregated A\u03b2, but they are suitable candidates for drug trials targeting soluble A\u03b2 in prodromal AD. A longitudinal study of the progression from PET\u2212 to PET+ status in early stage AD is needed to verify our results. Moreover, future research should investigate the biological mechanism by which changes in plasma A\u03b2 lead to the formation of A\u03b2 plaques in the brain.\nThere is limitation in this work. Given that CSF biomarkers were not used as inclusion criteria, it may happen that some of the aMCI patients do not develop AD lowering prediction rates. Another important question relates to replication/validation in an independent cohort, since the study was carried out in a small sample and individual results showed high variability."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "According to the results of the current study, based on a limited sample of clinically suspected aMCI and mild AD subjects, combining APOE genotypes and plasma A\u03b2 1-42 increases the accuracy for detecting amyloid PET+ in early stage AD from 42.3 to 70.4%.
