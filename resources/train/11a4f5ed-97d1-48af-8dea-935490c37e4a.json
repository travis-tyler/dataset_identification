[{"section_title": "Risk Management Through Enterprise Diversification: A Farm-Level Analysis", "text": "After a wave of intense diversification in the 1960s and 70s, the 1980s and 90s have seen a migration or even a reversal of this trend. Nonetheless, as Montgomery (1994) points out, the diversified (multi-product) firm still is the rule rather than the exception. Analysis of the factors affecting firm (farm) diversification remains a busy field of research in strategic management and industrial organization (Briglauer, 2000). Additionally, farming is a risky business because it deals with uncertain factors such as weather and market conditions. This uncertainty can result in variable returns (farm income) to the decisions that farmers make in a particular year. Therefore, farm income variability is a problem that the farming household has to deal with. Enterprise diversification is one method of reducing income variability (Robison and Barry; Newbery and Stiglitz). There are two different aspects of diversification. One is that of planning under an assumption of perfect knowledge and the other is to minimize the variance of an outcome by attempting to put a floor under the income level or by preventing the occurrence of undesirable outcomes (Heady). Farmers and farm managers, faced by price and yield variability, may wish to select a combination of enterprises to reduce the variability of farm income. Diversification is a frequently used risk management strategy that involves participating in more than one activity. It has the added advantage of mitigating price risk as well as fluctuations in outputs. In the U.S., corn and soybeans, and corn with beef or hogs are common combinations. In less developed economies, Walker and Jodha report multiple crops and inter-cropping are common, including agro-forestry. Diversification extending beyond the farm operating units is usually ignored (e.g. off-farm employment). Economically sized and diversified-enterprises may not be realized on the average farm. The management skills and capital required to establish and maintain such a business successfully may be beyond the ability of some farmers. It may be better for specialized farms to seek diversification off the farm. Off-farm diversification may come in the form of investments in public company stocks, government bonds, various forms of joint ventures related to agriculture (such as feeding in large cattle feedlots, or hog operations), or simply off-farm employment during slack seasons. Livestock investments should be large enough to take advantage of the economies of size but divisible into units that can be financed by the average farm business. Despite the frequent observation that diversification plays an important role in agriculture, there are only a few empirical studies on the factors that contribute to farm diversification. The purpose of this paper is to examine factors that determined farm diversification in the U. S. in 1996 and 2000. This is particularly important, as it would allow for the testing of the notion that production flexibility prescribed under the FAIR Act will alter farmers' cropping mix (or production decisions). If this is the case then one would expect the impact of government payments in 1996, when FAIR was enacted, on diversification to differ from that of 2000. The analysis is conducted on a national level with the unique feature of a larger sample than previously reported, comprising farms of different economic sizes and in different regions of the United States."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "A limited number of studies on diversification focus on the relationship between diversification and farm size. White and Irwin (1972), using aggregate U.S. Census data, compared diversification across farm size classes. The authors concluded that larger farms are more specialized. Pope and Prescott (1980), using 1,000 California crop farms and four different measures of diversification investigated the relationship between diversification and farm size and other socio-economic variables. The authors found a strong indication of a positive relationship between diversification and farm size. In analyzing data on 2,192 farms across three U.S. regions, Sun, Jinkins, and El-Osta (1995) distinguished between different \"stages of diversification\" which were found to influence the relationship between size and diversification. Although these studies differ substantially in the empirical approach and results reported, two common characteristics are to be mentioned. Firstly, they consider farm production diversification only and do not control for the impact of additional off-farm income. Secondly, the impact of commodity program participation is usually ignored. To the extent that participation in government commodity programs is viewed as a risk reducing mechanism (Goodwin; Calvin; and Just and Calvin), and because the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement Reform Act (FAIR) requires a reduction in payments 1 , this study will examine the potential impact of payments on diversification. The need for examining such potential impact lies in the effect a change in commodity specialization or diversification might have on input usage and/or the environment."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Consideration", "text": "The mean-variance (E-V) approach, which underlies this study, is a straightforward extension of utility Given that U(E, V) exists, the preference function will be linearized for ease of estimation in the following manner, where the b represents the subjective risk coefficient of the farm operator. Now the utility of returns to the farm operator is a direct function of the mean and variance of the returns. An extension of this model, so that the choice object is the maximization of utility of an enterprise portfolio is quite simple for a two-enterprise case. If the farm operator makes his enterprise decision between two enterprises, the equation for portfolio selection is to maximize where Z represents the returns from a portfolio of two enterprises x and y. The two enterprises are treated as stochastic variables, where 0 \u2265 \u03bb is the fraction of total portfolio allocated to enterprise, x, and is the fraction of total portfolio allocated to enterprise, y. In equation 2, represent the expected (mean) returns from enterprise x and expected (mean) returns from enterprise y, respectively. The variance of returns from enterprise x is 2 x \u03c3 and the variance of returns from enterprise y is 2 y \u03c3 . Finally, the covariance of returns from enterprise x and y is xy \u03c3 . Thus the expected value of returns per enterprise for a two-enterprise portfolio is: and the variance of returns from the portfolio is where E(Z) and 2 z \u03c3 are simply the mean and variance of the combination of the two enterprises, respectively. For a portfolio consisting of two enterprises, the model will be of the form in equation 2. The farm operator is assumed to have maximized U and the decision is to choose \u03bb that would lead to this maximization. The first-order condition for the maximization of U is: The model presented here could be generalized for more than two enterprises. Let us assume that returns from the i-th enterprise is i R , and the farm operator allocates a fraction of i \u03bb of the portfolio to enterprise i, then the total income is: (Gould, 1974). which has the mean and variance: As a farm operator varies his portfolio, that is, the farm plan, the income remains normally distributed, though its mean and standard deviation will depend on the choice of the fractions i \u03bb . The goal of this analysis is to determine the effect of farm and operator characteristics, soil productivity, and distance to market on farm diversification. An empirical representation of equation 5 that relates diversification to several relevant explanatory variables is given by where i Y is the entropy index (measure of diversification); i Z is a vector of farm and operator characteristics, location, and soil productivity, and distance to market; \u03b2 is a vector of unknown parameters to be estimated; and i \u03c8 is a residual term."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Model and Estimation", "text": "The empirical model in equation 8 can be expressed as: where log is the natural logarithm operator, X is an explanatory variable, and \u03b1 is a coefficient to be estimated. Since the values of i Y are between 1 and 0 and in order to avoid violating the standard assumption about the error term (i.e., i \u03c8 is required to have a non-truncated normal distribution) which is needed in least squares, a logistic transformation of i Y is carried out as depicted in i L (equation 9). El-Osta, Bernat, and Ahearn used a similar transformation of a Gini coefficient to investigate the role of off-farm income in income inequality (also see index numbers go to the operations that distribute their production more equally among several enterprises. The model is estimated using Weighted Least Squares. Additionally, a multiplicative dummy variable approach will be used to test for statistical difference among regression coefficients over the two time periods."}, {"section_title": "Test of Equivalency of Separate Coefficients Across Two Regressions", "text": "Using the base model as an example, let the following represent the regression performed on pooled data (1996 and 2000): where D is a dummy variable that equals one if the year is 1996, and D is zero otherwise. Since each of the dummy coefficients that corresponds to 20 \u03b4 indicates that 20 \u03b4 is significantly different than zero, this is equivalent to the finding that the coefficients of the variable OP_AGE are based on two separate regressions-one for each year 1996 and 2000--are significantly different. If the resulting t-ratio is positively signed, this indicates that the OP_AGE's coefficient in the year 2000 is significantly larger than its counterpart in the year 1996."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data for the analysis is pooled from the 1996 and 2000 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural Statistics Service. ARMS uses a multi-phase sampling design and allows each sampled farm to represent a number of farms that are similar, the number of which being the survey expansion factor. The survey collects data to measure the financial condition (farm income, expenses, assets and debts) and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. In addition to collecting basic financial data, the ARMS is dedicated to the collection of special data on farm and farm operator households. In 1996 and 2000 the ARMS collected information on business contracts by farm operators, management decisions, sources of information, use of technology, management strategies, and off-farm employment. Table 1 presents the definition and mean values of the explanatory variables and dependent variable (EINDX). In general, farms in year 2000 were slightly more diversified than farms in 1996. The average age of the farm operator in year 2000 was higher than the average age of the farm operator in 1996, however, the average level of education for farm operators was similar between the two samples. An average farm in the 2000 sample received twice as high a government payment compared to farms in 1996 (approximately $4,600 in 2000 and $2,400 in 1996). Further, the average value of agricultural products sold by an average farm fell from $82,300 in 1996 to $69,700. Finally, the data show that the number of full time farm operators decreased between the two years, from 30 percent in 1996 to 28 percent in 2000, correspondingly income from off-farm wages and salaried jobs increased by 29 percent, from $26,200 in 1996 to $33,700 in 2000."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Weighted least squares estimates of factors affecting farm diversification as depicted in equation 9, for 1996 and 2000, are presented in Table 2. The adjusted R 2 of 0.19 and 0.22 for 1996 and 2000, respectively, indicates that the explanatory variables used in the weighted least squares explained 19 percent and 22 percent of the variation in farm diversification. These levels of explained variation are fairly typical when analyzes are based on cross-sectional data. In 1996, the estimated model in (9) reveals that nine variables are significantly correlated with farm diversification. The sixth column in Table 2 denote the t-test of the differences in parameters between 1996 and 2000 time periods. The test, using the multiplicative dummy variable approach (see Pindyck and Rubinfeld), is used to highlight any significant parameter differences across the two time-periods. Based on the values of the t-statistics, age of the operator, whether the farm has insurance, marketing and production contracts, and off-farm income variables exhibit statistical difference. Additionally, amount of government payments received, and whether the farm operator is full-time and the farm is located in the Northeast show statistical difference across the two periods. Farm size measured by the value of agricultural product sold by the farm (FRM_SIZE) is significant and inversely related farm diversification (EINDX). This is in contrast with findings that diversification activities are concentrated on large farms (Pope and Prescott; Gasson; Ilbery; Shucksmith and Smith). Results suggest that larger farms may be more specialized. This is consistent with an economies of scale argument. That is, if there are large-scale economies in an enterprise then one might expect large farms to be more specialized. Our results support this hypothesis. Another possible explanation is that since farm size and wealth tend to be positively correlated, one can deduce that wealthier farms are less risk averse and less diversified--other things being equal. This is consistent with Pope and Prescott who find a negative and significant relationship between wealth and farm diversification. The coefficient of age of the farm operator (OP_AGE) is negative and statistically significant at The coefficient on off-farm income (OFF_WAGE), from wages and salaries, is negative and statistically significant only in the 2000 model. Because of low farm income and a better nonfarm economy, many farm operators and their spouses worked off the farm. This is also apparent by the fact that the average number of farm operators working full time on the farm decreased in 2000. Additionally, Mishra and Goodwin found a positive relationship between the coefficient of variation for farm income and off-farm work. That is, the greater the variability of farm income, the higher the farm operators' off-farm labor participation rate. Off-farm income diversifies a farm operator's income portfolio and reduces the degree of farm diversification and possibly offfarm work is not compatible with the labor demands of farm diversification. This is consistent with the findings of Calvin; Just and Calvin; and Mishra and Sandretto. A negative and significant coefficient of OFF_WAGE supports the potential ability of farmers to self-insure. Results in Table 2 show that there is a positive and significant relationship between diversification and full-time farm operators (WRK_STAT). Results indicate that a full-time farmer is more likely to diversify compared with a part-time farm operator. A plausible explanation is that full-time farmers are committed to farming and want to diversify risk on the farm. Another explanation could be that full-time farm operators are involved in labor intensive farming 4 , such as dairy, which leaves very little time to work off the farm. Purchase of insurance, crop insurance or revenue insurance, is a private risk management strategies that farmers have used to reduce risk and uncertainty associated with farm income (Harwood et al.,). The coefficient of farm insurance (HAV_INSUR) is positive and statistically significant at the 1 percent level for both years, 1996 and 2000. Results indicate that farm operators who buy insurance would diversify their farms. This may be a case of a risk averse farm operator who is reducing risk in several ways. This result demonstrates the farm operator's ability to self-insure and that insurance and diversification are compliments. A positive and significant correlation is found to exit between farm diversification the legal form of business organization, particularly if the business is organized as a sole proprietorship (FRM_SOLE), when compared with others forms of business organization 5 . In the case of sole proprietorship the farm operator has much at stake in the form of capital financing (unlimited personal liability for the business's debts) and there is no risk sharing. On the other hand, corporations have members who have shares and risk is distributed among the shareholders. Second, sole proprietorships is a common form or business organization on small and medium farms. Therefore, it is not surprising for a sole proprietor to diversify the farm considering the fact that diversification is a private risk management strategy. Aside from the farm, operator, and household characteristics, soil productivity and distance to the urban areas are also factors that may affect farm diversification. For example, if the soil is productive and can produce several crops, then the farm operator might be inclined to try new crops and other enterprises on the farm. The coefficient of mean productivity index (FRM_PROD) is positive and significant for both models at the 1 percent level. Previous work on farm diversification highlighted the importance of proximity to main roads and urban centers for development of other farm enterprises (Ilbery; Shucksmith et al.,; Edmond, Corcoran, and Crabtree). Such an access is assumed to provide the market stimulus for the development of farm enterprise. Results show a negative and significant correlation between farm diversification and proximity to urban area (FRM_URBAN) in both models. Operators and family members of farms located near urban areas are more likely to work off the farm and cannot meet the labor demand of a diversified farm. This is evident from negative and significant effect of off-farm work on diversification. Additionally, farms located near urban areas tend to specialize in niche agricultural activities--both on and off their farm. products. Finally, geographic location of farms determines cropping pattern, rainfall, soil productivity. Four regional dummies to indicate location of the farm were defined and three were included in the regression. However, only the coefficient of Midwest was statistically significant in both models (1996 and 2000). Results indicate that compared to farms in the South (benchmark), Midwestern farms are more likely to diversify."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The purpose of this paper is to identify farm, operator, and financial characteristics that are correlated with farm diversification in two time-periods (1996 and 2000). The present study uses national farm level data (1996 and 2000) with great diversity regarding farm size, location, commodities produced, and risk management strategies (such as crop insurance, participation in production and marketing contracts, and off-farm income). Evidence reported here suggests that diversification and farm size may be negatively correlated. Results suggest that economies of scale exist in production, which is consistent with economic theory. Further, older farm operators, farm households with off-farm income, and farm located near urban areas are less likely to diversify. On the other hand, the study also points out to a positive and significant correlation between farm diversification and family size, sole proprietorship, and having crop insurance or farm insurance and full time. Finally, there is also evidence that farms that received government payments are more diversified than their counterparts.   a, b, c Denote two-tailed statistical significance at 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively. 1 Reported t-statistics are absolute values. 2 Each t-statistics in this column tests the hypothesis that a specific estimated parameter in the farm diversification model of 1996 is equal to the corresponding parameter in the 2000 farm diversification model.
