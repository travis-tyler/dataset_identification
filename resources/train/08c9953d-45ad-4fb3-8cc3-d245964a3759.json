[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Infection and mortality rates due to COVID-19 continue to surge; nearly one million (990, 586) lives have been lost due to COVID and 32, 662, 857 cases have been documented (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020) . Robust testing systems are necessary to prevent localized outbreaks and forward transmission. Cross-country comparisons have been carried out largely to investigate COVID-19 mortality. Previous research has identified healthcare spending to be associated with higher mortality (Squalli, 2020) , likely resultant of enhanced documentation of COVID-19 deaths. A negative association between mortality and testing exists as a function of government effectiveness (Liang, Tseng, Ho, & Wu, 2020) , suggesting that national policy plays a large role.\nPrevious research has demonstrated that health expenditure and Human Development Index (HDI) scores have been associated with enhanced disease control (Tsai & Tipayamongkholgul, 2020) , factors which may be associated with COVID-19 testing. Additionally, countries may perceive their population to be at higher risk of respiratory diseases, resultant from factors such as the proportion of the workforce classified as essential workers (The Lancet, 2020), which may influence establishment of testing programs. There remains a gap in research regarding factors associated with testing to better understand national testing rates. The goal of this analysis is to explore predictors of COVID-19 testing, to better inform testing policies."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Testing and case-based data was amassed from Our World in Data, an online repository of testing indicators per country (Our World in Data, 2020). Information regarding predictors was gathered from the World Bank (The World Bank, 2020). Data from the most recent year "}, {"section_title": "Explanatory measures", "text": "HDI was assessed as a predictor due to the hypothesized relationship between governmental policy in relation to health and COVID-19 testing. HDI includes multiple dimensions, compiled of sociodemographic measures such as life expectancy, education and income, and is often employed to compare development resulting from national policies (United Nations Development Programme, 2019). We hypothesized health expenditure per capita (USD), universal health coverage (UHC), urban population (% of total population), people employed in the service industry (% of total labour force), and air pollution (mean annual exposure) would impact testing capacity, and thus were included as predictors. Health expenditure and UHC were included due to a hypothesized relationship between these factors and availability and accessibility of testing programs. Countries that allocate a greater amount of resources to population health may have a greater capacity to handle pandemic conditions and the implementation of testing programs through response readiness and existing health systems. In regards to UHC, existing or perceived cost of testing may create a barrier for access.\nAdditionally, the proportion of the population residing in urban areas was investigated, as the virus is transmitted with close proximity (The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 2020); we did not investigate overall population size, due to potential collinearity with proportion of urban population. We investigated the proportion of the population in the service industry to assess a measure of the number of essential workers, who are at higher risk for COVID-19 (The Lancet, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020). Additionally, air pollution has been found to increase COVID-19 mortality (Wu, Nethery, Sabath, Braun, & Dominici, 2020) . We hypothesized that the latter three predictors, which may indicate a population at greater risk for infection, would result in higher testing rates if governing bodies recognized greater risk among the population. All variables were operationalized as continuous measures."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "This analysis explored testing data most recently available until July 31 st , 2020. To facilitate country comparisons, we employed case-indexing methods, as measuring absolute numbers can lead to bias due to varying population sizes (Middelburg & Rosendaal, 2020) . This method involves synchronizing the epidemic across countries by using the date of the first reported COVID-19 case(s) as an index date and subsequently normalizing to cumulative cases 25 days post-index date (Middelburg & Rosendaal, 2020) . As adapted here, we normalized to cumulative tests 25 days post-index date. This resulted in an indexed number of tests that allowed for comparisons independent of temporal variation (Middelburg & Rosendaal, 2020) . Analyses were restricted to countries which had: available testing data; information regarding first reported COVID-19 case, and; the number of cases in the country exactly 25 days following its first case.\nCountries with missing data for predictors were excluded.\nThree multivariable linear regression models were built in a stepwise fashion to explore the association between the indexed number of COVID-19 tests and the HDI scores of each country.\nAll three models included urban population, percentage of labour force in the service industry, and mean air pollution exposure. Confounders were minimized due to high correlation between J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f national predictors. Model fit was assessed using Q-Q plots to test normality, variable inflation factors to detect multi-collinearity, and residual plots to test for heteroscedasticity."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "A total of 87 countries were considered for inclusion; the final analytical sample included 86 countries. As shown in Table 1 , we found that HDI and urban population were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with testing. The effect of HDI was not excluded due to either UHC or health expenditure."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This analysis explored potential predictors of COVID-19 testing; HDI and urban population were the only significant predictors of COVID-19 testing. The association between HDI and testing suggests that countries with a lower HDI may experience a disproportionate burden conducting high volume testing, and that inequities in testing exist at the global scale. These results may suggest that low HDI countries may be facing barriers to control the epidemic, imposing serious limitations on the global COVID-19 response. Taken a step further, these results speak to the importance of government capacity for the creation of testing interventions. In countries that are not able to establish robust testing programs, foreign assistance may be warranted, at the discretion of local governance.\nOur results have implications for the course of the pandemic and strategies for worldwide eradication or management. The possibility of eradication of COVID-19 bears similarities to smallpox in that worldwide cooperation and efforts will be required (Heymann & Wilder-Smith, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020). Countries that have successfully managed COVID-19 in conjunction with high testing coverage should consider, within their capacities, lending aid to countries experiencing high testing burdens with discretion of local governance. This is particularly relevant to consider as we look forward to vaccine distribution, as countries with either lower testing rates or that have struggled with testing implementation as a function of limited resources should prepare for challenges with vaccine distribution. While testing should remain the focus of preventative efforts in order to detect and trace COVID-19 cases, it is crucial to simultaneously look ahead and effectively plan for equitable vaccine distribution among countries with lower HDI scores and in resource limited settings. Governing officials should consider experiences from their unique communities regarding testing, to tailor vaccination strategies.\nLimitations of this analysis include the relatively few predictors included due to challenges with complete data. Countries with lower testing capabilities did not meet inclusion criteria, creating bias towards countries with more robust systems. Results should be interpreted with caution."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Significant predictors of COVID-19 testing include HDI and percentage of urban population.\nWhile results demonstrate the heterogeneity of national data, they also suggest that social conditions and government capacity remain consistently salient in the consideration of testing rates."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of interests", "text": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This work was not supported by any specific funding agency.
