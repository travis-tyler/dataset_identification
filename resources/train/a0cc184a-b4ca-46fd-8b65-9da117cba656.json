It is based on the application of Bayes theory to the relationship between entropy and image quality attributes. The entropy feature image of a slice is segmented into low-and high-entropy regions. For each entropy region, there are three separate observations of contrast, standard deviation, and sharpness quality attributes. A quality index for a quality attribute is the posterior probability of an entropy region given any corresponding region in a feature image where quality attribute is observed. Prior belief in each entropy region is determined from normalized total clique potential (TCP) energy of the slice. For TCP below the predefined threshold, the prior probability for a region is determined by deviation of its percentage composition in the slice from a standard normal distribution built from 250 MRI volume data provided by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. For TCP above the threshold, the prior is computed using a mathematical model that describes the TCP-noise level relationship in brain MRI images. Our proposed method assesses the image quality of each entropy region and the global image. Experimental results demonstrate good correlation with subjective opinions of radiologists for different types and levels of quality distortions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Virtually, all spheres of medicine need information contained in medical images. Structural information based on the chemical and physical properties that distinguish different anatomical structures is highly desired in medical images. This requirement makes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system a popular imaging modality for the study of human anatomy, diagnosis of neurological diseases, clinical trials of drugs for the monitoring, and treatment of neurological diseases. [1] [2] [3] An MRI system can display images in three different perpendicular planes and has the potential to discriminate the constituent soft anatomical structures with high spatial and contrast resolution.\nThe quality of a medical image is strongly dependent on the acquisition procedures. 4 During acquisition, there are several factors relating to the imaging system; the actions of the operator and the subject under investigation that limit the attainment of an ideal quality image. Image quality in radiation-based imaging systems is dependent on radiation dose. 5 There is a trade-off between image quality and patient safety. 6 The antiscatter grids determine the level of contrast in digital mammography images. 7 The quality of reconstructed SPECT images is influenced by the number of projection angles. 8 In breast ultrasound images, artifacts are caused by improper positioning of the nipple relative to the breast mass and loose contact between the breast mass and the transducer. 4 In MRI images, noise is the result of trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image resolution, and length of scan time. 9 Bias fields are the combined effects of nonuniform sensitivity of radio-frequency coils and nonuniformity of static fields. 10 Motion of the patient, respiration, blood flow, and patient position relative to the isocenter of the magnetic bore introduce blur and extraneous features into the image. 11, 12 Chemical shift and partial volume artifacts are the result of improper parameter settings. 13 These numerous factors that influence the acquisition procedures make quality evaluation a nontrivial and complex task. 14, 15 Popular objective quality evaluation methods, such as rootmean-square error (RMSE), SNR, and structural similarity index, 16 were designed to solve research problems that were not related to image interpretation but on efficient compression, storage, and transmission of images. Their formulation assumes that all classes of medical images and all other natural images have the same descriptive features. Medical images exhibit characteristics, such as texture, grayscale color, noise, and homogeneity, that distinguish them from each other and other *Address all correspondence to: Michael Osadebey, E-mail: mosadebey@ neurorx.com classes of natural images. There are many definitions of peak signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and mean square error, which make it difficult to compare quality measures from different imaging system, modalities, and researchers. 8 Quality indices derived from these popular methods do not always correlate with the performance of observers using the imaging system on the task for which they are intended. 8 Some of the problems associated with the popular quality assessment methods were addressed when task-based quality assessment methods were introduced to the medical imaging and computer vision community. [17] [18] [19] The philosophy behind a task-based quality assessment is the belief that a rigorous quantification of image quality should be defined by specifying a clearly defined task and the observer who will be performing the task. In medical imaging, the task can be a classification or estimation task. An example of a classification task is the detection of lesions in brain MRI images of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis disease. A quantification of brain atrophy in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease is an example of an estimation task. The observer can be human, human model, or Bayesian ideal observer. 20, 21 The efficacy of task-based quality assessment reported in Refs. 20, 22 , and 23 is the motivation behind pioneering research in the field of task-based adaptive imaging. Task-based adaptive imaging has been applied for the optimization of imaging systems parameters, 5, 8, 24 optimization of image quality in imaging systems, 21, 25, 26 evaluation of cardiac ejection fraction estimation algorithms, 27 and the evaluation of diffusion-weighted MRI segmentation algorithms. 28 The mainstream approach to brain MRI image quality evaluation methods such as [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] focus on the acquisition stage. The several parameters associated with MRI system acquisition process are exploited to evaluate and optimize image quality. There are few contributions on postacquisition quality assessment of brain MRI images. Postacquisition quality evaluation is an important step in the quality control procedures of clinical research organizations (CROs) because brain measurements derived from MRI images are susceptible to differences in MRI system sequence parameters. 36 Quality evaluation ensures that the variations in the quality of MRI images from different MRI system manufacturers, different clinical trial sites, and different acquisition protocols are assessed and standardized before they are fed to automated image analysis systems.\nWe identified and reviewed five contributions in the literature on postacquisition quality evaluation of brain MRI images. The report in Ref. 37 applies analysis of variance (ANOVA) algorithm to assess the variation of several quality measures with different levels of distortions. Mortamet et al. 38 combine the detection of artifacts and estimation of noise level to measure the image quality. In Ref. 39 , a null space analysis and just noticeable difference scanning method were proposed as a better quality metric compared to RMSE. The popular SNR is the quality metric adopted in Ref. 40 . Subjective quality assessment was reported in Ref. 41 .\nThe design of current postacquisition evaluation methods regards the brain as a single region. They will be inefficient for application in region-based brain MRI analysis. The contribution by Gedamu et al., 40 which adopts SNR, is diagnostically misleading 34 because it cannot discriminate the quality of two images that are perceptually dissimilar. 39, 42 A significant contribution by Mortamet et al. 38 is the adoption of artifacts as quality attributes. Since several types of distortions combine with ideal features to manifest as image quality attribute, 43 the adoption of artifacts and noise in Ref. 38 are too few attributes to evaluate the quality of an image. 44 There is a risk of ambiguity in quality measures that are based on the use of ANOVA models. 45 ANOVA limits the performance of the technique proposed in Ref. 37 to the detection of distortion. It cannot transform the different levels of distortion into a quality index. Trained MRI readers, such as radiologists, vary in their subjective evaluations. 46 Intrareader as well as interreader variability can be high. The need to reduce interreader variability through consensus with other readers coupled with negotiation around several types and levels of distortions 34 makes the subjective method proposed in Ref. 41 inefficient to manage the large volume of MRI data in CRO. 47 Motivated by the successful application of Bayesian model observer in task-based quality evaluation, we propose a postacquisition, attribute-based quality evaluation method for brain MRI images.

The classical quality attributes of a brain MRI slice include contrast, sharpness, noise, and brightness. Several contributions in the literature establish the relationship between entropy and the classical quality attributes. The reports in Refs. 49 and 50 show that image contrast can be expressed using entropy. Entropy is widely used to quantify image details by the measurement of sharpness. [51] [52] [53] The contributions in Refs. 54-56 establish the relationship between entropy and minimum mean square error (MMSE). The MMSE can be regarded as a function of SNR, a measure of noise level. The contributions in Refs. 57 and 58 demonstrate entropy as the combination of different image quality attributes. The relationship between brightness and entropy has been exploited to develop brightness-preserving histogram equalization algorithms. 59, 60 Furthermore, entropy maximization has been adopted in Refs. 61 and 62 to improve the quality of tomographic images.\nOur proposed method aims to predict the image quality of a specific region-of-interest in an MRI slice. Global entropy computed according to Eq. (1) is of no use for our proposed method because it regards the image as a single region. Our proposed method will require a segmentation task. It is necessary to incorporate spatial information into the image before the segmentation task. 63 We incorporate the spatial information according to Ref. 64 by defining a small neighborhood \u03a9 k by window size N k \u00d7 N k within the image so that the entropy of \u03a9 k can be written as E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; e 0 0 3 ; 6 3 ; 7 0 8 X \u00f0\u03a9 k \u00de \u00bc \u2212\nwhere p l is defined as E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; e 0 0 4 ; 6 3 ; 6 4 7\nis the probability of grayscale l in the neighborhood, n l is the number of pixels with grayscale l in the neighborhood, and X \u00f0\u03a9 k \u00de is the local entropy of neighborhood \u03a9 k . 65 the posterior probability P\u00f0A j jB k \u00de of each local entropy region A j given each observation B k is E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; e 0 0 5 ; 6 3 ; 3 8 8 P\u00f0A j jB k \u00de \u00bc"}, {"section_title": "Bayesian Framework", "text": "where P\u00f0A j \u00de is the prior belief of the event A j before the actual observation B k , P\u00f0B k jA j \u00de is the likelihood, and the denominator is a normalizing constant referred to as the total probability."}, {"section_title": "Prior belief", "text": "The prior belief P\u00f0A j \u00de in each entropy region A j is based on four principles. First, we incorporate the initial steps for implementing task-based quality assessment. [66] [67] [68] Multiple estimates of each entropy region for each patient in a given population can be computed from slices in an MRI volume data. 66 Second, brain MRI images are geometrically similar 69 across age, gender, and race. Third, they are statistically simple 70 as evident from the few constituent homogeneous regions that can be used to describe an ideal slice. Fourth, Rician distribution of pixels at low SNR can be modeled as Gaussian at high SNR. 71, 72 Based on these principles, we regard entropy as a random variable X generated from each slice in an MRI volume database.

A threshold T h classifies the TCP energy of the image into either the noise energy band or the entropy energy band so that the prior belief is defined as E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; e 0 0 7 ; 3 2 6 ; 5 7 6 P\u00f0A j \u00de \u00bc\nwhere \u03a6\u00f0z j \u00de is the cumulative probability when the z-score z j of the entropy value for A j is used to standardize the normal distribution in Eq.

(7). The TCP of the image E t is compared to a threshold set at T h \u00bc 0.5 to determine if the image can be classified as belonging to the noise energy band or the entropy energy band.\nFor E t \u2264 0.5, the prior belief (PBL and PBH) is the deviation of the percentage composition (EL and EH) in a slice from a standard normal distribution of corresponding percentage composition. The normal distribution of random variables was built from MRI data of 250 subjects obtained from ADNI.\nFor E t > 0.5, there are two methods to compute the prior belief. When a noise estimation algorithm is available, TCP is computed according to the mathematical model that expresses TCP-noise level relationship in Ref. 75 . In the absence of a noise estimation algorithm, the TCP is computed directly from the test image before insertion into the mathematical model."}, {"section_title": "Likelihood", "text": "The likelihood is the matching of the structural information in an entropy region to the corresponding region in a feature image where image quality attribute is observed E Q -T A R G E T ; t e m p : i n t r a l i n k -; e 0 0 8 ; 3 2 6 ; 4 1 6\nwhere n B k ;A m is the number of pixels common to both A m and B m and n fg is the number of foreground pixels.\nThe pixels in the low-energy region (CL, SL, and DL) and the high-energy region (CH, SH, and DH) of the observation images are separately matched, without registration, with pixels in the corresponding region (EL and EH) of the entropy image.

MRI-derived region-based features include regional atrophy measurements in multiple sclerosis patients, [89] [90] [91] hippocampal volume change in Alzheimer's disease patients, 92 substantia nigra, and the locus ceruleus volume change within the basal ganglia for Parkinson's disease patients. 93, 94 The importance of optimized objective quality evaluation methods for the different tasks in medical images was highlighted in Ref. 67 . The high-quality region-based quality measurement for brain MRI images was reiterated in the recommendation by the European Collaborative Research Network that studies MRI in multiple sclerosis. 95 One aspect of the recommendation is the use of high-quality brain MRI images for clinical research to prevent inaccurate diagnosis. The second aspect outlined region-based criteria for establishing multiple sclerosis dissemination in space and time. They are the presence of at least one lesion in at least two of four different regions of T2 brain MRI images. The regions are juxtacortical, periventricular, infrantentorial, and the spinal cord.\nLike natural images, distortion processes have different effects on the different homogeneous regions of the brain. 96 Noise introduces isolated edges, 97 resulting in unwanted details in the smoothly varying white matter and ventricle regions. Fine details that define the high density of edges in the cortical gray matter region are eroded by noise. Noise reduces the sharpness between the boundaries of different homogeneous regions. These effects make the task of edge detection and preservation difficult. 98 The smoothen effect of blur 99 makes it difficult to characterize the texture features that distinguish the white matter and the thalamus regions. Bias fields corrupt the natural homogeneity of the major anatomical structures by introducing new smoothly varying intensity levels. 100 This report addresses the need to provide high-quality region-based quality assessment for brain MRI images. The proposed method computes image quality index for the low-, highenergy region, and the whole-brain. The low-energy region is dominated by the white matter structure. The high-energy region includes the high density of edges that characterize the cerebral cortex and the boundaries that demarcate the different anatomical structures. The whole-brain is the brain regarded as a single region. Based on the performance evaluation results, the following subsections discuss the different characteristics of our proposed method."}, {"section_title": "Good Correlation with Human Observers", "text": "In all the categories of the experiment, the results show very good correlation (\u22650.6) between our proposed method and the subjective evaluation by human observers. This indicates that our proposed method correlates with the human visual system. The high correlation can be attributed to four factors. They are the efficient performance of our proposed algorithm, expertise of the human observers, the wide interval between distortion levels, and the number of observations. The expertise of the observers is more likely a combination of specific visual and cognitive skills derived from medical training and experience in detecting and determining the diagnostic importance of radiographic findings. 101 The observers, by their expertise, have knowledge of successive slices extracted from the same MRI volume data. Their visual perception of the small variations in the image quality between the different but successive slices will be reflected in the subjective evaluation. The interval between the different levels of distortion is reasonably large for the human eye to efficiently discriminate between the different levels of perceived distortions in the images. The number of data points used for computation of the correlation coefficient is reasonably high. The minimum number of data points in each category of the experiment is 30."}, {"section_title": "Good Classification of Image Quality", "text": "The results show that our proposed method demonstrates good classification of image quality across the slices in an MRI volume data, across MRI data acquired with different acquisition protocols, as well as different types and levels of perceived distortion."}, {"section_title": "Efficient Management of MRI Analysis", "text": "In CRO, quality attributes of an image are an important consideration during the subjective evaluation of automated image analysis systems. Subjective quality evaluation can be a cumbersome task for a trained reader. The good correlation between the outputs of our proposed method and expert human observers indicates that our proposed method can contribute to the efficient management of the large volume of data in CRO and meet the deadline to deliver image analysis reports to the sponsoring pharmaceutical organizations."}, {"section_title": "Reduction in Gaze Duration", "text": "In the evaluation of MRI-derived atrophy metrics, the reader's visual attention changes with the different metrics. Visual attention is on the white matter region during white matter atrophy measurement. The focus changes toward the cortical gray matter region during gray matter atrophy measurement and to the whole-brain for whole-brain atrophy measurement. We believe that, as in mammography, gaze duration is a useful predictor of missed lesions in brain volumetric analysis. 102 Objective method, such as our proposed method, can reduce gaze duration, improve the discernment, and accuracy of lesion detection by a trained MRI reader."}, {"section_title": "Reduction in Consensus Time", "text": "Some image analysis tasks, such as semiautomated identification of lesions, require the consensus of at least two experts. These tasks can be time-consuming because of variability in the visual judgment of the experts. Our proposed method can help find a common ground between two trained MRI readers and speed-up consensus between experts in quality assessment. The interexpert variability is much higher when it comes to image qualities that are considered borderline cases because the human visual system has no clearly defined threshold of quality index. Our proposed method can be used as a tool to define a quality index threshold that classifies an image into acceptable quality image and poor quality image."}, {"section_title": "Standardization of Image Quality", "text": "Daily very large volumes of MRI data are transferred from clinical trial sites around the globe to CRO that manage clinical trials for pharmaceutical organizations. This new quality evaluation method will find useful application in CRO environments to enforce the standardization of variations in the quality attributes of MRI images from different manufacturers, different clinical trial sites, and different acquisition protocols."}, {"section_title": "Computational Efficiency", "text": "The proposed quality evaluation system is computationally efficient. Processing the feature images required for the computation of quality index does not require additional resources, such as computationally intensive image registration algorithm. Operation of the algorithm is carried out in the binary domain."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with Task-Based Quality Evaluation without Ground Truth", "text": "Imaging methods can be referred to as any combination of image acquisition protocol, system, or parameters and image reconstruction, processing, or analysis methods used to obtain some quantitative value. 67 It is often difficult and even impossible to have access to an ideal reference also referred to as a gold standard. 103, 104 In specific applications, few images or imaging methods selected to act as reference image are far from ideal because in the real-world, an ideal image or imaging method does not exist. 66, 105 The use of phantom is not an effective approach for evaluation because it lacks the ability to model the complex anatomy and physiology of the human system as well as image acquisition artifacts that are usually encountered in real images. 67, 104 Six characteristics are common to our proposed method and task-based methods such as in Ref. 66 . First, both methods have three requirements. The requirements for our proposed method are quality attributes, Bayes model of an observer expressed by the prior belief, and figure of merit expressed by the posterior probability. The requirements for task-based methods are a task of interest, an observer performing the task and figure of merit. Second, they adopt statistical techniques. Our proposed method is based on Bayes framework while the task-based approach adopts linear regression. Third, the statistical techniques incorporate features for optimizing objective quality. Optimization in the task-based method requires an initial guess as the midpoint of the search space followed by maximum likelihood optimization. Our proposed method also requires an initial guess expressed by a prior belief in the entropy of specific image region. The prior belief is updated using Bayes rule. Fourth, both methods require a large number of patient data from a given population to attain the no-gold standard, although this can be regarded as a setback for both techniques. Fifth, both techniques assume that the statistical distribution for the ideal values of the parameter under investigation belong to a given family of parameterized distribution. Sixth, the lack of ground truth has been addressed by our proposed method and existing task-based quality evaluation methods, such as Refs. 66-68, 103, and 106.\nThere are three differences between our proposed method and task-based quality evaluation methods. First, there is difference in one of their three requirements. Our proposed method requires specification of image quality attributes while a task of interest is needed to be specified in task-based quality evaluation. Second, the specification of image quality attributes limits the application of our proposed method to images. Assessment methods change with the task at hand. 107 For this reason, taskbased method is considered as a rigorous approach to quality evaluation. Third, both methods have different roles in some specific image processing and image analysis task. An example is an estimation task such as brain atrophy measurement. Brain MRI images are the inputs to the algorithms. Our proposed method is related to the task-based method in same manner as the input images are related to the algorithms for processing and analysis task. Our proposed method can be said to play a primary role by assessing the input images. Task-based method can be considered playing a tertiary role by assessing the algorithms with its input images."}, {"section_title": "Recommended Quality Score for Images of Acceptable Quality", "text": "The quality index is based on a probability scale. An ideal MRI slice will have quality score of 1. A perfectly bad slice will have quality index of 0. The quality score for a real MRI slice will lie between 0 and 1. We recommend a quality score threshold of 0.4 to determine if a slice is of acceptable quality or without acceptable quality. This recommendation is with reference to the horizontal asymptote of 0.5 for the mathematical model that expresses the relationship between TCP and noise level. 75 The reasoning here is that the asymptote is a natural threshold that separates the energy band into two separate regions dominated by noise and entropy, respectively. Furthermore, a slice monotonically losses its sharpness quality with increasing distance on either of the thresholds. The recommended threshold is 20% less than the horizontal asymptote."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We hereby propose a postacquisition quality assessment method for structural brain MRI images. Our proposed method is significant because of the increasing interest in the use of the MRI system for monitoring disease progression in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological diseases. We exploit the relationship between entropy and the classical image quality attributes to develop quality measures for brain MRI images. Entropy is regarded as the aggregate of image quality attributes. Local contrast, local standard deviation, and local sharpness are the tests of quality attribute. Quality measure is formulated as a probability problem with focus on the different homogeneous regions of the brain. Bayes theorem is applied to compute the quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method gave good quality measures across images with different acquisition protocols, different types, and levels of distortion and correlates with subjective evaluation by human observers. It will be suitable for automated environments and in applications where specific regions of the brain are required for image analysis. This method will encourage the use of MRI images of acceptable quality in MRI-based clinical trials, ensure accurate diagnosis, and improve the performance of a trained reader in the performance evaluation of image analysis systems. The algorithm does not require image registration. It operates on binary images and thus has the potential of real-time operation. Current work regards the brain as consisting of the low-and the high-entropy regions. In the future, the low-entropy region will be segmented into five separate regions: white matter, thalamus, ventricle, cortical gray matter, and basal ganglia. This will increase the utility of our proposed method for the monitoring and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease."}, {"section_title": "Disclosures", "text": "Dr. Michael Osadebey reports no potential conflicts of interest.
