In contrast, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) found that in men, higher levels of testosterone were associated with a decrease in arterial stiffness over a 12-year followup. 16 These studies suggest that the effect that sex hormones have on arterial stiffness differs by sex. Both the MESA 15 and BLSA 16 analyses examined carotid stiffness; however, stiffness of the proximal aorta, may better correlate with risk for CVD and mortality. 17 There is a need to further understand the relation of sex hormone levels with aortic stiffness and changes in stiffness over time, particularly among women. Therefore, in a wellcharacterized cohort of men and postmenopausal women, we examined the associations between sex hormones [estradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)] and measures of aortic stiffness assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

However, there were no significant associations between sex hormones and baseline aortic arch PWV in either women or men after adjustment for age and other risk factors.\nAssociations of sex hormones for AAD and PWV were generally similar after further adjustment for lipids, diabetes, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (Supplementary Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal analysis", "text": "After an average follow-up time of 10 years, 1,005 participants (457 women and 548 men) underwent a repeat MRI of the thoracic aorta.

In men, the middle tertile of total testosterone, but not the highest tertile, was borderline associated with change in PWV ( Table 3 ). The borderline association of the 2 nd tertile of total testosterone with PWV in men persisted after adjusted for additional CVD risk factors (Supplementary Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this well-characterized community-based cohort of individuals free of clinical CVD at baseline, we found significant associations between sex hormone levels and prevalent measures of aortic distensibility, which differed by sex. Specifically, a less androgenic pattern of sex hormones (i.e., lower free testosterone and higher SHBG) in women, and higher estradiol in men, were cross-sectionally associated with greater AAD and AAS. We did not find any crosssectional associations of sex hormones with aortic arch PWV after adjustment. In longitudinal analyses, we did not find any associations of sex hormones with change in AAD after a 10-year follow-up, albeit in a smaller sample size of women and men. There was no longitudinal association of sex hormones with change in PWV either, except a borderline association for the middle tertile of total testosterone in men, which may be spurious.\nThe discrepant results between our cross-sectional and longitudinal results may possibly be attributed to several reasons. First, the baseline mean age (years) was 65 in women and 62 in men; thus, it is possible that at the time of the cross-sectional study the maximal effect of the hormones on aortic stiffness may have already been exerted resulting in significant associations at baseline with little to no progression at follow-up. Cross-sectional measures may be more robust because they are representative of the cumulative exposure over time to that point in time and the methods are more standardized, while longitudinal measures may vary because personnel and equipment have changed over 10-years' time. . Adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, study site, education, physical activity, smoking, height, weight, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, use of antihypertensive medications (women: additionally, adjusted for current hormone therapy, and years since menopause). Curves represent adjusted average difference (solid lines) and their 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines) of ascending aortic distensibility at baseline based on restricted cubic splines for free testosterone with knots at the 5th, 35th, 65th and 95th percentiles of their sample distributions. The reference values (diamond dots) were set at 10 th percentile (women: 0.57%, men: 1.39% for free testosterone). Abbreviations: MESA, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; T, testosterone.\nAdditionally, the longitudinal sample (participants with a follow-up aortic MRI 10 years later) was half the size of the cross-sectional sample and may be underpowered, although coefficients were largely null. Nonetheless, our findings of the cross-sectional associations of sex hormone levels with prevalent measures of aortic distensibility in women and men may offer insight into mechanisms behind sex differences for HFpEF risk.\nSex hormones may play a role in aortic stiffness regulating the mechanical and elastic properties of arteries. 26 Sex hormone levels have been associated with traditional CVD risk factors such as blood pressure 27 ; however, we found associations of lower free testosterone in women and higher estradiol in men to be cross-sectionally associated with aortic distensibility even after adjustment for mean arterial pressure, a potential mediating variable. Sex hormones may also influence aortic stiffness through their effects on the extracellular matrix components. Testosterone can promote the degradation of elastin and hence predisposes to stiffer arteries by increasing the amount of matrix metalloproteinase-3. 28 Estrogen may alter vascular endothelial cells to become spherical with a consequent increase in elasticity. 29 Among men, prior work from the BLSA found that testosterone, free testosterone index, and DHEA were inversely associated, and SHBG positively associated, with stiffness of the large arteries, with total testosterone alone being significant after adjusting for age. 16 Similarly, among men in our study, we also found free testosterone and DHEA were inversely associated, and SHBG positively associated, with PWV in unadjusted data, but this did not persist after adjustment for age and other risk factors. Another study found these inverse associations were stronger among younger men with hypertension. 30 This may be due to microvascular dysfunction with worsening arterial stiffness in the presence of low testosterone. 31 However, a novel finding in our study was that higher estradiol levels in men were independently associated with greater AAD at baseline. Differences between these studies may be due to population characteristics or age-dependent effects of sex hormones on the aortic wall. 30 Studies of postmenopausal women have found increased circulating levels of androgens are associated with increased measures of carotid arterial stiffness and carotid-femoral PWV. 15, 32, 33 Our study similarly found higher androgens (free testosterone) were also associated with lower baseline aortic distensibility assessed by aortic MRI in postmenopausal women, suggesting this may be a mechanism contributing to the increased risk of HFpEF in older women. Consistent with this, we previously found in this same cohort that a more androgenic sex hormone profile was associated with increased left ventricular mass in postmenopausal women. 19 We did not find an association of estradiol with aortic stiffness in women, but endogenous estradiol levels are low in women not on HT following the menopausal transition. Exogenous estrogen administration in the form of HT may have favorable effects on arterial stiffness. 34, 35 The relation of sex hormones with CVD risk may differ among HT users and nonusers, 36 although we adjusted for HT use in our main models and excluded HT users in a sensitivity analysis.\nStrengths of our study include conducting both crosssectional and longitudinal analyses in a well-characterized cohort of women and men free of CVD at baseline, adjusted for important demographic, socioeconomic, and cardiovascular factors. We used MRI-derived aortic stiffness parameters. MRI is thought to reflect changes in the aorta more accurately, and the aorta contributes up to 50% of the total arterial compliance, which may not be captured by the measures of carotid arterial stiffness that has been done in the past. 3, 37 However, limitations include: (i) Sex hormones were measured only once at baseline, and therefore we could not assess for change in sex hormone levels. (ii) The coefficients of variation for the sex hormone assays are not negligible and could have led to misclassification. (iii) In the calculations of aortic distensibility, we used brachial PP as a surrogate for central PP. Per, the \"amplification phenomenon\" brachial PP may overestimate central PP in a younger population, but in an older population (as in MESA), it is more comparable. 38 (iv) Cross-sectional results are subject to temporal and selection bias while longitudinal results are subject to selection and survival bias. (v) Associations are modest (presented in \u2206logAAD units) but similar in magnitude with several traditional risk factors. 3 (vi) We performed multiple testing giving rise to the possibility that findings were obtained by chance, although results were generally consistent with the prior literature and with our a priori hypotheses. Our study was meant to be exploratory and could guide further testing in this area.
