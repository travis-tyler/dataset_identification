Who are TIMSS Advanced students in the United States and what are they taught? \u2022 The U.S. TIMSS Advanced 2015 population is a select group of students. The students taking the advanced mathematics assessment represented 12.5 percent of U.S. twelfth-graders overall, and the students taking the physics assessment represented 5.3 percent. When viewed as a percentage of 18-year-old students, referred to as the \"coverage index\" for internationally comparative reporting in the Highlights, U.S. TIMSS Advanced students represented similarly small percentages: 11.4 percent for advanced mathematics and 4.8 percent for physics. The U.S. coverage index was in the middle of participating countries for advanced mathematics and among the countries with the lowest coverage indices for physics. \u2022 Most U.S. TIMSS Advanced students took an AP course: 76 percent of students in the advanced mathematics assessment took AP calculus and 83 percent of students in the physics assessment took AP physics. Of those who had taken an AP course, the majority took the lowest level AP course (AP Calculus AB or the first-year AP Physics 1). \u2022 U.S. students' opportunity to learn the advanced mathematics and physics content assessed in TIMSS Advanced varied by subject and the highest level course taken. Generally, coverage of advanced mathematics topics was more comprehensive than the coverage of physics topics. 1 Across eligible U.S. advanced mathematics courses, all topics were covered in the AP and IB course curricula (or in a prerequisite course), except two topics that were not covered in the standard-level IB mathematics course. On average, across topics in all content domains, advanced mathematics teachers reported that TIMSS Advanced mathematics topics were taught to 98 percent of all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students by the time of the assessment (either in the current or a prior year). In physics, there was considerable variation in the coverage of the TIMSS Advanced topics across the eligible AP and IB physics courses. In particular, the first-year AP Physics 1 course curriculum covered less than half of the TIMSS Advanced physics topics (mostly those related to mechanics), which means that U.S. students whose first high school physics course was AP Physics 1 would likely not have covered the majority of the TIMSS Advanced topics. The other AP and IB physics courses' curricula covered at least two-thirds of the topics in mechanics and thermodynamics and in electricity and magnetism. The topics in wave phenomena and atomic/ nuclear physics were not included in the AP Physics C curriculum but may have been covered in prior courses. Physics teachers reported that TIMSS Advanced physics topics were taught to 73 percent of all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students on average, which reflects an average of 87 percent for mechanics and thermodynamics, 66 percent for electricity and magnetism and 62 percent for wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics."}, {"section_title": "Section 1: Introduction", "text": "With the increasing emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-STEM-education and careers, it is important to understand how U.S. students are performing at the end of high school in the core subjects that are needed to prepare them to undertake more specialized STEM study in college and beyond.

The student assessments provide several measures to examine U.S. TIMSS Advanced students' performance, including scale scores, international benchmarks of achievement, and item-level statistics. The scale scores and international benchmarks are used to provide a general description of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students' performance in advanced mathematics (in section 5.1) and physics (in section 6.1). The item-level statistics provide student performance data on individual assessment items from across the topics assessed in TIMSS Advanced to explore U.S. performance in more detail (in sections 5.2 and 6.2). In addition, these item-level data are used to illustrate common approaches, misconceptions, and errors demonstrated by U.S. students on specific example items (in sections 5.3 and 6.3). Data from the student and school questionnaires are used primarily to conduct subgroup analyses, allowing student performance to be examined not just overall but also by course type (the highest level advanced mathematics or physics course taken), sex, race/ethnicity, and school locale. 3 Data collected for the U.S. national curriculum questionnaire are used to determine if the TIMSS Advanced topics are covered in the curriculum guides of the eligible U.S. courses. The curriculum questionnaire data are presented alongside data from the teacher questionnaire on the extent to which the TIMSS Advanced 2 International reporting describes the TIMSS Advanced populations as a percentage of the corresponding age cohort or \"coverage index.\" Reporting the coverage index allows for fair international comparisons because it accounts for the fact that education systems vary in both structure and the percentage of students who take advanced courses.

The prevalence of suburban students in the U.S. TIMSS Advanced population reflects the predominance of these students in the grade 12 population overall (41 percent). There were differences, however, in the percentages of students from the other school locales, with disproportionately lower percentages of rural and urban students and disproportionately higher percentages of town students than in the grade 12 population overall. Specifically, 8 percent of U.S. students in advanced mathematics and 6 percent in physics were from rural schools compared to 18 percent in the grade 12 population overall. Likewise, 19 percent of students in advanced mathematics and 21 percent in physics were from urban schools compared to 31 percent in the grade 12 population overall. Conversely, 35 percent of students in advanced mathematics and 26 percent in physics were from town schools compared to 11 percent in the grade 12 population overall.\nIn the United States, suburban students outperformed rural students in advanced mathematics overall and on all three content subscales (figure 5-3 and table B-9). Suburban students' average advanced mathematics score was 503 points, 75 score points higher than rural students' average score of 428 points. On the subscales, suburban-rural average differences were 71 points in algebra, 83 points in calculus, and 76 points in geometry. As described in section 3 (figure 3-3), a higher percentage of suburban students (28 percent) had taken AP Calculus BC than rural students (5 percent). \nDifferences were also seen by school locale (figure 5-7). Higher percentages of suburban students reached the High (33 percent) and Intermediate (64 percent) international benchmarks in advanced mathematics than the U.S. total (26 and 56 percent, respectively). The percentages of suburban students (along with town students) also exceeded the international medians for each benchmark, as did urban students for the Intermediate benchmark. In contrast, lower percentages of rural students reached any of the benchmarks than the U.S. total, with 1, 10, and 32 percent of rural students reaching the Advanced, High, and Intermediate benchmarks, respectively.\nThere were no measurable differences in average scores among U.S. TIMSS Advanced students from different locales-on the overall physics scale or the three content subscales (figure 6-3 and table B -20). This is in contrast to advanced mathematics where the average performance of students in rural schools was lower than those in suburban schools overall and on all three subscales.  \nUnlike advanced mathematics (where lower percentages of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students in rural schools reached the Advanced, High and Intermediate benchmarks), there were no measurable differences between U.S. students from different school locales and the U.S. total at any of the benchmarks in physics (figure 6-7).

Considering student access, the number of high schools offering AP courses has increased over the past decade, but recent data show that of those offering AP courses in 2015, less than half offered exams in the higher level AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C courses (College Board 2015a).

Among students taking non-AP mathematics courses, those who had taken other calculus courses (i.e., non-AP, non-IB) scored, on average, below the U.S. average overall (447 vs. 485) and on all three content subscales, with differences ranging from 33 points below average on the geometry subscale to 46 points below average on the calculus subscale (tables 5-1 and 5-2). 37 Like AP Calculus AB courses, non-AP, non-IB calculus courses also had lower levels of coverage of the topics related to finite and infinite series and vectors and also had lower levels of coverage of the topics related to integrals (tables A-3a, A-3b, and A-3c). 38 In terms of the cognitive domains (i.e., knowing, applying, and reasoning), the patterns in performance by course type were generally similar to those for the content domains. Students who had taken an AP calculus course as their highest course, on average, performed above the U.S. average on all three cognitive subscales, whereas those who had not taken an AP course performed, on average, below the U.S. average on all three cognitive subscales (table 5-3). Again, however, the results were driven by the strong performance of AP Calculus BC students-who scored from 71 points higher in applying and reasoning to 76 points higher in knowing than U.S. TIMSS Advanced students on average. These students also scored, on average, above the scale centerpoint on all three cognitive subscales. In contrast, students who had taken AP Calculus AB were not measurably different from U.S. students, on average, on any of the cognitive subscales. They also scored below the scale centerpoints on all three. Students who had taken other calculus courses (i.e., non-AP, non-IB) as their highest mathematics course scored lower on average on all three cognitive subscales than the U.S. averages, ranging from 38 points (in reasoning) to 43 points (in knowing) lower, and also lower than the scale centerpoint. 1 Course type reflects the highest level mathematics course taken. If students took another course in addition to an Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) course, they are included in the AP or IB category. Students are included in the \"other calculus courses\" category only if they have not taken an AP or IB course. 2 The score difference is calculated by subtracting the subgroup average score from the U.S. average score. 3 The score difference is calculated by subtracting the subgroup average score from the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoint.

These percentages were higher than the U.S. total (7, 26, and 56 percent, respectively) and the international medians (2, 14, and 43 percent, respectively). In contrast, among students who had taken AP Calculus AB, 5 percent of students reached the Advanced benchmark, 22 percent reached the High benchmark, and 54 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark. These percentages were lower than the U.S. total reaching the Advanced and High benchmarks and not measurably different from the U.S. total reaching the Intermediate benchmark, but higher than the international medians for each benchmark. Among U.S. students who had taken a non-AP course as their highest mathematics course, lower percentages of students reached the Advanced (2 percent), High (12 percent) and Intermediate benchmarks (39 percent) than the U.S. total. 41\n\n\nThe patterns observed among students who reached the High and Intermediate benchmarks (26 and 56 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall, respectively) were generally similar to those among the Advanced students. For example, the percentages of students reaching the High and Intermediate benchmarks who had taken AP Calculus BC were higher than the U.S. totals, and the percentages who had taken other non-AP, non-IB courses were lower. In contrast, among students who did not reach the Intermediate benchmark (44 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall), a higher percentage (32 percent) had taken other non-AP, non-IB calculus courses and a lower percentage (6 percent) had taken AP Calculus BC than the U.S. totals.\nAverage U.S. performance on advanced mathematics items by content domain and broad topic area within each content domain In the United States, the average percent correct overall (i.e., across all TIMSS Advanced mathematics items) was 44 percent (table 5-4). This percentage is used as the reference point for identifying content domains and topics areas in which item performance was relatively higher or lower than advanced mathematics overall (i.e., those with a higher or lower average percent correct than the overall 44 percent). Looking across content domains, the U.S. average percent correct was relatively higher on the items in algebra (46 percent correct) and calculus (47 percent correct) and relatively lower on the items in geometry (38 percent correct), compared to advanced mathematics items overall (44 percent correct). Within content domains, there was also variation in the average item percent correct across topic areas: \u2022 In algebra, the U.S. average percent correct for two topic areas-functions (53 percent) and equations and inequalities (45 percent)-was higher than for advanced mathematics overall (44 percent). In contrast, in the topic area expressions and operations, U.S. students had a lower average percent correct (42 percent) than in advanced mathematics overall. \u2022 In calculus, the U.S. average percent correct for all three topic areas-limits (49 percent), derivatives (47 percent), and integrals (46 percent)-was higher than for advanced mathematics overall. \u2022 In geometry, the U.S. average percent correct for both topic areas-noncoordinate and coordinate geometry (40 percent) and trigonometry (36 percent)-was lower than for advanced mathematics overall. Content domain/topic area average is higher than advanced mathematics (all content domains and topic areas) average (p < .05). Content domain/topic area average is lower than advanced mathematics (all content domains and topic areas) average (p < .05). 1 Average percent correct is the weighted percentage of students receiving full credit (1 point on multiple-choice items, 1 point on short constructedresponse items, and 2 points on extended constructed-response items) or partial credit (1 point on extended constructed-response items), averaged across items.

This item assesses the topic using derivatives to solve problems in optimization and rates of change, which is covered in all of the TIMSS Advanced-eligible AP calculus and IB mathematics courses and was reported by teachers to have been taught to virtually all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students (table A-3b). As such, the topic was categorized as high coverage (figure 5-9). In contrast to example 2, this item requires students to use differential calculus to solve a contextualized problem to determine the number of commodity units that should be produced and sold to maximize the profit. This item maps above the Advanced international benchmark level. Overall, 16 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered this item correctly, which was higher than the international average (9 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 5-4 and table B-14). The correct response of 200 units (as shown in the student example and code 10 in the scoring guide) is based on correctly differentiating the profit function to find the point at which the first derivative is zero and then verifying that profit is maximum at that point using the second derivative. Students also received full credit by using a scientific/graphic calculator to arrive at the correct answer and explaining how the calculator was used to determine the answer (code 11). U.S. performance ranged from 8 percent correct for students who had taken non-AP mathematics courses (lower than the U.S. total) to 28 percent correct for those who had taken AP Calculus BC (higher than the U.S. total). 50 Of the 71 percent of U.S. students who provided an incorrect response (codes 70, 71, 72, and 79 combined), 7 percent made a computational error in determining the derivative of the profit function itself (code 70) (see the second page of exhibit 5-4). This diagnostic code was used to determine how many students knew how to set up the profit function for differentiation to start the multistep problem but made a computational error in the first step and thus could not go further. There were no measurable differences by highest course taken for this type of error. Another 9 percent of the students used the calculator but arrived at an incorrect answer with or without an adequate explanation of how they used the calculator (code 71 or 72). The majority of the students provided other types of completely incorrect responses (code 79, 55 percent) or left the item blank (13 percent). 50 Percent correct is based on codes 10 and 11 combined.\nWhat is the area enclosed by the graphs of functions y x 2 and y x = \u2212 5 4?

TIMSS Advanced mathematics example item 3 with student performance data, by course type: 2015-Continued Scoring guide for contructed response\nExample 4-\"Comparing rental plans\" Exhibit 5-5 shows this extended constructed-response advanced mathematics item from the topic area of equations and inequalities in the algebra content domain. This item assesses the topic using equations and inequalities to solve contextual problems. This topic is covered in both IB mathematics courses and considered foundational knowledge for both AP calculus courses (table A-3a), and was categorized as high coverage ( figure 5-9). The item requires students to apply their understanding to solve a problem within a real-world context (comparing two car rental plans) and answer two questions (parts A and B). It maps to the Advanced international benchmark level. Overall, 35 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students received full credit on this item, which was not measurably different from the international average (30 percent full credit) (see the first page of exhibit 5-5 and table B-15). A fully correct score (code 20 in the scoring guide) requires students to correctly answer both parts A and B. A correct response to part A must provide the correct answer with adequate work shown (algebraically or graphically). The algebraic solution (shown in the example student response) includes writing equations for the two different car rental plans (X and Y) and then solving the simultaneous equations to find the point at which they intersect (3000 km), or, have the same cost. In part B, a correct response requires students to understand and explain that if the same increase in initial cost is applied to both plans with no other change, the difference between the two y-intercepts remain the same. Therefore, the distance on the x-axis at which the two equations intersect will not change. U.S. performance ranged from 31 percent full credit for students who had taken AP Calculus AB (not measurably different from the U.S. total of 30 percent) to 45 percent full credit for those who had taken AP Calculus BC (higher than the U.S. total). Students received partial credit for providing a correct response to either part A (code 10, 22 percent) or part B (code 11, 5 percent) (see the second page of exhibit 5-5). A correct response to part A only (code 10) demonstrated that students could write the equations for the situation described and apply the correct procedure to find the intersection point, but they did not understand the equations well enough to explain the impact of the y-intercept change on both equations. That is, they did not demonstrate a deeper understanding beyond applying procedures to solve a pair of linear equations. The percentage of students receiving partial credit for part A only was higher for students taking AP calculus courses (24 percent) and lower for students taking non-AP mathematics courses (15 percent) than U.S. students overall. The percentage of U.S. students who demonstrated at least the level of understanding required for a correct score on part A (codes 20 and 10 combined) was 57 percent overall and ranged from 52 percent of those who had taken other (non-AP, non-IB) calculus courses to 71 percent who had taken AP Calculus BC. In contrast, 31 percent of U.S. students overall provided a completely incorrect response (code 79) on both parts A and B, and 7 percent left the item blank.\nExhibit 5-5. TIMSS Advanced mathematics example item 4 with student performance data, by course type: 2015\nExample 5-\"Properties of vectors\" Exhibit 5-6 shows this multiple-choice advanced mathematics item from the topic area of noncoordinate and coordinate geometry in the geometry content domain. It assesses the topic properties of vectors and their sums and differences, which is covered in both IB mathematics courses and is generally considered prerequisite knowledge for both AP calculus courses (table A-3c). However, it was reported by teachers to have been taught to only 81 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall at the time of the assessment, and thus is categorized as low coverage ( figure 5-9). The item requires students to use their knowledge of properties of vectors to analyze and identify equivalent statements involving two vectors, and maps to the Advanced international benchmark level. Overall, 39 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered this item correctly, which was the same as the international average (39 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 5-6 and table B-16). The correct response (option C) states that vector a is perpendicular to vector b. This response indicates that students understand that if the sum and difference of the two vectors are equal, the cosine of the angle between them is zero, which occurs when the angle is 90 degrees. U.S. performance ranged from 30 percent correct for students who had taken other (non-AP, non-IB) calculus courses (lower than the U.S. total) to 50 percent correct for those who had taken AP Calculus BC (higher than the U.S. total). The most common incorrect answer was option B, chosen by 36 percent of U.S. advanced students (see the second page of exhibit 5-6). Students who selected this option either confused the angle at which cos \u04e8 is zero or erroneously used sin \u04e8 instead of cos \u04e8 in the formula for dot product of vectors. There were no measurable differences in the prevalence of this mistake by the highest course taken. Other incorrect responses (options A and D, each 9 percent of U.S. students overall) included that the two vectors are equal or their sum is zero, both of which are indicative of a minimal of understanding of vectors.\nExhibit 5-6. TIMSS Advanced mathematics example item 5 with student performance data, by course type: 2015\nExample 6-\"Changes in animal population\" Exhibit 5-7 shows this extended constructed-response advanced mathematics item from the topic area of trigonometry in the geometry content domain. It assesses the topic solving problems involving trigonometric functions, which is covered in both IB mathematics courses and is considered foundational knowledge for both AP calculus courses (table A-3c). 51 The topic was categorized as high coverage ( figure 5-9). The item requires students to apply their understanding of trigonometric functions to solve a contextualized problem involving changes in animal population, and maps to the High international benchmark level. Overall, 36 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students received full credit for this item, which was higher than the international average (28 percent full credit) (see the first page of exhibit 5-7 and table B-17). As shown in the example student response, solving the problem involves (a) finding the maximum of the sinusoidal function and the value of the dependent variable (number of animals) at the time it occurs, and (b) determining one of the times at which the maximum occurs. The example student response provides work showing how the answers were obtained, but this was not required for full credit. Students may also use another method (not shown) based on differentiating the given function to find the time at which the maximum occurs and the number of animals at that point. A fully correct response (code 20 shown in the scoring guide) requires students to provide a correct answer for both the maximum number of animals (1500) and a correct time at which the maximum occurs (t = \u03c0/6 or one of its multiples). U.S. performance ranged from 24 percent full credit for students who had taken other (non-AP, non-IB) calculus courses (lower than the U.S. total of 36 percent) to 59 percent full credit for those who had taken AP Calculus BC (higher than the U.S. total). Students received partial credit for providing a correct answer for either the maximum value of the function (code 10, 10 percent of U.S. students) or the time at which the maximum value occurs (code 11, 6 percent of U.S. students) (see the second page of exhibit 5-7). For these types of responses, students either made an error or did not provide an answer for one part of the question. Overall, about half (51 percent) of U.S. students demonstrated conceptual understanding of trigonometric functions by providing a complete or partial response (codes 20, 10, and 11 combined). These percentages varied by mathematics course, ranging from 40 percent of students who had taken other (non-AP, non-IB) calculus courses to 77 percent of students who had taken AP Calculus BC, despite the fact that mathematics teachers reported that trigonometric functions had been taught to virtually all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students by the time of the assessment (table A-3c). 52 Thirty-two percent of U.S. students overall attempted the problem but provided completely incorrect responses (code 79), while 16 percent left the item blank. There were no measurable differences in the percentage of students providing an incorrect response across the advanced mathematics courses except AP Calculus BC (18 percent, lower than the 32 percent of U.S. students overall). In comparison, the percentage of students who did not attempt the problem (left the item blank) ranged from 4 percent of students taking AP Calculus BC to 29 percent of those taking other (non-AP, non-IB) calculus courses. e number of animals in a certain population P(t) varies periodically with time t. is can be modeled by What is the maximum number of animals?

In sum, these differences in coursetaking patterns mean that not all U.S. students have had the same exposure to the physics topics assessed in TIMSS Advanced. In particular, those students whose highest physics course was AP Physics 1 (42 percent of TIMSS Advanced students overall, table 2-3)-and the relatively large proportion of Hispanic students (58 percent) and town students (56 percent) in this course (figures 3-5 and 3-6)-are less likely to have covered the more advanced topics in electricity and magnetism (table A-4b) and in wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics (table A-4c), as well as the topics related to thermodynamics in the mechanics and thermodynamics content domain (table A-4a) than students in higher level AP physics courses. 4.1 Analysis and reporting for subsections 5.1 and 6.1: student performance results based on scale scores and international benchmarks\nSubsections 5.1 and 6.1 describe U.S. TIMSS Advanced students' performance in advanced mathematics and physics, respectively, using scale scores and international benchmarks.\nPerformance was especially high for students who had taken the AP Physics C course in electricity and magnetism (537), the majority of whom had also taken the C-level course in mechanics (table 6-1). On average, these students performed higher than the U.S. average in all three content domains, ranging from 85 points higher in wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics to 138 points higher in electricity and magnetism (table 6-2). They also were the only specific course group whose average score was either higher than, or not measurably different from, the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoint, overall and on each content subscale. 54 Students who had taken AP Physics B as their highest level physics course (in their junior year or prior), on average, did not have measurably different scores from U.S. students overall (442 vs. 437), while students who had taken AP Physics 1 as their highest physics course (in their senior year) scored, on average, below the U.S. average overall (407 vs. 437) and the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoint (table 6-1). These students also scored below the U.S. averages on all three content subscales (table 6-2). The average score differences for students who had taken AP Physics 1 ranged from 25 points below the U.S. average in mechanics and thermodynamics to 41 points below the average in electricity and magnetism. Less than half of TIMSS Advanced topics are explicitly covered in the AP Physics 1 curriculum, and for students taking AP Physics 1 in the 2014-15 school year (42 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced physics students), this may be their first high school physics course. None of the TIMSS Advanced topics in electricity and magnetism are fully covered in AP Physics 1 (table 3-2). Students who had taken non-AP physics courses (402 points), including those who had taken IB Physics (360 points), had average scores that were not measurably different from the U.S. average (437 points) but were lower than the scale centerpoint (table 6-1). The same pattern holds true for content subscales (table 6-2). Most students who had taken IB Physics were in the standard-level course, which, in contrast to the higher-level IB physics course, does not cover all of the TIMSS Advanced physics topics (table 3-2). In terms of the cognitive domains (i.e., knowing, applying, and reasoning), the patterns of performance by course type were generally similar to the content domain results. Relative to the U.S. average, U.S. student performance on the three cognitive subscales did not vary significantly by whether or not students had taken an AP physics course, but did vary by AP course level (table 6-3). Students who had taken an AP Physics C course, as well as those who had taken AP Physics 2, had average scores above the U.S. average on all three cognitive subscales, while those who had taken AP Physics 1 had average scores below the U.S. overall on all three. Students who had taken an AP Physics C course or AP Physics 2 had average scores that were not measurably different from the scale centerpoint in all three cognitive domains, except for those whose highest course was AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism, who performed on average above the scale centerpoint on the knowing and reasoning subscales, and those whose highest course was AP Physics C-Mechanics, who performed on average below the scale centerpoint on the applying subscale. Students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 or IB Physics had average scores lower than the scale centerpoints on all three subscales. The percentage of students in the physics population is based on the weighted counts of students in the sample. 3 The score difference is calculated by subtracting the subgroup average score from the U.S. average score. 4 The score difference is calculated by subtracting the subgroup average score from the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoint.

Data in the AP Physics B category are generally for students who took this as their highest physics course in 2013-14 or prior. However, a small number of schools still reported offering a 1-year course identified as AP Physics B in 2014-15. 6 A large majority of the students whose highest course was AP Physics C-E/M had also taken AP Physics C-M (89 percent), whether sequentially or in a combined course. 7 Includes both higher-level and standard-level IB physics courses. 8 Includes other types of second-year physics courses (including \"honors\" and \"regents\" courses).

Only the 53 percent of Physics C mechanics students at the Intermediate benchmark was higher than the U.S. total, and there were no measurable differences between the percentage of AP Physics C-Mechanics students and the international medians for any of the benchmarks. Among U.S. students whose highest course was AP Physics B or 2, there were no measurable differences between the percentages of students reaching any of the benchmarks and the U.S. total or the international medians-except for the 56 percent of AP Physics 2 students who reached the Intermediate benchmark, which was higher than the U.S. total. Among students whose highest course was AP Physics 1, some 1 percent reached the Advanced benchmark, 9 percent reached the High benchmark, and 28 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark; these percentages were lower than the U.S. total (and international medians) for all benchmarks.\n\n\n\n3 Includes higher-level and standard-level IB physics courses. 4 Includes other types of second-year physics courses (including \"honors\" or \"regents\" courses).

Average percent correct is the percent correct averaged across items. In this report, averages are computed for different item sets to provide results for a. physics overall (across all physics items), b. each content domain, and c. each broad topic area within a content domain. Relative performance by content domain and topic area is determined by comparison to the average percent correct for physics overall.\nContent domain/topic area average is lower than physics (all content domains and topic areas) average (p < .05). 1 Average percent correct is the weighted percentage of students receiving full credit (1 point on multiple-choice items, 1 point on short constructedresponse items, and 2 points on extended constructed-response items) or partial credit (1 point on extended constructed-response items), averaged across items. SOURCE: International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced, 2015.(TIMSS) Advanced, 2015. \u2022 In wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics, the average percent correct for one topic area (wave phenomena) was relatively higher (44 percent) than physics overall, while that in the other topic area (atomic and nuclear physics) was not measurably different than physics overall.\nFour physics topics are in the high coverage category, and three are in the moderate category, all but one of which are from the topic areas related to mechanics (forces and motion and laws of conservation). The majority of physics topics (16 of 23) are in the low coverage category-including 3 of 9 topics from mechanics and thermodynamics (all related to thermodynamics) and all topics from electricity and magnetism and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics (except mechanical waves). The sections below describe the range of U.S. item performance on TIMSS Advanced physics topics in the high, moderate and low coverage categories.\nThe low-coverage category includes three topics from the topic area of wave phenomena and four topics from the topic area of atomic and nuclear physics. All these topics (except thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength) are included in the intended curricula for AP Physics B, AP Physics 2 and the higher level IB Physics course, while none are included for AP Physics 1, except a portion of the topic on reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction (table A-4c). The specialized AP Physics C courses in mechanics and electricity and magnetism also do not include any of these topics. As noted above for thermodynamics topics, students may have covered some of these topics in prior courses, but their AP Physics teachers may not know this. Based on teachers' reports, coverage of these topics in the implemented curriculum varied across topics and courses. The percentage of students overall who had been taught the topics from the topic area of wave phenomena ranged from 53 percent (thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength) to 73 percent (electromagnetic radiation), and U.S. item performance ranged from 11 percent correct (thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength) to 65 percent correct (electromagnetic radiation) ( figure 6-9). Coverage of the topics from the topic area of atomic and nuclear physics ranged from 45 percent of students taught overall (mass-energy equivalence in nuclear reactions and particle transformations) to 73 percent (structure of the atom and its nucleus; atomic number and atomic mass; electromagnetic emission and absorption and the behavior of electrons). As might be expected, the percentage of AP Physics 1 students who had been taught the topics related to nuclear physics was very low (between 20 and 30 percent). Even for AP Physics B and AP Physics 2, where the topics are included in the intended curriculum, many students had not been taught these topics by the time of the assessment (between 75 and 85 percent taught). Only for the IB Physics courses did teachers report nearly universal coverage of these topics. In comparison, about 60 percent of students in other non-AP, non-IB physics courses had been taught these topics. U.S. item performance in the two topics related to nuclear reactions ranged from 9 to 59 percent correct. The two items in this topic with the lowest performance (9 percent correct) were constructed-response items that required detailed or quantitative understanding of the nuclear process. In comparison, the three items on structure of the atom and its nucleus; atomic number and atomic mass; electromagnetic emission and absorption and the behavior of electrons were clustered in the mid-performance range (35 to 41 percent correct). Despite the low topic coverage for wave-particle duality and the photoelectric effect (50 percent of students taught overall), U.S. performance on the specific set of items that assess this topic was more clustered on the upper half of the performance range (47 to 69 percent correct).      1 Percent correct is the percentage of students receiving credit on each item. For multiple-choice and short constructed-response items (each worth one score point), this reflects the percentage of students who provided a correct answer. For extended constructed-response items, this reflects the weighted percentage of students receiving full credit (2 points) or partial credit (1 point).\n\n\n\nExhibit 6-4. TIMSS Advanced physics example item 3 with student performance data, by course type: 2015\nExample 4-\"Fish generates an electric field\" Exhibit 6-5 shows this multiple-choice item from the topic area of electricity and electric circuits and the topic of charged particles in an electric field in the electricity and magnetism content domain that requires students to identify the direction of the electric force on a charged object in an electric field. While the topic of electrostatic attraction or repulsion between isolated charged particles-Coulomb's law is widely covered in all of the TIMSS Advanced-eligible physics courses (except the AP Physics C course in mechanics), the topic of charged particles in an electric field is not covered in the first-year AP Physics 1 course (table A-4b). Charged particles in an electric field was reported by physics teachers to have been taught to 74 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall. The item maps to the Intermediate international benchmark level, and the topic was categorized low coverage (figure 6-9). Overall, 43 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered the item correctly, which was lower than the international average (51 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 6-5 and table B-26). The correct response (option C) identifies the direction of the net electric force on the positively charged object as being parallel to the closest electric field line and pointed away from the positively charged head. U.S. advanced students who had taken AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) or AP Physics 2 performed above the U.S. total of 43 percent, with 61 and 65 percent, respectively; whereas students who had taken AP Physics 1 performed lower than the U.S. total, with 35 percent correct. These AP Physics 1 students, who have studied electrostatic attraction/repulsion between isolated charges, are not likely to have covered this type of problem involving electric fields due to multiple charges. The most common incorrect response (option A, 38 percent overall) identifies an incorrect direction that points toward the negatively charged tail (and is essentially perpendicular to the electric field line) (see the second page of exhibit 6-5). This misconception demonstrates a lack of knowledge about electric fields and does not account for the net electric force resulting from the positive and negative charges on the fish based on their relative distances from the positively charged object. Instead, it points in a direction that would occur from only the attraction of the positively charged object toward the negative tail. The prevalence of this misconception varied by course type. The percentage of students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 and who selected option A (45 percent) was higher than the U.S. total, whereas the percentages of students who had taken AP Physics 2 or AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) and selected option A were lower than the U.S. total (23 percent and 25 percent, respectively). These higher level AP physics courses would likely have covered both electric fields and electromagnetism, and, thus, students selecting option A who had taken these courses may be confusing the behavior of a charged particle in an electric field with the behavior of a moving charged particle in a magnetic field, where the force is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the charged particle. a Gravitational attraction prevents the ball from rebounding fully. b All the kinetic energy of the ball is transformed into potential energy during impact.\nc On the way up, the force on the ball will decrease. d Some mechanical energy of the ball is transformed into heat. Subgroup/international average percent correct is significantly lower than U.S. total percent correct (p < .05). Subgroup/international average percent correct is significantly higher than U.S. total percent correct (p < .05). Exhibit 6-5. TIMSS Advanced physics example item 4 with student performance data, by course type: 2015-Continued Scoring guide for multiple choice\nExample 5-\"Electron beam in a magnetic field\" Exhibit 6-6 shows this multiple-choice item from the topic area of magnetism and electromagnetic induction and the topic of charged particles in a magnetic field in the electricity and magnetism content domain that requires students to predict the change in motion of an electron beam moving in an applied magnetic field. Like the topic assessed in the previous example (charged particles in an electric field), the topic assessed in example 5 (charged particles in a magnetic field) is covered in IB Physics and in the AP Physics B, 2, and C (electricity and magnetism) courses, but is not covered in AP Physics 1 (table A-4b). It was reported by teachers to have been taught to 58 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall at the time of the assessment. This item maps to the Advanced international benchmark level, and the topic was categorized as low coverage ( figure 6-9). Overall, 23 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered the item correctly, which was lower than the international average (32 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 6-6 and table B-27). The correct response (option B) identifies that the electron beam will curve up out of the plane of the page. This direction results from a correct application of the \"right-hand rule\" for an electron (negative charge) moving in a uniform magnetic field (force is perpendicular to both the direction of the magnetic field and the velocity of the electron). As was the case with the previous item involving electric fields, students whose highest course was AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) or AP Physics 2 (36 percent and 40 percent correct, respectively) performed above the U.S. total of 23 percent, whereas students who had taken AP Physics 1 (14 percent correct) performed below the U.S. total, as they would not likely have covered this advanced topic at the time of the assessment. The most common incorrect response overall (option C) identifies that the electron beam curves down (in the direction of the magnetic field) (see the second page of exhibit 6-6). This type of response demonstrates the misconception that the behavior of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is analogous to that in a uniform electric field (force is parallel to the direction of the electric field), and 36 percent of U.S. students chose this option. The prevalence of this misconception was higher among students who had taken AP Physics 1 (46 percent) than among U.S. students overall. In contrast, it was lower among students who had taken AP Physics B, 2, or C (electricity and magnetism)-at 24 percent, 16 percent, and 15 percent, respectively-than among U.S. students overall. Among students who had taken AP Physics B, AP Physics 2 or AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) courses, option A (beam curves down into the page) was the most common incorrect response (35 to 39 percent). This response shows that students know that the force on the electron beam will be perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the electrons, but they make an error in applying the \"right-hand rule.\"\nExhibit 6-6.

AP Physics B was a 1-year physics course that was discontinued after the 2013-14 school year and was replaced with the 2-year course sequence AP Physics 1 and 2 beginning in 2014-15. Data in the AP Physics B category are generally for students who took this as their highest physics course in 2013-14 or prior.

Thus, the percentage in the correct category (option B in the scoring guide) may be slightly different from what is shown for percent correct on the first page of the exhibit (which excludes students in the not-reached category). 8 Blank includes both students who omitted the item and those who did not reach the item. NOTE: International average is the item percent correct, averaged across the countries participating in the TIMSS Advanced physics assessment. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.  Exhibit 6-7 shows this multiple-choice item from the topic area of atomic and nuclear physics in the wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics content domain. It requires knowing the concept of mass-energy equivalence to identify what accounts for the difference in the mass of an atom before and after a nuclear reaction. The topic mass-energy equivalence in nuclear reactions and particle transformations is covered in IB Physics, AP Physics B, and AP Physics 2. It is not covered in either AP Physics 1 or AP Physics C (table A-4c). Students in the more advanced AP Physics C courses may have had this topic in a previous first-year physics course, but students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 are not likely to have covered this topic. However, the topic of nuclear reactions may be covered in upper-level high school chemistry courses and some U.S. students may have learned this topic in these courses. Physics teachers reported that this topic had been taught to 45 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students at the time of the assessment. This item maps to the High international benchmark level, and the topic was categorized as low coverage (figure 6-9). Overall, 42 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered the item correctly, which was not measurably different from the international average (44 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 6-7 and table B-28). The correct response (option A) relates the loss of mass of the atom and neutron to the energy emitted (gamma ray). Compared to the U.S. total of 42 percent correct, performance was higher for students taking AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) (61 percent correct), while performance was lower for students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 (35 percent correct). There were two similarly common incorrect responses chosen by U.S. students, option B (23 percent) and option C (26 percent) (see the second page of exhibit 6-7). Students who chose option B incorrectly related the difference in mass to ionization (removal of an electron). This response demonstrates the misconception that the mechanism of neutron capture and gamma emission involves the ionization of electrons in the outer shell of the atom (which are involved in chemical rather than nuclear reactions). This misconception was less common among students who had taken AP Physics B (9 percent) than among U.S. students overall. Students who chose option C demonstrated the misunderstanding that the addition of a neutron results in an isotope with lower atomic mass. The percentage of students selecting this incorrect response ranged from 15 percent of students who had taken AP Physics C (electricity and magnetism) or AP Physics 2 to 30 percent of students who had taken AP Physics 1 and 37 percent who had taken AP Physics B.\nExhibit 6-7.

It was designed as a second-year high school course covering a range of physics topics that are typically covered in a first-year introductory, algebra-based college physics course, including Newtonian mechanics, fluid and thermal physics, electricity and magnetism, waves and optics, and atomic and nuclear physics. As such, AP Physics B students were generally expected to have taken a prior introductory high school physics course and to have knowledge of algebra and basic geometry and trigonometry. Because TIMSS Advanced was administered in the spring of 2015 (when this course had been largely discontinued), most U.S. TIMSS Advanced students whose highest course was AP Physics B completed this course in their junior year. 20"}, {"section_title": "AP Physics 1 and 2", "text": "AP Physics 1 and 2 is a 2-year sequence that replaced AP Physics B in the 2014-15 school year. These two courses are the equivalent of the first and second semesters of an introductory, algebra-based college physics course that together cover the same topics as AP Physics B, but in more depth. The AP Physics 1 and 2 sequence provides a foundation in physics to support future advanced coursework in the sciences. Since 2014-15 was the first year that AP Physics 1 and 2 were offered, schools were in transition and the specific courses that students took varied. The majority of students took AP Physics 1 in their senior year. Others took both AP Physics 1 and 2, which some schools offered as one-semester courses to provide equivalent topic coverage as AP Physics B in the same time span, while other students took only AP Physics 2 in their senior year. AP Physics 1 does not require any prior high school physics and may be a first-year physics course for many students. It focuses on mechanics, with some coverage of introductory topics related to wave properties, electrostatics, and electric circuits. AP Physics 2 is intended as a second-year physics course to follow AP Physics 1 or an equivalent first-year physics course. Since the 2014-15 school year was the first year that AP Physics 2 was offered, students who took only Physics 2 in their senior year had likely taken a previous physics course. The mechanics topics covered in AP Physics 1 are considered foundational knowledge for AP Physics 2, which focuses on more advanced physics topics covering thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, wave phenomena, and atomic and nuclear physics. For AP Physics 1, students are expected to have completed geometry and be concurrently enrolled in algebra II or its equivalent. For AP Physics 2, students are expected to have taken or be concurrently enrolled in pre-calculus or its equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Other physics courses", "text": "Other physics courses (non-AP, non-IB) include state-, district-, and school-specific second-year physics courses, including those identified as \"honors\" or \"regents\" courses.

In contrast, the teacher questionnaire data on the implemented curriculum (described in 3 above) reflect teachers of all TIMSS Advancedeligible physics courses. For this and other reasons discussed below, patterns reflected in the two sources of data may differ slightly. 22 Overall, the extent of coverage of TIMSS Advanced topics in the eligible physics courses varied by course type and content domain. AP Physics B and the higher level IB physics course generally covered all or nearly all of the TIMSS Advanced topics. AP Physics C courses (mechanics, and electricity and magnetism) covered the TIMSS Advanced topics in their corresponding content areas, with the topics covered in AP Physics C-Mechanics considered foundational knowledge for AP Physics C-Electricity & Magnetism. However, coverage of other topics depended on which prior physics course(s) students had taken previously. 23 Like its predecessor AP Physics B, the curriculum for the new AP Physics 1 and 2 course sequence covers nearly all of the TIMSS Advanced topics as previously reported (Lazzaro et al. 2016). Although AP Physics 2 would not alone cover all the TIMSS Advanced topics, accompanied by AP Physics 1 or an equivalent course in a prior year (which would have been typical), the AP Physics 2 students taking the 2015 TIMSS Advanced assessment would likely have covered nearly all the topics. In contrast, the standard-level IB physics course covered about fourfifths of TIMSS Advanced physics topics (19 of 23), and AP Physics 1 covered less than half of the topics (10 of 23). This means that students whose first high school physics course was AP Physics 1 would not likely have covered the majority of the TIMSS Advanced topics. On average across the TIMSS Advanced topics in all content domains, 73 percent of U.S. students overall were reported by their physics teachers to have been taught the topics by the time of the assessment (either in the current or a prior year). 24 22 Data cited in this section for specific physics topics in each content domain are not shown in table 3-2, which summarizes the data at the topic area level. Coverage of the specific TIMSS Advanced physics topics in each topic area and the percentage of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students taught these topics in the different TIMSS Advanced-eligible courses is provided in the supplementary tables in appendix A (A-4a, A-4b, and A-4c). 23 The AP Physics C course guides do not specify particular prerequisites, so table 3-2 only indicates if the TIMSS Advanced topics are included in the associated AP course guidelines. However, because both AP Physics C courses are designed as second-year, specialist physics courses, topics included in a firstyear physics course would likely have been covered prior to Physics C. 24 Average topic coverage in the U.S. was generally low compared to other countries (most at or above 80 percent); however, there were other countries with similarly low coverage to the U.S. for topics in electricity and magnetism and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics (between 50 and 60 percent  Mechanics and thermodynamics 9 6/9 6/9 9/9 6/9 9/9 9/9 8/9 87 62-100 Topic area is covered in the course curriculum (all topics are fully or partially covered in the TIMSS Advanced-eligible physics course or are expected to have been covered in a prior physics course). Topic area is partially covered (at least one topic is not covered in the course curriculum nor specified as prerequisite knowledge). Topic area reflects foundational concepts expected for AP Physics 2 that are covered in AP Physics 1 and those expected for AP Physics C-Electricity & Magnetism that are covered in C-Mechanics. Topic area is not included in the course curriculum. The number of topics assessed in TIMSS Advanced reflects the specific physics topics included in each topic area and content domain as shown in table A-2. \"Extent of TIMSS Advanced topic coverage in the intended curriculum\" is based on the overlap of TIMSS Advanced physics topics with Advanced Placement (AP) Physics course descriptions available from the College Board and the core curriculum specified for the International Baccalaureate (IB) Physics standard-level and higher-level courses. The intended curriculum is not indicated for other TIMSS Advanced-eligible non-AP, non-IB physics courses, since the curricula for these courses vary across states, districts, and schools. The ratios shown under each course type reflect the proportion of TIMSS Advanced topics in a given content domain (and overall) that are at least partially covered in the intended curriculum for that course (or are considered foundational knowledge expected to have been covered in a prior physics course). The AP Physics C course curriculum covers a specific set of topics in mechanics and in electricity and magnetism. The extent to which other TIMSS Advanced topics have been covered in AP Physics C or prior physics courses varies across states, districts, and schools. \"Overall percentage of U.S. students taught TIMSS Advanced physics topics\" reflects the implemented curriculum. It is based, for each topic, on the number of students whose teachers reported that the students in their physics class were \"mostly taught this year\" or \"mostly taught before this year\" that respective topic. These data reflect all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students, including those taking AP, IB and other non-AP, non-IB physics courses. For students with more than one physics teacher, students are counted as \"taught\" if any of their teachers indicated that the topic was taught in the current or a prior year. Percentages shown reflect the average and the range across the topics in each topic area, content domain, and overall (all content domains).

These topics are included in the curricula for AP Physics C-Mechanics, AP Physics B, and AP Physics 1, and are considered foundational knowledge for the second-year AP Physics 2 course. Students whose highest course was AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism would likely have covered these mechanics topics in AP Physics C-Mechanics or another prior physics course. \u2022 There were three topics in mechanics and thermodynamics, however, with lower coverage in the AP and IB physics course curricula: both topics in the heat and temperature topic area and the topic on the first law of thermodynamics in the laws of conservation topic area. These topics are only fully covered in AP Physics B, AP Physics 2, and higher level IB Physics. \u2022 The teacher data generally confirmed the coverage patterns indicated by the review of curricula, showing that nearly all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students were reported to have been taught the topics in forces and motion and the two topics in laws of conservation related to mechanical energy and momentum by the time of the assessment (97 to 100 percent). In comparison, from 62 to 64 percent of students had been taught the two topics in heat and temperature and the topic on the first law of thermodynamics in laws of conservation by the time of the assessment. The coverage across these latter three topics ranged from about half of students who had taken AP Physics 1, to at least three-quarters of those who had taken AP Physics B or AP Physics 2, to all students who had taken either of the IB physics courses. 25 Coverage of these three topics for students taking other non-AP, non-IB courses ranged from 66 percent having been taught the topic on law of ideal gases to 86 percent having been taught the first law of thermodynamics. Teachers also reported that a relatively low percentage of AP Physics C students had been taught these topics (from 48 to 58 percent). 26 For the AP Physics 1 students, the teacher data indicating that about half of these students have been taught these topics (from 48 to 52 percent) appears to be in contrast with the reports on the intended curriculum, which show that the topics are covered in AP Physics 2 but not AP Physics 1. However, as mentioned in the technical notes for this section, these additional topics may also have been taught to many AP Physics 1 students in order to meet state curriculum standards for grade 12. Also, since the 2014-15 school year was the first year that the AP Physics 1 and 2 course sequence was offered, some schools may have included some of the AP Physics 2 topics as part of what was identified as an AP Physics 1 course in the transcript data in order to provide better topic coverage for their seniors who previously would have taken AP Physics B. 27 \n"}, {"section_title": "Electricity and magnetism", "text": "\u2022 All topics in electricity and magnetism were covered in the intended curricula for most of the higherlevel AP courses-AP Physics B, Physics 2 and Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism-as well as the higher level IB physics course (tables 3-2 and A-4b). In contrast, in the electricity and electric circuits topic area, AP Physics 1 only covers the topics related to electrostatics and electrical circuits at an introductory level and does not cover the topic of charged particles in an electric field at all. In the magnetism and electromagnetic induction topic area, AP Physics 1 covers none of the three topics, and the standard-level IB physics course covers only one (charged particles in a magnetic field). \u2022 The relatively lower curriculum coverage of electricity and magnetism topics and the variation in coverage across courses was generally reflected in the teacher data as well, with correspondingly low percentages of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students reported to have been taught these topic areas by the time of the assessment (66 percent overall and driven by lower percentages for students taking AP Physics 1 and other non-AP, non-IB physics courses). For example, the lowest coverage was of the topic on Faraday's and Lenz's laws of induction in the magnetism and electromagnetic induction topic area, which was reported as taught to 49 percent of students overall and just 25 percent of AP Physics I students. Notably, even in the most advanced AP Physics C-electricity and magnetism course, about one-quarter of students were not reported to have been taught this topic by the time of the assessment. (This more advanced topic may be covered toward the end of the AP Physics C course and, thus, reported by some teachers as \"not yet taught or just introduced.\") Of the other topics not covered in the AP Physics 1 curriculum, the two topics in the magnetism and induction topic area were reported as taught to 31 percent of AP Physics 1 students, but the other topic (charged particles in an electric field) was taught to over half the students (59 percent). Again, these may be topics required to meet state curriculum standards or included to provide increased topic coverage for seniors taking the new AP Physics 1 course.\n"}, {"section_title": "Wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics", "text": "\u2022 All the topics in wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics are covered in the intended curriculum for the higher-level IB physics course, and most (7 of 8) are covered in the curricula for the standard-level IB physics course, AP Physics B, and AP Physics 2 (or across the AP Physics 1 and 2 sequence) (tables 3-2 and A-4c). Few topics (2 of 8) are covered by AP Physics 1 alone, and none are covered by AP Physics C courses. Students in AP Physics C courses in their senior year would only have had these topics in a prior physics course. In wave phenomena, the topic on mechanical waves is covered in AP Physics 1, and the topic on reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction of waves is partially covered (and continued in AP Physics 2), but the other two topics (on electromagnetic radiation and on thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength) are not covered in AP Physics 1. The topic on thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength is explicitly covered only in the intended curricula for IB physics courses. Although the AP course curricula do not explicitly cover this topic, learning objectives in AP Physics 2 related to energy transfer and emission spectra build on these concepts. In atomic and nuclear physics, all four topics are included in AP Physics B, AP Physics 2, and higher-level IB Physics; and all but one (wave-particle duality) are covered in standard-level IB Physics. AP Physics C and AP Physics 1 course curricula do not cover any of the topics in this topic area. \u2022 The teacher data were more consistent with the curriculum coverage patterns for the topic area of wave phenomena than for the topic area of atomic and nuclear physics. The average percentage of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students reported to have been taught the topics in wave phenomena was 69 percent overall (ranging from 56 percent of AP Physics 1 students to all or nearly all IB physics students), which appears to be consistent with the coverage of topics in the course curricula. In contrast, the average percentage of students reported to have been taught the topics in atomic and nuclear physics was 54 percent overall, including 36 percent of students in the AP Physics 1, which does not cover any of these topics. Clearer examples of differences between the intended and implemented curriculum data are found at the individual topic level. The topic related to mechanical waves was reported as taught to the highest percentage of students (87 percent overall), reflecting at least 80 percent of students in all eligible courses, including the AP Physics C courses in which the topic is not covered (although it is likely to have been taught in a prior course). In another example, teachers reported that about half of U.S students (53 percent) had been taught the topic on thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength, which contrasts with the curriculum coverage results indicating that this topic is covered only in IB physics courses (representing 6 percent of the U.S. TIMSS Advanced population, table 2-3). It is possible that the description of this topic was interpreted by the U.S. physics teachers to include content beyond what is assessed in TIMSS Advanced. In the atomic and nuclear physics topic area, 73 percent of students overall were reported to have been taught the topic on structure of the atom and its nucleus by the time of the assessment compared to no more than half who were reported to have been taught the more advanced topics in modern physics related to wave-particle duality, types of nuclear reactions, and mass-energy equivalence. The 73 percent of students overall reported by teachers to have been taught the topics on electromagnetic radiation and structure of the atom and its nucleus includes more than half of AP Physics 1 students.

Another 16 percent had taken AP Physics B or AP Physics 2 as their highest physics course. About one-fifth of U.S. students had taken only non-AP physics courses, with 6 percent having taken IB Physics and 12 percent having taken other (non-AP, non-IB) second-year physics courses.

This was not the coursetaking pattern observed for the subsets of students who reached each of the international benchmarks in advanced mathematics.

The results presented here show how student performance on the set of items in each individual topic relates to the level of topic coverage in their advanced mathematics courses (from section 3). To examine how U.S. student performance relates to students' opportunity to learn, TIMSS Advanced topics are organized into three levels of topic coverage in the United States-high, moderate, and low-based on both the intended and implemented curriculum data (tables A-3a, A-3b, and A-3c). 42 For each topic, a graph is included that shows the distribution of percent correct for the set of items in that topic and identifies the item type: multiple-choice, short constructed-response, or extended constructed-response (figure 5-9 and table B-11). These distributions show how tightly clustered or how widely spread items are in terms of percent correct and thus indicates the range of U.S. performance across the specific set of items developed to assess each topic. Even for topics reported as taught to most students, performance across the individual items within and across topics still varies for a variety of reasons, including how challenging the content covered by the topic is, the breadth of content covered by the topic, and the specific requirements of the items and their contexts. Over half of the advanced mathematics topics (17 of 23) were in the high coverage category. These topics spanned all content domains, including seven of nine topics in algebra, five topics in calculus related to limits and derivatives and five of six topics in geometry. Three advanced mathematics topics were in the moderate coverage category-the two calculus topics from the topic area of integrals and one algebra topic involving arithmetic and geometric series. Three topics-one from each content domain-were in the low coverage category. The sections below describe the range of U.S. item performance on TIMSS Advanced mathematics topics in the high, moderate, and low coverage categories."}, {"section_title": "High level of topic coverage", "text": "All seven of the high-coverage algebra topics were reported by teachers to be universally taught, 43 and all were covered in IB mathematics course curricula or considered foundational knowledge for AP calculus covered in prerequisite courses (table A-3a). Still, there was a range of performance across the items assessing these algebra topics. For example, item performance in the topic of equivalent representations of functions tended to be on the higher end of the performance range (54 to 76 percent correct) whereas item performance in the topics of using equations and inequalities to solve contextual problems (36 to 61 percent correct); properties of functions, including domain and range (26 to 52 percent correct); and linear and quadratic equations and inequalities (26 to 58 percent) tended to be in the mid-performance range of U.S. students on the TIMSS Advanced mathematics items (figure 5-9). With the exception of one item which asks students to find the value of a compound exponent expression (71 percent correct), item performance in the topic of evaluating algebraic expressions did not exceed 50 percent correct. All five of the high-coverage calculus topics were covered across the TIMSS Advanced-eligible courses, including both AP calculus and IB mathematics courses, with teachers reporting that all or nearly all students had been taught these topics (table A-3b). 44 Performance on items in differentiation of functions tended to reflect this high coverage level and be on the higher end of the performance range (48 to 71 percent correct), as did performance on three of the four items in limits of functions (56 to 59 percent correct) (figure 5-9). Performance on the fourth item in limits of functions was 37 percent correct, the lower value of which may have been because it required students to evaluate the limit of a given function, where the input value (x) approaches a variable rather than a numerical value. In the other three items, the input value approaches infinity. On the three items in the using derivatives to solve problems topic, performance tended to be on the lower end of the range (16 to 31 percent correct). Of the high-coverage calculus topics, item performance varied most widely on topics related to using first and second derivatives to determine slope and local extrema (21 to 62 percent correct) and using first and second derivatives to sketch and interpret graphs of functions (35 to 65 percent), by 41 and 30 percentage points, respectively. Looking across the derivatives topics, it seems that many students were able to answer straightforward procedural items correctly but fewer were able to apply their knowledge of derivatives in contextualized problem situations. Among the high-coverage geometry topics, all five are considered foundational knowledge for AP calculus and would be expected to have been covered in prerequisite courses. For IB mathematics, the two topics involving trigonometric functions are covered in the course curricula, and the other three topics are considered foundational knowledge (table A-3c). In general, these high-coverage topics were reported by teachers to be taught to all or nearly all U.S. students. 45 High-coverage topics in geometry, however, tended to have the widest variation in performance among the content domains. For example, performance on items in the topic of trigonometric properties of triangles (13 to 58 percent correct) and solving problems involving trigonometric functions (1 to 44 percent correct) both ranged at least 43 percentage points (figure 5-9). 46 Item performance on the properties of geometric figures in two and three dimensions topic also ranged widely (21 to 74 percent, or 53 percentage points), though excluding the highest-performing item shows a tighter overall range for the remaining five items (21 to 45 percent, or 24 percentage points). Item performance on the topic of trigonometric functions and their graphs (37 to 61 percent) tended to be at the higher end of the range, as did item performance on the topic of using coordinate geometry to solve problems in two dimensions (43 to 60 percent) if excluding the one lower-performing item (23 percent). This lower-performing item required students to identify the equation of a circle representing a set of points. Looking across the high-coverage topics, about half of the items requiring an extended constructed-response were at the lower end of item performance within their topics (ranging from 13 to 36 percent correct), with several more not exceeding 50 percent correct. (For example, see [1] linear and quadratic equations and inequalities; exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, rational, and radical equations; and using equations and inequalities to solve contextual problems in algebra; [2] using derivatives to solve problems; using first and second derivatives to determine slope and local extrema; and using first and second derivatives to sketch and interpret graphs of functions in calculus; and [3] properties of geometric figures in two and three dimensions and trigonometric properties of triangles in geometry). However, there were some exceptions of relatively higher-performing extended constructed-response items in algebra and calculus topics. There were no other clear patterns in item performance by item type among those in the high-coverage topics.\nAll four of the high coverage topics involve mechanics and are universally taught across the TIMSS Advancedeligible physics courses (table A-4a). Still, there is a range of performance across the items assessing these topics. In particular, a broad range of item performance was found for kinetic and potential energy; conservations of mechanical energy (13 to 84 percent correct) and forces, including frictional force, acting on a body (23 to 73 percent correct) (figure 6-9). In comparison, performance on items in applying Newton's laws and laws of motion tended to be on the higher end of the performance range (45 to 85 percent), and the three items in law of conservation of momentum; elastic and inelastic collisions were clustered in the mid-performance range (44 to 50 percent correct) of U.S. students on TIMSS Advanced physics items."}, {"section_title": "Moderate level of topic coverage", "text": "The moderate coverage category included one algebra and two calculus topics. The moderate-coverage algebra topic-the nth term of arithmetic and geometric sequences and the sums of finite and infinite series-was covered in both IB mathematics courses and as foundational knowledge for AP calculus covered in prerequisite courses, but mathematics teachers reported that not all U.S. students (93 percent) were taught these topics by the time of the assessment (table A-3a). Performance on the items in this topic ranged from 35 to 61 percent correct (figure 5-9). The two moderate-coverage calculus topics-both related to integrals-were covered across the TIMSS Advanced-eligible mathematics courses, including AP calculus and IB mathematics courses. However, as with the prior algebra topic, mathematics teachers reported that not all U.S. students (95 percent) had been taught these calculus topics by the time of the assessment (table A-3b). It may be that, because these topics are generally covered toward the end of the year, they may have been introduced but not covered in depth by the time of the assessment. For the topic of evaluating and defining integrals, item performance for its six items was in the mid-performance range (30 to 65 percent) (figure 5-9). The topic of integrating functions, on the other hand, had only two items-one of which reflected one of the lowest item performances (12 percent correct) across all TIMSS Advanced mathematics items and the other relatively high item performance (66 percent correct). The former was a short constructed-response reasoning item that required students to find the antiderivative of a sinusoidal function, whereas the latter was a multiple-choice item that required students to simply recall the integral of an exponential function.\nThe three topics in the moderate coverage category include two topics related to mechanics and one topic related to mechanical waves. Like the high coverage topics, the two moderate-coverage mechanics topics are also covered in the intended curriculum across the TIMSS Advanced-eligible physics courses, but physics teachers reported that a slightly lower percentage of students (95 to 97 percent) had been taught these topics by the time of the assessment (table A-4a). With the exception of one extended constructed-response item in the topic of law of gravitation in relation to movement of celestial objects requiring students to solve a quantitative problem and show their work (13 percent correct), item performance in both of the mechanics topics was in the midperformance range (31 to 60 percent correct) (figure 6-9). The percentage of students taught the third moderate-coverage topic of mechanical waves; the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength was lower (87 percent of students overall) and varied across the different TIMSS Advanced-eligible courses, ranging from about 80 percent of students in AP Physics 1 and AP Physics C-mechanics to all or nearly all students (99-100 percent) taking AP Physics B, IB Physics, and other non-AP, IB courses (table A-4c). Performance on the items related to mechanical waves ranged from 41 to 69 percent correct, with five of six items with at least 50 percent correct (figure 6-9)."}, {"section_title": "Low level of topic coverage", "text": "The topics in the low coverage category include one topic from each of the three content domains. The algebra and calculus topics in this category were both covered in AP calculus courses and the higher-level IB mathematics course but were not covered in the standard-level IB course-although teachers did report that the topics were taught to all or nearly all U.S. students (tables A-3a and A-3b). 47 Performance on the two items in the algebra topic, operations with complex numbers, were both less than 50 percent correct (34 and 41 percent correct) (figure 5-9). Performance on the four items in the calculus topic, conditions for continuity and differentiability of functions, ranged from 21 to 62 percent correct and all were multiple-choice items. The low-coverage geometry topic, while covered in both IB mathematics courses and as foundational knowledge for AP calculus, was reported to be taught to just 81 percent of U.S. students (reflecting all students taking IB Mathematics, between 80 and 90 percent of students taking AP Calculus, and 66 percent of those taking other non-AP, non-IB calculus courses) (table A-3c). While this topic (properties of vectors and their sums and differences) is expected to have been covered prior to calculus, some calculus teachers may not have considered this to be prerequisite knowledge for their course or did not know what students had been taught in their prior courses. Item performance on this topic ranged from 21 to 38 percent correct (figure 5-9).\nThe low coverage category includes three topics related to thermodynamics (from mechanics and thermodynamics), all six topics from electricity and magnetism, and seven of eight topics from wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics. All of the low-coverage topics are included in the intended curriculum of AP Physics B, AP Physics 2 and the higher level IB physics course (except thermal radiation, temperature, and wavelength), while only three topics are even partially covered in AP Physics 1 (electrostatic attraction or repulsion between isolated charged particles; electrical circuits; and reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction) (tables A-a, A-4b PHYSICS and A-4c). The percentage of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall who had been taught the low-coverage topics by the time of the assessment ranged from 45 percent (mass-energy equivalence in nuclear reactions and particle transformations) to 82 percent (electrostatic attraction or repulsion between isolated charged particles-Coulomb's law), with most topics (13 of 16) taught to between 50 and 75 percent of students. All three topics related to thermodynamics were reported by teachers as taught to between 62 and 64 percent of students overall, which reflects about half of students taking AP Physics 1 and less than 60 percent of students taking the specialized AP Physics C courses in mechanics and electricity and magnetism (table A-4a). These topics are not included in the intended curricula of AP Physics 1 or the specialist AP Physics C courses in mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Although they may have been covered in prior physics courses, coverage may be underestimated if some AP Physics teachers do not know what topics students covered in their prior courses. The performance of U.S. students on the items covering thermodynamics ranged from 13 percent correct (heat transfer and specific heat capacities) to 71 percent correct (first law of thermodynamics) ( figure 6-9). In general, though, performance on these topics was lower than the topics at the high and moderate coverage level, with half of the low-coverage thermodynamics items (6 of 12) at or below 30 percent correct (all of which were constructed-response items). Three multiple-choice items had relatively higher performance, including two items in heat transfer and specific heat capacities (53 and 69 percent correct) involving energy transfer in familiar Earth systems (radiation from the Sun and temperature decrease when air rises) and one item in first law of thermodynamics (71 percent correct) relating work done on a container of gas to changes in internal energy and temperature. All of the topics in electricity and magnetism are included in the intended curriculum for AP Physics B, AP Physics 2, and the specialized AP Physics C course as well as the higher level IB Physics course (table A-4b). These topics are not covered in AP Physics 1 except for electrostatic attraction/repulsion and electrical circuits, which are covered at a basic level. Teachers reported that many students had not been taught some of these topics by the time of the assessment. The first three topics from the topic area of electricity and electric circuits were reported to have been taught to between 74 and 82 percent of students overall, while the last three topics from the topic area of magnetism and electromagnetic induction had been taught to between 49 and 58 percent of students. Overall, U.S. item performance covered a broad range for both the electricity and electric circuits topics (14 to 68 percent correct) and especially the magnetism and electromagnetic induction topics (5 to 74 percent correct) (figure 6-9). One exception is the topic of electrical circuits; using Ohm's law and Joule's law (which is at least partially covered in AP Physics 1) where performance on the five items was more clustered in the midperformance range (29 to 45 percent correct). The item in the topic of charged particles in a magnetic field with extremely low performance (5 percent correct) is an extended constructed-response item that requires students to predict and explain the direction of movement of a foil strip connected to a power source when it is placed next to a bar magnet. In comparison, there are two items from the topics of (a) relationship between magnetism and electricity; magnetic fields around electric conductors; electromagnetic induction and (b) Faraday's and Lenz's laws of induction with relatively higher performance (74 and 71 percent correct, respectively).

It requires students to apply Newton's laws of motion to answer two questions about the motion of a ball thrown vertically upward. Although the topic of applying Newton's laws and laws of motion-classified as high coverage (figure 6-9)-is covered in all of the TIMSS Advanced-eligible physics courses and has been taught to all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students (table A-4a), there are some common misconceptions and differences in performance depending on the specific physics courses taken. Part A is a multiple-choice item requiring students to identify the acceleration of the ball at its highest position. A correct response to part A (option D) requires students to know that the acceleration due to gravity is constant and applies equally to the ball at all positions. Part A maps to the High international benchmark level. Overall, 51 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered part A correctly, which was higher than the international average (34 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 6-2 and table B-23a). U.S. performance on part A varied by the highest physics course taken, with 28 percent of students who had taken non-AP physics courses providing a correct response (which was lower than the U.S. total of 51 percent), compared to 55 percent who had taken an AP physics course (which was higher than the U.S. total). The higher-than-average percentage for students who had taken AP physics courses was driven by the students in AP Physics C courses (75 percent correct for those taking the electricity and magnetism course and 77 percent correct for those taking the mechanics course). The percentages correct for students in AP Physics 1, 2, and B were not measurably different from the U.S. total. Of the 49 percent of U.S. students overall who did not provide a correct response to part A, most (41 percent overall) demonstrated a specific misconception that there is no acceleration when the ball momentarily stops moving as it reverses direction at its maximum height (option A) (see the second page of exhibit 6-2). This misconception was less common among students who had taken an AP Physics C course (21 percent) and more common among students taking non-AP physics courses (65 percent) than U.S. students overall (41 percent). In comparison, the percentage of students who had taken other AP physics courses demonstrating the misconception ranged from 42 to 49 percent. In part B, students were asked to determine the time duration between two points on the path of the ball. A correct response to part B (code 10 in the scoring guide) requires students to indicate that the time traveled by the ball is the same on the way up as it is on the way down, as shown in the example correct student response. This example presents a higher level student response that includes an explanation; however, an explanation is not required and students who just state that the times are the same also received full credit. Part B maps to the Intermediate international benchmark level. Overall, 64 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students answered part B correctly, which was higher than the international average (48 percent correct) (see the first page of exhibit 6-2 and table B-23b). Forty-nine percent of students who had taken non-AP physics courses provided a correct response compared to 67 percent who had taken an AP physics course (although neither of these percentages was measurably different from the U.S. total of 64 percent). Students who had taken AP Physics B or an AP Physics C course, however, performed higher than the U.S. total (75 and 73 percent, respectively). Of the 36 percent of U.S. students overall who did not provide a correct response to part B, more than half (19 percent overall) demonstrated a specific misconception that the time on the way down is shorter because PHYSICS Exhibit 6-2. TIMSS Advanced physics example item 1 with student performance data, by course type: 2015 the ball is accelerating (speeding up) on the way down and decelerating (slowing down) on the way up (code 78) (see the third page of exhibit 6-2). This misconception was more common among students who had taken an IB physics course (30 percent) and less common among students who had taken an AP Physics C course (14 percent) than among U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall. Another 15 percent of U.S. students overall provided other types of incorrect responses, and 2 percent left part B of the item blank. Exhibit continues on next page. See notes at end of exhibit. Subgroup/international average percent correct is significantly lower than U.S. total percent correct (p < .05).

It requires students to apply the law of conservation of momentum to solve a contextualized problem involving two skiers colliding. The topic of law of conservation of momentum; elastic and inelastic collisions is covered in all TIMSS Advanced-eligible physics courses (or in a prerequisite course) and has been taught to virtually all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students (table A-4a). The item maps to the High international benchmark level, and the topic was categorized as high coverage ( figure 6-9). Overall, 35 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students received full credit on this item, which was not measurably different from the international average (34 percent full credit) (see the first page of exhibit 6-3 and table B-24). To solve the problem, students must first determine that the law of conservation of momentum should be applied and then set up the appropriate equations to calculate the final velocity of the two skiers (after they collide inelastically). To receive full credit (code 20 in the scoring guide), students must get the correct answer (2 m/s) and show their work, including any equations used (as shown in the example student response). Fifty-three percent of students who had taken one or both AP Physics C courses provided a fully correct response (higher than the U.S. total of 35 percent), compared to 18 percent of students who had taken a non-AP physics course (lower than the U.S. total). Performance of students taking other AP physics courses ranged from 29 percent of those who had taken AP Physics B, to 33 and 37 percent of those who had taken AP Physics 1 or 2 as their highest course, respectively. Students received partial credit either for providing a correct answer without complete work shown (code 10, 16 percent of U.S. students) or for setting up the correct equations but arriving at an incorrect answer due to a substitution or calculation error (code 11, 1 percent of U.S. students) (see the second page of exhibit 6-3). The frequency of providing a correct answer with incomplete work was similar for total AP and total non-AP physics students (and not measurably different from U.S. students overall for any course type). Overall, 52 percent of U.S. students demonstrated conceptual understanding by providing a complete or partial response (codes 20, 10, and 11 combined). These percentages ranged widely across physics courses, from 34 percent of students who had taken non-AP physics to 75 percent of students who had taken AP Physics C, despite the fact that physics teachers reported that the topic had been taught to virtually all U.S. advanced students by the time of the assessment. Among the incorrect responses, some students showed an equation related to conservation of momentum but were unable to correctly apply this to the problem (code 77, 3 percent of U.S. students overall), while 40 percent of U.S. students provided other completely incorrect responses not based on the law of conservation of momentum (code 79) and 6 percent left the item blank. a It is one-fourth. b It is half. c It is the same.  1 Course type reflects the highest level physics course taken. If students took another course in addition to an Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) course, they are included in the AP or IB category. Students are included in the \"other physics courses\" category only if they have not taken an AP or IB course 2 Percent full credit is the percentage of students receiving full credit on an assessment item. For extended constructed-response items, there is both a correct level (worth 2 score points) and a partial level (worth 1 score point). Thus, percent full credit reflects the percentage of students who provided a fully correct response (code 20 in the scoring guide). Students who provided a partial response are not reflected in the percent full credit, but are shown in the distributions across the correct and partial response categories on page 2 of the exhibit. Students who did not reach the item were not included in the calculation of this percentage. 3 AP Physics C includes courses in mechanics (C-M) and electricity and magnetism (C-E/M). AP Physics B was a 1-year physics course that was discontinued after the 2013-14 school year and was replaced with the 2-year course sequence AP Physics 1 and 2 beginning in 2014-15. Data in the AP Physics B category are generally for students who took this as their highest physics course in 2013-14 or prior. However, a small number of schools still reported offering a 1-year course identified as AP Physics B in 2014-15. 4 A large majority of the students whose highest course was AP Physics C-E/M had also taken AP Physics C-M (89 percent), whether sequentially or in a combined course. 5 Includes both higher-level and standard-level IB physics courses; nearly all students took the standard-level course. 6 Includes other second-year physics courses (including \"honors\" or \"regents\" courses). 7 Percentages are based on the full set of responses, including students who did not reach the item. Thus, the percentage in the correct category (code 20 in the scoring guide) may be slightly different from what is shown for percent full credit on the first page of the exhibit (which excludes students in the not-reached category). 8 Blank includes both students who omitted the item and those who did not reach the item.

Example 3-\"Volume of gas\" Exhibit 6-4 shows this extended constructed-response item from the topic area of heat and temperature in the mechanics and thermodynamics content domain. It requires students to use the law of ideal gases to calculate the new volume of a gas when pressure and temperature change. The first part of the topic (law of ideal gases) is covered in AP Physics B, AP Physics 2, and IB Physics (higher level), but is not covered in AP Physics 1 or C or in IB Physics (standard level) (table A-4a). Students whose highest course was an AP physics C course may have PHYSICS covered this topic in a previous first-year physics course, but this likely varies across states, districts, and schools. Students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 are not likely to have covered this topic. However, the topic of ideal gas laws is typically covered in upper-level high school chemistry courses and some U.S. students may have learned this topic in these courses. The topic was reported by physics teachers to have been taught to 62 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall at the time of the assessment. This item maps above the Advanced international benchmark level, and the topic was categorized as low topic coverage ( figure 6-9). Overall, 11 percent of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students received full credit, which was lower than the international average (18 percent full credit) (see the first page of exhibit 6-4 and table B-25). To solve the problem, students use the ideal gas equation pV/T = constant (or pV = nRT), where T is the temperature on the Kelvin scale (K = o C + 273). To receive full credit (code 20 in the scoring guide), students must get the correct answer (2.0 m 3 ) and show their work, including any equations used (as shown in the example student response). Accepted work must include applying the initial and final conditions in the ideal gas equation to generate the equation pV 1 /T 1 = 2pV 2 /T 2 , and substituting the values for V 1 , T 1 , and T 2 to calculate the correct answer (including units). Performance on this item was lower than the U.S. overall for students who had taken AP Physics 1 or non-AP physics courses as their highest course (5 percent correct for both). Performance was higher than the U.S. total for students who had taken AP Physics 2 or C (electricity and magnetism) courses, with 25 percent and 26 percent correct, respectively. About twice as many U.S. students overall received partial credit (23 percent) as full credit (11 percent) on this item (see the second page of exhibit 6-4). Students received partial credit (code 10 or 11) for demonstrating conceptual understanding by setting up the ideal gas equations correctly but making an error. Code 10 was used when students made a calculation error or had missing or incorrect units. Code 11 was used to track a specific type of error in which students show correct work but use temperature in degrees Celsius without first converting to Kelvin. Overall, the latter error was more common for U.S. students (code 11, 17 percent) than the former error (code 10, 6 percent). Overall, 34 percent of U.S. students demonstrated conceptual understanding of ideal gas laws by providing a complete or partial response (codes 20, 10, and 11 combined). These percentages ranged widely across physics courses, from 19 percent of students whose highest course was AP Physics 1 to 61 percent of students who had taken AP Physics B and 66 percent of those taking AP Physics 2, which is consistent with expectations based on differences in topic coverage by course. The prevalence of the error in temperature scale (code 11) varied by highest physics course taken. Twentytwo percent of students who had taken AP Physics C and 32 percent of students who had taken AP Physics 2 received partial credit by making this error only, which were both higher than the U.S. total of 17 percent. In contrast, 11 percent of students who had taken AP Physics 1 and 9 percent who had taken IB Physics made this error only, which was lower than the U.S. total. Rather, 58 percent of students who had taken AP Physics 1 and 62 percent who had taken IB Physics provided incorrect responses reflecting additional types of errors (codes 71 and 79 combined) compared to 30 percent of those who had taken AP Physics 2 and 32 percent of those taking AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism).

The students taking the advanced mathematics assessment represented 12.5 percent of U.S. twelfth-graders overall, and the students taking the physics assessment represented 5.3 percent. \u2022 Most U.S. TIMSS Advanced students took an Advanced Placement (AP) course: 76 percent of students in the advanced mathematics assessment took AP calculus and 83 percent of students in the physics assessment took AP physics (section 2, tables 2-2 and 2-3). 61 Among those who had taken an AP calculus course, over twice as many had taken the lower level AP Calculus AB as had taken the higher level AP Calculus BC as their highest mathematics course. Overall, 56 percent of TIMSS Advanced students had taken AP Calculus AB as their highest mathematics course. Among those who had taken an AP physics course, over one and a half times as many students had taken the lowest level algebra-based Physics 1 compared with the highest level calculusbased Physics C courses. 62 Overall, 42 percent of TIMSS Advanced students had taken AP Physics I as their highest physics course. \u2022 U.S. students' opportunity to learn the advanced mathematics and physics content assessed in TIMSS Advanced varied by subject and highest level course they took. Generally, coverage of advanced mathematics topics in the intended and implemented curriculum was more comprehensive than the coverage of physics topics (section 3, tables 3-1 and 3-3). 63 AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, and the higher level IB mathematics course curricula generally covered all the TIMSS Advanced mathematics topics (either in the current course or in a prerequisite course). In contrast, the standard-level IB mathematics course covered 91 percent (21 of 23) of the TIMSS Advanced mathematics topics. The topics not covered by the standard-level IB course included one algebra topic (operations with complex numbers) and one calculus topic (conditions for continuity and differentiability of functions). Also, topics related to finite and infinite series in algebra and vectors in geometry appear to receive more emphasis in the IB courses and AP Calculus BC than in AP Calculus AB. On average, 61 The rest of the U.S. TIMSS Advanced students (24 percent in advanced mathematics and 17 percent in physics) were in non-AP courses, including International Baccalaureate (IB) mathematics or physics courses (high-level or standard-level) and state-, district-, or school-specific calculus or second-year physics courses. 62 AP physics courses additionally included AP Physics 2 and AP Physics B (16 percent of students combined). AP Physics C included courses in mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and combination courses. 63 See also the supplemental tables A-3a, A-3b, and A-3c; and A-4a, A-4b, and A-4c. across topics in all content domains, advanced mathematics teachers reported that the TIMSS Advanced mathematics topics were taught to 98 percent of all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students by the time of the assessment (either in the current or a prior year), which reflects an average of 99 percent for algebra, 98 percent for calculus and 96 percent for geometry. 64 The course curricula for AP Physics B, the higher-level IB physics course, as well as the twoyear AP Physics 1 and 2 course sequence covered all or nearly all the TIMSS Advanced physics topics (at least 22 of 23 topics), and the standard-level IB physics course covered most topics (19). In contrast, the first-year AP Physics 1 course curriculum covered less than half of the TIMSS Advanced physics topics (10 of 23), excluding most topics in electricity and magnetism and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics. The two AP Physics C course curricula covered all the topics in their corresponding content areas (mechanics and electricity and magnetism); coverage of other topics in thermodynamics and in wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics depend on which prior physics course(s) students had taken. On average, across topics in all content domains, physics teachers reported that the TIMSS Advanced physics topics were taught to 73 percent of all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students by the time of the assessment (either in the current or a prior year), which reflects an average of 87 percent for mechanics and thermodynamics, 66 percent for electricity and magnetism and 62 percent for wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics. The lower coverages in electricity and magnetism and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics are driven by AP Physics 1 (reflecting 42 percent of students overall); less than half of these students had been taught the topics in these content domains (49 and 46 percent on average, respectively). \u2022 U.S. students were below the TIMSS Advanced scale centerpoints in both advanced mathematics and physics. In advanced mathematics, U.S. students had an average score of 485, which was 15 score points below the scale centerpoint. In physics, U.S. students had an average score of 437, which was 63 score points below the scale centerpoint. U.S. students also performed, on average, below the centerpoints on the content domain subscales, except for the calculus subscale in advanced mathematics. In calculus, there was no measurable difference between the U.S. average score and the subscale centerpoint. In physics, average U.S. performance was especially low on the electricity and magnetism subscale (120 score points below the centerpoint). \u2022 U.S. students who took the more rigorous AP courses in calculus and physics, however, scored on average higher than students who took other courses (sections 5 and 6, tables 5-1, 5-2, 6-1, and 6-2). U.S. students who had taken an AP calculus course scored above the U.S. average in advanced mathematics (497 vs. 485), whereas those taking non-AP courses (448) scored below the U.S. average-with the pattern holding true for all three content domain subscales (algebra, calculus, and geometry). Students who had taken the higher level AP Calculus BC course tended to pull up the average score for AP calculus students overall (556 vs. 497). The average score for AP Calculus BC students was 71 points higher than the U.S. average, and these students were the only course subgroup to score higher than the international advanced mathematics centerpoint (by 56 points). U.S. student performance in physics did not vary significantly by whether or not students had taken an AP physics course but did vary by the level of AP physics course taken. U.S. students who had taken an AP Physics C course, as well as those taking AP Physics 2, scored above the U.S. average overall and on all three content domain subscales (mechanics and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics). In particular, students in the highest level AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism course had an overall average score (537) that was 100 score points higher than the U.S. average (437), and they were the only course subgroup to score higher than the international physics centerpoint (by 37 points). Students who had taken AP Physics 1 as their highest level course scored below the U.S. average overall (407 vs. 437)-a pattern that held for all three content subscales. \u2022 U.S. TIMSS Advanced students' average performance in advanced mathematics and physics varied by sex and race/ethnicity, and these differences may be related to coursetaking patterns (section 3, figures 3-1, 3-2, 3-4, and 3-5; sections 5 and 6, figures 5-1, 5-2, 6-1, and 6-2). Males outperformed females in advanced mathematics and physics overall and on all three content subscales in each subject. A higher percentage of males (21 percent) than females (17 percent) had taken the higher level AP Calculus BC; and nearly twice the percentage of males (30 percent) as females (16 percent) had taken AP Physics C as their highest physics course. In advanced mathematics, White students scored higher on average than Black and Hispanic students overall and on all three content subscales, but lower than students of Two or more races overall and on the algebra and calculus subscales. A higher percentage of White students (19 percent) had taken the higher level AP Calculus BC than Black or Hispanic students (6 and 12 percent, respectively), while a higher percentage of Black and Hispanic students had taken the lower level AP Calculus AB (72 and 74 percent, respectively) compared to 52 percent of White students. There were no measurable performance differences between Asian students and White students in advanced mathematics, nor in the percentages taking either AP calculus course. In physics, White students scored higher on average than Black and Hispanic students overall and on all three content subscales. A higher percentage of White students (28 percent) had taken one or both of the highest level AP Physics C courses than Black students (14 percent). A higher percentage of Hispanic students (58 percent) than White students (40 percent) had taken the lowest level AP Physics 1 course. There were no measurable performance differences between Asian students and White students in physics, nor in the percentages taking the highest level AP Physics C courses. \u2022 Average U.S. performance also varied by school locale (urban, suburban, town, or rural), but only for advanced mathematics; average performance did not vary by school control (public or private) for either subject (sections 5 and 6, figures 5-3 and 6-3). Suburban students scored higher on average than rural students in advanced mathematics overall and on all three content subscales. A higher percentage of suburban students took AP Calculus BC than their rural (and town) counterparts. There were no measurable differences in average physics scores among students from different locales on physics overall or on the three content subscales, although a higher percentage of suburban students took an AP Physics C course than students from urban and town locales. \u2022 The percentages of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students reaching each of the three international benchmarks-Advanced, High, and Intermediate-were higher than the respective international medians in advanced mathematics, but in physics the percentages were lower or not measurably different than the international medians (sections 5 and 6, figures 5-4 and 6-4). In advanced mathematics, 7 percent of U.S. students reached the Advanced benchmark, 26 percent reached the High benchmark, and 56 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark. These percentages were all higher than the international medians (2, 14, and 43 percent, respectively). In physics, 5 percent of U.S. students reached the Advanced benchmark, 18 percent reached the High benchmark, and 39 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark. These percentages were not measurably different than the international medians for the Advanced and High benchmarks (5 and 18 percent, respectively). However, the percentage of U.S. students reaching the Intermediate benchmark was lower than the international median (46 percent). \u2022 U.S. students who had taken the highest level AP calculus and AP physics courses reached the international benchmarks in higher proportions than U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall, while the proportion of students who had taken the lower level AP (or non-AP) courses reaching each benchmark were, generally, lower than or not measurably different from the U.S. total (sections 5 and 6, figures 5-4, 5-8, 6-4, and 6-8). Among students who had taken AP Calculus BC, 20 percent reached the Advanced benchmark, 56 percent reached the High benchmark, and 85 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark in advanced mathematics. These percentages were higher than the U.S. total (7, 26, and 56 percent, respectively). In comparison, among students who had taken Calculus AB, 5 percent of students reached the Advanced benchmark, 22 percent reached the High benchmark, and 54 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark. Among students who had taken a non-AP course as their highest mathematics course, lower percentages of students reached the Advanced (2 percent), High (12 percent) and Intermediate benchmarks (39 percent) than the U.S. total. Among students who had taken AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism, 18 percent of students reached the Advanced benchmark, 49 percent reached the High benchmark, and 77 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark in physics. These percentages were higher than the U.S. total (5, 18, and 39 percent, respectively). In contrast, among students whose highest course was AP Physics 1, only 1 percent reached the Advanced benchmark, 9 percent reached the High benchmark, and 28 percent reached the Intermediate benchmark; these percentages were lower than the U.S. total for all benchmarks. For the other AP physics courses (C-Mechanics, B and 2), the percentages reaching the international benchmarks were generally not measurably different from the U.S. total, with the exception of the 53 percent of students who had taken AP Physics C in mechanics and the 56 percent who had taken AP Physics 2 reaching the Intermediate benchmark, both of which were higher than the U.S total. \u2022 The coursetaking patterns of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students reaching the different achievement levels in advanced mathematics and physics differed from the coursetaking patterns in the population overall. In both subjects, the percentage of students reaching the Advanced and High benchmarks who had taken the most advanced AP courses was higher than U.S. students overall (19 percent taking AP Calculus BC and 10 percent taking the AP Physics C course in electricity and magnetism). In advanced mathematics, 55 percent of students reaching the Advanced benchmark and 41 percent of those reaching the High benchmark had taken AP Calculus BC. In physics, 34 percent of students reaching the Advanced benchmark and 26 percent of those reaching the High benchmark had taken AP Physics C-Electricity and Magnetism (the majority of whom had also taken AP Physic C-Mechanics). \u2022 The percentages of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students reaching the international benchmarks varied by student characteristics in both advanced mathematics and physics and varied by school characteristics in advanced mathematics (sections 5 and 6, figures 5-5, 5-6, 5-7, 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7). In advanced mathematics, higher percentages of male students reached each of the three international benchmarks than U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall. In contrast, lower percentages of female students and Black students reached each of the three benchmarks than students overall. Additionally, higher percentages of White students and suburban students reached the High and Intermediate benchmarks compared to students overall, whereas lower percentages of Hispanic and rural students did so. Also, a higher percentage of students of Two or more races reached the Intermediate benchmark and a lower percentage of rural students reached the Advanced benchmark than U.S. students overall. There were no measurable differences in the percentages of students reaching any of the benchmarks by school control. In physics, higher percentages of male students reached each of the three international benchmarks than U.S. TIMSS Advanced students overall. In contrast, lower percentages of female, Black, and Hispanic students reached all three benchmarks than students overall. Additionally, higher percentages of White students reached the High and Intermediate benchmarks compared to U.S. students overall. Unlike advanced mathematics, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of U.S. students reaching any of the physics benchmarks by school locale. Nor were there differences by school control. \u2022 In both advanced mathematics and physics, the average percent correct for U.S. students on TIMSS Advanced items was higher in two of the three content domains (and in specific topic areas) than on advanced mathematics and physics items overall (sections 5 and 6, tables 5-4 and 6-4, figures 5-9 and 6-9). In advanced mathematics, the U.S. average percent correct was higher on the items in algebra and calculus (46 and 47 percent, respectively) and lower on the items in geometry (38 percent) compared to advanced mathematics overall (44 percent correct). Within the three advanced mathematics content domains, the U.S. average percent correct was notably higher than advanced mathematics overall in the algebra topic area of equations and inequalities (53 percent), as well as in the algebra topic area of functions and all three topic areas in calculus. Topic areas in which U.S. average percent correct was lower were expressions and operations in algebra and both topic areas in geometry. In physics, the U.S. average percent correct was higher on the items in mechanics and thermodynamics and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics (44 and 43 percent, respectively) and lower on the items in electricity and magnetism (36 percent), compared to physics items overall (42 percent). Within the three physics content domains, the U.S. average percent correct was notably higher than physics overall in the topic areas of forces and motion and laws of conservation in mechanics and thermodynamics (48 and 49 percent, respectively), as well as in wave phenomena. Topic areas in which U.S. average percent correct was lower were heat and temperature in mechanics and thermodynamics and both topic areas in electricity and magnetism. \u2022 U.S. performance on TIMSS Advanced mathematics and physics items ranged widely and was not strictly related to the level of topic coverage. Level of topic coverage (high, moderate, or low) was based on coverage in the curricula of eligible courses and whether the topic was reported as taught by the time of the assessment; topic coverage was markedly greater for advanced mathematics than for physics (sections 5 and 6, figures 5-9 and 6-9). Even for topics reported as taught to most students, performance across the individual items within and across topics still varies for a variety of reasons, including how challenging the content covered by the topic is, the breadth of content covered by the topic, and the specific requirements of the items and their contexts. Nearly three-quarters of the advanced mathematics topics (17 of 23) were in the high coverage category. Of the other 6 advanced mathematics topics, 3 were in the moderate coverage category and 3 were in the low coverage category. In contrast, the majority of the 23 physics topics were in the low-coverage category (16), compared to 4 in the high and 3 in the moderate coverage categories. In advanced mathematics, item performance in the United States ranged from 1 to 76 percent correct across content domains. The topics in each coverage category generally spanned all content domains (with the exception being the moderate coverage category, which had no topics from geometry). However, there were no strong patterns observed between coverage levels and item performance. The topics at each coverage level had examples of relatively higher item performance and relatively lower item performance; in addition, there were some topics with wide-ranging item performance and others where item performance was more tightly clustered within topics. And while the items that required an extended constructed-response in highcoverage topics tended to be associated with relatively lower item performance, this was not uniformly the case. Of the three low-coverage mathematics topics, two were not covered in the standard-level IB mathematics course curriculum and one was expected to have been covered in a prerequisite course that AP calculus (and other calculus) teachers reported as not taught. In physics, item performance in the United States ranged from 5 to 85 percent correct, and there were some patterns in topic coverage levels by content domain. For example, all the high-coverage, and two of the three moderate-coverage, topics were from the content domain of mechanics and thermodynamics and related to mechanics. In contrast, the low-coverage topics included all those from the content domains of electricity and magnetism and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics (except mechanical waves, which was at the moderate-coverage level), as well as the three thermodynamics topics from the content domain of mechanics and thermodynamics. For these topics (most not covered at all in AP Physics 1), the range of item performance tended to be lower than for topics at the high-and moderate-coverage levels. Additionally, the low-coverage topics also included most of the lowest-performing physics items. Because AP Physics 1 was the highest physics course taken by 42 percent of U.S. students, this contributed to lower U.S. performance overall on items measuring these topics. \u2022 U.S. students demonstrated some common approaches, misconceptions, and errors on the TIMSS Advanced mathematics and physics items, including those covering topics that had a high level of coverage across the U.S. TIMSS Advanced-eligible courses and where U.S. students performed relatively well on average (section 3 tables and supplementary tables in appendix A, section 5.2 and 6.2 tables and figures, and section 5.3 and 6.3 example item exhibits referenced below). Advanced mathematics example items illustrated common approaches, misconceptions, and errors related to \u00bb Solving problems in real-life contexts: In general, solving problems in real-life contexts was more difficult for U.S. students than noncontextualized problems involving similar mathematical concepts. For example, in the context of maximizing a profit (exhibit 5-4), only 16 percent of U.S. students correctly differentiated the profit function, calculated the point at which the profit will be a maximum, and verified the solution to show that they indeed found the maximum point. More than half of U.S. students (55 percent) did not take a meaningful approach to the problem, and another 13 percent did not even attempt the item. Another item (exhibit 5-7) required students to apply their understanding of trigonometric functions to solve a contextualized problem involving changes in animal population. Thirty-six percent of U.S. students received full credit on this item by correctly calculating the maximum number of animals and also the time at which this will occur. In comparison, U.S. student performance was higher on a noncontextualized example item (exhibit 5-3) requiring students to determine the second derivative of a rational function (52 percent full credit). In both these latter example items, however, between about onequarter and one-third of students did not make a meaningful attempt at the problemsalthough this was less common among students taking the highest level AP calculus course. \u00bb Understanding concepts and procedures: U.S. students did not always demonstrate a deep understanding of the mathematics concepts and procedures applied to solve problems. For example, in the context of comparing two rental plans (exhibit 5-5), students were required to solve simultaneous linear equations to find the point where they intersect and then to predict and explain what would happen under a different set of conditions. While the majority of U.S. students (57 percent) at least wrote the linear equations from the situation and applied the correct procedure to determine the point at which one plan would become cheaper, only about one-third (35 percent) understood the concepts well enough to explain that an equal increase in the initial cost for both plans will not change the difference between the y-intercepts or the slopes of the lines, and, therefore, the points at which the two lines intersect would not change. \u00bb Understanding properties of vectors: U.S. students did not perform well on most items in the geometry topic related to properties of vectors, nor in the geometry content domain, when compared to advanced mathematics overall. In the example item involving sums of vectors (exhibit 5-6), just 39 percent of U.S. students provided a correct response and earned full credit. Just as commonly, U.S. students selected an incorrect option (36 percent) that either confused the angle at which cos \u04e8 is zero, or erroneously used sin \u04e8 instead of cos \u04e8 in the formula for dot product of vectors. Another 9 percent of students each selected two other incorrect options, which demonstrated a similar minimal understanding of the properties of vectors. Although this topic is covered in the intended curriculum or prerequisite courses for IB mathematics and AP calculus, teachers reported relatively lower percentages of students having been taught the topic-81 percent of U.S. students overall. Physics example items illustrated common approaches, misconceptions, and errors related to \u00bb Applying Newton's laws of motion: While U.S. students performed relatively well in the topic area of forces and motion, many had difficulty applying Newton's laws of motion in problem-solving situations. For example, in the context of a ball thrown upward (exhibit 6-2), 41 percent of U.S. students overall incorrectly indicated that there is no acceleration at the moment that the ball stops moving upward and reverses direction at its maximum height. In addition, 36 percent of students did not know that the amount of time the ball travels is the same on the way up as it is on the way down, with more than half of these students (19 percent overall) incorrectly indicating that the ball takes longer to go up than to come down because the ball is decelerating (slowing down) on the way up. These types of misconceptions were less common among students who had taken an AP physics C course (21 percent and 14 percent demonstrating the two different misconceptions) than U.S. students overall. \u00bb Understanding electric and magnetic fields: Average U.S. performance was lowest on the items in electricity and magnetism compared to physics overall, and many U.S. students demonstrated a lack of understanding of electric and magnetic fields. In one item (exhibit 6-5), for example, less than half of U.S. students were able to identify the direction of the electric force on a charged object in an electric field. On another item (exhibit 6-6), only about one-quarter of U.S. students could predict the change in the motion of an electron beam moving in an applied magnetic field. These topics are not well covered across all U.S. physics courses, but even in the higher level AP courses where these topics are covered, some students confused the direction of force on charged particles due to electric fields (in the direction of the electric field) with the direction of force due to magnetic fields (perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field)-albeit at lower frequency than U.S. students overall. \u00bb Solving quantitative problems: The TIMSS Advanced physics assessment includes both qualitative (conceptual) problems and quantitative problems that require calculations. Many of the quantitative problems require students to show their work, including any equations used, for full credit. For example, one item involving a collision of two skiers (exhibit 6-3) required students to use the law of conservation of momentum to determine the final velocity of the skiers. About half of U.S. students (52 percent) demonstrated that they conceptually understood how to solve the problem by writing out the correct equations to receive full credit, but 17 percent either made a calculation error or showed incomplete work. Such errors were made by both AP and non-AP physics students with similar frequency."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and future research", "text": "Together, these results expand upon the overview of U.S. performance provided in NCES' initial report on TIMSS Advanced (Provasnik et al. 2016). They focus specifically on U.S. students and highlight differences in coursetaking patterns by sex and race/ethnicity, noting the higher enrollment in the most advanced AP courses by male students and by White students. This pattern is further reflected in differences in performance favoring these groups and adds to an existing of body of research that demonstrates the relationship of AP coursework and/or AP-exam-taking with a host of positive outcomes including college entrance exam scores, enrollment, grades, course completion, persistence, and on-time completion rates (NCES 2019, Patterson et al. 2011, Mattern et al. 2013, Mustafa and Compton 2017. Further research using TIMSS Advanced might more fully explore the relationship of coursetaking and achievement gaps at the individual student level, examining performance differences between groups within courses. Differences in coursetaking patterns across student subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, and school locale are likely to be impacted by a number of factors, including students' access to the specific advanced mathematics and physics courses offered in their schools and student enrollment choices in these courses. Schools that offer AP and IB courses (and particularly the highest level AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C courses) may vary within and across states and districts. Male and female students in the TIMSS Advanced sample generally attend the same high schools, so gender differences are more likely to reflect student enrollment choices (Broughman et al. 2019, Mitchell et al. 2017). In the case of race/ethnicity and school locale differences, the percentage of students taking different courses may reflect both student enrollment choices and a possible lack of student access to the higher level AP courses in their schools. This report did not fully explore the impact of equity in student access and student choice in relating coursetaking patterns and curricular coverage to performance on TIMSS Advanced, and this is another area that would benefit from further research. The results in this report also demonstrate content domains and topic areas of relative strength and weakness for U.S. students, which are sometimes but not always closely related to specific topic coverage in the curricula of the courses they have taken. While this report explores students' opportunity to learn mainly through its examination of the curriculum and teacher questionnaire data that show if a topic was taught, other factors likely bear on their performance such as how they are taught. Further research related to teaching and teacher qualifications and training-though not the focus of this report-might more fully explore these factors and their relationship to achievement in advanced subject matter in mathematics and physics. In addition, further research is needed on how well schools with advanced course offerings are staffed and capable of delivering quality instruction in terms of both human and other instructional resources. The diagnostic data in this report from the example items helps demonstrate students' approaches, misconceptions, and errors and thus can inform what changes in curriculum or teaching might be beneficial. This report contributes to the literature on student misconceptions and can be extended in further research that looks at patterns of student misconceptions in multiple countries across grade levels and time by using data from TIMSS Advanced and TIMSS grade 4 and grade 8 as was done for a recent IEA report (Neidorf et al. 2019). The diagnostic information provided by the example items in this report is based on just a few of the hundreds of TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced items that are available to explore student misconceptions in mathematics and science across a range of topics at each grade level. It is hoped that this report has contributed to our understanding of U.S. student performance in advanced STEM subjects and will spur additional research, including the analysis of item-level diagnostic data, to improve U.S. high school students' educational opportunities and college or career readiness in advanced mathematics and physics."}, {"section_title": "Advanced mathematics courses Content covered", "text": "The curriculum for AP Calculus AB is divided into three main areas covering the following topics: \u2022 Functions, Graphs, and Limits: one-sided limits; limits at infinity; the limits of a sequence; infinite limits; using limits to determine continuity of a function; intermediate value theorem; mean value theorem \u2022 Derivatives: derivatives at a point including slope of a curve, tangent line to a curve, and rate of change; derivative as a function; characteristics of functions and their derivatives; increasing and decreasing of functions; mean value theorem; point of inflection; application of derivatives, including optimization and rates of change; differential equations \u2022 Integrals: antiderivative; integration by substitution; application of integrals (including finding the area of a region, the volume of a solid with known cross sections, the average value of a function, the distance traveled along a line, and accumulated change from rate of change); separable differential equations 1 Course curricula have been revised for the 2016-17 academic year, with topics added to both the AB and BC courses.

Topic reflects foundational concepts expected for AP Physics 2 that are covered in AP Physics 1 and those expected for AP Physics C-Electricity & Magnetism that are covered in C-Mechanics. Topic is not included in the course curriculum. -Not available. 1 The AP Physics C course curriculum covers a specific set of topics in mechanics and in electricity and magnetism. The extent to which other TIMSS Advanced topics have been covered in AP Physics C or prior physics courses varies across states, districts, and schools. 2 IB physics teachers often teach both the standard-level and higher-level courses in their schools, and their responses to the questionnaire may be based on the topics covered in the higher-level course. Therefore, some topics indicated as not included in the standard-level curriculum may be identified as having been taught to all IB physics students. 3 \"Overall percentage of U.S. students taught wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics topics\" reflects all U.S. TIMSS Advanced students, including those taking AP, IB and other TIMSS Advanced-eligible non-AP, non-IB physics courses. 4 Two framework topics (#2 and #3 in the atomic and nuclear physics topic area) were combined into a single topic in the teacher questionnaire; data for the combined topic are presented under both topics #2 and #3. NOTE: This table provides the disaggregated data on wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics topics for the main report table that summarizes advanced mathematics topic coverage at the topic area level (table 3-4). \"Topics covered\" reflects the intended curriculum based on the overlap of TIMSS Advanced wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics topics with Advanced Placement (AP) Physics course descriptions available from the College Board and the core curriculum specified for the International Baccelaureate (IB) Physics standard-level and higher-level courses. The intended curriculum is not indicated for other TIMSS Advanced-eligible non-AP, non-IB second-year physics courses, since the curricula for these courses vary across states, districts, and schools. The ratios shown under each course type reflect the proportion of topics in a given topic area (and for the wave phenomena and atomic/ nuclear physics content domain overall) that are covered in the curriculum for that course (or are considered foundational knowledge expected to have been covered in a prior physics course). The \"percentage of students taught\" is based, for each topic, on the number of students whose teachers reported that the students in their physics class were \"mostly taught this year\" or \"mostly taught before this year\" the respective topic. For students with more than one physics teacher, students are counted as \"taught\" if any of their teachers indicated that the topic was taught in the current or a previous year by the time of the assessment. Percentages are shown for each topic as well as the average across the topics in each topic area and in the wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics content domain overall.

SOURCE: International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced, 2015. In total, the TIMSS Advanced U.S. national sample in 2015 consisted of 241 schools for advanced mathematics and 165 schools for physics (of the original sample of 348 schools for both subjects). The weighted school response rate for the United States for advanced mathematics was 72 percent before the use of substitute schools and 76 percent with the inclusion of substitute schools. The weighted school response rate for the United States for physics was 65 percent before the use of substitute schools and 68 percent with the inclusion of substitute schools. The U.S. national sample consisted of 2,954 students in advanced mathematics and 2,932 students in physics. The weighted student response rate was 87 percent for advanced mathematics and 85 percent for physics. Student response rates are based on a combined total of students from both sampled and substitute schools. As indicated by footnotes in the cross-education system figures in the Highlights report, the United States did not satisfy guidelines for sample participation rates in TIMSS Advanced. As required by NCES standards, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted because the U.S. school-level response rate for both subjects in TIMSS Advanced fell below 85 percent of the sampled schools. The purpose of the analysis was to examine whether the participation status of schools was related to various characteristics and thus introduced the potential for bias in the results. For TIMSS Advanced, these analyses suggest that there was little potential for nonresponse bias in the advanced mathematics sample based on the characteristics studied. It also suggests that, while there was some evidence that the use of substitute schools has not reduced the potential for bias, it did not add to it substantially. Moreover, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there was little evidence of remaining potential bias in the final sample. In physics, however, the results suggest that there was some potential for nonresponse bias in the sample based on the characteristics studied. It also suggests that, while there was some evidence that the use of substitute schools reduced the potential for bias, it did not reduce it substantially. Moreover, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there was some evidence of remaining potential bias in the final sample with the largest bias in locale. See the sections on International Requirements for Sampling, Data Collection and Response Rates and on Sampling in the United States in the Technical Notes at http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss15technotes.asp for additional information.

In TIMSS Advanced, about 33 percent of the items were from previous assessments and about 67 percent were developed for the 2015 assessment. Items were reviewed by representatives of each country for possible bias. To further examine potential biases and design issues in the TIMSS Advanced assessments, nearly all participating countries field-tested the assessment items in 2014. After the field test, items that did not meet the established measurement criteria or were otherwise found to include intrinsic biases were dropped for the main assessment. Each participating country translated the international version of the assessment (in English) into the language(s) spoken in their country or adapted the assessments to reflect any variations necessary in different English-speaking countries. The translations were then verified by the IEA Secretariat. The translation and translation verification processes occur twice-first before the field test and then before the commencement of data collection. The 2015 assessment instruments for TIMSS Advanced were organized in booklets and were constructed and distributed such that each student responded to only a portion of the items and that each item was administered to a random sample of students. The TIMSS Advanced assessments consisted of 6 booklets for advanced mathematics and 6 booklets for physics, each requiring approximately 90 minutes. In both subjects, items were assembled into 9 unique blocks (each containing approximately 10 items across the content domains). Each block appeared in two booklets to permit linking of student responses from the various booklets. Each student completed only one booklet (either advanced mathematics or physics) consisting of 3 blocks of items. After the cognitive assessment, students then completed a 30-minute questionnaire designed to provide information about their backgrounds, attitudes, and experiences in school. Principals in schools where TIMSS Advanced was administered completed questionnaires designed to provide information on their school's structure, resources, curriculum and instruction, climate, and policies. The advanced mathematics and physics teachers of students participating in the assessments also completed questionnaires on these topics and on their own educational background and experiences. This report uses data from the student questionnaire to conduct various subgroup analyses (i.e., those by sex and race/ethnicity) as well as data from the teacher questionnaires on the TIMSS Advanced mathematics and physics topics covered in the classes taken by students in the TIMSS Advanced population. The race/ethnicity categories in the U.S. student questionnaires include White, Black/African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Students were asked which of the categories best describes them and instructed to select all that apply; those who selected more than one of these groups were categorized as \"Two or more races.\" In the teacher questionnaires, students' advanced mathematics or physics teachers were asked to indicate whether each framework topic was: \"mostly taught this year,\" \"mostly taught before this year,\" or \"not yet taught or just introduced.\" In addition to the student, teacher and school questionnaires, TIMSS Advanced also administers country-level curriculum questionnaires focused primarily on the organization and content of the curriculum in advanced mathematics and physics. The curriculum questionnaires were completed in each participating country with input from subject matter and curriculum experts. For each topic covered in the TIMSS Advanced framework, the curriculum questionnaire asks countries to indicate whether, according to their curriculum, students in the advanced mathematics or physics courses being assessed by TIMSS Advanced should have been taught the topic by the end of the school year (in their current course or before). In the United States (which does not have a national curriculum), the questionnaire was completed by reviewing the curriculum frameworks for the various TIMSS Advanced-eligible courses in the U.S. to determine the extent to which each of TIMSS Advanced topics were covered. This included the AP course guidelines from the College Board, the core curriculum guides from the IB program, as well as the curriculum standards of the five most populous states (New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida). The United States' curriculum questionnaires were completed by mathematics and science experts at the American Institutes for Research under contract to NCES. The results were then reviewed by external curriculum experts at the College Board and the Council of Chief State School Officers. The completed curriculum questionnaires for the United States and other countries participating in TIMSS Advanced can be found at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/timssadvanced-2015/mathematics/programs-and-curriculum/united-states-description-of-advanced-mathematics-programs-and-curriculum/ for mathematics and at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/ advanced/timss-advanced-2015/physics/curriculum/united-states-description-of-physics-programs-andcurriculum/ for physics. This report uses topic coverage data from research conducted while compiling responses for the TIMSS Advanced 2015 U.S. national curriculum questionnaires and from the teacher questionnaires for the results on intended and implemented curricula in section 3. The intended curriculum research determined whether the TIMSS Advanced topics are covered in the different AP and IB advanced mathematics and physics courses. Each topic was classified as fully covered, partially covered, not covered, or reflecting foundational concepts expected to have been covered in a prerequisite course. For the AP calculus courses, the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics were used to determine foundational knowledge covered in prerequisite mathematics courses for the TIMSS Advanced topics in algebra and geometry. The intended curriculum is not indicated for the non-AP, non-IB courses eligible for TIMSS Advanced, because the curricula for these courses vary across states, districts, and schools. The implemented curriculum is based on the percentage of U.S. TIMSS Advanced students whose advanced mathematics or physics teachers reported that the TIMSS Advanced topics were \"mostly taught this year\" or \"mostly taught before this year\" (i.e., by the time of the assessment). The third response option in the teacher questionnaire (\"not yet taught or just introduced\") indicated either topics not covered in the curriculum or topics included in the curriculum that had not yet been taught (or were just introduced) by the time of the assessment. These responses were treated as \"not taught\" for the analyses of implemented curriculum. For students with more than one advanced mathematics or physics teacher, students were counted as \"taught\" if any of their teachers indicated that the topic was taught in the current or a prior year. See the sections on Test Development and the Student, Teacher, and School Questionnaires in the Technical Notes at http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss15technotes.asp for more information about the field test, assessment design, and questionnaires.

The TIMSS Advanced scales in advanced mathematics and physics range from 0 to 1,000, with a fixed scale centerpoint of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. 1 For both subjects, TIMSS Advanced provides overall scale scores as well as subscale scores for each content and cognitive domain. In addition to these scale scores as the basic form of measurement, TIMSS Advanced describes student performance in terms of the percentage of students reaching three international benchmarks (Advanced, High, and Intermediate) in advanced mathematics and physics. These international benchmarks provide a way to interpret the scale scores and to understand how students' proficiency varies at different points on the scales, because each successive point, or benchmark, is associated with particular kinds of knowledge and skills that students must successfully demonstrate. See the Weighting, Scaling, and Plausible Values and International Benchmarks sections of the Technical Notes at http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss15technotes.asp for more information. In addition to scale scores and international benchmarks of achievement, this report also uses item-level statistics to provide results on student performance on individual assessment items. These statistics include the \"percent correct,\" or the weighted percentage of students receiving full credit or partial credit on an assessment item. For multiple-choice and short constructed-response items, correct responses are awarded 1 score point; for extended constructed-response items, correct responses are awarded 2 score points, and partial responses are awarded 1 score point. Thus, students providing partial responses to an extended constructed-response item receive a weight of 0.5 when computing the overall percent correct for the item. For the example items included in the report, the item-level statistics include the percentages of students providing a correct response, partial responses (for extended constructed-response items), incorrect responses, and blank responses (for omitted or not-reached items). In addition to the percentages of students at the correct, partial, and incorrect levels, this report uses data on the distributions across the different response options for multiple-choice items and specific types of partial or incorrect responses for constructed-response items. TIMSS Advanced uses a twodigit scoring system (e.g., 20, 10, 11, 70). The first digit for a correct or partial response code indicates the number of score points given to the response (1 or 2), while the first digit for incorrect response codes is 7. The second digit (0-5) designates a specific type of correct, partial, or incorrect response. The code 79 is used for \"other incorrect responses\" not covered by a specific incorrect code (e.g., 70, 71). The definitions of the twodigit diagnostic codes are specific to each item (i.e., there is no general definition for a code that applies to all items). TIMSS Advanced 2015 used diagnostic codes in the constructed-response item scoring guides to track particular misconceptions or errors described in this report. In most cases, these diagnostic codes were applied internationally, although in some cases they were applied only in the United States. For detailed information about the item-level statistics produced by TIMSS, see Chapter 11 (Reviewing the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Achievement Item Statistics) of the IEA's Methods and Procedures in TIMSS Advanced 2015 (at http://timss.bc.edu/publications/timss/2015-a-methods.html). For more information, see the Scoring and Scoring Reliability section in the Technical Notes at https://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss15technotes.asp. Scoring guides are shown for example items in this report and in the examples shown in the TIMSS Advanced international results at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/."}, {"section_title": "Sampling weights and standard errors", "text": "Sampling weights are necessary to compute statistically sound estimates. Adjusted survey weights adjust for the probabilities of selection for individual schools and classrooms and for school or student nonresponse. As with any study, there are limitations that should be taken into consideration. Estimates produced using data from TIMSS Advanced 2015 are subject to two types of error: nonsampling errors and sampling errors. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems such as unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of survey questions, and mistakes in data preparation. Sampling errors arise when a sample of the population, rather than the whole population, is used to estimate some statistic. Different samples from the same population would likely produce somewhat different estimates of the statistic in question. This uncertainty is referred to as sampling variance and is usually expressed as the standard error of a statistic estimated from sample data. Standard errors for all statistics reported in this report are available in the associated web tables at https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2020051.
