The above institution eligibility conditions were consistent with all previous NPSAS studies with three exceptions: 1) Title IV participation, 2) inclusion of correspondence schools, and 3) exclusion of Puerto Rico. The requirement that an institution be eligible to distribute federal Title IV aid was implemented beginning with NPSAS:2000. Institutions that offered only correspondence courses, provided these same institutions were also eligible to distribute federal Title IV student aid, were first included in NPSAS:04.

The IPEDS files provided nearly complete coverage of the institutions in the target population. 2 Listings included (1) all institutions whose primary purpose was the provision of postsecondary education; (2) all branches of colleges, universities, and other institutions, so long as the branch offered a full program of study (not just courses); (3) free-standing medical schools, as well as schools of nursing, schools of radiology, and the like, within hospitals; and (4) schools that offered occupational and vocational training with the intent of preparing students for work (e.g., a modeling school training for professional modelingnot just a charm school). The IPEDS files do not include (1) schools not open to the general public (i.e., training sites at prisons, military installations, corporations); (2) hospitals offering internships or residency programs only, or hospitals that offer training only as part of a medical school program at an institution of higher education; (3) organizational entities providing only noncredit continuing education units; (4) schools whose only purpose is to prepare students to take a particular test, (e.g., Certified Public Accountant examination or state Bar examinations); or (5) branch campuses of U.S. institutions in foreign countries. Institutions in the file that were not eligible (e.g., institutions located outside the United States, central offices, military academies) were deleted from the sampling frame. These IPEDS file exclusions eliminated some categories of ineligible institutions; however, additional deletion from this file was required. Starting with the 7,300 \"institutions\" in this database, records were deleted to yield a sampling frame containing 6,665 institutions appearing, on the basis of their 2009 IPEDS data, to be eligible for NPSAS:12. Deletions included (1) administrative units; (2) U.S. service academies; (3) institutions outside the United States; (4) institutions offering no programs of at least 300 content hours; (5) closed institutions; (6) institutions not open to the public; and (7) institutions not eligible for Title IV funding. Because enrollment data were necessary to compute measures of size for sample selection, the enrollment data from the 2009 IPEDS Fall and 2008 IPEDS 12-Month Enrollment Components were edited, imputed, or both to eliminate missing data. Missing undergraduate and graduate enrollments were set to zero for institutions that did not offer that level of instruction, and missing first-time beginner counts were set to zero for graduate institutions. Sets of records were identified for which the enrollment data were reported with another institution's. In such cases, the combined enrollment data were allocated following IPEDS' allocation formulas. For institutions with any missing enrollments, enrollment was imputed in accordance with the IPEDS methodology. The institutions on the sampling frame were partitioned into 10 institutional strata based on institutional level, control, and highest level of offering: 1. public less-than-2-year 2. public 2-year 3. public 4-year non-doctorate-granting 4. public 4-year doctorate-granting 5. private nonprofit less-than-4-year 6. private nonprofit 4-year non-doctorate-granting 7. private nonprofit 4-year doctorate-granting 8. private for-profit less-than-2-year 9. private for-profit 2-year 10. private for-profit 4-year The sample of institutions was initially selected in September 2010. In August 2011, a freshened sample of institutions was selected from a frame of institutions that were not on the original sampling frame because they were newly eligible institutions. Freshening was done to ensure the representativeness of the sample because the initial sample was selected a year earlier. The measures of size for the supplemental sampling frame from which the freshened sample was selected were based on the 2010 IPEDS Fall and 2009 IPEDS 12-Month Enrollment Component counts."}, {"section_title": "B.1.2 Selecting Student Sample", "text": "It was necessary to allocate the student sample to the separate applicable institutional (defined above) and student sampling strata.

FTBs were divided into students in certificate programs and other students strata because FTBs in certificate programs were oversampled since they have important early labor market experiences that can only be explored via BPS if a sufficient starting sample is identified. In determining the allocation, the following notation was used: r = 1, 2, . . . , 10 indexes the previously defined institutional strata; s = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 1 indexes the previously defined student strata; j = 1, 2, . . . , J(r) indexes the institutions within stratum r; M rs (j) = number of students enrolled during the NPSAS year who belonged to student stratum s at the jth institution in institutional stratum r; m rs = number of students to be selected from student stratum s within the rth institutional stratum (i.e., student stratum rs); and \u03c0 r (j) = probability of selecting the jth institution in institutional stratum r. The overall population sampling rate (f rs ) for student stratum rs is given by The IPEDS Fall Enrollment file contains counts of FTB students. While this definition does not exactly match the NPSAS definition, and it is only for fall enrollment, it is sufficient for sampling purposes. Using the IPEDS Fall Enrollment file, NPSAS sampling statisticians calculated the percentage of first-time students in the fall, and applied that percentage to the full year enrollment counts to calculate an estimated count of the potential FTB population. The student sample was allocated to the separate applicable institutional and student sampling strata, as defined above. Student sampling rates, which were used to compute institutionlevel composite measures of size, were based on the 2009 IPEDS Fall and 2008 IPEDS 12-Month Enrollment Components counts and the required sample sizes (see table B-1). The initially computed stratum-level student sampling rates, f rs (used to define institutional measures of size), are shown in tables B-2 and B-3. Table B-2 shows the sampling rates for potential FTBs and other undergraduate students for each of the 10 institutional strata. Table B-3 presents sampling rates for master's, doctoral-research/scholarship/other , doctoral-professional other graduate students. The composite measure of size for the jth institution in stratum r was then defined to be which is the number of students that would be selected from the jth institution if all institutions on the frame were to be sampled. With use of Chromy's (1979) sequential probability minimum-replacement sampling algorithm, which resembles systematic sampling, an independent sample of institutions was selected for each institutional stratum. This algorithm led to the selection of institutions with probabilities proportional to a composite measure of size based on expected enrollment. Initially a sample of 1,670 institutions was selected in September 2010 so that a separate field test sample could be selected from the remaining institutions on the sampling frame. To avoid multiple selections of sample institutions, those with expected frequencies of selection greater than unity (1.00) were selected with certainty. The remainder of the institutional sample was selected from the remaining institutions within each stratum. To ensure the positive pairwise probabilities of selection required for proper variance estimation (Chromy 1981), the sampling algorithm was implemented with a random start for each institutional stratum. Therefore, the probability of selection for the jth institution in institutional stratum r is given by In August 2011 the sample was freshened with use of the 2010 IPEDS Institutional Characteristics, Fall, and Completions files and the 2009 IPEDS 12-Month Enrollment file; any newly eligible institutions in the sampling frame were in this way included to ensure representativeness of the current student population. The measures of size for the supplemental sampling frame from which the freshened sample was selected were based on the 2010 IPEDS Fall and 2009 IPEDS 12-Month Enrollment Component counts. The sample size for freshened institutions was set so that they would have similar probabilities of selection as if they had been selected in the original sample. This minimized the chance of unequal student weights and variance estimates due to different probabilities of selection. This process added about 20 institutions to the sample. Table B-4 shows the institutional sampling rates and the sample size for each of the 10 institutional strata. Within each institution stratum, NPSAS statisticians accomplished additional implicit stratification by sorting the sampling frame within stratum by the following classifications: 6 (1) historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) indicator; (2) Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) indicator; 7 (3) Carnegie classifications of degree-granting postsecondary institutions; 8 (4) 2digit Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code of the largest program for less-than-2-year institutions; (5) the Office of Business Economics Region from the IPEDS header file (Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce Region); (6) state and system for states with large systems, e.g., the SUNY and CUNY systems in New York, the state and technical colleges in Georgia, and the California State University and University of California systems in California; and (7) the institution measure of size. The objective of this implicit stratification was to approximate proportional representation of institutions on these measures. 12 Data File Documentation  "}, {"section_title": "B.2 Student Universe and Samples", "text": "The initial student sample was selected from lists provided by approximately 1,480 of the 1,690 eligible institutions.

Each sampled institution verified as NPSAS-eligible was asked to provide a list of all students who satisfied all the NPSAS:12 eligibility conditions, preferably an \"unduplicated\" electronic list (i.e., one in which each student's name appeared only once), together with identifying, classifying, and locating information (see section 2.2.2). Institutions were allowed to fax a list to a secure fax machine as a last resort and only after the institution submitted a test of nonsensitive data. Several checks on quality and completeness of student lists were implemented before the sample students were selected. Institutions providing lists that failed these checks were contacted so the detected problems could be resolved. Enrollment lists failed quality control checks under the following conditions: \u2022 Education level-undergraduate, master's, doctoral-research/scholarship/other, doctoral-professional practice, or other graduate-was not included or was unclear; or \u2022 First-time beginning students were not identified; or \u2022 Undergraduate degree program was not provided for first-time beginning students; or \u2022 Major fields of study or CIP codes were not clearly identified for graduate students; or \u2022 If the number of students who were less than 18 years of age and did not have a high school graduation date was too high; or \u2022 Contact information appeared misaligned; or \u2022 The number of students listed was inconsistent with the most recent IPEDS data. Quality checks on counts for FTB students were performed separately from checks on counts for the rest of the students. Since IPEDS does not have unduplicated annual FTB counts, the unduplicated FTB counts from the enrollment lists provided by institutions were checked against adjusted full-year enrollment counts. Percentages of FTBs computed from the 2009 IPEDS Fall Enrollment Component were multiplied by full-year undergraduate enrollment counts from the 2010 IPEDS 12 Month Enrollment Component to estimate the numbers of full-year FTBs. Upper and lower bounds were formed around the IPEDS counts to create a range. If the student enrollment list count was within the prescribed range, the enrollment list passed quality control; otherwise, it failed. 9 Enrollment lists failed quality control checks if the number of FTBs, undergraduates, and graduates differed significantly from the IPEDS counts. For undergraduates and graduates, the list failed if its count was either 50 percent less or 50 percent more than the IPEDS enrollment count. For FTBs, the failure occurred if the list count was either 50 percent less or 100 percent more than the adjusted IPEDS enrollment count. To keep institution burden to a minimum, no lists were failed if the absolute difference between the student list count for a particular student level and the IPEDS count for that level was less than 200 and the student list count was not zero. Likewise, if the IPEDS count was zero for any student level and the institution provided a list of any number of students at that particular level, the count passed the quality control check."}, {"section_title": "B.2.2 Student Sample Selection", "text": "As student lists were received from institutions, students were sampled by means of stratified systematic sampling with predetermined sampling rates that varied by student stratum. For each institution, the student sampling rates, rather than the student sample sizes, were set to fixed values \u2022 to facilitate sampling students on a flow basis as student lists were received; and \u2022 because sampling at a fixed rate based on the overall stratum sampling rates and the institutional probabilities of selection results in approximately equal overall probabilities of selection within the ultimate institution-by-student strata. Some institutional systems sent in lists for multiple institutions or campuses. If the lists were separate for each institution or campus, then the samples were selected separately and independently. If the lists were combined into one list with no identifier mapping students to institution or campus, then one student sample was selected that represented all of the institutions or campuses on the list. In such cases, sampling rates were adjusted, and a weight adjustment was made (see section 6.3.1). To eliminate cross-institution duplication, the Social Security numbers (SSNs) of those students selected from institutions were compared with SSNs of students who had already been selected from other institutions. Multiplicity adjustments in the sample weighting (described in more detail in section 6. 3.3) accounted for the fact that any students who attended more than one institution during the NPSAS year had more than one chance of selection. The development of student sampling rates within student stratum rs (i.e., the rth institutional stratum and the sth student stratum within the institutional stratum) were previously discussed in section B.1.2; the same notation will apply here. For the unconditional probability of selection to be a constant for all eligible students in stratum rs, the overall probability of selection should be the overall student sampling fraction, f rs ; in essence, it must be required that Thus, the conditional sampling rate for stratum \"rs,\" given selection of the jth institution, becomes It should be noted that, in this case, the desired overall student sample size, m s , is achieved only in expectation over all possible samples. Achieving the desired sample sizes with equal probabilities within strata in the particular sample that has been selected and simultaneously adjusting for institutional nonresponse and ineligibility requires that Because setting student sampling rates was necessary before complete information on institutional eligibility and response status was available, rs M was calculated as follows: where S denotes the set of all sample institutions, E r is the institutional eligibility factor for institutional stratum r, and R r is the institutional response factor for institutional stratum r. These factors were the proportions of institutions expected to be eligible or responding within the defined strata. Because this determination was made after eligibility status had already been determined for some institutions, values of zero (known not eligible) or 1 (known eligible) were used, if known at that time. These sampling rates were sometimes modified as follows: \u2022 To ensure sufficient yield for variance estimation, student sampling rates were increased, as necessary and if possible, to make the sample size at each sample institution at least 10 sample students. \u2022 Student sampling rates were decreased if the sample size was greater than 300. \u2022 To ensure that the desired student sample sizes were achieved, sample yield was monitored throughout enrollment list collection, and student sampling rates were adjusted periodically for institutions for which sample selection had not yet been performed. These adjustments to the initial sampling rates resulted in some additional variability in the student sampling rates and therefore in increased survey design effects (variance inflation; see section 6.5). The planned and achieved sample sizes are reported by student stratum and level of offering (table B-5). Also reported is the initial classification of the student sample by institutional type and student stratum (table B-6). The achieved sample yield of 128,120 was higher than the targeted 124,650 because institutional participation rates were higher than estimated, sampling continued longer than scheduled, and a higher sample size was desired to help meet interview yield targets. Overall, more FTB students, doctoral students, and other graduate students were selected into the sample than planned, with fewer other undergraduate and master's students than planned.  12.7 # Rounds to zero. 1 The two FTB strata have been combined, and the three master's, four doctoral, and other graduate strata have been combined NOTE: The student sample was drawn from 1,690 eligible institutions that provided enrollment lists.

With the restricted-use data file for each study, each sample member was first assigned to the appropriate NPSAS institutional and student strata.

When a between-stratum variance component was estimated to be negative, the variance component for that stratum was considered to be negligible, and the variance components were recomputed without inclusion of that stratum in the computation. In addition, unusually small and extremely large student-level components of variance were truncated so that the student-level component of variance was always between 40 percent and 95 percent of the total variance. Unequal weighting effects, UWE hk , were set to 1.05 because their values, based on past experience, were expected to be highly variable. It was decided that they were not reliable predictions of the unequal weighting effects to be expected with the NPSAS:12 design.
