[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In response to mounting evidence that a program of increased physical activity is a useful component in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) in older adults, the Board of Directors of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), along with a multidisciplinary panel of experts, recommended that the AGS take the lead in promoting exercise prescription for OA patients in the primary care setting. This project, culminating in the publication of these practice recommendations, parallels the Society's clinical practice guidelines on the management of chronic pain in older persons. 1 The purpose of this document is to provide an evidenced-based review that explains why a physically active life style benefits older adults with OA and to provide practical strategies and exercise guidelines for this expanding patient population. These practice recommendations are derived from the existing literature and by consensus among a panel of experts from many disciplines: geriatrics, internal medicine, orthopedics, physical therapy and rehabilitation, exercise physiology, nursing, and pharmacy. A literature search involving a full-text computer search of Index Medicus and MEDLINE using the terms osteoarthritis , exercise , and aging was first conducted. An extensive manual search using the bibliographies of the publications located through the computer search was also undertaken. A study was included in this review if the publication made an implicit or explicit claim regarding osteoarthritis or research designed to evaluate the effects of exercise on physiologic or functional parameters in older adults. Members of the multidisciplinary panel reviewed successive drafts of the report summarizing their findings, and the final draft was submitted for review and comment by experts routinely involved in the care of older adults.\nAmericans 65 years or older represent an expanding proportion of the United States (U.S.) population, and their numbers will increase rapidly as the baby-boom generation ages. 2, 3 Although the majority of older people in the U.S. are healthy and physically active, others suffer with chronic illnesses and require some assistance (family, friends, and public support systems) to manage their everyday lives. 4, 5 Approximately one quarter of all patients seen by primary care physicians present with musculoskeletal conditions 6 and, among those age 65 years and older, the most prevalent articular disease is OA. 7 Addressing the health care needs of this rapidly expanding population is a national priority.\nThe conspicuous presence of OA in the older population has many believing that chronic pain and functional difficulties are immutable consequences of aging. OA, the most common form of arthritis, is associated with considerable disability. 8 Symptomatic OA causes pain, limits daily activities, and reduces quality of life. 8, 9 The majority of those burdened with OA are elderly; in fact, about half of all persons age 65 and over are affected by OA. 10 The fallacy that undercuts the mistaken belief that symptomatic OA is caused by aging is revealed in the following anecdote. An older man visits his doctor complaining of difficulty with getting out of a chair and walking because of persistent pain in one of his knees. The doctor replies, \"Well you're 75, this is just part of growing old.\" The astute patient replies, \"My other knee is just as old and it doesn't hurt.\" 11 An emerging body of evidence shows that light-to moderate-intensity physical activity may play a preventive and possibly a restorative role in combating declines in health and functional capacity caused by chronic diseases such as OA. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Regular physical activity modifies risk factors for chronic diseases prevalent in the older population, 18, 19 improves psychologic health, 10 and promotes functional independence. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Physical inactivity is recognized as a risk factor for many diseases prevalent in the older population (coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity), and increasing physical activity in sedentary OA patients may reduce morbidity and mortality. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Evidence indicates that quadriceps muscle weakness is a risk factor for knee OA, which is often the consequence of inactivity. 35 Furthermore, inactivity may contribute to the morbidity associated with a variety of other chronic diseases, most notably diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, osteoporosis, and depression. The superimposition of any of these conditions on several age-related changes only compounds the negative effects of OA on the older person's functional independence. Encouraging regular exercise may reduce the physical impairments and the burden of comorbidities, and thus improve the OA patient's quality of life. 36 Comprehensive management of the patient with OA should involve non-pharmacological interventions in combination with medications. Medications such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be used alone as the primary therapy but instead should be used in conjunction with non-pharmacologic measures. 11, 39, 40 These include education about joint protection, weight-loss counseling for obese people, development of pain-coping skills, enhancement of social support, application of heat or cold to painful joints, exercises that strengthen muscles, and the use of a cane or a walker. Developing an exercise program aimed at alleviating pain and improving overall physical fitness is especially important, because the primary concern for many OA patients is maintenance of functional independence. 12, 41, 42 "}, {"section_title": "OA RISK FACTORS, INCIDENCE, AND PREVALENCE: IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT", "text": "Osteoarthritis is a major cause of chronic pain and disability in the older population. Even though there is much that we still do not understand about the pathophysiology of OA, our current understanding is sufficient to direct therapeutic interventions. Research in the underlying mechanisms of OA have identified several risk factors. The data suggest that, as with atherosclerotic heart disease, the risk of developing symptomatic OA is influenced by the presence of multiple risk factors. Reducing or eliminating these risk factors may reduce the symptoms and disability associated with OA. Table 1 lists the major risk factors of knee OA in older adults. 11 Some factors, such as age, gender, and inheritance are immutable, but others are modifiable. Obesity, muscle weakness, joint laxity, and altered biomechanics are some risk factors potentially amenable to nonpharmacologic measures. An understanding of the ways these risk factors affect the course of OA provides clinicians with the rationale for targeting their interventions for OA patients and increases the likelihood that these patients will improve.\nThe incidence and prevalence of OA at different anatomic regions vary, depending on whether this condition is defined by clinical symptoms, radiologic findings, or a combination of the two. [43] [44] [45] [46] Although all peripheral joints may be affected, OA of the knee has been the focus of many epidemiologic studies. 9, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] Age is the most consistent risk factor for both radiographic and symptomatic OA at all articular sites. 46 The prevalence of OA increases after the age of 40 in women and 50 in men. 55, 56 OA affects about 50% of persons age 65 and older, and this prevalence increases to 85% in the group age 75 and older. 57, 58 In the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study, Felson and colleagues 56 found that 27% of the people age 63 to 70 years had knee OA diagnosed radiographically, and among those 80 years or older, the prevalence increased to 44%. In 1997, researchers found that nearly 12% of people age 65 years and older said that their activities were limited because of arthritis. 1 This number is likely to grow proportionally as elderly people comprise an increasingly greater share of the U.S. population in the decades to come.\nGender also influences the prevalence and incidence of OA. Isolated hand and knee OA are common in women, whereas the prevalence of hip disease is higher in men. 44, 45, 49, 50, 54 Prospective, longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between body weight and OA. Data from the Framingham Knee Osteoarthritis Study, which followed 1,420 persons for more than 30 years, indicate that overweight men and women are at higher risk for developing symptomatic and radiographic OA than those less obese. 53, 59 Similarly, both the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Swedish study demonstrated that obesity increased the risk for developing OA. 60, 61 Felson and colleagues also reported that weight reduction reduces pain, further supporting the relationship between obesity and OA. 62 Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, several investigators speculate that excessive body weight increases the biomechanical stresses across weight-bearing joints, which eventually results in cartilage damage. [63] [64] [65] Although some data support this teleologic hypothesis, a direct relationship between weight loss and reduced OA morbidity is less convincing. A small limited number of randomized clinical trials provide preliminary data suggesting that a reduction in OA symptoms is correlated more strongly with reduced body fat mass than with reduced total body weight. 56, 66 Slemenda and colleagues 67, 68 reported that reduced strength, relative to body weight, may play a role in the development of OA. These preliminary data could indicate that reduced total body fat and increased muscle strength may be relevant to the development of OA. These data suggest that interventions designed to strengthen the muscles and reduce total body fat may be effective methods for reducing pain and improving function in patients suffering with OA.\nA history of joint trauma, the presence of bony deformities, or joint instability are also risk factors for OA. 9 Evidence from a variety of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggests that major trauma to a joint increases the risk for developing OA. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] Consistently, the evidence suggests a strong relationship between joint damage and the development of OA later in life. Recent studies report that muscle weakness and reduced joint proprioception are risk factors for developing OA. In patients with knee OA, quadriceps weakness is common. Because of decreased joint stability and shockabsorbing capacity, muscle weakness contributes to disability. 74 Until recently, this disuse muscle atrophy was thought to develop because patients avoid loading painful joints. Slemenda and colleagues 67 examined this relationship between muscle strength and knee OA in a population of randomly selected community-dwelling older adults age 65 years and older. They reported that in those without a history of knee pain, isolated quadriceps weakness was strongly associated with radiographic knee OA. The findings from subsequent studies 68, 75, 76 suggest that quadriceps weakness may be a risk factor for knee OA.\nAlthough proprioception declines with age, several reports demonstrate that diminished position sense contributes to the development of OA. [77] [78] [79] [80] Pai and colleagues showed that knee proprioception was significantly diminished in older adults with knee OA when compared with their counterparts without OA. 77 Whether reduced proprioception causes or is a consequence of OA remains unknown . Highlighting the importance of these factors are the findings from several studies that demonstrated strengthening and aerobic exercise programs designed to improve muscle strength and joint proprioception reduce pain and improve mobility in patients with OA. 75, 76, [81] [82] [83] The relationship between levels of physical activity and the risk of OA has been well studied. In general, moderate amounts of recreational physical activity do not increase the risk of OA. [84] [85] [86] However, participation in occupations requiring strenuous physical activity or intense competitive sports activity throughout life may contribute to the development of OA. 59, [87] [88] [89] Nevertheless, the results of many studies suggest that older adults, even those with OA, can reduce their morbidity by regularly participating in moderate physical activity."}, {"section_title": "BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR OA PATIENTS", "text": "Published reviews outline the effects of exercise training in the OA population. 90, 91 The details of selected randomized, controlled studies are presented in Table 2 , 42 which also lists many of the benefits of increased physical activity for OA patients. Although many researchers who have studied this question conclude that exercise training does not impact the pathological process of arthritis, [30] [31] [32] 60, 76, 82, [92] [93] [94] [95] a notable and consistent finding across the OA literature is that exercise training does not exacerbate pain or disease progression and is effective in decreasing pain and improving function. Moreover, the evidence from well-controlled clinical trials suggests that regular physical activity can provide older OA patients with the same physical, psychologic, and functional benefits observed in the general population. Chief among the functional benefits produced by increasing physical activity is improved postural and gait stability, which may reduce falls in this at-risk population. 76, [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] These findings are significant because emerging research data implicate muscle weakness as a risk factor for OA 67, 68, 101 and suggest that physical inactivity exacerbates disability in OA patients. 102 Short-term studies show that aerobic exercise 82, 103 and strength-training programs 17,83,100 effectively improve important physiologic parameters related to functional capacity in older adults with OA. More recent randomized, controlled long-term trials confirm these earlier findings. 75, 74, 102, 104 Given the positive health and functional benefits associated with exercise and the fact that inactivity contributes to disability, 102 it is evident that promoting physical activity should be an integral component of the management of OA."}, {"section_title": "MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC OA", "text": "To date, no definitive treatment or cure for OA has been identified. The management of OA includes patient education, therapeutic modalities, exercise, and medications in parallel. Treatment goals include pain control, maximizing functional independence and improving quality of life within the constraints imposed by both OA and comorbidities. 40, 105 Patient Education and OA Patient education is an important component of effective arthritis rehabilitation. Counseling programs have been found to be effective in reducing the pain and disability associated with OA. [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] Formal community-based programs to which the primary practitioner can refer OA patients are also available in many locations. In addition, the Arthritis Foundation publishes educational brochures and videotapes for patients and, in many communities, offers courses that teach practical techniques to reduce pain and improve function and general health.

While little scientific data demonstrate the efficacy of any specific modality in OA treatment, topical applications of heat and cold have been used for thousands of years. The physiologic effects of thermal modalities include muscle relaxation and decreased pain. However, because adverse effects can occur with the application of heat and cold, a comprehensive medical evaluation is necessary prior to using these modalities. The physiologic effects and general precautions of these modalities are outlined in Table 3 ."}, {"section_title": "EXERCISE ASSESSMENT AND PRESCRIPTION", "text": "Pain, swelling, limited range of motion, muscle weakness, postural or gait instability, and poor cardiovascular fitness are significant physical impairments associated with OA. Interestingly, sedentary people without arthritis have many of these same problems, which suggests that physical inactivity plays an important role in the symptoms and signs associated with OA. A potential barrier to recommending regular physical activity to patients with OA is the belief that exercise will exacerbate joint symptoms. The results of randomized, controlled clinical trials, however, indicate that increased physical activity does not produce or exacerbate joint symptoms and, in fact, confers significant health benefits. 30, 32, 52, 54, 59, 60, 111 Patient Screening A comprehensive evaluation is the initial step in designing a physical activity program individualized for the patient with OA. The information obtained provides the founda- tion for developing an appropriate exercise prescription for each patient. Assessment objectives can be divided into two broad categories: arthritis-related factors (current medications, joint pain, inflammation, stability, and range of motion) and impairments associated with inactivity (altered body composition, muscle weakness, and poor cardiovascular fitness). The assessment should include a search for any subclinical or undetected health problems or conditions that could be exacerbated by exercise. In addition, reviewing the patient's expectations along with his or her financial and social resources may improve long-term adherence. [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] When all these factors are considered, an exercise prescription can be offered that accommodates to the specific needs and circumstances of the patient."}, {"section_title": "The Need For Graded Exercise Testing", "text": "As many older adults may have cardiovascular disease, a complete history and physical examination are needed before prescribing increased physical activity. Contraindications to exercise are presented in Table 4 ; in general, they are not different from those applicable to younger, healthier adults. 117 Opinions differ regarding the need for a physician-supervised exercise stress test. Cardiovascular response to exercise should be considered for patients with significant risk factors. Such testing assesses cardiac response to exercise and helps to establish an individual's initial aerobic exercise prescription. 118 False positives do occur with exercise stress testing, and there are no consensus recommendations concerning the need to obtain this costly and inconvenient test in older adults who do not have significant cardiovascular disease risk factors. In a review of 14 studies (11 different training protocols) examining the effects of high-intensity strength training in older adults, only three included exercise stress test as part of their screening procedures. 10, 14, 16, 28, 29, [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] In the largest of these studies, 70 subjects were screened with exercise stress testing; five subjects were excluded because of a resting blood pressure \u03fe 160/100, and eight were excluded because of positive exercise stress test results. 28, 29 Although serious cardiovascular events can occur with physical exertion, these usually occur during high-intensity activities. This risk should be considered in light of the fact that regular physical activity of moderate intensity lowers the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease and can be safely implemented in patients with a low risk for such events."}, {"section_title": "How to Start", "text": "The first step in designing an exercise program for the OA patient is to understand which functional problems are most important to the patient. Once disabilities have been Uncontrolled metabolic disease Acute myocardial infarction Acute congestive heart failure inventoried and prioritized, the patient and clinician can set specific short-and long-term goals, which will determine the exercises to be prescribed. Involving the patient in the process enhances long-term adherence. [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] Initially, the program should involve exercises that address the impairments (pain, limited joint range of motion, or muscle weakness) contributing to functional problems. As soon as these impairments begin to improve, a generalized fitness program designed to improve health and functional capacity should begin. Shortly after therapeutic exercise is initiated, fitness training can begin and continue in parallel. The clinician should reinforce the goals and benefits of exercise and familiarize the patient with the specifics of the exercise prescription (intensity, volume, and frequency) and precautions. The latter might include, for example, warnings that physical performance and disease activity can vary from day to day, and that signs of excessive exercise stress include joint pain during activity, pain lasting more than 1 to 2 hours after exercise, swelling, fatigue, and weakness. Patients who are aware of their body's response to exercise and equipped to adjust their training program to avoid immobility may have better long-term adherence with a physical activity program."}, {"section_title": "Basic Exercise Principles and Prescription Components", "text": "The basic components for any physical activity program are exercises to improve flexibility, strength, and endurance. Table 5 presents basic recommendations. The training parameters should be individualized for each patient, but all programs are based on general guidelines, as follows.\nAll exercise prescriptions aimed at improving joint flexibility, muscle strength, or endurance are based on the overload principle: when musculoskeletal tissues are subjected to unaccustomed physiologic stresses, they will adapt and increase their capacity. Overload can be accomplished by increasing the exercise intensity, volume, or frequency, or a combination of these factors. 42 To (Table 5 ).\n\u2022 Intensity defines the amount of muscular effort or exertion put forth during the activity. The intensity of an activity is typically expressed as a percentage of the individual's maximal capacity. Traditionally, the intensity specified in an exercise program is submaximal (i.e., at levels below the individual's full capacity).\n\u2022 Volume describes how long the exercise is to be performed. For endurance training, volume may be expressed as the amount of time (in number of minutes per exercise session or accumulated minutes per week) the person is engaged in aerobic exercises. For resistance training, volume may be expressed as the number of sets and number of repetitions per set to be performed.\n\u2022 Frequency may be expressed as the number of exercise sessions per week.\n\u2022 Progression, or the gradual application of the overload principle as adaptation occurs, depends on the individual's response to exercise. Although the initial time needed for adaptation to the stress of exercise has not been identified, the range may be 2 to 3 months for most older arthritic adults with reduced physiologic reserve. Progression can be manipulated by changing the intensity, volume, or frequency of training.\nThe greatest amount of force that a muscle or group of muscles can generate defines strength. A variety of methods have been developed to measure strength. The most commonly used strength measurement is the one repetition maximum or 1RM, defined as the maximum amount of resistance that can be lifted through a full range of motion only once. Typically, the intensity of a strength training program is expressed as a percentage of 1RM. The amount of strength gain depends on the individual's initial level of strength and potential and on the training intensity, frequency, and volume. 128, 129 The type of muscle contraction, static or dynamic, differentiates training techniques. A static or isometric contraction does not change muscle length or move a joint. Isometric strength training occurs when the force of the muscle cannot overcome the applied external resistance (i.e., holding a heavy tray). Strength increases occur primarily at the angle where the muscle was trained, with less improvement at other angles. This drawback limits the usefulness of isometric exercise as the sole form of strength training.\nDynamic training is more useful for the person with OA. A dynamic contraction both changes muscle length and moves the joint. Dynamic contractions are further classified as isotonic or isokinetic. Isokinetic muscle contractions are performed on sophisticated machines that apply variable resistance throughout the range of motion. Isokinetic training, which has been studied in OA patients, [130] [131] [132] shows no significant advantages over isotonic strengthening programs. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, isotonic is the recommended form of dynamic strength training for OA patients. An isotonic muscle contraction is characterized by variable joint speed exerted against a constant resistance (i.e., free-weight bench press exercise). Isotonic exercise closely corresponds to everyday activities, and strengthening isotonic muscle contractions therefore are recommended for OA patients.\nAll exercise sessions should have three phases, each of which is essential for reducing the potential for injury and maximizing benefit. The first phase is a warm-up period involving repetitive low-intensity range-of-motion exercises; warm-up lasts 5 to 10 minutes. This phase is important because a proper warm-up prepares the body for more vigorous activity. The second phase is the training period, which provides the overload stimulus to increase joint range of motion, muscle strength, or aerobic capacity, or a combination of these. The final phase, cool-down, lasts 5 minutes and typically involves static stretching of the muscles.\nExercise and other non-pharmacologic interventions are used in parallel with medications to reduce pain and improve function in the older OA patient. The management of symptomatic OA should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient; an algorithmic approach, though limited, nonetheless helps to organize this complex process into a series of steps (Figure 1) . The algorithm highlights the importance of modifiable risk factors in the design of treatment plans that accommodate the heterogeneity of the older OA population and yet facilitates simultaneous implementation of several therapeutic interventions. Such an approach helps to reduce the latency for reducing pain and improving function in older symptomatic OA patients."}, {"section_title": "FLEXIBILITY (RANGE-OF-MOTION) EXERCISES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General Principles", "text": "Joint mobility is important to health and to maximal joint range of motion, enhanced muscle performance, 95 reduced risk for injury, 95, 133 and improved cartilage nutrition. 134 Flexibility exercises, typically the first step when beginning an exercise program, 34, 104 increase the length and elasticity of muscles and periarticular tissues. 135 For the OA patient, the objectives of such exercises are to decrease stiffness, increase joint mobility, and prevent soft-tissue contractures. Flexibility exercises are often done during the warm-up period or in conjunction with resistance or aerobic activities.\nTo improve joint range of motion in the OA patient, static stretching is recommended. This stretching technique moves muscles, joints, and periarticular tissues through a range of motion that is comfortable for the patient but that produces some resistances to further movement. Joints, especially those that are painful, should not be over stretched (i.e., stretched to a point that elicits pain), as this may compromise stability. All movement should be through the fullest possible pain-free range. The application of heat prior to stretching may help reduce pain and increase motion.\nAccording to the American College of Sports and Medicine (ACSM), a flexibility program can begin with one stretching exercise per muscle group and should be performed at least 3 times per week. 136 With improvement, the number of repetitions per muscle group can be gradually increased to 4 to 10 repetitions. 137 This general static stretching program should involve the major muscle and tendon groups in the upper and lower extremities (Table 6 ).\nIsometric strengthening is indicated when joints are acutely inflamed or unstable. Isometric contractions produce low articular pressures 83 and are well tolerated by OA patients with swollen, painful joints. These exercises can improve muscle strength and static endurance. They prepare the joint for more dynamic movements and are, therefore, typical starting points for most strengthening programs. Data indicate that strength increases occur when isometric contractions are performed at the muscles' resting length. 143, 144 Strength improvements occur primarily at the angle the muscle was trained, with less improvement at different angles [145] [146] [147] which hinders the usefulness of this exercise form if the goal is to improve overall function. As joint instability and pain decrease, the patient's exercise program should gradually shift to dynamic (isotonic) training, as these muscle contractions are used during the performance of activities of daily living.\nIsotonic muscle contractions are used to perform activities of daily living. Isotonic strength training has been shown to produce positive effects on energy metabolism, 139 insulin action, 111 bone density, 18 and functional status 18, 20, 21, 141 in healthy older adults. In the absence of inflammation and joint instability, this exercise form is well tolerated by OA patients. Recently, the ACSM published isotonic strength training guidelines. Their recommendations, based on scientific research, are the basis of the exercise recommendations for OA patients outlined below.\nAerobic exercise has numerous physiologic benefits that alleviate the deteriorations of aging. These include improved maximal aerobic capacity (measurement of aerobic fitness), 14, 15, 126, 149 insulin action, 150 body composition, 151 and plasma lipoprotein lipid profiles. 75, 76, 152 Regular aerobic exercise also reduces blood pressure. 153 Meredith and colleagues 138 showed that moderate-intensity training (70% of maximal heart rate), performed 45 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 3 months produced similar aerobic gains in both sedentary young and older adults. The mechanisms for adaptation to aerobic conditioning differ between young and old adults, but improvement in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and glycogen store are more prominent in the older adult.\nThe ACSM has set forth standards for the quantity and quality of exercises for developing and improving cardiovascular fitness in an older population. 137 The overload principle is applied to improve an individual's aerobic fitness (VO 2 max). (This principle states that the intensity, frequency, and volume of aerobic exercise must be greater than normal daily activities.)

More often than not, injuries can be avoided if the patient gradually works up to the desired activity level and avoids excessive amounts of activity."}, {"section_title": "Pharmacologic Therapy", "text": "Most authorities agree that the treatment for OA pain should be comprehensive, including both non-pharmacologic and, when necessary, pharmacologic approaches. 1 They also agree that non-pharmacologic therapy should be considered the initial treatment and that pharmacologic agents, such as analgesics and NSAIDs, should be used as adjunctive therapy. 158 Drug therapy for the treatment of OA pain is most effective when used in conjunction with a coordinated program encompassing appropriate non-pharmacologic strategies. 1 Primary physicians who are prescribing exercise for OA patients are encouraged to regularly review the literature on pain management for up-to-date information on the pharmacologic management of pain. Acetaminophen should be considered the preferred firstline pharmacologic treatment for mild to moderate pain of OA. 1, [159] [160] [161] Acetaminophen has been shown to provide pain relief comparable to that achieved with NSAIDs, 162, 163 without the potential for the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with the use of NSAIDs. 164, 165 The daily dosage of acetaminophen should not exceed 4 grams per day.\nAs an alternative to acetaminophen, a trial of an NSAID (available over the counter [OTC] or by prescription) might be of benefit. [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] There is also considerable risk of drug-drug interactions and drug-disease interactions (e.g., congestive heart failure, hypertension, and hepatic and renal disease) with the NSAIDs. Physicians treating OA patients therefore need to take detailed medication histories, including questions about OTC medication use, in order to provide optimal care and recommendations. It has been reported that adverse events with nonselective NSAIDs are more frequent than with any other drug class. 172 It is important to remember that elderly persons are at high risk for side effects of NSAIDs, including GI, platelet, and nephrotoxic effects. Accordingly, NSAIDs should not be used in high doses for long periods of time. 1 If a patient has a history of gastroduodenal ulcers or of GI bleeding, or develops GI symptoms, one of the new cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors or selective NSAIDs should be considered. 173, 174 The new COX-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to be as effective as traditional NSAIDs in the management of OA pain. The two currently available COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have been shown to be as effective as nonselective NSAIDs for mild-to-moderate pain in patients with knee or hip OA. 175, 176 However, caution is advised in prescribing a COX-2 (as well as other NSAIDs), as there is the potential for renal complications. There is evidence that rofecoxib tends to cause fluid retention in older adults and that, in addition, taking it without aspirin carries increased cardiovascular risk in this population. 177, 178 The choice of agents for treating OA patients with preexisting renal insufficiency requires careful consideration. 179, 180 For patients with OA of the knee and other joints who have mild to moderate pain, topical formulations of analgesics or counterirritants (e.g., methyl salicylate or capsaicin cream, menthol) might be beneficial. [181] [182] [183] [184] Expert geriatricians have indicated that pharmacologic modalities for OA pain, besides acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids, include topical formulations of these agents and intraarticular injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid. 160 Intraarticular therapy is an alternate approach to pain management in those individuals who either have not obtained relief through systemic medications or in whom oral NSAIDs are contraindicated. This is especially true for patients with OA of the knee. Intraarticular administration of glucocorticoids (e.g., triamcinolone hexacetonide) has been beneficial in treating acute episodes of pain, especially when there is evidence of inflammation and joint effusion. 185, 186 More recently, the intraarticular administration of hyaluronic acid preparations has been shown to have efficacy in relieving pain that is not adequately relieved with non-invasive, non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. [187] [188] [189] Other agents that have shown benefit in treating the pain associated with OA of the knee include glucosamine and chondroitin. 190, 191 However, additional studies are necessary to demonstrate longterm safety and efficacy of these agents.\nFor some patients with severe OA pain that is refractory to other forms of therapy, stronger analgesic drugs may be required. Carefully titrated opioid analgesic drugs may be preferable to NSAIDS, cortisone, or other pharmacologic or invasive interventions that pose appreciable risks in older people. 1 It has also been suggested that opioid analgesics may be better for treating acute exacerbations of OA pain than for long-term use. 159 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Chronic pain and functional dependency are not inevitable consequences of aging with joint disease. Identifying the modifiable risk factors (Table 1) enables practitioners to focus their therapeutic interventions, reduce pain, and improve function. Randomized, controlled trials clearly show that regular moderate-level exercise does not exacerbate OA pain or accelerate the pathological process of OA. Furthermore, these studies strongly indicate that increasing the level of physical activity in OA patients reduces pain and morbidity. Exercise programs should be individualized to address the specific needs of the patient. The goals of any exercise program should focus on controlling pain, increasing flexibility, and improving muscle strength and endurance. The following organizations with special interest and expertise in the management of osteoarthritis and exercise in older person provided expert review of an earlier version of the guidelines: American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, American Nurses Association, and the American Physical Therapy Association."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Funding was provided as an unrestricted educational grant from McNeil Consumer Health Care, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania."}]
