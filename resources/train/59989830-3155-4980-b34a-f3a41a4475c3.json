We used data from mild AD participants in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative to model trial effect sizes for 12-and 24-month trials using 3 versions of the ADAS-Cog and increased standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) cutoffs for amyloid imaging inclusion criteria. For 12-month trials, extended ADASCog versions improved effect sizes. The ADAS-Cog11 elicited larger effect sizes when enriching for SUVR 1.1 only, whereas the ADASCog12 and ADAS-Cog13 were associated with larger effect sizes with higher SUVR thresholds. For 24-month trials, extended ADASCog versions increased effect sizes for trials not enriched for amyloid and trials enriched for SUVR 1.1. Only enriching for higher SUVR thresholds (1.3 and 1.4, not 1.1) increased trial power.

[2] [3] [4] Although these negative results may represent evidence against the amyloid hypothesis, 5 an alternative interpretation is that the absence of positive findings reflects relative weaknesses in trial design. For example, post hoc analyses of some recent mild-to-moderate AD trials of immunotherapies suggested efficacy when data were limited to participants with mild AD (MMSE 20 to 26) and scores on extended ADAS-Cog versions were examined. 3, 4 Furthermore, a sizeable proportion of participants in these trials had negative amyloid PET imaging, suggesting that they did not have underlying Ab pathology. 6 Together, these findings have contributed to a paradigm shift in AD dementia trials, whereby studies are targeting earlier stages of AD, requiring demonstration of amyloid pathology, and measuring efficacy with extended versions of the ADAS-Cog. 7 Although the ADAS-Cog11 was used in the clinical trials that demonstrated the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in mild-to-moderate AD, 8 extended ADAS-Cog versions may offer increased sensitivity at earlier stages of disease. In particular, adding a delayed recall subtest (ADAS-Cog12) 9 captured greater annual decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 10 and may require smaller sample sizes for MCI treatment trials, 11 compared with the ADAS-Cog11. Increased sensitivity with the ADAS-Cog12 was not seen in participants with dementia due to AD, likely due to floor effects on delayed recall items. 10 The ADAS-Cog13 includes an additional cancellation task, which demonstrated disease worsening over time without ceiling or floor effects in mild and severe AD. 12 Current interventional clinical trials for mild AD are using the ADAS-Cog11, 13 ADAS-Cog12, 14 and ADAS-Cog13 15 as primary cognitive outcome measures.\nTrials of anti-Ab interventions are also implementing amyloid imaging inclusion criteria 16 to confirm the presence of underlying AD pathology, 17, 18 thereby limiting trial samples to participants who express the therapeutic target. 6 AD trials using positive 18F-Florbetapir amyloid imaging as an inclusion criterion have implemented a minimum standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) cutoff of 1.1. 7 This cutoff represents the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) for young cognitively normal controls 19 and in autopsy samples yielded 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity for the presence of moderate to frequent senile plaques. 20 The optimal SUVR cutoff for entry into AD clinical trials remains uncertain, however, as different SUVR cutoffs may be associated with varying degrees of longitudinal change on the ADAS-Cog. 21 There is a relative dearth of available data regarding the impact of ADAS-Cog versions and amyloid imaging SUVR cutoffs on trial efficiency. The aim of this study was to model the impact of these design choices on calculated effect sizes in mild AD treatment trials lasting 12 or 24 months using longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We hypothesized that larger effect sizes would emerge with higher SUVR cutoffs for positive amyloid imaging and the use of extended ADAS-Cog versions."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these 3 protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

Effect sizes were calculated as Dm/s, where Dm was the ADAS-Cog score at time i minus ADAS-Cog score at baseline. s was the SD of Dm. Time i was 12 or 24 months. Because a higher ADAS-Cog score indicates poorer performance, positive Dm represented cognitive decline.\nWe calculated 95% CI for effect size using 10,000 iteration bootstrap resampling. Throughout the text, we report the effect size and the 95% CIs. We also calculated the 95% CIs of effect size difference between ADAS-Cog and SUVR pairs using 10,000 iteration bootstrap resampling to determine whether the CIs of this difference overlapped with zero.

Of the 100 participants with amyloid imaging, 91% met the SUVR 1.1 criteria; 76% of participants met the SUVR 1.3 criteria, and 58% met the SUVR 1.4 criteria ( Table 1) . Table 2 ). Only the 95% CI effect size difference for ADASCog13 and ADAS-Cog12 did not overlap zero (Table 3) . Compared with SUVRZ1.1, there was little or no additional increase in effect sizes for 12-month trials using ADAS-Cog11 when enriching for SUVRZ1.3 or Z1.4. Higher SUVR cutoffs, however, did improve effect sizes for ADAS-Cog12 and 13. , although the effect size difference 95% CI overlapped zero. Nevertheless, increased effect sizes at these higher SUVR cutoffs were observed for all versions of the ADAS-Cog ( Table 2) .\nThe graphical trends illustrated in Figure 1 complement the observations made when analyzing the SUVR cutoffs of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4. For 12-month trials, the ADASCog13 yielded larger effect sizes relative to the ADASCog11, with more pronounced increases seen at higher SUVR thresholds. In contrast, for 24-month trials, the ADAS-Cog versions incorporating the additional items offered increased effect sizes only when the lower SUVR thresholds were used."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study examined how protocol decisions related to amyloid enrichment criteria and ADAS-Cog version affect AD clinical trial power. Our findings demonstrate that these aspects of trial design, in conjunction with trial length, can significantly modulate expected detectable effect sizes and, in turn, the statistical power for detecting treatment benefit on clinical trials for mild AD.\nNinety-two percent of AD participants met amyloid imaging criteria of SUVR >1.1, similar to observed rates in prior studies. 26 This cutoff has been shown to discriminate AD participants from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90%. 27 Mean SUVRs in AD study participants are often higher than 1.1, however, 28 leading us to examine whether varying SUVR criteria would impact AD trial power. Similarly, the recent use of extended versions of the ADAS-Cog, particularly in registration trials, raises the question of whether the choice of ADAS-Cog version might interact with other trial design choices to impact statistical power. For 12-month trials, the use of extended ADAS-Cog versions and amyloid enrichment increased effect sizes. In trials using the standard 11-item ADAS-Cog, enriching for amyloid SUVR 1.1 afforded an effect size that would reduce trial sample sizes by 22%. Interestingly, increasing the minimum SUVR criteria did not further increase trial power when using this version of the ADAS-Cog, but trials using extended versions of ADAS-Cog appeared to benefit from higher minimum amyloid burden requirements. These results suggest that phase Ib and phase IIa proof-of-principle trials that limit to participants with higher amyloid burden and implement ADAS-Cog versions with additional items may require smaller sample sizes.\nFor 24-month trials, extended ADAS-Cog versions yielded increased trial effect sizes when including all eligible mild AD patients. Differences between ADAS-Cog versions were no longer apparent when higher amyloid PET SUVR criteria were implemented. Nevertheless, irrespective of which ADAS-Cog version was used, higher amyloid PET SUVR thresholds yielded more robust gains in effect size with longer trials. These findings are consistent with prior studies that correlated higher degrees of amyloid positivity with lower cognitive performance 18, 29 and greater cognitive decline. 30 Therefore, the benefit of amyloid enrichment in longer trial designs, such as those typically used in phase III registration studies, may be enhanced in trials that use more stringent biomarker criteria. These potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the expected increased screen failure rates and amyloid imaging costs that would be associated with implementing such criteria.\nThe differences observed between the trial lengths may also be an important consideration for those designing AD trials. Although shorter proof-of-concept trials may be appropriate in early-phase studies, these results suggest an additional complication may be introduced if ADAS-cog results from those studies are used to power larger, longer phase III studies. Study inclusion criteria may also be used by regulatory agencies when considering approval indications."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Some limitations to this study should be pointed out. Data were drawn from a single convenience sample (ADNI) whose participants were mostly white and highly educated. As such, our findings may not be representative of the larger AD population. This convenience sampling, however, may be more representative of interventional clinical trials than would be random sampling of a populationbased study. Few AD participants with higher SUVRs and 24-month cognitive outcomes were available for analysis. Thus, the results for these particular analyses should be considered less robust. Similarly, we did not have sufficient data to examine AD patients with lower MMSE scores (16 to 20) , who are often included in mild-to-moderate AD trials.\nAs in other studies that examine clinical trial power, our experiments assume that interventions tested in trials will have generalized effects on cognition, if beneficial. If, however, a drug had benefits on executive function but not delayed recall, for example, the generalizability of our results would be reduced. Similarly, our study does not account for the possibility of differential drug effects based on SUVR level, APOE genotype, or other demographic or disease-related characteristics. Furthermore, if greater amyloid burden is the result of greater disease severity, the enrichment strategy of limiting to those with greatest amyloid burden may directly contradict a trial design enrolling only those with mild disease. Our analyses did not include other techniques to optimize selection of AD trial participants, including enrichment for AD risk genes 31 such as APOE and other AD biomarkers, such as volumetric measures of atrophy, 32 cerebral metabolic measures, 33 or CSF markers of Ab or tau. 34 Nevertheless, CSF Ab measures correlate closely with 18F-Florbetapir PET results. 35 Although enrichment strategies can be useful in decreasing sample sizes, these design choices must be weighed against their larger implications on screening efficiency, imaging costs, and the generalizability of trial results. In our dataset, the screen failure rates for using SUVRZ1.4 as enrichment may be as high as 43% based on the amyloid PET criteria alone."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Extended ADAS-Cog versions and amyloid imaging enrichment may offer improved AD trial statistical power, but design choices must be made with caution. Our observations suggest that enriching for mild AD patients with higher brain amyloid burden and implementing extended versions of the ADAS-Cog can help optimize trial power in 12-month more so than 24-month clinical trials. Such advantages may be mitigated by expected parallel increases in screen failure rates and amyloid imaging costs. Nevertheless, these approaches should be considered when designing future clinical trials of novel therapeutics in mild AD and the current findings may aid in that process."}]
