[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and have been shown to have reduced cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRgl) in the same brain areas frequently affected in AD. These individuals also exhibit reduced plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE) attributed to a specific decrease in the apoE4 isoform as determined by quantification of individual apoE isoforms in APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes. Whether low plasma apoE levels are associated with structural and functional brain measurements and cognitive performance remains to be investigated. Methods: Using quantitative mass spectrometry we quantified the plasma levels of total apoE and the individual apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms in 128 cognitively normal APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 individuals included in the Arizona APOE cohort. All included individuals had undergone extensive neuropsychological testing and 25 had in addition undergone FDG-PET and MRI to determine CMRgl and regional gray matter volume (GMV). Results: Our results demonstrated higher apoE4 levels in females versus males and an age-dependent increase in the apoE3 isoform levels in females only. Importantly, a higher relative ratio of apoE4 over apoE3 was associated with GMV loss in the right posterior cingulate and with reduced CMRgl bilaterally in the anterior cingulate and in the right hippocampal area. Additional exploratory analysis revealed several negative associations between total plasma apoE, individual apoE isoform levels, GMV and CMRgl predominantly in the frontal, occipital and temporal areas. Finally, our results indicated only weak associations between apoE plasma levels and cognitive performance which further appear to be affected by sex. Conclusions: Our study proposes a sex-dependent and age-dependent variation in plasma apoE isoform levels and concludes that peripheral apoE levels are associated with GMV, CMRgl and possibly cognitive performance in cognitively healthy individuals with a genetic predisposition to AD."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "More than two decades after the first report describing a significantly increased risk of developing lateonset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele [1] , this allele remains the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Recent work further shows that the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele also increases the risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [2] whereas carriers of the APOE \u03b52 allele are protected against developing either of these two disorders [2, 3] . Although there is strong evidence that the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele drives early and more abundant amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) pathology in AD, the exact biological mechanisms underlying the variation in risk of disease between the different APOE genotypes are not fully understood. Interestingly, cognitively healthy carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele exhibit cerebral A\u03b2 accumulation as early as in their third or fourth decade of life [4, 5] . Amyloid-\u03b2 plaque pathology appears to be more prominent in female APOE \u03b54 carriers [4] , who also are at a greater risk of AD than their male counterparts [6, 7] . Results from augmenting studies suggest an increase specifically in the pool of oligomeric A\u03b2 in FAD-Tg mice expressing APOE \u03b54, in synaptosomeenriched preparations from APOE \u03b54 carriers and in APOE \u03b54 versus APOE \u03b53 carrier AD patients, of which the former AD patients exhibit higher levels of oligomeric A\u03b2 surrounding amyloid plaques [8] . Consistent accumulating evidence further shows that APOE \u03b54 carriers devoid of cognitive symptoms exhibit low cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRgl) in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietotemporal and frontal regions [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , and reduced regional gray matter volume (GMV) in the hippocampus [14] and amygdala [15] , all brain regions known to be affected in AD. Interestingly, some of these changes can be found in young adults many years prior to the onset of cognitive dysfunction [16] . Even more compelling, these brain abnormalities appear to be present very early in life because recent results from a crosssectional imaging study on infant APOE \u03b54 carriers (6-25 months of age) suggest that the white matter myelin water fraction and GMV are reduced in the precuneus, posterior/middle cingulate, lateral temporal and medial occipitotemporal regions compared with infant noncarriers [17] . These alterations may render APOE \u03b54 carriers more susceptible to AD-related pathology and predict conversion to AD in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [18, 19] . Studies of APOE \u03b54-targeted replacement mice proposed a clear link between early-life stress and cognitive impairment in middle-aged mice, but whether these observations are of relevance to humans needs to be confirmed [20] .\nAt the molecular level, various A\u03b2-dependent and independent mechanisms have been suggested to explain the increased risk of AD in APOE \u03b54 carriers [21] . For example, results from numerous studies on animal models show that the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele promotes A\u03b2 pathology [22] . In support, we and others have shown that the APOE gene product apolipoprotein E (apoE) negatively affects cellular A\u03b2 uptake, for instance by glial cells [23] [24] [25] . In our work published recently we propose that cellular A\u03b2 uptake is reduced in the presence of apoE due to competition between apoE and A\u03b2 for binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [26] . It has further been shown that animals expressing different human apoE isoforms exhibit APOE genotype-dependent variations in apoE levels, with the lowest apoE levels found in apoE4-expressing animals [27] . Other studies addressing apoE fluid concentrations in humans with different APOE genotypes, however, have reported conflicting results [28] [29] [30] [31] . Technical issues were proposed to underlie the variation in reported apoE levels [28] . This is a valid concern because the three apoE isoforms only differ in one or two amino acid residues at positions 112 and 158, complicating the development of isoform-specific antibodies to be used in immuno-based quantification assays. To address this concern, we recently developed a specific multiplexed mass spectrometry-based assay for the absolute quantification of total apoE and individual apoE isoforms [32] . Employing this method we found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of total apoE do not differ between AD patients and nondemented individuals [33] . However, plasma apoE levels were significantly reduced in APOE \u03b54 carriers with the lowest levels found in homozygous individuals, both controls and AD patients. As concluded from the results derived from APOE \u03b54 heterozygous individuals, the observed lower levels of plasma apoE in these individuals resulted from a specific reduction in the levels of the apoE4 isoform. In our previous study, total plasma apoE in heterozygous APOE \u03b54 was composed of roughly 30% apoE4 versus 70% non-apoE4 [33] . Because we found no difference in CSF or plasma apoE levels between AD patients and nondemented individuals we speculated that the peripheral apoE deficiency observed in APOE \u03b54 carriers may predispose these individuals to, rather than cause, neurodegenerative disease. An association between low levels of plasma apoE and risk of AD was suggested previously by findings from a prospective study of the Danish general population [34] . In the current study we aimed to quantify total plasma apoE as well as the individual apoE isoform levels and their effect on cognition, CMRgl and GMV in cognitively healthy APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating whether the levels of individual apoE isoforms in plasma from APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers are associated with GMV and CMRgl, as determined using structural and functional brain imaging, and cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study cohort", "text": "The included individuals are a sample from the Arizona APOE Cohort for which recruitment and enrollment strategies have been described previously [35] [36] [37] .

The Arizona APOE Cohort study subjects underwent APOE genotyping and agreed to have the test results withheld from them as part of the study protocol. To be considered for inclusion, participants had to score at least 27 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination and exhibit no evidence of depression (10 points or less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). None of the included individuals met the published criteria for MCI [38] or AD [39] at study entry. Study subjects were followed and seen in the clinic every 1-2 years. Blood for plasma analysis was collected in tubes containing EDTA. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes.

SPM8 was also used to spatially deform the individual FDG-PET data to the same MNI brain template.\nGeneral linear model-based, voxel-wise analysis examined the association of the apoE4/apoE3 ratio with volumetric MRI-based regional GMV or with FDG-PET-measured CMRgl respectively.

To adjust significance levels for the number of resolution elements in a-priori regions known to be affected by AD, previously characterized independently for volumetric MRI and FDG-PET from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, the association in each of the regions of interest was corrected for multiple comparisons with family-wise error (FWE) correction.

The characteristics of the individuals who underwent imaging are summarized in Table 1 . Given our limited sample size and the potential number of comparisons we could make, we focused our examination on the association of the apoE4/apoE3 ratio with CMRgl and with GMV while also exploring such correlation with each apoE isoform. We first investigated whether the relative ratios between the apoE4 and apoE3 isoforms were negatively associated with regional CMRgl and GMV because numerous studies have attributed a gain of toxic function to the APOE \u03b54 gene product [22] , and hence lower levels of this isoform may be beneficial. We found that higher apoE4/apoE3 ratios were indeed mainly associated negatively with measures on both the FDG-PET and MRI scans. Specifically, higher apoE4/apoE3 ratios were associated with glucose hypometabolism in the right hippocampus ( Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). This p value survived multiple comparisons at the 0.05 level using SVC.\nA negative correlation was further observed between CMRgl and levels of the apoE4 isoform in the left inferior frontal orbital region (p = 0.000432), and a negative correlation with CMRgl and apoE3 isoform in the right frontal medial orbital (p = 0.00126) (Table 3) . Similarly, higher apoE4/apoE3 ratios were negatively associated with GMV in the following common regions of GMV decline with AD: posterior cingulum, left hippocampus, left and right lateral temporal, left medial temporal and right precuneus (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). Only the negative association of GMV and E4/E3 ratio in the posterior cingulum survived corrections at a 0.05 level with SVC."}, {"section_title": "Neuropsychological test results and correlations with apoE levels", "text": "We next assessed whether the identified associations could be reflected in scores on neuropsychological tests assessing verbal comprehension, working memory, word retrieval, attention and arithmetic capabilities mainly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes.

We found no correlation between global cognition scores and apoE levels in the two cohorts (data not shown) and our assessment of associations between scores from individual cognitive domain testing and apoE isoforms all turned out essentially negative when correcting for multiple testing (Bonferroni, four cognitive domains) (data not shown).\nWith significant differences in apoE levels between males and females, we explored sex-dependent associations between apoE levels and cognitive test scores. Splitting the large group into females (n = 91) versus males (n = 37) we found two associations between plasma apoE levels and cognition scores that remained significant after corrections, in females only.

Hence, higher apoE (apoE3) levels were linked to better performance on the verbal reasoning (similarities) subtest of the WAIS-R test in females only."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Identification of APOE \u03b54 phenotypical characteristics in humans should promote experimental hypothesis-driven research linking pathological cell and molecular processes to APOE \u03b54. We recently reported that APOE \u03b54 carriers have decreased levels of plasma apoE driven by a specific decrease in the apoE4 isoform levels [33] . We speculated that peripheral alterations in apoE concentrations predispose APOE \u03b54 carriers to processes leading to AD rather than cause the disease because in our previous study we found no difference in apoE levels between patients and controls. Interestingly, one study found that total plasma apoE levels were negatively linked to memory and verbal memory in older individuals when correcting for APOE \u03b54 carrier status [44] , and results from the ADNI [45] proposed that lower total apoE levels were associated with smaller hippocampal size and that the association was driven by APOE \u03b54 status. Whether these associations can be traced to individual apoE isoform concentrations rather than total apoE levels remains to be investigated. We here quantified total plasma apoE and individual apoE isoform levels in nondemented individuals with an APOE \u03b54/\u03b53 genotype. We were interested to see whether the protein levels of the apoE4 risk isoform versus apoE3 in plasma could be associated with phenotypical characteristics reported in APOE \u03b54 carriers [11] . Our results indicated that the relative distribution between the risk-isoform apoE4 and the apoE3 isoform is of importance because a higher relative ratio of apoE4/apoE3 was linked to glucose hypometabolism and reduced GMV, for instance in the posterior and anterior cingulate areas. Hypometabolism in the medial temporal and parietal areas was proposed previously to predict cognitive decline in cognitively normal individuals [46] , and in a large study including 600 cognitively normal individuals hypometabolism was associated with amyloid pathology as assessed using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET [47] . It was further found that APOE \u03b54 carriers exhibited marginally lower metabolism specifically in the posterior cingulate compared with noncarriers and the authors proposed that the APOE-associated observations were mediated through A\u03b2 plaque load (PiB retention). Previous studies have shown that APOE \u03b54 carriers of similar age to those investigated here exhibit significant amyloid pathology even in the absence of cognitive symptoms [5] . A major weakness of the current study is that the studied individuals did not undergo CSF sampling and hence CSF AD biomarkers levels as surrogate markers of amyloid and tau pathology were not available.\nExactly how the relative ratio of apoE4 over apoE3 isoform levels in plasma can be related to the described structural and metabolic differences in the brain is not clear and linking peripheral apoE levels to processes in the brain is controversial because peripheral apoE does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [48] . Of note, we found that females exhibited higher apoE4 isoform levels than males and that the apoE3 levels were positively associated with age in females only. Results reported previously from the prospective study of the Danish general population also demonstrated an age- associated increase in levels of apoE (total levels) in both females and males; however, the increase in males appeared to plateau earlier than the increased levels found in females [34] . There could be several causes of the age-associated increase of apoE3 but not apoE4 that we observed in females, including altered levels of various sex hormones due to menopause; however, the lack of effect on the levels of apoE4 proposes differential effects of sex on different apoE isoforms. We speculate that an increased relative ratio of apoE4 over apoE3 may be 'risky' and that the levels of apoE3 are agedependently upregulated as a protective feature in females who generally are at higher risk of AD [49] . Intriguingly, the specific role of apoE3 in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers is not well understood. The risk of developing AD is known to be higher in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers than in APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 carriers [3] and also the lipid and receptor binding capacities differ between the apoE isoforms [50] . If assuming a loss of function of the apoE4 isoform, a compensatory upregulation of the non-apoE4 isoform-apoE3 in the case of the herein studied individuals-may be beneficial. A full compensatory mechanism appears not to be present, however, as indicated by our previous findings showing lower plasma total apoE levels in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers versus APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 carriers [33] . Overall low total apoE levels were shown to increase the risk of AD and of other types of dementia in the Danish general population [34] , but the question remains whether increased levels of all isoforms including apoE4 may be beneficial or not. Future studies further need to address whether the described age-associated and sex-associated effects also apply to apoE levels in CSF, in which we have previously shown that the ratio between the different apoE isoforms in total apoE differ from those in plasma [33] . In relation to the effect of sex, when exploring whether the variation in plasma apoE could be linked to cognitive performance in four major domains (memory, language, executive and spatial functions) we found only two weak correlations which were observed in females only. Hence as expected when studying a cohort that is cognitively intact (with little variation in cognitive performance), we did not find any strong correlations between plasma apoE levels and neuropsychological test results; however, our data do suggest the presence of a gender-specific effect on these correlations. Because of our limited sample size, future studies of larger cohorts are necessary to assess the specificity and significance of our observations linking plasma apoE levels to imaging findings and neuropsychological test outcomes.\nThe observed low levels of the apoE4 isoform with regard to total apoE levels are in line with our results reported previously [33] . However, the differences in apoE isoform levels between the sexes as well as an agerelated increase in apoE3 in females only were not observed in our previous study [33] . Differences in cohort size and age of the included individuals may be factors that have influenced the outcome of the two studies. The lack of correlation between the apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms in plasma was surprising and needs further attention. It has been shown that the turnover rate differs between different apoE isoforms in plasma, with the apoE4 turnover rate almost 4-fold faster than that for apoE2 in APOE \u03b52/ \u03b54 individuals [31] . As discussed before [33] , it is not clear whether the apoE4 isoform levels result from fast degradation paralleled by a lack of compensatory upregulation of apoE4 synthesis or whether the synthesis of apoE4 per se is lower than that of other apoE isoforms due to differences at the expression and/or translation level in the periphery. Given our current results and previous results of a specific reduction in the apoE4 isoform in APOE heterozygous individuals [33] , further studies are necessary to confirm that the reported differences are not due to alterations in the allele-specific expression of apoE."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current study provides the first evidence linking plasma levels of the individual apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms to structural and metabolic changes in the brains of cognitively intact APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 carriers.

Our study further provides new insights into sex-dependent differences in plasma apoE levels, with females exhibiting higher levels of the apoE4 isoform than males and increasing plasma apoE3 concentrations as a function of age. The exact relevance of these findings needs to be determined because female APOE \u03b54 carriers are at higher risk of AD than males [51, 52] . We conclude that peripheral levels of apoE and the isoform composition of total apoE levels are important features to consider with regard to risk and etiology of AD in carriers of the APOE \u03b54 risk allele."}, {"section_title": "Additional file", "text": "Additional file 1: Table S1 .
