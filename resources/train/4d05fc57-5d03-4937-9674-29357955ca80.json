Methods: MCI patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a yearly basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic regression models were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF, amyloid-b, and tau).\nResults: The predictive model at 4 years revealed that two cognitive measures, an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing screening test, were the best predictors of conversion (area under the curve 5 0.78). Conclusions: This model of prediction is consistent with the previous model at 2 years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive measures in progression from MCI to AD.

Among the causes of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common. AD dementia is currently considered as an end state after consistent pathologic brain changes have accumulated, perhaps years before the earliest clinical symptoms manifest.\nRelatively few studies have directly compared the differential contribution of different kinds of markers (biomarkers and cognitive markers) in their predictive utility for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. This motivated us to undertake a systematic and comprehensive examination of several classes of markers. In a previous study, we found that a combination of delayed verbal episodic memory measures and a middle temporal lobe cortical thickness measure were the strongest predictive factors of the conversion to AD from MCI in a follow-up period of 2 years using a sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [2] .\nSince our initial report, several studies investigating a combination of different markers have obtained similar findings. Ewers and colleagues [3] found that memory measures (free recall) and executive function measures had comparable predictive accuracy to that of biomarkers within the ADNI database using an approach involving a cross-validation paradigm to differentiate AD from elderly control subjects that was later applied to the prediction of MCI conversion to AD. Heister and colleagues found that MCI patients with a combination of learning impairment and increased hippocampal atrophy had the highest risk of conversion to AD [4] . Jedynak and colleagues [5] , using advanced statistical methods, found that inflection of a delayed memory measure preceded that of other biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] levels and hippocampal volumes) on the progression from MCI to AD in the ADNI database. This set of findings was recently the subject of an editorial that highlighted the otherwise often undervalued importance of cognitive measures as early markers of AD progression [6] .\nIn this study, the first aim was to derive a model for prediction and contrast it with our prior model findings over a longer follow-up period of 4 years in the ADNI database. Given the often undervalued but widespread phenomenon of failure to replicate findings in published biomedical research [7, 8] , we believe that confirming the validity of a model of prediction for the transition from MCI to AD is of great value and it contributes to the clarification of the processes implicated in transition.\nWe appreciate that this is not a replication in a separate and independent sample. Nevertheless, as an extension and refinement of our results, we think that this approach will be a step toward validation of our overarching findings (that cognitive measures were robust predictors of conversion from MCI to AD).\nWe hypothesized that measures of episodic memory and brain morphometric measures will still be predictive of the development of AD in a longer follow-up. To further test this hypothesis, we also included new biomarkers that we did not evaluate in our previous work: (1) a recently proposed factor that has been implicated in the risk of AD development, namely CSF linear combination of amyloid-b (Ab) 1-42 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 181p [9] ; and (2) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) biomarkers, specifically the hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), a single measure intended to reflect the extent to which the pattern and magnitude of cerebral hypometabolism in an individual correspond to that in probable AD patients [10] . HCI has been shown to be predictive of AD progression in MCI alone or in combination with hippocampal volume."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

Furthermore, we also sought to extend our model, including a recently proposed model of the combination of Ab and p-tau for the prediction of conversion, within the same analytic framework that we used in our previous study. Inclusion criteria for MCI and healthy subjects are described elsewhere [2] and on the ADNI website (http://www. adni-infor.org). In brief, MCI patients had Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) [11] scores between 24 and 30 (inclusive), a memory complaint, objective memory loss, a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [12] score of 0.5, absence of significant impairment in other cognitive domains, and preserved activities of daily living. In an attempt to ascertain conversion to AD, we excluded MCI subjects whose conversion to AD was not verified at another additional follow-up (i.e. at least two consecutive visits being diagnosed as AD and no reversion to MCI.

Concentrations of Ab 1-42 , total tau (t-tau), and p-tau 181p in CSF have been reported as strongly associated with the development of AD [13] and accurate in identifying incipient AD [14] . We used logtransformed values for Ab 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau 181p as well as for t-tau/Ab 1-42, p-tau 181p /Ab 1-42, and Ab 1-42 /p-tau 181p ratios. Because some reports have indicated that the influence of Ab 1-42 on brain volumetric and cognitive decline measures only occurs in the presence of elevated p-tau 181p [9, 15] , we also included a measure of the linear combination of Ab 1-42 and p-tau 181p that has not been previously tested on their predictive utility for conversion to AD. According to published ADNI proposed CSF cutoffs values [16] , we classified the subjects on the basis of high or positive (.23 pg/mL) and low or negative (,23 pg/mL) p-tau 181p levels and low or positive (,192 pg/mL) and high or negative (.192 pg/mL) Ab 1-42 levels. We calculated a new ordinal variable with the combination of these cutoffs levels that yielded four levels: high Ab and low ptau codified as 1, high Ab and high p-tau codified as 2, low Ab and low p-tau codified as 3, and finally low Ab and high p-tau codified as 4. Subjects classified as having low Ab (positive Ab) and high p-tau (positive p-tau) were greater in the MCI converters group (82.1%) compared with nonconverters (53.1%) (c 2 5 16.27, P 5 .001)."}, {"section_title": "PET-FDG acquisition and processing", "text": "A PET-FDG measure involving a voxelwise approach, the HCI, was used.

First, we tested the predictive validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the best model we obtained in 2 years of follow-up but now applied to the 4-year follow-up data.

Furthermore, these findings are strengthened by a complementary analysis in which patterns of decline on the different markers showed that cognitive measures (plus a measure of function) had larger ES in the MCI subgroup that progressed to AD.\nIn our previous study in the same sample, but with a shorter follow-up of 2 years, we found that two episodic delayed memory measures (plus left middle temporal thickness) were the variables that best predicted conversion to AD [2] . Application of this former predictive model to the current 4-year data yielded an AUC of 0.77 (sensitivity 5 66% and specificity 5 70%). In comparison to our initial 2011 model, this reflected a decrease in specificity but an increase in sensitivity in the measures' ability to predict conversion to AD in 4 years of follow-up. Nevertheless, and critically, AUC and the pseudo-R 2 of our initial model at 2 years of follow-up were fully comparable to the new \"winners\" model at 4 years of follow-up (AUC 5 0.78).\nSeveral studies from ADNI, including our original study, have demonstrated that cognitive tests are robust predictors of MCI to AD conversion and HC-MCI discrimination [2] [3] [4] [5] 17] . Studies conducted in other MCI populations (i.e., outside of ADNI) have found results similar to ours when combining different classes of markers [26, 27] . Furthermore some findings place verbal episodic memory impairments (recall and learning) at least 5 years before dementia onset [28] [29] [30] . An interesting study has indicated that memory decline may be indicative of subclinical AD Abbreviations: MCI, mild cognitive impairment; SD, standard deviation; FDG-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography; HCI, hypometabolic convergence index; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; Ab, amyloid-b; t-tau; total tau; p-tau, phosphorylated tau.\n*Measured in cubic millimeters.\ny Measured in millimeters. z n 5 79, three subjects had Ab but not t-tau.\nx n 5 85, one subject had p-tau but not t-tau or Ab.\nin otherwise healthy individuals as demonstrated by amyloid accumulation in PET-amyloid imaging [31] . Individual AUC for neuropsychological predictors (AVLT) was in some cases as high as for the combination models [27] . Nevertheless, studies outside of ADNI have reported higher AUC probabilities as compared with our AUCs. Differential characteristics of the MCI samples under examination and different sampling procedures may have played a role in this discrepancy because other studies derived from ADNI have reported similar AUCs to ours when comparing MCI patients that converted to AD to those who remained stable [3] .\nThere are several other issues that deserve comment. First, our new predictive model did not include any brain morphometry measure. Although left middle temporal lobe thickness and left hippocampus volume were significant predictors in the individual MRI model, they did not reach statistical significance when combined with the rest of the markers. One possible reason for this might be related to the inclusion of a glucose metabolism measure (FDG-PET) because when this biomarker was not modeled, left middle temporal lobe thickness and left hippocampus volume (plus episodic memory) were significant predictors of conversion in the combined model (data not shown). Furthermore, a complementary analysis showed that middle temporal thickness and FDG-PET had greater decline along 4 years than the rest of the brain morphometric measures (see Figure 2 ). Hence, collinearity and sample size issues (subjects with valid measures on all of the variables changed as a different set of variables were fitted together) may have forced the exclusion of MRI measures in the final model.\nA second issue relates to our CSF findings. When modeling only CSF measures, the p-tau/Ab 1-42 ratio was found to be predictive of AD conversion; however, this ratio did not demonstrate predictive significance when combined with other measures (MRI, FDG-PET, and cognitive measures) in the final regression model. Therefore, in this MCI sample, CSF biomarkers at baseline did not have independent predictive utility when combined with other predictors, and they did not show significant decline through follow-up. It might be possible that this result is related to the stage in the progression of the underlying neuropathology in this particular MCI population [32] (i.e., CSF biomarkers have been proposed as more informative in very early preclinical states) or increased utility in longer follow-ups [33] , making these measures perhaps more suitable to identify healthy subjects at risk of future AD development. However, our results suggest that cognitive markers may be equally if not more effective as predictors in our study. As opposed to our methods, preclinical CSF studies generally do not directly compare CSF and cognitive markers. In addition, it has also been claimed that Ab-associated brain volume loss [15] and clinical decline [9] occur only in the presence of elevated p-tau. However, our findings do not point toward a strong predictive ability of a p-tau/Ab linear combination on AD progression in MCI.\nThird, it is important to note that the number of subjects included in our regression models decreased when predictive variables were progressively estimated together given that fewer subjects underwent lumbar punctures compared with MRI or cognitive assessment; this fact may have restricted our ability to adequately compare different clusters of markers in simultaneous combination. Our approach to overcome this issue was clustering set of similar markers into separate regression analyses, hence maximizing sample size on each model, and finally aggregating the resulting significant measures (\"winners\") into a final predictive model. Also, we acknowledge that our findings may not be fully generalizable to other studies outside of ADNI.\nFourth, another factor that could have influenced our findings is related to the age of the subjects studied. MRI and cognition have been found to remain informative in older and younger patients (as subjects included in our study), unlike CSF biomarkers, which are only predictive of subsequent AD development in younger individuals [34] . As such, biological and cognitive markers may have different roles at various points in the development of AD (i.e., they can be differentially sensitive to changes at different stages of the disease) [35] .\nFinally, as our complementary ES analysis indicated, function as measured by the FAQ showed the highest decline through 4 years in the MCI converters subgroup. However, we did not include it in the predictive models because doing so would create a tautology (i.e., function is used to distinguish the MCI and AD diagnoses). Nevertheless, it is empirically a strong predictor of conversion.\nIn summary, cognitive markers were still predictive of conversion to AD in a MCI population at 4 years of follow-up as they were found to be at 2 years of follow-up. This set of findings highlights the importance of cognitive measures, even those derived from basic clinical neuropsychological tests, in their predictive utility for MCI to AD progression."}]
