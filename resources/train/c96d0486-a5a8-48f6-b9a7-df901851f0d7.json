[{"section_title": "Sea Level Rise", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "KEY FINDINGS", "text": "1. Global mean sea level (GMSL) has risen by about 7-8 inches (about 16-21 cm) since 1900, with about 3 of those inches (about 7 cm) occurring since 1993 (very high confidence). Human-caused climate change has made a substantial contribution to GMSL rise since 1900 (high confidence), contributing to a rate of rise that is greater than during any preceding century in at least 2,800 years (medium confidence). 2. Relative to the year 2000, GMSL is very likely to rise by 0.3-0.6 feet (9-18 cm) by 2030, 0.5-1.2 feet (15-38 cm) by 2050, and 1 to 4 feet (30-130 cm) by 2100 (very high confidence in lower bounds; medium confidence in upper bounds for 2030 and 2050; low confidence in upper bounds for 2100). Future emissions pathways have little effect on projected GMSL rise in the first half of the century, but significantly affect projections for the second half of the century (high confidence). Emerging science regarding Antarctic ice sheet stability suggests that, for high emission scenarios, a GMSL rise exceeding 8 feet (2.4 m) by 2100 is physically possible, although the probability of such an extreme outcome cannot currently be assessed. Regardless of emissions pathway, it is extremely likely that GMSL rise will continue beyond 2100 (high confidence). 3. Relative sea level (RSL) rise in this century will vary along U.S. coastlines due, in part, to changes in Earth's gravitational field and rotation from melting of land ice, changes in ocean circulation, and vertical land motion (very high confidence). For almost all future GMSL rise scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low GMSL rise scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high GMSL rise scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska. Almost all U.S. coastlines experience more than global mean sea level rise in response to Antarctic ice loss, and thus would be particularly affected under extreme GMSL rise scenarios involving substantial Antarctic mass loss (high confidence). 4. As sea levels have risen, the number of tidal floods each year that cause minor impacts (also called \"nuisance floods\") have increased 5-to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal cities (very high confidence). Rates of increase are accelerating in over 25 Atlantic and Gulf Coast cities (very high confidence). Tidal flooding will continue increasing in depth, frequency, and extent this century (very high confidence). 5. Assuming storm characteristics do not change, sea level rise will increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters (very high confidence). A projected increase in the intensity of hurricanes in the North Atlantic could increase the probability of extreme flooding along most of the U.S. Atlantic"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Sea level rise is closely linked to increasing global temperatures. Thus, even as uncertainties remain about just how much sea level may rise this century, it is virtually certain that sea level rise this century and beyond will pose a growing challenge to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems from increased (permanent) inundation, more frequent and extreme coastal flooding, erosion of coastal landforms, and saltwater intrusion within coastal rivers and aquifers. Assessment of vulnerability to rising sea levels requires consideration of physical causes, historical evidence, and projections. A risk-based perspective on sea level rise points to the need for emphasis on how changing sea levels alter the coastal zone and interact with coastal flood risk at local scales. This chapter reviews the physical factors driving global and regional sea level changes. It presents geological and instrumental observations of historical sea level changes and an assessment of the human contribution to sea level change. It then describes a range of scenarios for future levels and rates of sea level change, and the relationship of these scenarios to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Finally, it assesses the impact of changes in sea level on extreme water levels. While outside the scope of this chapter, it is important to note the myriad of other potential impacts associated with relative sea level (RSL) rise, wave action, and increases in coastal flooding. These impacts include loss of life, damage to infrastructure and the built environment, salinization of coastal aquifers, mobilization of pollutants, changing sediment budgets, coastal erosion, and ecosystem changes such as marsh loss and threats to endangered flora and fauna (Wong et al. 2014). While all of these impacts are inherently important, some also have the potential to influence local rates of RSL rise and the extent of wave-driven and coastal flooding impacts. For example, there is evidence that wave action and flooding of beaches and marshes can induce changes in coastal geomorphology, such as sediment build up, that may iteratively modify the future flood risk profile of communities and ecosystems (Lentz et al. 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Physical Factors Contributing to Sea Level Rise", "text": "Sea level change is driven by a variety of mechanisms operating at different spatial and temporal scales (see Kopp et al. 2015a for a review). Global mean sea level (GMSL) rise is primarily driven by two factors: 1) increased volume of seawater due to thermal expansion of the ocean as it warms, and 2) increased mass of water in the ocean due to melting ice from mountain glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (Church et al. 2013). The overall amount (mass) of ocean water, and thus sea level, is also affected to a lesser extent by changes in global land-water storage, which reflects changes in the impoundment of water in dams and reservoirs and river runoff from groundwater extraction, inland sea and wetland drainage, and global precipitation patterns, such as occurs during phases of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Church et al. 2013;Reager et al. 2016;Rietbroek et al. 2016;Wada et al. 2016Wada et al. , 2017. Sea level and its changes are not uniform globally for several reasons. First, atmosphere-ocean dynamics-driven by ocean circulation, winds, and other factors-are associated with differences in the height of the sea surface, as are differences in density arising from the distribution of heat and salinity in the ocean. Changes in any of these factors will affect sea surface height. For example, a weakening of the Gulf Stream transport in the mid-to-late 2000s may have contributed to enhanced sea level rise in the ocean environment extending to the northeastern U.S. coast (Boon 2012;Sallenger et al. 2012;Ezer 2013), a trend that many models project will continue into the future (Yin and Goddard 2013). Second, the locations of land ice melting and land water reservoir changes impart distinct regional \"static-equilibrium fingerprints\" on sea level, based on gravitational, rotational, and crustal deformation effects (Mitrovica et al. 2011) ( Figure 12.1a-d). For example, sea level falls near a melting ice sheet because of the reduced gravitational attraction of the ocean toward the ice sheet; reciprocally, it rises by greater than the global average far from the melting ice sheet. Third, the Earth's mantle is still moving in response to the loss of the great North American (Laurentide) and European ice sheets of the Last Glacial Maximum; the associated changes in the height of the land, the shape of the ocean basin, and the Earth's gravitational field give rise to glacial-isostatic adjustment (Figure 12.1e). For example, in areas once covered by the thickest parts of the great ice sheets of the Last Glacial Maximum, such as in Hudson Bay and in Scandinavia, post-glacial rebound of the land is causing relative sea level (RSL) to fall. Along the flanks of the ice sheets, such as along most of the east coast of the United States, subsidence of the bulge that flanked the ice sheet is causing RSL to rise. Finally, a variety of other factors can cause local vertical land movement. These include natural sediment compaction, compaction caused by local extraction of groundwater and fossil fuels, and processes related to plate tectonics, such as earthquakes and more gradual seismic creep (Zervas et al. 2013;W\u00f6ppelmann and Marcos 2016) (Figure 12.1f). Compared to many climate variables, the trend signal for sea level change tends to be large relative to natural variability. However, at interannual timescales, changes in ocean dynamics, density, and wind can cause substantial sea level variability in some regions. For example, there has been a multidecadal suppression of sea level rise off the Pacific coast (Bromirski et al. 2011) and large year-to-year variations in sea level along the Northeast U.S. coast (Goddard et al. 2015). Local rates of land height change have also varied dramatically on decadal timescales in some locations, such as along the western Gulf Coast, where rates of subsurface extraction of fossil fuels and groundwater have varied over time (Galloway et al. 1999). [INSERT FIGURE 12.1 HERE]"}, {"section_title": "Paleo Sea Level", "text": "Geological records of temperature and sea level indicate that during past warm periods over the last several millions of years, GMSL was higher than it is today (Miller et al. 2005;Dutton et al. 2015). During the Last Interglacial stage, about 125,000 years ago, global average sea surface temperature was about 0.5\u00b0 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0F) above the preindustrial level [that is, comparable to the average over 1995-2014, when global mean temperature was about 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) above the preindustrial levels] (Hoffman et al. 2017). Polar temperatures were comparable to those projected for 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F-3.6\u00b0F) of global mean warming above the preindustrial level. At this time, GMSL was about 6-9 meters (about 20-30 feet) higher than today (Dutton and Lambeck 2012;Kopp et al. 2009) (Figure 12.2a). This geological benchmark may indicate the probable long-term response of GMSL to the minimum magnitude of temperature change projected for the current century. Similarly, during the mid-Pliocene warm period, about 3 million years ago, global mean temperature was about 1.8\u00b0-3.6\u00b0C (3.2\u00b0-6.5\u00b0F) above the preindustrial level (Haywood et al. 2013). Estimates of GMSL are less well constrained than during the Last Interglacial, due to the smaller number of local geological sea level reconstruction and the possibility of significant vertical land motion over millions of years (Dutton et al. 2015). Some reconstructions place mid-Pliocene GMSL at about 10-30 meters (about 30-100 feet) higher than today (Miller et al. 2012). Sea levels this high would require a significantly reduced Antarctic ice sheet, highlighting the risk of significant Antarctic ice sheet loss under such levels of warming ( Figure 12.2a). For the period since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 26,000 to 19,000 years ago (Clark et al. 2009), geologists can produce detailed reconstructions of sea levels as well as rates of sea level change. To do this, they use proxies such as the heights of fossil coral reefs and the populations of different salinity-sensitive microfossils within salt marsh sediments (Shennan et al. 2015). During the main portion of the deglaciation, from about 17,000 to 8,000 years ago, GMSL rose at an average rate of about 12 mm/year (0.5 inches/year) (Lambeck et al. 2014). However, there were periods of faster rise. For example, during Meltwater Pulse 1a, lasting from about 14,600 to 14,300 years ago, GMSL may have risen at an average rate about 50 mm/year (2 inches/year) (Deschamps et al. 2012). Since the disappearance of the last remnants of the North American (Laurentide) Ice Sheet about 7,000 years ago (Carlson et al. 2008) to about the start of the 20th century, however, GMSL has been relatively stable. During this period, total GMSL rise is estimated to have been about 4 meters (about 13 feet), most of which occurred between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago (Lambeck et al. 2014). The Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3) noted, based on a geological data set from North Carolina (Kemp et al. 2011), that the 20th century GMSL rise was much faster than at any time over the past 2,000 years. Since NCA3, high-resolution sea level reconstructions 1 have been developed for multiple locations, and a new global analysis of such reconstructions 2 strengdlens tIlls finding (Kopp et al. 20 16). Over the last 2,000 years, prior to the industrial era, GMSL exhibited small fluctuations of about \u00b18 em (3 inches) , widl a significant decline of about 8 em (3 inches) Figure 12.2b , Figure 12 .3a) and 18-21 cm (7-8 inches) since 1900 . Satellite (altimetry and gravity) and in sihl water column (Argo float s) measurements show that , since 2005, about one third of GMSL rise has been from steric changes (primarily thernial expansion) and about two thirds from the addition of mass to the ocean , which represents a growing land-ice contribution (compared to steric) and a departure from the relative contributions earlier in the 20th century (Church et al. 2013;Llovel et al. 20 (Figure 12 .3a). In addition to land ice , dIe mass-addition contribution also includes net changes in global landwater storage . TIus terni varied in sign over dIe course of dIe last century , with human-induced 31 changes in land-water storage being negative (perhaps as much as about -0.6 min/year [-0.02 inches/year]) during the period of heavy dam constmction in dIe middle of dIe last century , and turning positive in the 1990s as groundwater withdrawal came to dominate (Wada et al. 20 17) . On decadal timescales, precipitation variability can dominate human-induced changes in land water storage; recent satellite-gravity estimates suggest that , over 2002-2014 , a human-caused land-water contribution to GMSL of 0.4 min/year (0.02 inches/year) was more dIan offset by -0.7 nun/year (-0.03 inches/year) due to natural variability (Reager et al. 20 16) ."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Comparison of results from a variety of approaches supports the conclusion dlat a substantial 2 fraction of GMSL rise since 1900 is attributable to human-caused climate change (Kapp et al . 20 16;Slangen et al. 2016;levrejeva et al. 2009;Dangendorf et al. 2015;Becker et al. 20 14;Marcos and Amores 2014;Slangen et al. 20 14a;Marzeion et al. 20 14;Marcos et al. 20l7). For example , based on the long tenn historical relationship between temperature and rate of GMSL change , Ka pp et al. 2016found that GMSL rise would extremely likely have been le ss than 59% of observed in the absence of 20dl century global wanning . and that it is very likely that GMSL has been higher since 1960 dIan it would have been without 20th century global wannillg (Figure 12 .3b). Similarly, using a variety of models for individual components , Siangen et al. 2016). Floating ice shelves around Antarctica are losing mass at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015). Mass loss from floating ice shelves does not directly affect GMSL, but does allow faster flow of ice from the ice sheet into the ocean. Estimates of mass loss in Greenland based on mass balance from input-output, repeat gravimetry, repeat altimetry, and aerial imagery as discussed in Chapter 11: Arctic Changes reveal a recent acceleration (Khan et al. 2014). Mass loss averaged approximately 75 Gt/year (about 0.2 mm/year [0.01 inches/year] GMSL rise) from 1900 to 1983, continuing at a similar rate of approximately 74 Gt/year through 2003 before accelerating to 186 Gt/year (0.5 mm/year [0.02 inches/year] GMSL rise) from 2003 to 2010 (Kjeldsen et al. 2015). Strong interannual variability does exist (see Ch. 11: Arctic Changes), such as during the exceptional melt year from April 2012 to April 2013, which resulted in mass loss of approximately 560 Gt (1.6 mm/year [0.06 inches/year]) (Tedesco et al. 2013). More recently (April 2014-April 2015), annual mass losses have resumed the accelerated rate of 186 Gt/year (Kjeldsen et al. 2015;Tedesco et al. 2016). Mass loss over the last century has reversed the long-term trend of slow thickening linked to the continuing evolution of the ice sheet from the end of the last ice age (MacGregor et al. 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Projected Sea Level Rise", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Scenarios of Global Mean Sea Level Rise", "text": "No single physical model is capable of accurately representing all of the major processes contributing to GMSL and regional/local RSL rise. Accordingly, the U.S. Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force (Sweet et al. 2017; henceforth referred to as \"Interagency\") has revised the GMSL rise scenarios for the United States and now provides six scenarios that can be used for assessment and risk-framing purposes (Figure 12.4a; Table 12.1). The low scenario of 30 cm (about 1 foot) GMSL rise by 2100 is consistent with a continuation of the recent approximately 3 mm/year (0.12 inches/year) rate of rise through to 2100 (Table 12.2), while the five other scenarios span a range of GMSL rise between 50 and 250 cm (1.6 and 8.2 feet) in 2100, with corresponding rise rates between 5 mm/year (0.2 inches/year) to 44 mm/year (1.7 inches/year) towards the end of this century (Table 12.2). The highest scenario of 250 cm is consistent with several literature estimates of the maximum physically plausible level of 21st century sea level rise (e.g., Pfeffer et al. 2008, updated with Sriver et al. 2012 estimates of thermal expansion and Bamber and Aspinall 2013 estimates of Antarctic contribution, and incorporating land water storage, as discussed in Miller et al. 2013;Kopp et al. 2014). It is also consistent with the high end of recent projections of Antarctic ice sheet melt discussed below (DeConto and Pollard 2016). The Interagency GMSL scenario interpretations are shown in Table 12.3. ["}, {"section_title": "INSERT FIGURE 12.4 HERE]", "text": "The Interagency scenario approach is similar to local RSL rise scenarios of Hall et al. (2016) used for all coastal U.S. Department of Defense installations worldwide. The Interagency approach starts with a probabilistic projection framework to generate time series and regional projections consistent with each GMSL rise scenario for 2100 (Kopp et al. 2014). That framework combines probabilistic estimates of contributions to GMSL and regional RSL rise from ocean processes, cryospheric processes, geological processes, and anthropogenic landwater storage. Pooling the Kopp et al. (2014) projections across RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, the probabilistic projections are filtered to identify pathways consistent with each of these levels with median (and 17th and 83rd percentiles) picked from each of the filtered subsets.  Kopp et al. (2014), the probability of exceeding the amount of GMSL in 2100 under the Interagency scenarios is shown in Table 12.4. The Antarctic projections of Kopp et al. (2014), the GMSL projections of which underlie Table   12.4, are consistent with a statistical-physical model of the onset of marine ice sheet instability calibrated to observations of ongoing retreat in the Amundsen Embayment sector of West Antarctica (Ritz et al. 2015). Ritz et al. (2015)'s 95th percentile Antarctic contribution to GMSL of 30 cm by 2100 is comparable to Kopp et al. (2014)'s 95th percentile projection of 33 cm under RCP8.5. However, emerging science suggests that these projections may understate the probability of faster-than-expected ice sheet melt, particularly for high-end warming scenarios. While these probability estimates are consistent with the assumption that the relationship between global temperature and GMSL in the coming century will be similar to that observed over the last two millennia (Rahmstorf 2007;Kopp et al. 2016), emerging positive feedbacks (self-amplifying cycles) in the Antarctic Ice Sheet especially (Rignot et al. 2014;Joughin et al. 2014) may invalidate that assumption. Physical feedbacks that until recently were not incorporated into ice sheet models (Pollard et al. 2015) could add about 0-10 cm (0-0.3 feet), 20-50 cm (0.7-1.6 feet) and 60-110 cm (2.0-3.6 feet) to central estimates of current century sea level rise under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (DeConto and Pollard 2016). In addition to marine ice sheet instability, examples of these interrelated processes include ice cliff instability and ice shelf hydrofracturing. Processes underway in Greenland may also be leading to accelerating high-end melt risk. Much of the research has focused on changes in surface albedo driven by the melt-associated unmasking and concentration of impurities in snow and ice (Tedesco et al. 2016). However, ice dynamics at the bottom of the ice sheet may be important as well, through interactions with surface runoff or a warming ocean. As an example of the latter, Jakobshavn Isbrae, Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, and the Northeast Greenland ice stream may be vulnerable to marine ice sheet instability (Khan et al. 2014). "}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise after 2100", "text": "GMSL rise will not stop in 2100, and so it is useful to consider extensions of GMSL rise projections beyond this point. By 2200, the 0.3-2.5 meters (1.0-8.2 feet) range spanned by the six Interagency GMSL scenarios in year 2100 increases to about 0.4-9.7 meters (1.3-31.8 feet), as shown in Table 12.5. These six scenarios imply average rates of GMSL rise over the first half of the next century of 1.4 mm/year (0.06 inch/year), 4.6 mm/yr (0.2 inch/year), 16 mm/year (0.6 inch/year), 32 mm/year (1.3 inches/year), 46 mm/yr (1.8 inches/year) and 60 mm/year (2.4 inches/year), respectively. Excluding the possible effects of still emerging science regarding ice cliffs and ice shelves, it is very likely that by 2200 GMSL will have risen by 0.3-2.4 meters (1.0-7.9 feet) under RCP2.6, 0.4-2.7 meters (1.3-8.9 feet) under RCP4.5, and 1.0-3.7 meters (3.3-12 feet) under RCP8.5 (Kopp et al. 2014). Under most projections, GMSL rise will also not stop in 2200. The concept of a \"sea level rise commitment\" refers to the long-term projected sea level rise were the planet's temperature to be stabilized at a given level (e.g., Levermann et al. 2013;Golledge et al. 2015). The paleo sea level record suggests that even 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) of global average warming above the preindustrial temperature may represent a commitment to several meters of rise. One modeling study suggesting a 2,000-year commitment of 2.3 m/\u00b0C (4.2 feet/\u00b0F) (Levermann et al. 2013) indicates that emissions through to 2100 would lock in a likely 2,000-year GMSL rise commitment of about 0.7-4.2 meters (2.3-14 feet) under RCP2.6, about 1.7-5.6 meters (5.6-19 feet) under RCP4.5, and about 4.3-9.9 meters (14-33 feet) under RCP8.5 (Strauss et al. 2015). However, as with the 21st century projections, emerging science regarding the sensitivity of the Antarctic Ice Sheet may increase the estimated sea level rise over the next millennium, especially for high emissions pathways (DeConto and Pollard 2016). Large-scale climate geoengineering might reduce these commitments (Irvine et al. 2009; Applegate and Keller 2015), but may not be able to avoid lock-in of significant change (Lenton 2011;Barrett et al. 2014;Markusson et al. 2014;Sillmann et al. 2015). Once changes are realized, they will be effectively irreversible for many millennia, even if humans artificially accelerate the removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere (DeConto and Pollard 2016). The 2,000-year commitment understates the full sea level rise commitment, due to the long response time of the polar ice sheets. Paleo sea level records (Figure 12.2a) suggest that 1\u00b0C of warming may already represent a long-term commitment to more than 6 meters (20 feet) of GMSL rise (Dutton and Lambeck 2012;Kopp et al. 2009;Dutton et al. 2015). A 10,000-year modeling study (Clark et al. 2016) suggests that 2\u00b0C warming represents a 10,000-year commitment to about 25 meters (80 feet) of GMSL rise, driven primarily by a loss of about onethird of the Antarctic ice sheet and three-fifths of the Greenland ice sheet, while the 21st century RCP8.5 emissions represent a 10,000-year commitment to about 38 meters (125 feet) of GMSL rise, including a complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over about 6,000 years.

Based on the process-level projections of the Interagency GMSL scenarios, several key regional patterns are apparent in future U.S. RSL rise as shown for the Intermediate (1 meter [3.3 feet] GMSL rise by 2100 scenario) in Figure 12.4b. (1) RSL rise due to Antarctic Ice Sheet melt is greater than GMSL rise along all U.S. coastlines due to static-equilibrium effects. (2) RSL rise due to Greenland Ice Sheet melt is less than GMSL rise in the continental U.S. due to static-equilibrium effects. This effect is especially strong in the Northeast. (3) RSL rise is additionally augmented in the Northeast by the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment.

Were the AMOC to collapse entirely-an outcome viewed as unlikely in the 21st century-it could result in as much as approximately 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of additional regional sea level rise (Gregory and Lowe 2000;Levermann et al. 2005; see Ch. 15: Potential Surprises for further discussion). (5) The western Gulf of Mexico and parts of the U.S. Atlantic Coast south of New York are currently experiencing significant RSL rise caused by the withdrawal of groundwater (along the Atlantic Coast) and of both fossil fuels and groundwater (along the Gulf Coast). Continuation of these practices will further amplify RSL rise. (6) The presence of glaciers in Alaska and their proximity to the Pacific Northwest reduces RSL rise in these regions, due to both the ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment to past glacier shrinkage and to the static-equilibrium effects of projected future losses.

The research is mixed about strong extratropical storms; studies find potential increases in frequency and intensity in some regions, like within the Northeast (Colle et al. 2013), whereas others project decreases in strong extratropical storms in some regions (e.g., Zappa et al. 2013). For tropical cyclones, model projections for the North Atlantic mostly agree that intensities and precipitation rates will increase this century (see Ch. 9: Extreme Storms), although some model evidence suggests that track changes could dampen the effect in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast (Hall and Yonekura 2013). Assuming other storm characteristics do not change, sea level rise will increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters. A projected increase in the intensity of hurricanes in the North Atlantic could increase the probability of extreme flooding along most of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coast States beyond what would be projected based solely on RSL rise (Grinsted et al. 2013;Lin et al. 2012;Little et al. 2015;Lin et al. 2016). In addition, RSL increases are projected to cause a nonlinear increase in storm surge heights in shallow bathymetry environments (Smith et al. 2010;Atkinson et al. 2013;Bilskie et al. 2014;Passeri et al. 2015;Bilskie et al. 2016) and extend wave propagation and impacts landward (Smith et al. 2010;Atkinson et al. 2013). However, there is low confidence in the magnitude of the increase in intensity and the associated flood risk amplification, and it could be offset or amplified by other factors, such as changes in storm frequency or tracks (e.g., Knutson et al. 2013Knutson et al. , 2015 Subject to Final Copyedit 28 June 2017 509"}, {"section_title": "TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Key Finding", "text": "Global mean sea level (GMSL) has risen by about 7-8 inches (about 16-21 cm) since 1900, with about of those inches (about 7 cm) occurring since (very high confidence). Human-caused climate change has made a substantial contribution to GMSL rise since 1900 (high confidence), contributing to a rate of rise that is greater than during any preceding century in at least 2,800 years (medium confidence)."}, {"section_title": "Description of evidence base", "text": "Multiple researchers, using different statistical approaches, have integrated tide gauge records to estimate GMSL rise since the late nineteenth century (e.g., White 2006, 2011;Jevrejeva et al. 2009). The most recent published rate estimates are 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 (Hay et al. 2015) or 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 (Church and White 2011) mm/year over 1901-1990. Thus, these results indicate about 11-14 cm (4-5 inches) of GMSL rise from 1901 to 1990. Tide gauge analyses indicate that GMSL rose at a considerably faster rate of about 3 mm/year (0.12 inches/year) since 1993 (Hay et al. 2015; Church and White 2011), a result supported by satellite data indicating a trend of 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 mm/year (0.13 inches/year) over 1993-2015(update to Nerem et al. 2010 (Figure 12.3a). These results indicate an additional GMSL rise of about 7 cm (3 inches) rise since 1990. Thus, total GMSL rise since 1900 is about 18-21 cm (7-8 inches). The finding regarding the historical context of the 20th century change is based upon Kopp et al. (2016), who conducted a meta-analysis of geological RSL reconstructions spanning the last 3,000 years from 24 locations around the world as well as tide gauge data from 66 sites and the tide gauge based GMSL reconstruction of Hay et al. (2015). By constructing a spatio-temporal statistical model of these data sets, they identified the common global sea level signal over the last three millennia and its uncertainties. They found a 95% probability that the average rate of GMSL change over 1900-2000 was greater than during any preceding century in at least 2,800 years. The finding regarding the substantial human contribution is based upon several lines of evidence. Kopp et al. (2016), based on the long term historical relationship between temperature and the rate of sea level change, found that it is extremely likely that GMSL rise would have been <59% of observed in the absence of 20th century global warming, and that it is very likely that GMSL has been higher since 1960 than it would have been without 20th century global warming. Using a variety of models for individual components, Slangen et al. (2016) found that 69% \u00b1 31% out of the 87% \u00b1 20% of GMSL rise over 1970-2005 that their models simulated was attributable to anthropogenic forcing, and that 37% \u00b1 38% out of 74% \u00b1 22% simulated was attributable over 1900. Jevrejeva et al. (2009, using the relationship between forcing and GMSL over 1850 and 2001 and CMIP3 models, found that ~75% of GMSL rise in the 20th century is attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Marcos and Amores (2014), using CMIP5 models, found that ~87% of 1 ocean heat uptake since 1970 in the top 700 m of the ocean has been due to anthropogenic 2 forcing. SlangeD et al. (2014a) , using C~5 , found that anthropogenic forcing was required to explain observed thennosteric SLR over 1957. Marzeion et al. (2014 found dIal 25% \u00b1 35% of glacial loss over 1851-2010, and 69% \u00b1 24% over 1991-2010, was attributable to anthropogenic forcing . Dangendorf et a1 (20 15) , based on time series analysis, found that >45 % of observed GMSL trend since 1900 cannot (with 99% probability) be explained by multidecadalllatural variability. Becker et al. (2014) , based on time series analysis, found a 99% probability that at least 1.0 or 1.3 mm/year of GMSL rise over 1880-2010 is anthropogenic.\nThe lower bound of the very likely range is based on a continuation of the observed approximately 3 Dun/year rate of GMSL rise. The upper end of the very likely range is ba sed upon estimates for RCP8.5 from three studies producing fully probabilistic projectio ns across multiple Reps. Ka pp et al . (2014) fu sed multiple sources of infonnation accounting for the 11 different individual process contributing to GMSL rise. Kopp et al. (2016) constmcted a semiempirical sea level model calibrated to the Common Era sea level reconstmction. Mengel et al . (2016) constructed a set of semi-empirical models of the different contributing processes. All three studies show negligible RCP dependence in dIe first half of this century , becoming more prominent in the second half of dIe century. A sensitivity study by Kopp et al. (2014), as well as studies by levrejeva et al. 2014and by Jackson and Jevrejeva (2016) , used frameworks similar to Kopp et al. (2016) but incorporated direcdy an expert elicitation study on ice sheet stability (Bamber and Aspinall 2013) . (This study was incorporated in Kopp et al. [2014]' s main result s with adjustments for consistency with Church et al. 20 13) . These studies extend the very likely range for RCP8.5 as high as 160-1 80 em (5--6 feet) (Kopp et al. 2014 , sensitivity study ;21 Jevrejeva et al. 20 14; Jackson and Jevrejeva 20 16) . To estimate dIe effect of incorporating the DeConto and Pollard (2016) projections of Antarctic ice sheet melt , we note that Kopp et al. (2014) ' s median projection of Antarctic melt in 2100 is 4 em (1.6 inches) (RCP2 .6), 5 em (2 inches) (RCP4 .5), or 6 em (2 .4 inches) (RCP8.5). By contrast , DeConto and Pollard (2016)'s ensemble mean projections are (varying the assumptions for the size of Pliocene mass loss and the bias correction in the Amundsen Sea) 2-14 em (0 .1-0 .5 foot) for RCP2.6, 26-58 em (0.9-1.9 feet) for RCP4 .5, and 64-114 em (2.1-3.7 ft) for RCP8.5. Thus, we conclude that DeConto and Pollard (2016)' s projection would lead to a -10 em (-0.1-0 .3 ft) increase in median RCP2 .6 projections, a 21-53 em (0 .7-1.7 feet) increase in median RCP4 .5 projections, and a 58-108 em (1.9-3.5 feet) increase in median RCP8.5 projections. \nThe processes that cause geographic variability in RSL change are reviewed by Kopp et al. (2015a). Long tide gauge data sets show the RSL rise caused by vertical land motion due to glacio-isostatic adjustment and fluid withdrawal along many U.S. coastlines (PSMSL 2016;Holgate et al. 2013). These observations are corroborated by glacio-isostatic adjustment models, by GPS observations, and by geological data (e.g., Engelhart and Horton 2012). The physics of the gravitational, rotational and flexural \"static-equilibrium fingerprint\" response of sea level to redistribution of mass from land ice to the oceans is well established (Farrell and Clark 1976;Mitrovica et al. 2011). GCM studies indicate the potential for a Gulf Stream contribution to sea level rise in the U.S. Northeast (Yin et al. 2009;Yin and Goddard 2013). Kopp et al. (2014) and Slangen et al. (2014a)  GMSL change in these studies indicate that local rise is likely to be greater than the global average along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and less than the global average in most of the Pacific Northwest. Sea level rise projections in this report are developed by an Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force (Sweet et al. 2017).\nHistorical changes over the last 60 years in flood probabilities have occurred most rapidly where RSL rates were highest and where tide ranges and extreme variability is less . In terms of future rates of changes in extreme event probabilities relative to fixed elevations, Hunter (2012), Tebaldi et al. (2012), Kopp et al. (2014),  and Sweet et al. (2017) all find that locations with less extreme variability and higher RSL rise rates are most prone.\nThe frequency , extent, and depth of extreme event-driven (for example. 5 to year event probabilities) coastal flooding relative to existing infrastmctnre will continue to increase in the future as local RSL rises (T ebaldi et al. 20 12;Horton et al. 11 ;Woodruff et al. 20 13;Ka pp et al. 20 14;Buchanan et al. 20 16;Hall et al. 20 16;Sweet et al. 20 17) . Extreme flood probabilities will increase regardless of change in stoml characteristics, which may exacerbate such changes. Model-based projections of tropical storms and related major storm surges within the North Atlantic mostly agree that intensities and frequencies of the most intense 11 storms will increase this century (Grinsted et al. 2013;Lin et al. 2012;Little et al. 2015;Knutson et al. 2013;Lin et al. 2016). However, the projection of increased hurricane intensity is more robust across models than the projection of increased frequency of the most intense stonns, since a number of models project a decrease in the overall number of tropical stonns and hurricanes in the North Atlantic , although high-resolution models generally project increased mean hurricane intensity (e .g., Knutson et al. 2013). fu addition, there is model evidence for a change in tropical cyclone tracks in wann years that minimizes the increase in 1andfalling hurricanes in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic or Northeast (Hall and Yonekura 2013). Major uncertainties Uncertainties remain large with respect to the precise change in future risk of a major coastal 21 impact at a specific location from changes in the most intense tropical cyclone characteristics and tracks beyond changes imposed from local sea level rise. Assessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement, including short description of nature of evidence and level of agreement There is lolV corifidellce that the flood risk at specific locations will be amplified from a major tropical sta nn this century.
