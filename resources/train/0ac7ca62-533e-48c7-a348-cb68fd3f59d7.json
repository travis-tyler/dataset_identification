[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), particularly in its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remains still a challenge.

Objective: In this work we aim at: predicting the conversion of MCI affected subjects to AD more than months in advance of their conversion session and understanding the progression of the disease by predicting neuropsychological test outcomes from MRI data. Methods: In order to do so, SBM is applied to a series of MRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

I", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world, with more than million affected, a number that is expected to grow up to . million by [ ]. Many computational tools have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of AD, however, its early diagnosis remains a challenge, especially in its prodromal stage known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The early and more accurate diagnosis of possible AD would reduce the mistreatment of MCI and an earlier treatment of the disease when its symptoms are still subtle. This might positively impact the progression of AD, delaying the apparition of a more severe symptomatology and improving the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients and their families.\nCurrently, cognitive testing is often used to guide in the diagnosis procedure. Clinical tests such as Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) [ ] or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAScog, in and -question variants) [ ] are often used to assess cognitive decline in patients in risk of suffering AD. However, recent studies [ , ] show that non-speci ic neuropsychological scores such as MMSE could be a possible source of false positives in MCI diagnosis.\nNeuroimaging, with its ability to perform in vivo exploration of brain structure and function, could be a key source of information to enhance MCI diagnosis. Many works have explored the possibility of multivariate analyses of structural and functional imaging using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis [ , ] , Support Vector Machines [ , , ] , texture analysis [ , , ] or volume and shape analysis [ , , , , , ] . These works used semiautomatic methodology to segment and extract features from images that leaded to higher discriminative Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems [ ], offering performances up to % in the diagnosis of MCI.\nObtaining reliable and objective information from neuroimaging data could effectively increase the accuracy of MCI diagnosis. For its part, predicting neuropsychological tests outcomes could help to understand the relationship between structural changes in the brain and cognitive state (as measured by cognitive tests). This is key to validate diagnostics and establish a connection between neuroimaging and clinical tests. However, only a few works such as [ ] attempt to predict cognitive test outcomes. In this work we will evaluate the usefulness of the Spherical Brain Mapping (SBM) texture measures [ ] in two main environments: to predict conversion of MCI subjects and to predict outcomes of different cognitive tests such as MMSE, ADAS-and ADAS-. In the irst case, we will use a Support Vector Machine classi ier (SVC) to classify the derived SBM maps, as in [ ]. For predicting test outcomes, we will test two regression models [ ]: Support Vector Machine regression (SVR, Sec. II. . ) with linear kernel, a robust and generalizable model even in high-dimensional spaces [ ], and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO, Sec. II. . ), that estimates sparse coef icients and can therefore be used for feature selection [ ].

Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe database used in this article was obtained with from the ADNI initiative, containing subjects that have undergone periodical assessment of cognitive function and MRI acquisition every months, with a total T -weighted MRI images (for further information, see www.adni-info.org). These images were spatially normalized to the standard SPM template using the SPM software [ ] Normalize with default parameters (non-rigid, preserve concentrations), and them segmented into Grey Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) using the VBM toolbox.\nIn the classi ication experiments we will consider four different cohorts. The irst subset correspond to all AD subjects in their baseline acquisition (that is, when the disease is less advanced), and will be regarded as AD from this point. Two more subsets containing the last available visit from CTL and MCI stable will be selected as well, namely the CTL and MCI-S (from MCI stable) subsets. Finally, a MCI subset containing all converters in the last session available prior to their conversion will form the MCI-C (from MCI converter) set.\nThis choice is not trivial. Since the inal aim is to estimate how discriminant are the SBM maps in predicting MCI conversion, we wanted to make the classi ication task as dif icult as possible. Since the MCI-to-AD progression can be viewed as a continuum, the last CTL acquisition will be more dif icult to differentiate from the earliest AD, and likewise, the last MCI stable acquisition will be more dif icult to differentiate from MCI converters. That way, the MCI-S will be more representative of the whole spectrum commonly classiied as MCI but never progress to AD.\nFor comparison purposes, we will provide the Voxels-As-Features (VAF) [ ] performance of this database using the segmented GM and WM maps in the AD vs CTL and MCI-C vs MCI-S classi ication."}, {"section_title": "II. .

The irst one is a classi ication approach, and therefore, we will employ a linear Support Vector Machine classi ier (SVC) to estimate how relevant the differences between classes are. The inal performance values estimate how discriminant the different measures are when classifying two classes. Accuracy (acc.), Sensitivity (sens.) and Speci icity (spec.) and their standard deviation (SD) will be estimated as:\nwhere TP, TN, FP and FN are the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives respectively.\nThe performance estimates are obtained via a strati ied -fold cross-validation [ ]. In brief, this procedure divides the whole dataset in subsets with the same proportion of classes, and iteratively uses of this subsets for training and tests against the remaining one. The procedure is repeated times, from which we obtain the average and standard deviation of the different proposed estimates. Performance estimates of the classi ication of AD vs CTL groups and MCI converters vs stable will be computed. Since MCI is a rather heterogeneous class, with overlapping converters and non-converters, we additionally will use AD and CTL subjects to train the classi ier, and then identify the MCI subjects more similar to AD as con-verters and those more similar to CTL as stable.\nThe second environment corresponds to regression analysis. Since SBM maps have never been tested on this environment, we will employ two different strategies: Support Vector Machine regression (SVR, Sec. II. . ) and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO, Sec. II. . ). To quantify the quality of the prediction of our regressive model, we use the Mean Square Error (MSE) and the coef icient of determination R 2 .

In these particular cases, there is a noticeable positive (average and variance) and negative (kurtosis and skewness) correlation between MMSE scores and SBM values at the hippocampus ( ), amygdala ( ) and parahippocampal gyrus ( ). In these cases, the PCC reaches absolute values higher than . . However, two different correlation patterns (smaller, with PCCs around . ) appear in entropy and thickness. In these two cases, the maximum correlations are located at the bottom part of the parahippocampal gyrus ( ) and, in general, the limits of the temporal lobe.

The patterns are much more related to WM variations, and they can hardly been related to the previous structures.

D", "text": "The main purpose of this work is to test the ability of the SBM maps in two challenging scenarios: predicting the conversion of MCI subjects to dementia at least six months in advance, and predicting neuropsychological tests outcomes from MRI data in order to have another objective measure of cognitive state. This is enhanced by the special characteristics of the SBM mapping, which allows a direct bidimensional visualization of textural changes in the brain.\nHowever, before discussing these two scenarios, we will try to provide intuition about what the different measures mean. In the irst place, average, variance, skewness and kurtosis are related to different statistical moments of V \u03b8,\u03d5 . The average of these intensities is then easy to relate to tissue density, and therefore, a decrease in this measure could be a hint of atrophy in that direction. Note how this occurs in the AD and MCI-C groups at Figure , where the mean of all SBM-average maps for each of the four de ined groups are displayed. Similarly, the variance of V \u03b8,\u03d5 measures the variability in its values. Higher variance could mean higher neurodegeneration, since its val-ues may be more disperse. Skewness and kurtosis are often considered a measure of symmetry and 'peakedness' of the statistical distribution of the intensities in V \u03b8,\u03d5 . Smaller skewness means that the intensity has decreased, which can also been associated to atrophy. A higher kurtosis is the result of extreme deviations from the mean, which is indicative of more abrupt transitions between grey levels, and therefore, better de ined boundaries of GM and WM. Smaller kurtosis can also be related to neurodegeneration.\nThickness is the only morphological measure in this work, and it measures the distance between the irst and last voxels in V \u03b8,\u03d5 higher than a threshold. It is a rough estimate of tissue thickness, very different from more precise -and complex-cortical thickness measures provided by software such as FreeSurfer Figure : Mean of the SBM-average maps for the AD, MCI-C, MCI-S and CTL groups. Zoom over the hippocampus region.\n[ ] or the CAT toolbox [ ]. Finally, entropy comes from information theory, and it measures the 'amount of information' or 'randomness' of V \u03b8,\u03d5 . In this work, a higher entropy means a more random distribution of the voxels in V \u03b8,\u03d5 , which may be linked to the structural changes due to the neurodegeneration process. Now, regarding the irst scenario, we presented the regions with more signi icant differences between AD and CTLs in Section III. . The highlighted areas in GM, especially in the afterwards higher scoring measures, correspond mainly to the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. Differences between MCI-C and MCI-S are also located at these areas, which also project to the external temporal middle gyrus and temporal pole. In WM, there are no signi icant differences in any SBM measure between MCI-C and MCI-S, which might be due to neurodegeneration affecting irst the GM and later progressing to WM [ ]. However signi icant WM differences can be found between AD and CTL in the boundaries of the superior motor area which correspond to the longitudinal issure, and also some other regions overlapping to the precuneus, cuneus, paracentral lobule and the frontal middle gyrus.\nThese differences correspond to existing evidence in the literature. The hippocampus is widely regarded as one of the most discriminating structures in structural MRI [ , , , ] . Its in luence in declarative memory is patent, and many studies have reported atrophy in early AD, along with surrounding structures such as the amygdala and the parahippocampal gyrus. Most studies report early neurodegeneration in MCI in these structures and generally in the temporal lobe [ , , , ] . Martinez-Torteya et al. [ ] also reported the left medial orbital gyrus and the left inferiolateral remainder of the parietal lobe (area between inferior parietal gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus). The SBM measures are then collecting useful information on neurodegeneration that can be useful for further assessment and visualization.\nRegarding the classi ication performance, we tested four different groups: AD, CTL, MCI-C and MCI-S. In the AD vs CTL performance we achieved high accuracy (around % for WM, higher for GM) that may be due to an improvement since our last work. While in [ ] we placed the origin of v \u03b8,\u03d5 at the geometrical centre of the image, now we place it at the Anterior Commissure, one landmark anatomical position in the literature and one of the points where the two cerebral hemispheres are connected. Thank to this, it may have improved the computation of the SBM measures in different regions of interest, especially internal regions such as the hippocampus or the caudate nucleus.\nHowever, the most relevant classi ication results are those that predict MCI conversion between and months in advance. The highest performance was obtained when training with AD and CTL subjects, which may be due to a better de inition of the separation hyperplane of the SVC by two more distant clusters than the higher-variability MCI subclasses. The reported results are comparable to the state of the art, [ , , , , , , , ] . Of these studies, which achieved accuracies ranging from % to %, the best performing approach was the one proposed by Misra et al. [ ] , which achieved between -% accuracy on a subset of converters and nonconverters from the ADNI dataset. Chupin et al. [ ] used the larger population, with individuals ( converters) from ADNI, achieving an accuracy of %. Some of these even used histopathological labels, acquired postmortem, instead of clinical labels, which are more heterogeneous and make the classi ication task more dif icult. Our performance results match those achieved by the best methodology in the state of the art, with a larger, more heterogeneous and less prevalent population ( converters + non converters), which is key for comparison.\nOf all SBM measures used in this article, the average, variance and entropy measures achieved similar performance. Particularly, average worked very well with segmented GM maps, whereas the entropy always performed better in the WM. Thickness yielded the poorest performance, perhaps due to the lack of relevant features in areas of interests such as the hippocampus.\nIn the second scenario, the PCC maps show the areas that are highly correlated with different neuropsychological tests. The main impression is that the ADAS-cog scores (especially the ADAS-) achieve higher correlations with the MRI data than the MMSE, suggesting that these measures are much more speci ic of AD progression and cognitive decline. This is also supported by current literature [ , ] , where some authors claim that non-speci ic neuropsychological scores may be a source of false positives, especially in MCI.\nIn GM, correlations with the ADAS-test outcomes scored higher than . in areas such as the hippocampus and parts of the parahippocampal gyrus. This was repeated in the average, variance, skewness and kurtosis measures. Entropy and thickness measures revealed different patterns, with maximum correlations in the lower boundary of the temporal lobe. As for the WM, the correlations were smaller (maximum values around . ), with more correlated areas in the longitudinal issure and, only in the case of entropy, the occipital middle gyrus, the parietal inferior gyrus and the junction between the temporal middle and inferior gyri.\nThe performance of the regression methods is displayed at Table . The reader may note the large differences between the MSE in the ADAS-cog tests and the MMSE, but this is related to a much higher variability in the values (ADAS-ranges from to in our database, and ADAS-from to ) compared to the MMSE (ranges from to ). See Table for more information on the demographics of the dataset. The R 2 , however, takes into account this variability, yielding a more consistent measure of the performance, and that is why we will focus on it throughout this section.\nTwo main properties can be inferred from Table ' s data. First, the differences in R 2 scores stress again the usefulness of the ADAS-cog against the MMSE in measuring Alzheimer's progression. Second, They show that the SVR performs better than LASSO in predicting test outcomes for ADAS-cog in GM. Since LASSO internally focuses on a small number of features, it may be an indication that there are moderately correlated covariates in the maps, which would eventually degrade its performance [ ]. Then, SVR is a more adequate choice in this case. Conversely, LASSO outperforms SVR in modelling MMSE, however its performance is smaller than with the ADAS-cog. In WM, our regression techniques can ind even less evidence to predict neuropsychological tests, which adds support to the fact that GM neurodegeneration is a better predictor of cognitive state.\nThe maps with higher performance in predicting neuropsychological tests are entropy and variance. This differs with the largest PCCs computed for each v \u03b8,\u03d5 in the maps, where average, kurtosis, skewness and variance had the largest correlations. However, PCCs were obtained for each individual SBM value at L L R R Figure : Comparison between the equirectangular projection for two SBM examples (an average map and the PCC maps computed at Sec. III. . ) and the stereographic projection, currently in development.\nthe (\u03b8, \u03d5) position, where the regression methods use all values in the maps to create a linear model that predicts the neuropsychological outcomes. Therefore it is possible that entropy, where individual PCCs were relatively smaller, contains relevant -and different-information in more areas than the other maps, and those values can be used to inform a more accurate model of the test. When looking at the PCC maps for the SBM-entropy, large negative and positive correlations were found in GM (in contrast to all other measures), including negative PCCs at the lower boundary of the temporal lobe and positive at the angular gyrus, thalamus, occipital gyrus, caudate nucleus, etc., that have also been found in functional imaging [ ].\nThe pattern in WM pattern is similar, which may be the reason why the SBM-entropy achieves best performance in regression. The SBM mapping, as any other technique intended to visualize three-dimensional volumes in two dimensions, is subject to deformations due to the projections. Our choice for SBM, given its simplicity, was the equirectangular projection, also known as plate carr\u00e9e projection [ ]. However, it is neither equal area nor conformal, introducing distortions as the elevation \u03b8 increases. Other projections, for example the stereographic projection [ ] (see Fig. for comparisons), might seem more convenient for visualization. This last projection is conformal and therefore preserves angular relationships, yielding a more brainlike, intuitive visualization of the SBM maps. We plan to include this approach in future releases of the python mapBrain package, which contains SBM.\nIn summary, the SBM offers a series of bidimensional maps that provide a signi icant feature reduction along with a visual aid that could be useful to locate differences, in combination with either hypoth-esis testing or correlation analysis. We have proven that a classi ier trained with SBM average maps from AD and CTL subjects can effectively predict conversion of MCI in the session immediately previous to their reported conversion session (that is, in all cases, between and months in advance), with a % accuracy and % sensitivity. And ultimately, we demonstrated that these maps can be used to predict scores that match the outcomes of clinical tests, providing an objective replication tool based on imaging data."}, {"section_title": "V. C", "text": "In this work, we propose the application of a Spherical Brain Mapping (SBM) of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in two challenging scenarios involving Alzheimer's Disease (AD): predicting the conversion of MCI subjects to dementia at least six months in advance, and predicting neuropsychological tests outcomes from MRI data. These two classi ication and regression scenarios are tested using Support Vector Machines and LASSO, providing numerical evidence of their performance. Moreover, we also analyse visual evidence on the affected regions via hypothesis testing (for differences between groups) and correlation coef icient (for correlation with test outcomes).\nThe SBM maps provide a signi icant feature reduction over the million-voxel MRI images, while achieving a state-of-the-art performance ( % accuracy) in the prediction of MCI conversion more than months in advance. The best prediction is obtained with a classi ier trained with AD and control (CTL) classes which, thanks to being separate clusters, de ine a better separation hyperplane. Signi icant differences between maps have been found at the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and more generally the temporal lobe, all of which have a proven relationship with AD progression.\nFor its part, the relationship between some of the SBM measures in GM and the outcomes of neuropsychological tests has also been proven. The highest performance of this regression analysis is achieved when predicting the ADAS-cog, supporting existing evidence that this test is more indicative of the disease stage than the MMSE. R 2 scores up to .\nwere obtained when predicting ADAS-with Support Vector Regression on the SBM-variance maps. The SBM average and variance measures are also noticeably correlated with this test (pearson-r higher than . ). A visual analysis of the pearson-r reveals the util-ity of the bidimensional representation in identifying changes in texture along the brain. Regions typically related with AD, achieve highest correlation rates, but the most persistent area is the hippocampus.\nIn summary, the SBM offers a series of bidimensional maps that provide a signi icant feature reduction along with a visual aid that could be useful to locate differences, in combination with either hypothesis testing or correlation analysis. These maps keep relevant textural information that allows a system to predict MCI conversion more than six months in advance. New projections to enhance visualization are currently being explored, in order to provide a more intuitive insight of the brain structure.
