[{"section_title": "Dedication", "text": "I dedicate this dissertation to my beloved mother, the late Sharon Armstrong, and to my dad, Seth Armstrong. Their lives represent social justice action through my mother's concerns about social issues and efforts to combat racism, and my dad's long career as an educator, who contributed to the success of many students through teaching them a solid foundation of mathematics, and who taught them to think critically beyond mathematics. I also dedicate it to my husband, Gene House, also an educator, without whom I do not know how I would have persevered. He listened to me talk about the dissertation, discussed sociological theories, cared for our dogs and birds when I really needed to write, and patiently encouraged me throughout the whole process of obtaining this degree.   acknowledging the interrelatedness of education and society, and believing one should not \"ignore the sociocultural influences on education\" (Bogotch, 2014, p.55), Bogotch concluded that educators and educational researchers should participate in social justice actions (p. 58, p. 62)."}, {"section_title": "viii", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": "Shields 2010and Theoharis (2007) both built on the idea of social justice as being a purpose of education through offering similar leadership theories. Shields' 2010described the transformative leadership theory as: Transformative leadership, therefore, recognizes the need to begin with critical reflection and analysis and to move through enlightened understanding to action---action to redress wrongs and to ensure that all members of the organization are provided with as level a playing field as possible-not only with respect to access but also with regard to academic, social, and civic outcomes (p. 572). Theoharis (2007) stated: For this article, I define social justice leadership to mean that these principals make issues of race, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, and other historically and currently marginalized conditions in the United States central to their advocacy, leadership practice, and vision (p. 223). Both Shields (2010) and Theoharis (2007) demonstrated in their research how some principals demonstrated characteristics and actions which go beyond good or successful leadership into the realm of making positive changes in areas of social justice. They were specifically concerned with ensuring every student has a better chance at educational success. writings of Bogotch (2008Bogotch ( , 2014, Mehra (2015), Mehra et al. (2017), Rioux (2010), Shields (2010), and Theoharis (2017). In the same vein as these educators, I view social justice as an educational construct (Bogotch, 2008; and suggest putting it into practice through use of the theories of Shields' transformative leadership and of Theoharis' social justice leadership. I suggest taking actions within libraries and librarianship as advocated by Honma (2005), Mehra (2015), Mehra et al. (2017), Rioux (2010), and others in the library science field. Honma (2005) called for the field of library and information sciences to be transformative through being willing to discuss and to work toward reducing racism and marginalization thereby transforming the profession and beyond. Transformative actions include developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, providing inclusive services, meeting information needs for diverse library users, and working for positive change in individuals, communities, educational institutions, and society to benefit library users and library employees (Brook, Ellenwood, & Lazzaro, 2016;Mehra, 2015;Mehra et al., 2017;Rioux, 2010). Awareness of social justice issues in libraries. Library associations recognize the need to serve a diverse population (Al-Qallaf & Mika, 2013;American Library Association, 2004;Chu, 2013). The American Library Association's (ALA) values for the profession, for example, include seeking to provide information resources and services to the communities served and assist all users in achieving equitable access to information (ALA, 2004). This is increasingly important as the population of the United States becomes more diverse. The 2017 estimates by race and ethnicity from the U. S. Census are White (not Hispanic or Latino) 60.7%, Black or African American 13.4%, Asian 5.9%, American Indian and Alaska Native 1.3%, Hispanic or Latino 18.1% (\"QuickFacts,\" 2017). Government projections for 2030 show a decline in percentage of White (not Hispanic or Latino) and an increase in the percentage of all other populations with the exception of American Indian and Alaska Native (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). This report also showed the largest increases in percentage of the population will be in the Asian and Hispanic groups. Given these predictions and the profession's core values, librarians should be prepared to meet the information needs of all people regardless of racial or ethnic background. Despite the awareness and concern of library educators in American library graduate programs of the need to recruit and prepare students to work in diverse settings, Al-Qallaf and Mika (2013) found only 12 of 58 graduate schools actually had diversity and multicultural goals. Of seven categories of goals, the fewest schools in their study had goals and objectives in the areas of \"achieve diversity in the student body\" and \"recruit faculty from diverse backgrounds\" (p. 14). The library profession workforce in the United States has been mostly White and mostly female, with currently 83.6% White and 79.5% female (U.S. Department of Labor, 2017). There are problems in female dominant fields such as gender gap income inequality (Bobbitt-Zeher, 2007), and male overrepresentation in administration (Moran, Leonard, & Zellers, 2009;Passet, 1993). Although there are undoubtedly other areas of diversity one could study for recruitment improvement, I chose to focus on diversity in race/ethnicity and gender of those who entered library graduate programs due to the documented imbalances in those areas and the availability of national data. Race/ethnicity and gender data are available for graduates of baccalaureate programs in a U.S. Department of Education dataset, Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (Cataldi, Siegel, Shepherd, & Cooney, 2014). The Department of Education developed this dataset through a sample of 17,110 students of an approximate 1.6 million students who completed bachelor's degree requirements during the 2007-2008 year. Follow-up occurred after one year in 2009 and after the students had been out of college for four years in 2012. The data included employment experiences and enrollment in postgraduate degree programs. My study focused on the characteristics of those who chose to enter the field of librarianship during the first four years after completing a bachelor's degree. Knowing more regarding the characteristics of those who choose to enter the field of librarianship, particularly candidates of diversity, can help library graduate schools in their recruiting efforts. Having a more diverse student body will provide a more diverse pool of applicants for the workforce. Al-Qallaf and Mika (2013), Dali and Caidi (2016), and Jaeger, Bertot, and Subramaniam (2013) who have written on aspects of diversity in library and information science education called for more research into recruiting and educating librarians to serve in a diverse world."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "The librarian profession in the United States from the turn of the twentieth century forward has been primarily comprised of women, ranging from about 75% in 1900 to 91% in 1930 to 82% in 2007 (Moran et al., 2009, pp. 215-216). For the United States workforce, the distribution by gender shows women are 46.9%, but within the library field women now comprise 79.5% (U.S. Department of Labor, 2017, p. 1, 3). By race and ethnicity for the workforce as a whole, 78.4% are White, 12.1% Black or African American, 6.2% Asian, and 16.9% Hispanic or Latino (U.S. Department of Labor, 2017, p. 1). Contrastingly, the distribution in the library field is 86.3% White, 6.4% Black or African American, 5.2% Asian, and 10.4% Hispanic or Latino (U.S. Labor, 2017, p. 3), with Whites overrepresented in comparison to the overall workforce percentage and all other races/ethnicities underrepresented. Some authors have examined this history, the reasons for individuals selecting the profession of librarianship, and the graduate schools' recruitment of persons into the profession (Lynch, 2008;Moran et al., 2009;Oliver & Prosser, 2017;Passet, 1993). Others have written on minority populations' barriers to entering the profession and possible solutions to those barriers (Carter, 2015;Kim & Sin, 2008).

The first layer includes the student's individual context of demographics (gender, race/ethnicity), cultural capital, social capital, financial resources, and demand for higher education (pp. 116-117). The second layer is the school and community context, which is the broader setting within which the student attended school and the support or lack of support from teachers and counselors (pp. 117-118). The third layer is higher education's influence on the student's choice through marketing, recruiting, admission requirements, and limits on enrollment (p. 118). The fourth layer of influence on decision-making is comprised of the larger societal issues, economic conditions, and policy frameworks (pp. 119-120). My study used Perna's (2006) model as a basis for examining the choice of pursuing a master's degree in library science or closely related fields to understand choices by gender, racial/ethnicity, and major. The variables within the Baccalaureate and Beyond dataset that are closely related to cultural and social capital, and economic factors of the first layer of Perna's model were examined. The study did not examine factors from the other three layers of Perna's four-layer model because investigating those layers goes beyond the scope of this project. Like Douglas' (2017) study of those who chose to enter business graduate programs, this study examined the relationship of undergraduate major fields to the decision to choose library science graduate programs."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Project", "text": "Few studies have focused on the factors influencing graduate college choice (Douglas, 2017;Kallio, 1995;McCulloch, Guerin, Jayatilaka, Calder, & Ranasinghe, 2017). Some have focused on the choice of library science or related graduate study (Dali & Caidi, 2016;McCulloch et al., 2017) and other graduate programs (Lara & Nava, 2018;Sasson, 2017), but very few have focused on graduate choice by gender or race/ethnicity within library science (Dali & Caidi, 2016;Davis-Kendrick (2009); Passet, 1993). Generally, the studies on graduate study choice have been of motivating factors of an individual group such as Davis-Kendrick's (2009) study of African American male librarians and Taylor, Perry, Barton, and Spencer's (2010) study of students at one library and information science school. Studies of graduate study choice using a national sample, a Baccalaureate and Beyond, include Collins (2012), Douglas (2017), English & Umbach (2016), Kronfeld (2013), Lasiewski (2001), Mullen, Goyette, & Soares (2003), Nitopi (2010, and Xu (2014). None of these using a national sample explored the factors related to graduate study choice of library science. This study will add to the literature of student choice of library science study using a national sample. This study will also further the literature on predicting graduate student choice of study by examining the characteristics of those entering library graduate programs through the lens of an economic and sociological framework proposed by Perna (2006). Douglas (2017) conducted a similar study using Perna's model by examining the characteristics of those entering graduate business programs. Similarly, my study further tested Perna's (2006) model. By adding to the knowledge of the economic and sociological factors influencing students to choose library science, this study will assist recruitment efforts on the part of library graduate schools. An understanding of these contributing factors can also assist librarians in identifying potential candidates to recruit within the ranks of student library assistants and library staff. The study is also significant as an example of research to inform library recruitment practices as a social justice action. Shields' (2010) definition of transformative leadership of moving from reflection, to gathering information, and after informed understanding, taking action is a model I use in this dissertation. First in chapter I is reflection on the background of the problem of lack of diversity in the library and information fields with a specific concern about the decision to choose or not choose library science as a graduate field of study. The literature review, methodology, and findings in Chapters II, III, and IV are all information gathering activities related to graduate choice in general and specific to choice of library science. Finally, comparable to Shields' action step of moving \"through enlightened understanding to action\" (p. 572), I will create an action plan in Chapter V for making improvements in libraries in the areas of recruiting into the library field, and hiring and retaining diverse librarians."}, {"section_title": "Description of Terms", "text": "Culturally competent.

This chapter provides an overview of student enrollment, recruitment, and college choice, including expansion of diversity, during the history of higher education in the United States. It includes the development of theories and models to explain and predict student choice of college and field of study, particularly when choosing graduate study. These theories often have an economic and sociological basis so the literature review includes works on status attainment, social stratification, and human, social, and cultural capital. An increased understanding of the interrelatedness of these forms of capital, status attainment, and social stratification can contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to graduate choice. I believe gaining a deeper understanding can also contribute to what L\u00f3pez (2013) described as a \"pursuit of social justice\u2026that goes far beyond surface-level improvements and focuses on those deeper structures and functions that incapacitate and oppress marginalized populations in society on a daily basis\" (p."}, {"section_title": "511).", "text": "Since this study uses Perna's (2004) combined economic and sociological model as a theoretical basis for analyzing a data set, the literature review includes Perna's work, and other college choice literature from researchers using Perna's model.

Political social justice would include equal rights to vote and to participate in the governmental process (Friesen, \"Domains of Social Justice\", para. 1). The legal context would include equality in terms of process and representation in courts and other legal settings (para. 2). Economic social justice refers to narrowing the gaps between the rich and poor in a society achieving less inequality (para. 3). Social justice in the social domain could include a variety of factors but ultimately includes \"mutual respect and dignity for both individuals and the social groups to which they belong (para."}, {"section_title": "4).\"", "text": "Efforts to achieve social justice result in tensions which Mehra et al. (2017) in their overview of social justice concepts noted as tensions between the rights of an individual, the rights of other individuals, and \"individual rights vs. the good of the community\"(p. 4218). Mehra et al. also traced the history of debates on these tensions as moving from classical Greek philosophers to the Christian religious sphere to secular discussions (pp. 4218-4219.) This movement to secular discussions allows for social justice study, research, and actions in many contexts. Mehra et al. identified the dimensions as \"legal,political,economic,criminal,civil,philosophical,linguistic,religious,historical,and sociocultural\" (p. 4219). Social justice research theories include post-positivist and critical theory. Lincoln, Lynham, and Guba (2011) considered a post-positivism paradigm as viewing reality as probabilistically known (Table 6.1), but not completely known due to incomplete data or hidden variables (Table 6.5, p.109). Davis and Harrison (2013) advocated using a postpositivist framework for social justice research and action. Post-positivists consider one's reality as constructed, for example, with capital available based on one's access to power depending upon one's level in society's strata (p.4). Critical theorists as described by Creswell (2014) are concerned with \"empowering human beings to transcend the constraints placed on them by race, class, and gender\" (p. 65). These theorists view research as valuable, which acts to influence social change for a more just society (Lincoln et al., 2011, Table 6.5, p. 108). Reflecting on the findings of research and using those reflections to implement a change in practice are further characteristics of this theoretical view (p.109). One can trace critical theory to the Frankfurt school established by the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany in 1923 (Barbour, J.D. & Barbour, J.D. 2006). These theorists were concerned with examining social, cultural, and political power structures, which hinder persons' potential and are oppressive (para. 5). They built upon the work of Karl Marx, who focused on labor and class stratification (para. 2). One of the Frankfort theorists, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, focused on communication and how truthful dialogue is crucial to facing modern society's challenges through collective decision making to lessen or eliminate oppression (para. 8). William Foster further applied critical theory to that of the role of educational leaders to critically examine societal issues and use the power of discourse by the educational leader to lead to transformation in society (para. 11;Shields, 2010). Critical theory enables one to question the ways in which society is structured, who benefits, who is marginalized, and how society might work toward positive change (Sensoy & DiAngelo, 2017, pp. 25-27). Critical theory has expanded to include research from theorists from \"indigenous, postcolonial, racialized, and other marginalized perspectives\" (p. 27). Mehra et al. (2006) proposed a framework for social justice research in the library and information sciences professions. Their framework focused on the following social justice principles as quoted:"}, {"section_title": "Social Justice Research and Theories in Library and Information Sciences", "text": "\u2022 Fairness and equity in social relationships; \u2022 Empowerment; \u2022 Economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental impacts; \u2022 Community building and community development; \u2022 Diversity, multiplicity, and democracy; \u2022 Everyday information needs; and \u2022 Community informatics (pp. 5-6). Rioux (2010) called for a social justice metatheory in LIS with five assumptions as quoted: 1) All human beings have an inherent worth and deserve information services that help address their information needs. 2) People perceive reality and information in different ways, often within cultural or life role contexts. 3) There are many different types of information and knowledge, and these are societal resources. 4) Theory and research are pursued with the ultimate goal of bringing positive change to service constituencies. 5) The provision of information services is an inherently powerful activity. (p.13). Through a consideration of Rioux's metatheory, one can develop a perspective for thinking about actions, research, and service (p.13). One can use Mehra et al. (2006) and Rioux's works as guidance for social justice research, for example, see Oliphant (2015) who used Rioux's metatheory along with discourse analysis. In addition, one should see Folk (2019) for using information literacy to increase students' academic cultural capital and Ilett (2019) for serving first-generation students in libraries as further examples of social justice research. Mehra et al. (2017) documented library activities provided to diverse library users including those from disenfranchised groups based on \"race, ethnicity, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, age and other variables\" (p. 4222). To provide better library services to diverse groups, Kim and Sin (2008) stated diversity in the library profession leads to a greater comfort level on the part of the user and a greater understanding of the diverse users' information needs (p. 155). The profession, however, is not yet very diverse as found in the following literature."}, {"section_title": "Diversity in Library and Information Sciences", "text": "Predominance of white females. Carter (2015) stated, \"few other occupations are more middle-aged, more female and/or more white (p. 295).\" Brook et al. (2015) have documented the predominance of Whiteness and its influences in libraries. The predominance of females and Whites still holds true in 2017 data as only ten professional occupations are near or exceed the number of females and also are predominately White (see Appendix A). Authors of library literature and those in other fields have examined the prevalence of gender differences, finding that serious gender inequality issues exist related to traditional female fields in the areas of wage gaps and hindrances in advancement (Bobbitt-Zeher, 2007;Moran et al., 2009;Morgan, 2008;Passet, 1993). Passet (1993) studied 281 men who attended library school from 1887 through 1921, discovering their characteristics and providing context for the salary gaps that persist (p. 387). Some library school directors recruited men in the hopes that salaries in the profession would rise (p. 395). Moran et al. (2009) expressed concern about the persistence of lower salaries for women than men through the 1960s through 1990s. Silva and Galbraithe (2018) reported that as of 2014-2015 in Association of Research Libraries women's salaries were 95.5% of men's (p. 324). Prevalence of disproportionate number of males in leadership. Library school directors encouraged some of the men in the late 1800s through early 1900s to aspire to administrative positions thus contributing to setting the pattern of more men in library director positions (Passet, 1993, pp. 396-397). Passet examined correspondence of library school directors, which revealed their expectations of male students. The directors encouraged male students to be very selective by accepting positions at the most prestigious institutions or positions with the best titles and salaries (p. 397). Some library school directors describing men in terms not indicative of leadership qualities still recommended they should be directors of libraries (p. 397). The prevalence of male librarians in leadership positions existed as well in the American Library Association's early years in the late 1800s until at least the 1970s and 1980s (Turock, 2001, p. 115). One example Turock provided is \"that of fifteen Executive Directors from 1890 to 1972, fourteen men served in that position alone except for one year -1890 to 1891-in which a man and a woman occupied it jointly\" (p. 115). In the early years of public libraries, although women were active in fundraising and providing other forms of support and service, neither equal pay nor equal status in leadership existed for women due, at least in part, to lack of women's voting rights (Mehra et al., 2017, p. 4223). Moran et al. (2009)  Gender income gaps. Bobbitt-Zeher (2007) found in a study of factors contributing to gender income gaps the \"educational factor that seems to matter the most is college major\" (p.13). Bobbitt-Zeher used data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988. This survey included data from over 12,000 students who were followed from high school through college and into early adulthood in 2000 (p. 7). Bobbit-Zeher used regression analysis to determine explanations for the percentage gaps in men and women's salaries and found 14% of the income gap was explained by the percentage of females in the college major. Estimated generalized least-squares regression analysis showed that the percentage of females in college major explained a larger percentage of the income gap than the field of study (p. 10; Table 2). This data suggests the fields of study associated with women and populated with a larger percentage of females may be devalued and thus those employed in those fields paid less (p. 15). Need for racial and ethnic diversity. In the 1970s, the American Library Association (ALA) recognized the need for racial and ethnic diversity and charged library schools to do better recruiting (Carter, 2015). The stated desire was to recruit a diverse student body \"more representative of the population which their graduates serve\" (Carter, 2015, p. 296). Kim and Sin (2008) explained the importance of diversity as leading to an increased comfort level for the library users and improved communication as users find librarians with whom they identify commonalities (p. 155). Interpersonal similarities between librarians and users leads to better understanding of the information needs of the users and thus the library can be more successful in providing library services and building relevant collections (p. 155). Bonnet and McAlexander (2012) found in their approachability image rating study participants had significant preferences for hypothetical images of librarians of different racial/ethnic appearance depending upon their own racial group. This study further added evidence to the studies Kim and Sin cited in which persons feel more comfortable with those who appear to be like themselves. , but cited these reasons for choosing to become a librarian: \"Help people,\" \"Like teaching,\" \"Like research,\" \"'Fell into it'\", \"Like technology,\" \"Like reading/literacy,\" \"Positive community impact,\" and \"Want to be a role model\" (p. 37). Davis-Kendrick also surveyed the participants on gender issues. Davis-Kendrick asked questions to determine whether there was concern over entering a female-dominated profession with 45% definitely not concerned though 12% were indeed concerned (p.41)."}, {"section_title": "Student Enrollment and College Choice throughout U.S. Higher Education History", "text": "During the colonial era, 1636-1789, colonists established nine colleges using variations of European models (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 19). At this time, enrollments were low due to lack of appeal, lack of means to afford education, and inability to meet admission requirements (pp. 26-28). Admission requirements at some institutions included student knowledge of Latin and Greek, and in later years of this period understanding arithmetic, which effectively limited entrance to those from wealthy families with the means to provide tutors (pp. 27-29). Enrollment was low, generally not more than one hundred students at each college (p. 26). Those who did attend were mostly male who would become \"ministers, physicians, teachers, lawyers, public servants, or a combination of these\" (p. 27), as the curriculum taught was really not necessary for employment for most of the jobs of that time period (p. 26). From 1790 to 1869, significant growth occurred in the population of the country and in the number of higher education institutions from a population of approximately four million to over thirty-eight and half million and the number of institutions increasing from 11 to 240 (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 58 (Ihlanfeldt, 1980, p. 4). Institutions continued to compete for students and began to implement measures to improve access and support to members of minority groups, who formerly institutions had denied access (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, pp. 209-210). During the 1950s through 1970s, a few researchers began to explore the decision making process of students (Holland, 1958;Holland, 1959;Ihlanfeldt, 1980). From the mid-1960s to early 1980s, the college enrollment rates of high school students remained steady instead of increasing as in the prior era (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 332). The enrollment rate coupled with fiscal uncertainties, administrators' concern over excess capacity due to prior college building, the public's questioning of value, and governmental pressures led those in higher education to turn to marketing to achieve their enrollment goals (Ihlanfeldt, 1980, pp. 5-10.) As a part of marketing, one should understand the behavior of the target market leading to increased research into college choice, which formerly had received little attention (p. 12). Between 1975 and 1993, major changes occurred in sources of revenue for higher education from federal government declining from 16% (1975-1976) to 12% (1992)(1993) and state government revenue declining from 31% to 24% (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 395). This led to increases in tuition from 21% (1975-1976) to 27% (1992-1993), as other sources of revenue did not sufficiently increase to offset the government's decline in support (p. 395). Ihlanfedt (1980) noted student behavior related to college choice in the face of tuition cost as a factor, which institutions must consider in marketing (p. 26). In addition to tuition costs, there were other areas to consider in maximizing enrollment. At the time of Ihlanfedt's writing, college student choice research had only \"limited success\" (p. 21) in \"isolat[ing] the effects of noncognitive factors on college choice\" (p.21). Even with those limitations, Ihlanfedt lists these important student choice factors from a review of the literature: \"the secondary school attended,\" \"the education of the parents,\" \"the family's economic status,\" \"colleges attended by older brothers and sisters,\" \"extracurricular interests,\" and \"religious preference\" (pp. 21-22). Diversity in the student body increased from 1975 to 1993 with more Black students enrolled, increasing from 42% of Black high school students enrolling to 56% by 1993 (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 333 Chapman (1981), who proposed a conceptual model for understanding college choice, attributed the lack of prior interest in studying college choice to the previous continued growth in enrollments. Chapman's model portrays student choice as a combination of student characteristics of socioeconomic status, level of educational aspiration, aptitude, and high school performance along with external influences such as significant persons in a student's life, characteristics of the college (cost, financial aid, location, programs), and the college communication with the student (pp. 492-498). All those influences combine to create general expectations on the part of the student and then the student decides upon college(s) to which to apply. The college makes choices based on the characteristics of the student, and ultimately a student chooses to enter college. Shortly after Chapman (1981) proposed a basic student choice model, Litten (1982) found it to have limitations since it did not account for differences for various groups of students. Litten reviewed six research projects with a focus on how the choice process differs by race, sex, ability (as measured by standardized test scores), parents' educations, and geographic location. Another concern of Litten's was the financial aid process and its influence on the college selection process. Litten expanded Chapman's model by incorporating these additional factors. By the end of the 1994-2009 timeframe, diversity in the student body expanded within race, ethnicity, and gender to be more reflective of the U.S. population (Cohen & Kisker, 2010, p. 464.) The number of women students exceeded males at undergraduate and graduate levels (57 and 60 percent respectively) (p. 465). Although African-American and Hispanic students had made gains in enrollment, the percentages of high school students enrolled in college the fall after graduation, continued to be less than of White students (White, 69%; Black, 56%; Hispanic, 58%) (p. 466). Additionally, these students were more likely to enroll in lower price institutions, with first-time undergraduates in Fall 2001 represented at a greater level at two-year institutions than four-year institutions (African-Americans 14% at two-year vs. 11.1% at four-year; Hispanics 12.2% at two-year vs. 6.6% at four-year institutions) (Perna, 2006, p. 99 "}, {"section_title": "History of Graduate Student College Choice Research", "text": "In the 1980s and 1990s, some researchers began investigating graduate student choice (e.g., Chapman, 1981;Hearn, 1991;Kallio, 1995;Malaney, 1987;Olson & King, 1985), which earlier had not received much attention. Olson and King (1985) attributed this lack of interest to an elitist selection process for graduate students, and a sufficient supply of students and resources (p. 305). By the 1990s, concern over a large enough pool of doctoral graduates to meet the demand in higher education and industry led to a new interest in studying graduate student choice (Kallio, 1995;Webb, Cocarri, & Allen, 1997). The researchers of this timeframe tended to take sociological or economic approaches and conduct quantitative research (Perna,p. 101). Although by 1985 research on undergraduate student choice existed, Olson and King (1985) could not identify any research on graduate student choice of institution prior to their study of prospective graduate students of a large public Midwestern university. Olson and King's quantitative study surveyed prospective students on aspects of their initial consideration of the university and the factors that influenced them to choose the institution. For the 303 students responding, the factors most likely to influence the decision were found to be \"employment in community or area at time of enrollment decision,\" \"speed of acceptance into program,\" and \"previous undergraduate attendance at the university\" (p. 307, pp. 311-312). One interesting finding was the significant differences in factors among academic colleges within the university, particularly in the area of amount of assistantship stipends (x 2 =29.013; p=.0001) (p. 311). Malaney's (1987) quantitative study of new graduate students at a large public research university examined the reasons students decided to go to graduate school, how they obtained information about the program or school, and why they chose a particular institution. Malaney analyzed the 1,073 responses by demographic characteristics for the variables of \"gender, ethnicity, citizenship, age, undergraduate grade point average, and part-time/full-time enrollment status\" (p. 251). Malaney found differences between groups of students, and found differences in results from Olson and King's (1985) study leading Malaney to recommend that each institution conduct their own study since results may vary between institutions (Malaney, p. 257). As interest in higher education has grown in predicting and managing student enrollments, academic researchers have often relied on economic and sociological concepts and theories as the basis of college choice theories and models. An overview of these provides background to the development of Perna's (2006) theory, which serves as the theoretical basis of this study. Human capital theory. Human capital traces back in economic literature at least as far as Adam Smith's work in 1776, but the modern concept of it dates to the late 1950s and early 1960s in the works of Theodore Schultz, Gary Becker, and others (Becker, 1993;Jacobsen, 2004;LaCost, 2006). Similar to physical capital, which is investment in physical resources, human capital is the increased capacity due to investment in people whether in education, other training or ways of increasing knowledge, or health care, for example (Becker, 1962;LaCost, 2006;Paulsen, 2001). Becker (1962) stated, \"all improve the physical and mental abilities of people and thereby raise real income prospects\" (p. 9). Becker analyzed the effect of education on earnings using economic formulas to reflect the increased earnings return on the investment of education."}, {"section_title": "Social capital theory.", "text": "As another concept to expand on types of capital, Coleman (1988) introduced social capital to explain this capital, which produces actions due to the relations between or among individuals or groups. Its forms include trust between persons or groups, which facilitates financial or other transactions; obligations and expectations, which build between individuals or a group; information sharing; and norms in a community or society (Coleman, 1988). Coleman used the example of tying social capital in the family and in the community into the creation of human capital through their influence on the dropout rates of high school students (pp. S109-S115). Coleman looked at presence of one or two parents, siblings, mother's expectations of the child's education, and the number of times the family had moved. The latter was an indicator of level of community support, larger if fewer moves. Coleman's study showed that the presence of these factors reduced the probability of dropping out (p. S119). Cultural capital. The concept of cultural capital comprises the \"tastes, knowledge, attitudes, language, and ways of thinking that we exchange in interaction with others\" (Witt, 2016, p. 241). Pierre Bourdieu (1973Bourdieu ( /2006, who introduced the concept, described it as \"the structure of the distribution of instruments for the appropriation of symbolic wealth socially designated as worthy of being sought and possessed\" (p. 259). Bourdieu wrote about the role of education in reproducing cultural capital specifically \"the reproduction of the structure of power relationships and symbolic relationships between classes, by contributing to the reproduction of the structure of the distribution of cultural capital among these classes\" (p. 257). Lynch and Baker (2005) discussed how education credentials create a State Nobility, similar to the titles of royalty, which supports inherited privileges. Likewise, in the library field, Brook et al. (2015) called for librarians to recognize the ways that White privilege manifests in higher education and academic libraries. Wilson, Douglas, and Nganga (2013) and Yosso (2005)  \u2022 aspirational (hope beyond barriers); \u2022 linguistic (communication strengths due to skills with multiple languages); \u2022 familial (family and community bonds, and funds of knowledge); \u2022 social (networks); \u2022 navigational (skills in navigating through institutions which favor Whites); and \u2022 resistant capital (\"knowledges and skills fostered through oppositional behavior that challenges inequality\" p. 80), pp. 77-80. C. Dudley-Marling and A. Dudley-Marling (2015) call for a culturally responsive approach to teaching all students with the view all have rich stores of cultural knowledge (p. 46)."}, {"section_title": "Stratification systems and status attainment. Peter M. Blau and Otis Dudley", "text": "Duncan were early researchers into the study of stratification systems, status attainment, and social mobility (Holmwood, 2006). Stratification systems are hierarchical systems of layers of status, power, and influence within which individuals or groups exist (Blau, Duncan, & Tyree, 1967/2000Witt, 2016). Status attainment is the process of obtaining or achieving a new status (Blau et al., 1967(Blau et al., /2000. Social mobility is movement horizontally and vertically within the layers of society (Witt, 2016). Blau et al.'s (1967Blau et al.'s ( /2000 research questions in The Process of Stratification were \"how and to what degree do the circumstances of birth condition subsequent status?\" and \"how does status attained (whether by ascription or achievement) at one stage of the life cycle affect the prospects for a subsequent stage?\" (p. 487). Blau et al. (1967Blau et al. ( /2000 created a model, which quantified the effect of the father's educational attainment and occupational status on the son's educational attainment, first job, and later occupational status. Blau and Duncan's book published in 1967, American Occupational Structure, is a classic study of stratification due to their creation of a theoretical model combined with data analysis (Holmwood, 2006). Examining graduate education through the perspectives of Bourdieu's social reproduction theory and Blau's status attainment concept, Posselt and Grodsky 2017provided a contemporary review of the role of graduate education in continued social stratification, specifically how it contributes to \"reinforcing, reflecting, and/or reducing inequality\" (p. 354). They called for more research into these four areas of graduate education: 1) graduate school choice, 2) the choice of field of study, 3) economic and non-economic returns on graduate degree investment, and 4) graduate education's role in social mobility and social reproduction (pp. 369-371)."}, {"section_title": "College Choice Theories and Models", "text": "As interest grew throughout the history of higher education in managing enrollment more effectively, so too the growth in research to inform decision making on the part of admissions officials, marketing professionals, and others (Park & Hossler, 2014). College choice researchers have often used sociological and economic theories as the basis of their theoretical frameworks. Park and Hossler categorized the major research approaches as economic, sociological, information processing, and combined models (pp."}, {"section_title": "50-52)", "text": ". Factors influencing college choice, which many studies have found may predict whether or not students attend college and which college they choose, were grouped by Park and Hossler into: personal characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity), family income and socioeconomic status, social and cultural capital, academic ability, high school attended, college information sources, peer influences, costs, and financial aid (pp. 52-55). Additionally, researchers have focused on college choice by race/ethnicity for White students, African American students, Latino students, and Asian students (pp. 55-62). Economic approach. Paulsen (2001) cites Becker and other human capital theorists as viewing student college choices as investment decisions (p. 56). This view assumes that students through rational action compare the benefits and costs of obtaining a college degree (Paulsen, 2001;Park & Hossler, 2014). Research with a focus on a cost-benefit analysis on college choice found the following contribute to an increased likelihood of enrollment or persistence: \u2022 expectation of greater earnings due to the college degree, especially for major field of study such as business or engineering; \u2022 lower direct costs of attending; higher scholarships, grants or loans, especially, grants; \u2022 lower opportunity costs (lost earnings while in college); and \u2022 expectation by some students of spending today in order to earn possibly more in the future (Paulsen, 2001, pp. 61-62;Paulsen & Toutkoushian, 2008, pp. 16-18). Paulsen and Toutkoushian (2008) credited human capital theory with being the most heavily used theory in college choice research. Even though human capital theory is useful for analyzing the costs and benefits associated with the college choice decision, Paulsen and Toutkoushian acknowledged the factor of student preferences, which researchers from other social sciences could provide insights. Thus, they advocated for a multidisciplinary approach. Sociological approach. Researchers using the sociological approach look at the factors of social and cultural capital such as family characteristics (i.e., income, education), family and community influences, and interactions and the likelihood of these interactions contributing to students' preparation for college and their college aspirations (Park & Hossler, 2014). Determining how social status influences college choice is a focus of this research (p. 51). An early example of using the sociological approach was Hearn (1991)  (R 2 =.27, p\u2264.001, see Table 2, p.166). Not to be overlooked are the background factors of race/ethnicity and gender, as well as the socioeconomic characteristics of parental education and income, which explained 10% of the variance (R 2 =.10, p\u2264.001, see Table   2, p. 166). Park and Hossler's (2014) review of literature related to social and cultural capital found \"parents' educational attainment, parental involvement in their child's education, and parental expectation toward their child are strongly associated with the child's college aspirations, application behaviors, and college enrollment decisions\" (p. 53). Information processing approach. This approach to college choice research examines the access, or lack thereof, of information, which contributes to students' college decision-making (Park & Hossler, 2014). Researchers consider these as \"primary college information channels\u2026parents and siblings, high school teachers and counselors, college admissions personnel, recruitment materials, college guidebooks, and college fairs\" (p. 51). Combined approaches. In the earliest of college choice research, researchers chose either economic or sociological approaches, but studies that are more recent use combination approaches (Perna, 2006). Park and Hossler (2014) provided a definition for combined approaches as those involving multiple decision-making stages (p. 52). They described models such as Don Hossler and Karen Gallaher's model of developing aspiration for going to college (predisposition), gathering information about the options (search), and then making the choice of a particular college (choice) (p. 52). Hossler and Gallagher's (1987) predisposition phase combines student characteristics with socioeconomic factors, parents' and other significant persons' influence, and school educational activities to create a student's aspiration to attend college (pp. 210-213). The search phase consists of both students searching for colleges that meet their expectations and colleges searching for students, with the students creating a choice set from which they choose in the last stage through communications and interactions with the colleges. Later researchers have continued to use Hossler and Gallaher's model and have found socioeconomic factors such as family income, parental education, and parent's occupation have strong positive roles in the students' progress through all these stages (Hurtado, Inkelas, Briggs, & Rhee, 1997;Perna, 2006, p. 132). Perna's college choice research. In Perna's (2000)  In another study, Perna (2004)  Drawing upon prior research with economic, sociological, and combined approaches, and incorporating the \"student choice construct\" proposed by Paulsen and St. John 2002 \u2022 Habitus (layer 1) (e.g., demographic characteristics, cultural capital, and social capital), \u2022 School and community context (layer 2) (e.g., influences of school and community resources, supports, barriers), \u2022 Higher education context (layer 3) (e.g., source of information, admission process, location, institutional characteristics), and \u2022 Social, economic, & policy context (layer 4) (e.g., demographic changes, economic conditions, public policies) (pp. 116-119). Perna's (2006) conceptual model is the basis of the theoretical approach of my study. Use of combined approaches. Engberg and Wolniak (2009) used a model of examining college enrollment choice through social and cultural capital perspectives and through economic perspectives using human capital theory influenced by Perna's (2006) model. They studied data on over 16,000 students enrolled at eight private institutions. Their study found some factors influence college enrollment decisions more than other factors across the various racial groups though the \"human capital variables were more consistent across race groups, and more important overall in explaining enrollment decisions (Engberg & Wolniak, p. 2276).\" Davies, Qiu, and Davies (2014) approached their study of students' intentions to participate in higher education by using both sociological theories (e.g. cultural capital) and economic theories (e.g. human capital theory). They found each framework provides insight into how students make their choices. The factors most associated with the intention of going to university were the sociological factors of parental education and cultural capital, and the economic factor of students' expectations of greater future salary due to education (p. 820). Davies et al.'s (2014) study illustrates the advisability of using both sociological and economic theories in studying college choice. English and Umbach (2016) adapted Perna's (2006) "}, {"section_title": "Graduate Choice Factors", "text": "Reviews of the literature (English & Umbach, 2016;Mullen et al., 2003;Posselt & Grodsky, 2017) indicate that research on graduate choice is a relatively recent line of study with few studies based on theoretical frameworks so far. Since the topic of this study is the examination of factors influencing the choice of the graduate program of library and information science, a predominately, White female field, this section reviews the research on the choice of field of study, gender, and race/ethnicity. Although there needs to be more study, it is possible to identify some research that addresses those factors, which often intersect, and to draw upon some relevant research from undergraduate choice. Choice of field of study. As noted in the library field, so also are some other fields predominately segregated by gender, such as women in the fields of nursing and education, and men in fields of engineering and computer sciences. Mullen and Baker (2015) in a study of 1.3 million bachelor's degree recipients found that in addition to segregated fields of study, the amount of the gender gap varied by the selectivity of the institution, but it existed at all types of institutions (see Table 4 and 5, pp. 181-182). Although this study documented gender segregation, it did not explain why it occurs. It does suggest that future researchers need to determine why the preferred fields of study varied by gender and by level of institutional selectivity. Future research should also consider the influences of educational approaches by gender as advocated by Grogan and Dias (2015), who wrote we should be \"changing the discourse around gender\" (p. 120). Posselt and Grodsky (2017) also found gender gaps as prevalent for fields of study. Using National Survey of College Graduates data, they calculated indices of dissimilarity across majors over the decades from pre-1970s through the 1990s. They calculated this index as a measure that indicates the \"percentage of men or women who would need to change fields to reach gender parity across majors\" (p. 368). For example, 41% of males in the 1990s would have needed to change field of study to achieve balance by gender across majors (see Table B1, p. 369). DiDonato and Strough's (2013) study of college students' gender-typed attitudes about occupations found through logistic regression analysis that both men and women held views that feminine occupations were more appropriate for women than for men (p.547). Despite those attitudes, the male students' attitudes about gendered occupations did not predict choice of major or occupation (p. 545). DiDonato and Strough suggested there might be additional reasons for men's choice, which warrants more research. Graduate students appear to differ in aspirations by undergraduate major and graduate program of study. For example, English and Umbach (2016) examined graduate school aspiration by undergraduate major and found differences, particularly on the part of education majors who \"were more than two and a half times as likely to aspire to graduate school than their peers who majored in business\u2026\" (p. 200). Zhang (2005) had similar findings with business graduates. Zhang also found undergraduate major influenced the probability of attending doctoral programs, with business students less likely to enroll and persons with liberal arts majors more likely (p. 324). Goyette and Mullen (2006) using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study, 1992-1994, and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, 1993, examined undergraduate major and the likelihood of entering graduate school. They classified the majors into arts and sciences, and vocational majors, which included business, education, engineering, preprofessional, and other occupational type majors (see Appendix A, p. 527). They found that all arts and sciences majors were more likely to enter graduate programs than those with vocational majors (p. 518). Monaghan and Jang 2017found that those with majors with lower income potential, predominately arts and sciences, were more likely to enter graduate school (p. 733). Mullen et al. (2003) discovered parental education influences graduate school enrollment for those in all programs of study with the exception of master's of business administration students. Posselt and Grodsky (2017) cited Mullen et al. (2003) and other literature as evidence of the continued role of social origins in reproducing social stratification. Kirk (1990) surveyed graduate students at a small regional university in the program areas of \"business administration, education administration, public affairs, counseling, human resource development\" (p.36). The variables most affecting choice of graduate major were \"opportunities for engaging in more fulfilling work,\" \"employment opportunities,\" and \"possibilities for advancement\" (p. 37). Kirk, using factor analysis, split the results into two groups of students: those who favored opportunity factors (opportunity-oriented) and those who favored quality of education factors (qualityoriented). Students from the \"helping\" professions of education administration and counseling were more likely to be in the quality-oriented group, which has important implications to the characteristics and recruitment of library science students, members of another \"helping\" profession. Graduate student choice by race/ethnicity and/or gender. analyzed workforce data. Although they acknowledged the lack of diversity in the workforce, the gender and diversity gaps in advancement, and provided some statistics, they did not delve into these issues very deeply. Morgan, Farrar, and Owens (2009) analyzed the same survey and provided findings for salaries and reasons for entering the profession by gender and race/ethnicity, which varied among the groups. For example, African Americans cited \"working with computers\" as a reason for choosing librarianship more often than other groups and mentioned recruitment to the field as being important (p.204). McCook and Moen (1992) looked at factors important to students in selecting library and information master's degree programs and tabulated the results by enrollment status, in-state/out-of-state, gender, and ethnicity. Reasons for choosing a particular library science program varied across ethnic groups with many different reasons cited by different ethnic groups. In common for all was the reason of 'location.' American Indian, Hispanic, and Black students ranked 'financial assistance' higher than did Asian Americans and Whites (pp. 216-217, 219). The variation in reasons for college choice by ethnic group indicates the need for more research in this area. Dali and Caidi (2016) surveyed library science students to gather information about their perceptions of library and information science field, careers, their respective programs, factors on deciding upon library and information science, and their ideas on improvement of recruitment (p. 501). Although they collected sex, country of birth, and other demographic data, they did not collect race/ethnicity, nor did they report findings by sex or country of birth. The top reasons for choosing a particular graduate school included \"Reputation of the university and reputation of faculty members,\" \"Location (e.g. city, state),\" and \"Economic considerations (tuitions, scholarships, financial aid)\" (see Table VI, p. 512)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Review of Literature", "text": "The literature review of social justice concepts, social justice specifically in the library and information sciences field, and issues regarding diversity in the library field provided a context for this research project.

The graduate choice research is most recent and has used existing models for undergraduate choice, based on economic, sociological, information processing perspectives or some combination of those perspectives and theories. A search through the literature for studies using Perna's combined economic and sociological approach to evaluate the literature combined with reviewing the decision making factors by race/ethnicity, and gender found few studies with that combination for graduate students in general and none using Perna's model for library science.

To represent those graduates, researchers used a sampling design, which resulted in a sample of 137,800 students (Table B-3). The 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) sampled these 137,800 students (p. 1). Of the 137,800 students, 132,800 were determined to be eligible for the B&B study (Table B-3), based on eligibility criteria, which included attending 1,940 eligible institutions (Table B-2). Researchers sampled students by using \"stratified systematic sampling with predetermined sampling rates that varied by student stratum\" (p. B-7). During the first follow-up study in 2009, the enrollment list sample narrowed to those who had completed a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2007 andJune 30, 2008, and had interviewed with NPSAS or had sufficient other data on file (Cataldi et al., 2014, pp. B-8-B-11). The second follow-up study in 2012 used the same sample set of eligible students (p. B-12). For the B&B:08/12 study, participants were students who were interviewed who were eligible in the B&B:08/09 first follow-up study (Cataldi et al., 2014, p. B-12). The students also had to meet these requirements as quoted: \u2022 be enrolled in any of the following: an academic program; at least one course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree; or an occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award; \u2022 not be currently enrolled in high school; and \u2022 not be enrolled solely in a General Educational Development (GED) or other high school completion program (Cominole, et al., 2015, p.6). Data collected included eligibility, undergraduate education, post baccalaureate education/training, post baccalaureate employment, and student background (details in Table B1, Full-scale interview core data elements, by section and topic: 2012). Additionally, to be eligible for participation, students must have attended NPSAS eligible institutions, which met the following criteria as quoted from Cataldi et al. (2014, p. B-4): \u2022 been eligible to distribute Title IV funds; \u2022 offered an educational program designed for persons who had completed at least a high school education; \u2022 offered at least one academic, occupational, or vocational program of study lasting at least 3 months or 300 clock hours; \u2022 offered courses that were open to persons other than the employees or members of the company or group (e.g., union) that administers the institution; \u2022 been located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; and \u2022 not been a U.S. service academy. There were 1,940 institutions eligible (p. B-5). Of these institutions, 1,730 provided lists of students (Cominole et al., 2015, Table 2). See participation rates of eligible institutions in NPSAS:08 sampled and eligible institutions and enrollment list participation rates, by institution characteristics: 2007-08 , Table B2. The students who met these eligibility requirements of graduating in the 2007-2008 year from an eligible institution, and who had interviewed and/or whose institutions provided transcripts numbered 17,160 students (Cominole et al., 2015, p.iii). For example, students could still be eligible even if they did not complete or partially complete the interview in the first follow-up study if their information existed for the following as quoted from Cominole et al. (2015, pp.8-9): \u2022 student type (undergraduate or graduate/first-professional); \u2022 date of birth or age; \u2022 sex; and Due to 20 students' deaths and other situations, the number of eligible students for the B&B:08/12 study was 17,110 (see Cominole et al., 2015, Table 11). Variables. Using Perna's (2004)   Expected costs and benefits -independent variables. Using the same assumptions as Perna (2004) and Douglas (2017), the direct cost of attending graduate school is not included in the analysis due to assuming graduate students' costs are the same due to participating in a national market rather than a state or local market (Perna, 2004, p. 493). The foregone earnings measurement is determined by grouping bachelor's degree field of study into lowest to highest quartiles based on expected level of earnings (Perna, 2004, p. 493). The four quartiles in Perna's study are lowest quartile (education, history, and psychology), second quartile (humanities, social sciences, public affairs and social services, and other), third quartile (business and management), and highest quartile (math and other sciences, health professions, and engineering) (p. 493). Perna (2004), drawing upon human capital theory, also considered the time between high school graduation and the completion of a bachelor's degree to be relevant to persons' decisions on whether or not to enroll in post-baccalaureate education (p. 494). This is due to persons' calculations as to the earnings potential over time if they had less time to recoup the costs of foregone earnings if it took longer to obtain the bachelor's degree (p. 494). Marital status and parental status are also considerations in determining the likelihood of further education (p. 494). See Table 2 for the relevant variables for assessing expected costs and benefits. Financial and academic resources independent variables. Financial variables, which may influence persons' decision-making when considering further education, include the availability of income from parents and self, and the existence of prior undergraduate debt (Perna, 2004, p. 494). Academic resources variables are those that reflect students' prior academic success and may influence their assessment of the likelihood of future academic success at the graduate level (p. 494). To measure this, one can use the variables of undergraduate grade-point average and ACT test scores. See Table 3 for the independent variables for financial and academic resources. Cultural and social capital independent variables. Measures of cultural capital include parent's educational level as noted by Perna (2000Perna ( , 2004, and Park and Hossler (2014). The highest educational level attained by either parent is a variable in the B&B:08/12 study, which one can use as a measure of cultural capital as well as the variable of whether or not the language at home was English. See Table 4. Perna (2004) and Douglas (2017) used these variables, so I used them in this study, though I note these items to reflect cultural capital may be Whiteness centered and are not as comprehensive as a broader definition of cultural capital as offered by Yosso for Communities of Color (2005). Social capital is meaningful to understanding the likelihood of students' choice of graduate education due to the influence of the building of social capital through prior relationships (Coleman, 1988). The undergraduate institution the student attended may promote graduate enrollment due to the influence of the social networks built during the undergraduate years (Perna, 2004, p. 497). In the case of the B&B:08/12 data set, variables that reflect attributes of the undergraduate institution the student attended include the institution's Carnegie Classification, and tuition and fees (which may reflect quality) (Perna, 2004, p. 497). Perna also considered location of the institution as a measure of social capital as a reflection of the breadth of the student's peer network as measured by whether or not the student's bachelor's degree was from the same state as the student's home state (p. 497). See Table 5 for these variables.  Table to obtain the report. In the logistic regression section, one selects Create Regression, then Logistic Regression. One drags the dependent variable into the top column and each independent variable into one of the rows. After creating a reference group when prompted to do so on the dependent variable, then one clicks on Create Regression to generate the report. PowerStats provides results for standardized regression coefficients, which one can compare to determine the relative magnitudes of relationships of independent variables to the dependent variable. For example, the relationship of one independent variable may be many times stronger in its relationship to the dependent variable than some other independent variable in relationship to the dependent variable (U. S. Department of Education, n.d., p. 12). Odds ratios results in PowerStats \"represent the proportional change in the probability that the dependent variable equals one for each additional unit of the independent variable, all else equal\" (U. S. Department of Education, n.d., p. 13). Odds ratios are useful because they show the likelihood of outcomes for different groups (Braver, Thoemmes, & Moser, 2010, pp. 957-958). Additionally, PowerStats reports the log-odds, or natural logarithm of each odds ratio (U. S. Department of Education, n.d., p. 13). PowerStats reports confidence intervals, which is another approach to determine whether there is a significant relationship between variables (Braver et al., 2010, p. 958 \u2022 Salary categories grouped by Bachelor's degree field of study, \u2022 Race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, Other), and \u2022 Gender -Male. I used as the dependent variable, Highest post-baccalaureate enrollment: Field of study as of 2012, Library Science, with \"All but Library Science\" as the reference category. For the salary grouping by major, I obtained the salaries all students were earning and sorted them by undergraduate majors using the \"Transcript: NPSAS Bachelor's degree field of study: 11 categories\" field. I then grouped them by lowest to highest salaries into four groups. The lowest quartile salaries were humanities, education, and other-law/library/human services/art/etc. Second quartile salaries were mathematics and science, general studies, social sciences, and other-manufacturing, etc. The third quartile salaries were in business. The highest quartile salaries were in computer and information sciences, engineering and engineering technology, and health care fields. For research question three, I used the Create Table section to Table section to obtain percentages enrolled in library science whose parent did or did not have a college degree by the library science students' gender, race/ethnicity, and the combination of race/ethnicity. I obtained the same reports for these variables: \u2022 English (or not) as the primary language growing up, \u2022 Married or not married in 2009 and in 2012, \u2022 Dependents or not, \u2022 Salary categories, \u2022 Undergraduate institutions groupings using Carnegie code classifications, and \u2022 Attendance at an undergraduate institution in the same state as legal residence. For all the continuous variables of income, GPA, ACT score, and cumulative loans for undergraduate study, I used the Create Table section to obtain means and medians. To obtain a logistic regression analysis by gender, I used the Create Regression section to run logistic regressions for females and for males by using these independent variables: \u2022 Marital status in 2009 -married To analyze the responses they chose the measure of \"temporal stability, or how constant responses remain over time\" (p. C-10). The researchers found the instrument to be very reliable with percentage agreement between responses for the field test and the reinterview being 80% or higher for the majority of questions (p. C-13). Validity. Validity refers to the concept of designing the research study such that one can consider the study's results accurate and generalizable (Mertler & Charles, 2008, p. 278). In quantitative research, researchers try to design the study to minimize threats to validity (Maxwell, 2005, p. 107). Internal validity threats are those actions, experiences, treatments, tests, and selection of participants or procedures in a study, which may contribute to the researcher being unable to draw correct conclusions from the data (Creswell, 2014, p. 174). Creswell lists several internal validity threats, which researchers should minimize, one of which is maturation. For example, researchers in the B&B:08/12 study minimized the maturation of subjects due to the participants being at the same level of educational attainment at the base year of 2007/2008 and followed up with them all in the year 2012. The researchers used a data collection technique of responsive design to minimize bias due to non-response (Cominole et al., 2015, p. iv). Researchers offered small financial incentives and abbreviated interviews to participants determined to be likely to contribute to non-response bias (pp. 41-43). For my study of this B&B:08/12 data, there is the risk of an internal validity threat due to sampling errors and nonsampling errors as a part of the B&B:08/12 study processes. Cataldi et al. (2014) caution analysts nonsampling errors can include \"nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations\" (p. B-24). The B&B:08/12 researchers explained their processes for dealing with privacy issues (perturbation), missing values (imputations), and weighting adjustments (pp. B-13-B-16). Even though researchers used these measures to compensate for problems in the data, it is possible these could introduce inconsistencies. For example, to deal with variables with missing data, the B&B system filled the variables with an imputation process, filling the fields with data that should be representative of what one would expect for that variable though could be introducing error (p. B-14). PowerStats does compute standard errors of estimates, which one could examine to determine if the error was too large for the estimate to be representative of the population. PowerStats also has a feature in which it will not display an estimate for a variable if the system deems it \"too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases)\" (pp. B-26-27). External validity threats are those in which researchers improperly generalize the findings of the data to other persons with other characteristics, or to those in other settings, or to those in different time-periods, either prior or future, than those participants in the study (Creswell, 2014, p. 176). To prevent external validity threats in this study, I use caution in generalizing to other groups. Since the B&B:08/12 data was carefully gathered through the work of NCES which conducted this longitudinal study, the external validity threats are minimized by the dataset representing students throughout the United States and by those researchers' attention to research design to minimize threats."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Delimitations", "text": "Mertler and Charles (2008) define limitations as \"[n]atural conditions that restrict the scope of a study and may affect its outcomes\" (p. 363). As with using any secondary data set, one limitation is the National Center for Education Statistics designed the methodology for the longitudinal study for their use rather than for my individual study. Cataldi et al. (2014)  Since the library field is so predominately White and female, there is a limitation of the data set not being large enough, even with the weighting process, for it to provide as much information on males and on those identifying in other race/ethnicity categories. Using Perna's model to analyze the data and using this data set allows one to examine only a few variables in the cultural and social capital areas. These are parent's educational attainment, primary language at home, type of undergraduate institution attended, undergraduate tuition and fees, and undergraduate attendance in the same state. One could view these variables as being Whiteness centered and not capturing other forms of capital as offered by Yosso (2005) for non-White communities. Wilson et al. (2013) expressed concern about research undervaluing the cultural capital of African Americans as well. A definition of delimitations as offered by Mertler and Charles (2008) is \"restrictions that researchers impose in order to narrow the scope of the study\" (p. 361). A delimitation in this longitudinal study is it only covers those who were undergraduates who graduated in 2007-2008 with follow-up data gathered in 2012. There could be students who entered library science graduate study who graduated at earlier or later years than 2007-2008. This data set does not include those persons and thus is not representative of all students in that timeframe. Although B&B:08/12 data could be considered dated, it is the most current B&B data set available as of 2019 and has value as a national data set comprised of a cohort tracked over time to allow for time to pass between bachelor's degree graduation and later enrollment in a graduate program. Enrollment in library science by members of this cohort between the years of 2012 and 2018 should be available in the 2018 follow-up data when that data set is released (U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, \"Baccalaureate and", "text": "Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B): About B&B\", n.d.). Another delimitation is my choice to examine library science graduate students rather than a larger group of students. The data set and Perna's model could be better suited for analyzing graduate study choice by students more generally, or at least those for which there are larger numbers of students who chose a field of study. Mertler and Charles (2008) "}, {"section_title": "Assumptions of the Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "To obtain all statistics and odds ratio information from the B&B:08/12 data set, I used PowerStats Version 1.0 on the NCES website. To obtain descriptive statistics for each variable examined in the research, I used the Create institutions, so there were fewer categories and thus larger percentages, to report. To answer research question two, I ran a logistic regression using the dependent variable, Highest post-baccalaureate enrollment: Field of study as of 2012, Library Science, with all but library science as the reference category to determine the likelihood of the independent variables influencing students' decisions to enroll in library science. When running the logistic regression, I chose the following independent variables to be reference categories based on the percentages being high of library science students with those characteristics, as found in research question one. I used single, no dependents, parents with college degree, English as primary language -yes, Carnegie code institution -Doctoral-Research, second quartile salaries, White, and Female. To be consistent with Perna (2004) and Douglas (2017)  The characteristics shown in Table 7 indicate those who enrolled in library science programs differ from those enrolled in other graduate degree programs in most of the variables. There were more female library science enrollees (74.93%) than enrolled in other programs (61.39%). More of the library science enrollees were White (92.79%) than enrolled in other programs (70.21%). In the combination of gender and race, there were more white females (67.72%) than enrolled in other master's (42.29%). There were similar percentages of white males (25.07%!) (! -interpret with caution) as enrolled in other master's (27.92%). There were so few enrollees from other race/ethnicity groups those numbers could not be displayed due to not meeting the reporting requirements of the PowerStats system. These findings are consistent with other statistics, which show the library field to be primarily White females. Library science enrollees differed from those in other graduate programs in the expected costs and benefits variables of marital status and dependents. Fewer library science students were single (66.04%) than other enrollees (78.99%). More library science enrollees had no dependents (93.72%) than other enrollees (84.99%). In the areas of cultural and social capital, more of the library science enrollees (53.11%) had attended a doctoral/research university for their undergraduate degrees than had other enrollees (38.51%). More library science enrollees (96.46%) grew up in homes where English was the primary language than other enrollees (89.68%).  To determine the impact of the variables on the likelihood of enrolling in a library science program, I ran a logistic regression analysis. See Table 8. In the areas of gender and race/ethnicity, among the library science enrollees, males were 29 percent less likely than females to enroll with the odds ratio of 0.71 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.05 to 11.03. In the area of race/ethnicity, the odds ratio for Blacks was 1.62, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 2053.45, for Hispanics was 0.58, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 347.25, and for all other races except Whites was 0.41, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 106.86. Due to the small percentages in the sample of any race/ethnicity other than White and due to these wide confidence intervals, one cannot rely on these odds ratios for predicting the likelihood of students of these races enrolling. The variables in the area of expected costs and benefits were foregone salaries as grouped by undergraduate major, time between high school and bachelor's degree, marital status, and any dependents. To account for the influence of undergraduate major and the potential of foregone salaries upon enrollment in a library science graduate program, I grouped majors into four quartiles. Those in the lowest quartile of humanities and education had 150 percent more odds to enroll in library science with an odds ratio of 2.50 and 95% confidence interval of 0.25 to 24.80 than those in the second quartile of mathematics and sciences, general studies, and social sciences. Those in the two highest salary quartiles of business and of computer sciences, engineering, and health care had 100 percent less odds to enroll in library science with an odds ratio for each quartile of 0.00 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 0.05 and p<0.05 than those in the second quartile. For the variable of months between high school graduation and 2007-2008 bachelor's degree award date, the odds ratio was 1.00 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.95 to 1.05, indicating that students at all levels of this variable had equal odds of enrolling or not in library science. Married students had 194 percent more odds to enroll in library science than nonmarried with a 95% confidence interval of 0.48 to 17.82. Library science enrollees who had dependents had 100 percent less odds than those without dependents to enroll with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 0.01 and p<0.05. The financial and academic resources variables are income (dependents' parents and independents) in 2006, undergraduate GPA, ACT composite score, and cumulative federal loan amount borrowed as of 2007-2008 for undergraduate studies. For the variable of undergraduate GPA, all levels had equal odds to enroll in library science (odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval of 0.99 to 1.02). The ACT composite score odds ratio of 1.08 indicates that as the ACT scores rise, students had 8 percent more odds to enroll in library science with 95% confidence interval of 0.97 to 1.20. Income and cumulative federal loan amounts had odds ratios of 1.00 with 95% confidence intervals of 1.00 to 1.00 indicating that those with all levels of income and federal loan amounts had equal odds to enroll in library science. The highest education level attained by either parent as of 2007-2008 and English as the primary language growing up are the variables examined for cultural capital. Students whose parent achieved some college but not a degree had 16 percent less odds to enroll in library science than those with parents with a college degree with a 95% confidence interval of 0.02 to 30.49. Students who had parent's highest education level of high school had 62 percent less odds to enroll than those with a college degree were to enroll in library science with a 95% confidence interval of 0.01 to 21.47. Those who grew up in a home without English as the primary language had 99 percent less odds to enroll than those who grew up with English as the primary language, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 0.06, p<0.05. The variables for social capital are the Carnegie Classification of the undergraduate institution, the undergraduate tuition and fees paid as of 2007-08, and attendance at an institution in the same state as legal residence. The variable for attendance in the same state was one I could not use in the logistic regression due to a collinearity error. Students who earned bachelor's degrees at Public and Private 4-year II institutions had 62 percent less odds to enroll in a library science program than those who graduated from Public and Private Doctoral/Research institutions with a 95% confidence interval of 0.12 to 1.24. Students at all levels of tuition and fees at the undergraduate level had equal odds to enroll in a library science program, with odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval of 1.00 to 1.00.    Tables 9 through 11. Table 9 shows the distribution by gender, with 74.9% as female as of the data collection in 2012. For the distribution by Race/Ethnicity (Table 10) as of the 2012 collection of data, 92.8% were White, with an insufficient percentage to report in all other race/ethnic groups. "}, {"section_title": "Distribution of 2007-2008 bachelor's degree recipients who enrolled in Library", "text": "Science by the combination of race/ethnicity and gender (Table 11) shows insufficient numbers to report in 2009. By 2012, the largest percentage was white female at 67.7%. The next two largest groups were white males and all other females, reporting with caution due to insufficient numbers. In the weighted sample, 61.4% of females had a parent who obtained a college degree and 38.6% of females did not have a parent who obtained a college degree as shown in Table 12. Whites also had many parents with college degrees at 65.2% with 34.8% not having a college degree.   Table 14 for the students with enrollment in a library science program as of 2012. The table provides breakdown by gender, race/ethnicity, and the combination of race/ethnicity and gender. Since the population is so heavily female and White, those were the only categories of variables meeting the reporting standards. One can compare the female income average of $69,262.17 to the overall total for library science students of $62,501.47 and conclude that females and/or their parents' had higher incomes than males since the total for all library science students was less. the ACT composite score. The GPA for females of 3.49 was higher than the total GPA of 3.40. To result in a drop from females' average GPA of 3.49 to the all total at 3.40, the male's average would have been lower. There was little difference in ACT composite of 25.7 for females and the 25.5 of the total. Expected costs and benefits variables include marital status, parental status, salary categories grouped into tiers by major, and time in months between high school graduation and bachelor's degree completion in [2007][2008]. Tables 15 through 18 contain the percentage distributions for marital status, parental status, and salary categories by gender, race/ethnicity, and the combination of race/ethnicity and gender. Table 15 shows that the highest percentage of those who enrolled in library science were females and were not married (78%) as of 2009. Among races and ethnicities, the largest group was White (63%). These statistics compared to those in Table 16 for those in Library Science as of 2012 show that many students married in those three years. The percentage of overall library science students not married declined from 66.5% in 2009 to 42.4% in 2012. For females the decline in not married was from 78.0% to 49.3% and Whites from 63.7% to 40.9%. This is interesting to note, though I will use the marital status in 2009 variable in the later odds ratio regressions by gender to be consistent with Perna (2004) who used the variable of marital status at the beginning of the date range of the longitudinal study.  As shown in Table 17, the largest percentages of library science students were not living with dependents (93%), were female (94.6%), and White (92.5%).   Another social capital variable is whether the student enrolled at an institution in the same state as legal residence when an undergraduate. As shown in Table 20, 79.4% of females enrolled in the same state and 86.4% of Whites enrolled in the same state. Since the overall total for students in library science showed 85.0% enrolled in the same state, then the percentages of males would have been higher than females who enrolled in some other state though the number of males did not meet the number required for reporting requirements. To examine the influence of the independent variables on the likelihood of females choosing to enroll in library science, I ran a logistic regression filtering for females. I could not use the variable of race in this logistic regression due to collinearity errors. See Table 21 for the odds ratio results. Expected costs and benefits variables were marital status in 2009, parental status in 2009, months between high school graduation and bachelor's degree graduation, and salaries grouped by majors from highest to lowest quartiles. Females who were married in 2009 had 30 percent more odds to enroll in library science than those not married with a 95% confidence interval of 0.10 to 16.94. Females who were living with dependents in 2009 had 100 percent less odds to enroll than females without dependents with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 0.00, p<.05. The odds ratio for the months between high school graduation and the completion of a bachelor's degree in 2007-2008 was 0.98, showing a two percent less odds of enrollment depending upon the number of months. Using the second quartile as reference, there were 124 percent more odds that students in the lowest quartile of salaries based on majors would enroll in library science. It was extremely unlikely that those in who majored in business and in other higher paid areas of computer and information science and engineering would enroll in library science, 100 percent less odds, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.00 to 0.29, p<.05. Financial and academic resources variables were income (dependent's parents and independents) in 2006, undergraduate GPA, ACT composite score, and the cumulative federal loans amount borrowed for undergraduate education through 2007-2008. Income and loan amounts had odds ratios of 1.00 with 95% confidence intervals of 1.00 to 1.00 indicating that females had equal odds to enroll regardless of these amounts. The odds ratio for undergraduate GPA was 1.00 indicating changes in the GPA did not change the likelihood of enrollment. The odds ratio for ACT composite score did show 10 percent greater odds of enrollment as the ACT score increased, with a 95% confidence interval of confidence interval of 1.00 to 1.00, indicating female students who had all levels of tuition and fees had equal odds of enrolling.  To examine the influence of the independent variables on the likelihood of males choosing to enroll in library science, I ran a logistic regression filtering for males. See   "}, {"section_title": "Summary of Results", "text": "Characteristics of those who enrolled in library science as opposed to other graduate programs include lower average income for the student and/or parents; and a higher percentage female, White, married, no dependents, and English as primary language than other graduate students. More library science students had attended doctoral-research universities as undergraduates than other graduate students. In examining the logistic regression for the impact of the variables on library science enrollment, I found that males had less odds of enrolling. Students with undergraduate majors in business, computer sciences, engineering, and health care also had much less odds of enrolling. Students without a parent who had a college degree had less odds to enroll in library science. Those who grew up in a home without English as the primary language had less odds to enroll. Students who attended public or private 4-year II Carnegie classification institutions as undergraduates had less odds to enroll than those who had attended doctoral/research universities. Findings of logistic regression odds ratios for females were significant for the characteristics of no dependents and of English as primary language influencing the likelihood of enrollment. The findings were also significant for the variables of the third highest and the highest salary categories for females having less odds to enroll in library science. Odds ratios were similar for both females and males for most variables. This study examined data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12) with Perna's (2006) conceptual model of college choice. This study used Perna's model of the influences of economic, social, and cultural factors in combination with gender and race to predict the enrollment in library science. The study also examined the issue of the lack of diversity in the enrollment in library science through a social justice framework, gathering relevant social justice literature as well as college choice literature. The process of the literature review combined with the research on the data provided greater knowledge of the factors involved in the choice of students' graduate study. This chapter will state the conclusions of the study, implications for practice and research, and recommendations for further research."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions of the Study", "text": "Economic factors play a role in the choice of library science. Library science students prior to enrollment in library science had lower incomes than those in other graduate programs. Among those who chose library science, most were from the lower salary tiers who had studied the undergraduate majors of education, humanities, and social sciences and rarely from the higher paid fields of business, computer science, engineering, and health care. Although Oliver & Prosser (2007) found the same pattern of humanities and social sciences majors ultimately choosing library science and found persons' \"dissatisfaction with jobs or job prospects\" (p. 528) as contributing to choosing library science, this study provides new economic statistical data and logistic regression data consistent with their survey findings which did not include income information. Comparing this study's findings to Perna's (2004) findings shows in both studies the economic factor of enrollment by females in a master's degree with undergraduate majors in the lowest quartile of salaries as increasing the likelihood of graduate enrollment (p. 518). For males, the findings differed, with males in Perna's study being equally likely to enroll from different salary quartiles, but males in this study being more likely to enroll when in the lowest salary quartile by major. Douglas' (2017) study of graduate business students found females and males as more likely to enroll if they had undergraduate majors in the lowest salary quartile (p.119). Since those from this study and from Douglas' (2017) study who were in the lowest salary quartile were the most likely to choose a graduate program, this is consistent with human capital theory (Becker, 1962), and with Perna's (2006) model. This indicates that students make educational decisions based on the expectation of future earnings after obtaining another degree being better than their current job's income or job prospects' earnings. Another economic factor in students' expected costs and benefits analysis, which was significant in influencing the decision to enroll, was whether the students had dependents. Having dependents made it highly unlikely to enroll in library science. This study did not find in the literature review of library science graduate choice any prior consideration of students' status as parents as an influence on the decision to enroll. Comparing this study and Douglas' (2017) on the factor of having dependents on the decision to enroll shows females in both studies were less likely to enroll than females without dependents. Having dependents influenced the decision to enroll among library science students more than it influenced enrollment by those students entering business graduate school (p. 122). For library science students, the findings were similar for men, but for business students men with dependents were more likely to enroll in graduate business school (Douglas, 2017, p. 122). Cultural capital factors influence the likelihood of attending library science graduate programs. It was highly unlikely a student grew up in a home without English as the primary language. It was highly unlikely a student would enroll if the parent's highest degree were a high school diploma. One can conclude from this study that students from homes where they did not have English as the primary language and those who were first-generation college students would be unlikely to enroll in library science. These are new findings not found in the review of library science literature. Although in this study first-generation college students of both genders were unlikely to enroll in library science, in Douglas' (2017) study the first-generation college students who were female were more likely to enroll in graduate study with only males being less likely to enroll (p. 126). In Perna's (2004) study, parents' education was a significant factor for both males and females (p. 504). Finding differences in gender by discipline may be an area for further study. The social capital factor most influencing the decision to enroll was the Carnegie Classification of the institution the student attended as an undergraduate. The literature review of library science literature did not find any articles examining the type of institution the undergraduate student attended. Those attending a doctoral-research university as an undergraduate were more likely to enroll in library science. Douglas (2017) and Perna (2004)  Since the population of library sciences students was predominately White, one cannot confidently draw conclusions on these economic, cultural, and social factors based on race/ethnicity. Findings for females and males were similar so one could not draw any unique conclusions about the influences of any of the factors by gender, with the exception of females having dependents and females having parent's highest educational level as high school as being statistically significant influences on the enrollment decision. As planned, this study adds to the literature on graduate study choice by examining economic, cultural, and social capital factors on enrollment in library science. It adds to the literature by using a national sample. It further tested Perna's (2006) model for examining graduate students choice. The knowledge gained in this study should assist in recruitment to library science graduate study in general though the sample did not include enough persons with race/ethnicity other than White to differentiate recruitment to specific racial/ethnic populations. One specific area in which Perna's (2004) study, Douglas' (2017) study, and this study agree is the finding of attendance at a research institution as an undergraduate increased the likelihood of attending graduate school."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice and Research", "text": "In the area of practice, library associations, graduate program administrators, and librarians can potentially use the findings in this study to improve recruitment into the library field. The findings in three areas are of particular use: 1) economic considerations including income, projected income, and dependents, 2) underrepresented groups of firstgeneration students, non-English speaking in home, and minority races and ethnicities, and 3) under-representation of students from institutions other than doctoral/research institutions. In the area of research, the study raised many questions due to limitations and delimitations posed by the data set being comprised of so many White females. The data set also presented problems due to being comprised of data over the short time span of those graduating in 2008 until enrollment in 2012. In the first area to consider for implications on practice, one should consider library science students had lower incomes and/or lower parent's incomes as undergraduates. This should lead library graduate schools to consider how adequate financial incentives such as scholarships, assistantships, and other financial aid may lead to additional recruitment. Library students generally had undergraduate majors from the lower salary tiers. To have more diversity in undergraduate majors, one would need to provide recruitment material to students in other majors to include statistics on librarians' salaries that are comparable to what the students may expect in the higher income fields. There are niche areas in many fields of librarianship including administration and jobs in private sectors with salaries more appealing than what students may expect for average starting salaries. Another important implication for practice is the finding related to having dependents making it very unlikely one would enroll. This could also indicate a need for scholarships, assistantships, and other financial aid to make the decision to enroll easier. Universities with daycares could promote those when recruiting. Although the data set did not have enough diversity in race and ethnicity to make conclusions by race/ethnicity, the findings did show students were less likely to enroll if English was not the primary language at home and if they were first generation students. Recruiting persons from those two groups should increase diversity. Thinking about recruitment needs take place at all levels of the library field. All librarians need to be sure the libraries are welcoming for all persons for this to be successful. Creating a positive experience in libraries can occur as early as when children are interacting with school and public librarians. Recruitment into the library field needs to occur early as well due to the influence of the type of institution on the likelihood of enrollment. If students are more likely to enroll in library science after undergraduate study at a doctoral/research university, then mentoring and preparation at the high school level for undergraduate admission to a doctoral/research university is important. Since this study's data set contained so many White females, researchers could gain more information through analysis of data with adequate numbers of males and those from other races/ethnicities for the statistical software to produce more data. Researchers could also gather more information had there been more time lapsed from undergraduate graduation until enrollment in a library science program as more students over time make that choice. Researchers should watch for later releases of data from the NCES in order to re-examine the data. If researchers had a larger sample, they could run comparable statistical tables and logistic regressions using Perna's (2006) model. With a larger sample, one could find out more about the influences of the economic, cultural, and social capital factors on enrollment by gender and race/ethnicity. There are possibilities also for using Perna's (2006) model to analyze a data set by region rather than a national data set."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Further Research", "text": "In addition to further research by gender, race/ethnicity, and by region, this study presented findings which led to additional questions researchers could examine. Since this was a quantitative study, researchers could do a qualitative or mixed methods study to find out more about why library science students may come from backgrounds of lower incomes than other graduate students do. In furthering the understandings of graduate study choice based on Perna's (2006) model, researchers could try to find out why there was a difference by gender by disciplines as was shown by comparing this study and Douglas' (2017) study. One could also research what recruitment efforts would be helpful to encourage enrollment in a particular field of study and if those practices need to differ by gender or race/ethnicity. Since there was a difference in the decision to enroll by first-generation students by gender and by discipline (library science versus business) in comparing this study and Douglas' (2017) study, researchers could work to determine why. Researchers could also determine what recruitment practices would be effective to recruit first generation students into a particular discipline. Few students were from homes in which English was not the primary language growing up. Researchers could investigate the reasons for that and could research effective recruitment of students from that population. Since library science students were more likely to have attended doctoral/research institutions as undergraduates, qualitative or mixed-methods research could add to the understanding of why that characteristic led to enrollment. Another avenue of research could be on effective recruitment of students from institutions, which are not doctoral-research universities. The key recommendation from this study is there must be a concerted effort on the part of library associations, graduate school administrators, and librarians to work to improve recruitment into the field of library science since the field is not diverse. This study points to the need for six areas of improvement: 1. Researchers must learn more about the reasons for persons to make the choice of library science and how that varies by gender, race, and ethnicity. 2. Recruitment needs to address the specific shortages of first-generation students and those who are from families without English as the primary language as well as the shortages of males, and shortages of all races and ethnicities other than White. 3. Recruitment needs to begin early so that students will want to become librarians even at the level of high school or earlier so they can be academically prepared for attendance at doctoral/research institutions as undergraduates. likely to enroll in library science as identified in this study. These include non-White race/ethnicities, males, first-generation college students, those with dependents, English not primary language in homes, those attending nondoctoral/research institutions as undergraduates, and those with business, engineering, and healthcare majors. 6. Library science graduate programs need to provide adequate financial support since library students may come from lower income backgrounds than other graduate students and need to provide support for students who have dependents. Applying a critical theory lens to suggest actions for diversity recruitment and retention planning, I created a Critical Theory Based Framework for Diversity in Libraries Action Plan, for increasing recruitment of the underrepresented groups identified in my study. The tool suggests social justice actions to improve early recruitment and support to underrepresented groups, recruitment at the undergraduate level, social justice education at the graduate LIS level, and recruitment and retention efforts in libraries. The critical theory and related concepts, and suggested actions are meant to be representative, not exhaustive, lending the tool to customization for one's own social justice actions.

The study showed that economic, cultural, and social factors do influence the decisions to enroll. Further research needs to find out the reasons why those factors influence the decisions and how librarians can take social justice actions to improve diversity and to influence the recruitment of diverse students into the library field.
