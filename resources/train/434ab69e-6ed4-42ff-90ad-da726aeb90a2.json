[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose-The stroke belt is described as an 8-state region with high stroke mortality across the southeastern United States. Using spatial statistics, we identified clusters of high stroke mortality (hot spots) and adjacent areas of low stroke mortality (cool spots) for US counties and evaluated for regional differences in county-level risk factors. Methods-A cross-sectional study of stroke mortality was conducted using Multiple Cause of Death data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to compute age-adjusted adult stroke mortality rates for US counties. Local indicators of spatial association statistics were used for hot-spot mapping. County-level variables were compared between hot and cool spots. Results-Between 2008 and 2010, there were 393 121 stroke-related deaths. Median age-adjusted adult stroke mortality was 61.7 per 100 000 persons (interquartile range=51.4-74.7). We identified 705 hot-spot counties (22.4%) and 234 cool-spot counties (7.5%); 44.5% of hot-spot counties were located outside of the stroke belt. Hot spots had greater proportions of black residents, higher rates of unemployment, chronic disease, and healthcare utilization, and lower median income and educational attainment. Conclusions-Clusters of high stroke mortality exist beyond the 8-state stroke belt, and variation exists within the stroke belt. Reconsideration of the stroke belt definition and increased attention to local determinants of health underlying small area regional variability could inform targeted healthcare interventions.

We used county-level data and spatial statistics to empirically identify geographic clusters of high stroke mortality, or hot spots, at a finer geographic resolution to compare with the traditional state-based stroke belt. We compared multiple county-level variables between high stroke mortality hot spots and adjacent low stroke mortality cool spots, to understand local factors contributing to stroke outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We used Multiple Cause of Death data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) from 2008 to 2010 to calculate a 3-year average ageadjusted adult stroke mortality rate for all US counties.

A state-based approach misses nearly half of the counties identified empirically as hot spots. We identified cool spots within the stroke belt where mortality is lower than expected. County-level heterogeneity suggests that statebased analyses may limit our understanding of the underlying drivers of survival through misclassification bias. Because things that are geographically close tend to be more similar, 8 identifying areas that have significantly different mortality rates, despite close proximity, may help explain the drivers of disparities in outcomes.\nThere was a higher rate of 60-minute PSC access for people living in hot spots than cool spots; however, a statistically significant difference for county-level averages was not observed. We found a paradoxical relationship between the number of physicians and mortality, with more physicians on average in hot spots than cool spots. These findings combined may suggest that differential access to health care and specialty stroke care may not be the key factor underlying geographic variability in stroke mortality. It is possible that more granular scales of analysis are needed to detect meaningful differences (the mortality data used restricted us to a county-level analysis).\nWe found statistically significant differences in prevalence of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension between hot spots and cool spots. However, differences in disease severity or disease control may be magnifying relatively small differences in prevalence.\nThis study has limitations. The stability of spatial patterns of mortality over time is not known, but a previous study "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Clusters of high stroke mortality exist beyond the 8-state stroke belt, and variation exists within the stroke belt.

That is, whether values of a given variable are random across geography, or alternatively whether a variable is correlated with itself across space, in which case we observe spatial patterns in the data among geographically proximate \"neighbors. With both types of tests, the investigator specifies how \"neighbor\" is defined for the purposes of comparing values of each geographic area to values of neighboring or nearby areas, to test whether values of the index locations are positively or negatively associated with the mean of the values of the index locations' neighbors. The most straightforward and intuitive method treats the geographic areas that are contiguous to and share a boarder with a given area as the neighbors of that area. Formally, this definition is called first--order contiguity and the comparison is accomplished by building a spatial weights matrix that for each location identifies its contiguous neighbors. That approach is not ideal if the areas being studied differ in size. An alternative is to treat all other geographic locations in the dataset as a neighbor of a given location, and compute the mean of the values of those locations by down--weighting the value of each location by the inverse of its distance from the index location. This weighing scheme is called inverse distance weighting (IDW). This method has the added benefit of enabling an analysis without making the investigator decide arbitrarily the distance or bandwidth within which areas are treated as neighbors.\nIn our analysis we used the Local Indicator of Spatial Association, or LISA 1 statistic, to test for spatial autocorrelation of stroke mortality rates in counties across the US, and defined neighbors according to inverse distance weighting. We presented the results in the conventional manner, which entails mapping the geographic areas under study and shading those areas where statistically significant spatial autocorrelation was identified. Different shading colors are used to indicate the nature of the spatial autocorrelation in each local area.
