[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Amazon and Orinoco rivers form the largest freshwater source into the world oceans. Their joint plume extends thousands of kilometers into the western tropical North Atlantic (WTNA) and the Caribbean [M\u20ac uller-Karger et al., 1989;Johns et al., 1990], modifying ocean temperatures and stratification [Pailler et al., 1999;Masson and Delecluse, 2001;Ffield, 2007]. Several tropical cyclones (TCs) pass over the plume each year [Ffield, 2007] and extract their energy from the tropical ocean. Since TCs are sensitive to oceanic conditions [Emanuel, 1987[Emanuel, , 1999Cione and Uhlhorn, 2003], it has been proposed that the Amazon and Orinoco plume intensifies tropical storms [Ffield, 2007;Vizy and Cook, 2010]. The oceanic control on TCs consists primarily of the initial sea surface temperature (SST) [Emanuel, 1987] as well as subsurface temperatures and stratification [Emanuel, 1999;Cione and Uhlhorn, 2003]. As TCs pass over the ocean they mix colder waters to the surface [Price, 1981], leaving a cool SST wake. The cooling can exceed 26 C and limits TC growth [Schade and Emanuel, 1999]. The cooling magnitude depends on the storm strength itself, but also on the underlying ocean structure [Shay et al., 2000;Cione and Uhlhorn, 2003;Lloyd and Vecchi, 2011]. Low-salinity plumes can induce barrier layers (BLs) and subsurface heating, and therefore reduce cooling feedbacks [Balaguru et al., 2012a]. Neetu et al. [2012] suggest that salinity stratification is particularly important for TC development in the Amazon and Orinoco plume. Since BLs are commonly accompanied by temperature inversions (TIs) [Vialard and Delecluse, 1998;Pailler et al., 1999], they may even impose positive feedbacks on passing storms. Balaguru et al. [2012a] find that tropical cyclone intensification is up to 50% higher in the presence of BLs. On the other hand the Amazon and Orinoco plume is highly turbid and contains sediments and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [Hu et al., 2004;Del Vecchio and Subramaniam, 2004]. Furthermore, the nutrient rich rivers support primary production and lead to enhanced phytoplankton (chlorophyll) abundance in the WTNA [Smith and Demaster, 1996]. The accumulation of light absorbing particles in the WTNA modifies the vertical heat transfer into the ocean. Subramaniam et al. [2007] show that the attenuation depth in the Amazon River plume is shallower compared to the open ocean. Solar radiation is absorbed nearer the The model domain covers the area 4.5 S-21 N/72.5 W-41 W, with a horizontal resolution of 10 km and 50 levels in the vertical, with a higher density of model levels in the upper ocean. On average the top 26 levels are concentrated in the upper 500 meters of the ocean, 12 of which are in the upper 100 m. The grid covers an area of about 2800 km33500 km and captures 3000 km of the northeastern South American coastline. The topography of the ocean bottom is taken from Global Topography v14.1 [Smith and Sandwell, 1990]. Open boundaries are applied in the West, the North and the East of the domain. The southern boundary is closed by the South American coastline. Open boundary and initial conditions for temperature, salinity, three-dimensional velocity fields and nontidal sea level were obtained from the monthly mean 1/4 Mercator Ocean (GLORYS2V3) global ocean reanalysis [Lellouche et al., 2013]. Tides are an important process in mixing the river freshwater plumes with the open ocean and are extracted from the 1/12 Atlantic Ocean Atlas Solution (OSU Tidal Data Inversion) [Egbert et al., 1994]. The 6 hourly NCEP CFSR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction; Climate System Forecast Reanalysis) data are used for the atmospheric boundary conditions [Saha et al., 2010], namely 2 m temperature and moisture, 10 m winds, precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation, and cloud coverage."}, {"section_title": "Experiments", "text": "We have conducted three experiments to estimate the effect of the Amazon and Orinoco on the WTNA. The first experiment is a control (No-River) with constant light absorption and no freshwater discharge. In the second experiment (Clear-River), the Amazon and Orinoco release freshwater into the ocean, but light absorption is still kept constant. In the third experiment (Colored-River) the river sources are included and the models' light absorption algorithm is modified to account for ocean color effects. We run each experiment for 11 years (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010) of which we analyze the last 10 years. The seasonal averages for winter (DJF-December, January, February), spring (MAM-March, April, May), summer (JJA-June, July, August), and autumn (SON-September, October, November) are presented. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 2.2.1. The Amazon and Orinoco Discharge River input in ROMS is realized in the form of freshwater sources at the river mouths. The mean annual cycle of Amazon and Orinoco discharge ( Figure 1) is derived from the Global Runoff Data Center [(GRDC)/Federal Institute of Hydrology/ Germany, and International Hydrological Programme/ United Nations Educational/ Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2001], which provide monthly discharge measured at various stations along the rivers. River temperature has been estimated from monthly CFSR SST at the river mouths. The Amazon discharge has been measured at Obidos from 1982Obidos from to 1947Obidos from and 1970Obidos from to 1997. Obidos is located about 750 km upstream the Amazon delta. The discharge is combined with the Tapajos and Xingu, which join the Amazon 50 km and 300 km downstream Obidos, respectively. The Tocantins is another major river with a yearly discharge that is almost a third of the Orinoco. It enters the North Atlantic close to the Amazon mouth and is usually assigned to the Amazon discharge. Amazon and the Tocantins release about 200,000 m 3 /s freshwater into the tropical North Atlantic. The discharge is maximum in May and minimum in November. The Orinoco discharge was measured from 1923 to 1989 at the gauging station Puente Angostura, located about 350 km upstream the Orinoco delta. The discharge is corrected by about 110% due to the Rio Caroni which feeds the Orinoco, approximately 100 km downstream Puente Angostura [Castellanos et al., 2010]. The mean discharge is about 30,000 m 3 /s. The combined annual mean cycle is dominated by the Amazon, but in summer and autumn the Orinoco contributes about 30% to 50% percent to the total discharge."}, {"section_title": "Light Attenuation Algorithm", "text": "ROMS applies the Paulson and Simpson [1977] radiation formulation, which splits solar transmission into a sum of exponential terms representing different wavelengths. Transmission coefficients and exponents are given as a function of the five Jerlov [1976] water types. Water type 1 represents the clearest water (1% light level at about 86 m) and water type 5 stands for the cloudiest water (1% light level at 24 m). In ROMS a fixed water type is set for a simulation, that doesn't vary in space or time. In the No-River and in the Clear-River experiment we use a Jerlov water type of 1, assuming that there are no light absorbing particles contained in the ocean. Although the Jerlov [1976] water types serve as a proxy for chlorophyll concentration, simply dividing water into categories is a rough and qualitative estimate and the transition between water types is not continuous [Lee et al., 2005]. Morel and Antoine [1994] and Ohlmann [2003] have overcome this by parameterizing attenuation coefficients as a function of surface chlorophyll concentration, available from satellite observations. This is appropriate in regions where chlorophyll is dominant, but is likely to underestimate light attenuation when other particles are present as well [Lee et al., 2005]. Del Vecchio and Subramaniam [2004] investigated the optical properties in the Amazon plume and conclude that CDOM is the main contributor to light absorption in the vicinity of the river mouth (70%). Within the higher salinity area of the plume detritus and chlorophyll become more important (40% each). To avoid the limitations of a chlorophyll-only based approach, we implement the Lee et al. [2005] algorithm into ROMS. The method is similar to Paulson and Simpson [1977], splitting transmission into visible and ultraviolet contributions, but the attenuation coefficients depend on depth (z) as well as backscattering and absorption coefficients at 490 nm. The coefficients are calculated applying the updated version [Lee et al., 2009] of the quasi analytical algorithm, developed by Lee et al. [2002]. This only requires remote sensing Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 reflectances (Rrs) at four different wavelengths. Combined monthly fields of Rrs at 9 km horizontal resolution from Terra and Aqua MODIS at 443 nm, 488 nm, 555 nm and 667 nm from 2000 to 2010 were obtained [Feldman and McClain, 2014]. MODIS is the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites, which pass over the equator at different times of day and are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1-2 days, acquiring data at various spectral bands. Figure 2 shows the annual mean 1% light level derived from the remotely sensed ocean color. Note that in the No-River and Clear-River experiments the 1% light level is at a constant depth of 86 m for the whole domain (Jerlov water type of 1). With the Lee et al. [2005] algorithm, the outline of low attenuation depth is similar to the shape of the freshwater plume ( Figure 3). The light depth is only about 10-20 m near the river mouths, and between 30 m and 60 m in the river plume area. Outside the plume, the light can reach depths of 80 m."}, {"section_title": "Oceanic Metrics and Tropical Cyclone Intensity", "text": "The depth of the isothermal layer and the mixed layer (ML) depth are given by a finite difference criterion [de Boyer Mont egut et al., 2004]. At the thermocline top the temperature has decreased by 0.2 C as compared to the temperature at the reference depth (10 m). A density decrease corresponding to the same temperature decrease at constant salinity marks the bottom of the ML. The barrier layer (BL) lies between the bottom of the ML and the thermocline.  Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "10.1002/2014JC010533", "text": "We estimate the potential impact of ocean stratification on TC intensity by comparing several oceanic metrics used in TC intensity predictions. The initial SST is a first predictor for the potential intensity of a storm [Emanuel, 1987], but TCs also interact with the ocean subsurface. The 100 m mean temperature [Price, 2009] and the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) [Leipper and Volgenau, 1972] consider the upper ocean heat content. TCHP is defined as the integrated ocean heat content above the 26 C-isotherm and is for instance used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for hurricane forecasts. In areas with strong salinity stratification, like the Amazon-Orinoco plume, increased stability may inhibit vertical mixing by TCs [Balaguru et al., 2012a]. This mechanism is not included in heat content-based metrics. Therefore Vincent et al. [2012b] developed the Cooling Inhibition index (CI). It is defined as the cube root of the potential energy increase in the ocean corresponding to a 2 C surface cooling, induced by vertical mixing. CI explicitly takes into account the density stratification in the ocean and is a key metric in this paper. TCs leave considerable cooling of several degrees in their wake. However, it is not the wake cooling, but rather the cooling under the TC eye that matters for storm development. Following Vincent et al. [2012a], the eye cooling (DT Eye ) is here defined as the SST cooling 112 h after compared to 212 h before TC passage averaged over a 200 km 3 200 km box around the TC position. The wake cooling (DT Wake ) is the SST 11 day to 13 days after, as compared to SSTs 210 days to 23 days before TC passage in the same box. Vincent et al. [2012a] show that DT Eye is roughly half of DT Wake . The SST feedback on a TC does not only depend on the ocean structure, but also on the TC strength itself. The Wind Power Index (WPi) is a measure for cyclone intensity and a proxy for the transfer of mixing energy to the ocean [Vincent et al., 2012b]. It considers cyclone wind speeds, translation speed, and size and is defined as the integrated power dissipation (23 days before to 13 days after TC passage), normalized by the power dissipation for a weak storm. Typically tropical cyclones that reach hurricane strength have a WPi between 2.5 and 5.5 [Vincent et al., 2012b]. The intensity of TCs can be expressed in terms of their minimum pressure. The maximum potential intensity (MPI) is a thermodynamic estimate for the minimum sustainable TC pressure at a given SST [Emanuel, 1987]. The actual minimum central pressure (MCP) is usually larger due to atmospheric and oceanic constraints, e.g., the self-induced surface cooling [Emanuel, 1999]. The dimensionless intensity change (DI) is then defined as the reduction in MPI compared to the difference in ambient pressure (p a ) and MPI [Schade, 2000]: 3. Results\nabout 3 m too deep in spring and summer respectively. The agreement in ML depth is very good in autumn. We attempt to estimate the impact of the colored river plume on TC intensity, which mainly occur from June to November. Therefore the winter bias should not affect our overall conclusions. Of relevance for TC development is the heat contained in the upper ocean. The annual and area mean TCHP in the model is 48.2 kJ/cm 2 . The spatial distribution of the June to November TCHP is roughly a reflection of the warm pool ( Figure 5a). Generally, TCHP is larger toward the coast where SSTs are higher. However, the heat content does not only depend on ocean temperatures, but also on the depth of the isothermal layer. The thermocline is deepest in the Caribbean (up to 100 m in winter, and up to 60 m in summer), leading to high TCHPs (up to 80 kJ/cm 2 and 120 kJ/cm 2 ). Ocean temperatures are lower in winter and spring resulting in a lower TCHP. Since the isothermal layer is deeper in that season, the effect of the colder ocean is damped. In summer, when the ocean is warmed, TCHP increases. Daily TCHP maps are available online from NOAA. TCHP is derived from satellite-obtained sea surface height anomalies [Goni et al., 2009]. These maps show that TCHP in the Caribbean can commonly reach 100 kJ/cm 2 in the hurricane season and is large within the warm pool, similar to the ROMS model. As for TCHP, CI is large when the isothermal layer is very thick. However, it also depends on the density stratification and grows with strong freshwater signals on the ocean surface, or thick barrier layers. The annual mean CI in the model domain is 37.6 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , in the hurricane season (June-November) it is only 34.5 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 . The June to November CI is low near the South American coastline and largest in the northern part of the model domain, where the thermocline can be very deep ( Figure 5b). The same argument explains high values of CI in the Caribbean (up to 50 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ). Observed CI has been calculated from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) data set which contains temperature and salinity profiles from 1955 to 2012 [Locarnini et al., 2013;Zweng et al., 2013]. The spatial distribution and magnitude is very similar to the model results ( Figure 5c). Modeled CI is slightly higher in the western Caribbean, and slightly too low in the eastern model domain.\nThere is no significant change in SSTs, except near the Amazon and Orinoco river mouths ( Figure 6b). A sensitivity experiment with variable river temperatures (12 C, 22 C) shows that this river outlet warming is due to the river temperature itself. In the open ocean SST changes are not sensitive to the river temperature. Subsurface temperatures on the other hand are modified by the freshwater. The change in the area mean June-November temperature profile is shown in Figure 7. The difference is largest in the BL, with a maximum heating of 10.1 C at about 30 m in the Clear-River experiment. The BL thickens as a consequence of surface freshening in all seasons ( Figure 6c). The annual and area mean BL increase is 2.1 m (7%). The magnitude in BL change is maximum in spring (up to 15 m locally) and the spatial extent is largest in autumn. The spatial distribution and seasonal cycle of BL thickening is similar to the pattern of surface salinity changes. However, there are some discrepancies in surface salinity decrease and BL change, i.e., north of the Amazon River mouth in summer. Note that any modifications in BL thickness are a combination of thermocline and ML depth. The ML shallows in each season, the seasonal cycle and spatial distribution reflecting the decrease in surface salinity. While the thermocline depth does not change on average, it is subject to large natural seasonal and regional variations. Local changes can exceed 10 m, leading to additional thickening or shallowing of the BL locally. Persistent temperature inversions (TI's) develop in the presence of BL's, due to isolation from surface cooling [Pailler et al., 1999;Vialard and Delecluse, 1998]. They are here defined as the maximum temperature difference compared to the reference temperature at 10 m, if this difference exceeds 0.2 C [de Boyer Mont egut et al., 2004]. In the Clear-River experiment they occur in 31% of all modeled days and locations, and in the No-River experiment only in 8%. TIs become strongest in winter, frequently exceeding 0.5 C and are mostly located north of 10 N (not shown). These inversion almost entirely disappear in the No-River experiment (Figure 6d). The plume sustains weaker inversions in summer and autumn (up to 0.4 ), which also fade when the rivers are switched off. Spring doesn't witness any significant TIs in both experiments. As a result the BL is 10.08 C warmer in the Clear-River experiment, leading to a slight increase in 100 m mean temperatures (10.06 C). The subthermocline (defined as the layer between the thermocline and the 26 C isotherm) experiences widespread, but small cooling as a consequence of reduced entrainment. The annual mean subthermocline cooling is 20.02 C. Although the BL is slightly warmer in the Clear-River experiment, it is not able to produce any significant TCHP increase (Figure 6e). The modest BL heating is partly compensated by subthermocline cooling. Furthermore the 26 C-isotherm is subject to large interannual and seasonal variations. The annual mean increase is only 11.0 kJ/cm 2 (2%). The spatial maps are patchy and the change can even be negative in some places (i.e., in the Caribbean). As mentioned above, the TCHP does not consider the stabilizing freshwater effect. However, there is a widespread increase in the energy required to cool the ocean surface ( Figure 6f). The seasonal cycle and spatial distribution of CI increase is very similar (but of opposite sign) to the change in surface salinity. The average increase is 12.2 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 . The change is largest in summer and spring (up to 110 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ), while the location of maximum CI increase migrates from about 10 N in spring to about 15 N in summer. The CI increase is 3 ), but still has a similar spatial extent. There is a significant increase in CI north of 10 N from June to November, when many hurricanes pass over that area. The modest change in TCHP suggests that the majority of CI increase is due to increased stability, rather than subsurface warming. To estimate each contribution we recalculate CI, only considering changes in salinity stratification. Here the temperature profile of the No-River experiment is used for both CI calculations, while the salinity profile of the respective experiment is applied. That yields a CI increase of 12.0 (J/ m 2 ) 1 3 in the Clear-River experiment, compared to no freshwater, i.e., only 0.2 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 (9%) of the CI change is caused by subsurface heating. In the WTNA the BL is formed by surface freshening from rivers and rain [Foltz et al., 2004]. Another important formation mechanism is the subduction of high salinity waters of south Atlantic origin, creating subsurface salinity maxima in the WTNA [Blanke et al., 2002;Balaguru et al., 2012a]. Following Neetu et al. [2012], the impact of the total BL in the WTNA (river, precipitation and subduction induced) on CI can be estimated by comparing the standard CI in the Clear-River experiment, to a CI computed at constant salinity (33.85 PSU). According to this estimate, salinity stratification increases CI by about 8.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , of which only about 27% are caused by the Amazon and Orinoco.\nRiver case does include freshwater effects as well as light attenuation, the differences therefore show the combined effect of river-freshwater and ocean color. Again, the relevant annual mean values are summarized in Table 1. The Net change in the June-November temperature profile is shown in Figure 7. The subsurface warming of the freshwater stabilization is small compared to the subsurface cooling induced by ocean color. There is therefore an absolute cooling of the subsurface caused by the colored river, not just relative to the riverinduced BL heating. However, their maximum impacts occur at different depths. At about 30 m Clear-River induced BL heating shifts the profile to warmer temperatures. At 50 m the temperature change is almost solely determined by ocean color (20.5 C). At the surface the slight warming in the Clear-River experiment adds to the warming in the Colored-River experiment, leading to a Net of about 10.11 C. Since the Clear-River experiment did not modify offshore SSTs, the spatial pattern of net SST change in the open ocean is a reflection of the change caused by ocean color (Figure 8a), the mean SST increase being about 0.1 C. BL heating slightly lowers the 100 m mean temperature decrease as compared to the colorinduced changes, but the Net effect of the colored plume is still a considerable cooling (20.2 C). The ML is shallowed in the Clear-River experiment, thickening the BL. On the other hand the Colored-River experiment lifts the thermocline, thereby shallowing the BL and leading to a Net decrease of about 26 m. However, the changes in BL thickness are due to different mechanisms. In the Clear-River experiment the MLbottom is lifted due to higher stability. Whereas the Colored-River experiment shallows the BL from below. While this means that colder water is closer to the surface, it only leads to a modest increase in ocean stability. The Net TCHP change is a reduction similar to Figure 8c in terms of seasonal and spatial distribution (not shown). However, this reduction is slightly reduced due to the modest TCHP increase seen in the Clear-River experiment. The mean TCHP change is therefore 25.6 kJ/cm 2 . As mentioned above TCHP might not be the relevant parameter for TCs, since it neglects ocean stability. We therefore concentrate on CI in the following. The annual mean Net change of the colored plume is a small CI increase of 10.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 . The annual cycle is shown in Figure 9. In winter and spring, the BL effect seems to overwhelm any CI reduction caused by subsurface cooling (11.4 and 10.4 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , respectively). The large Net increase between about 10 N and 20 N in winter (up to 8 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 locally) is a result of persisting TIs. In the hurricane season (June-November) freshwater and color effects largely cancel each other. The Net effect is even a slight reduction in CI (20.6 (J/ m 2 ) 1 3 ). This implies that there may only be a marginal average consequence on SST feedbacks induced by the Amazon and Orinoco. However, there are significant month to month variations. The June and July maps show small areas of increasing (decreasing) CI of up to 16 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 (24 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ) in magnitude. In August, September and October, the Net is mostly negative. There is a significant decrease of up to 26 (J/ m 2 ) 1 3 between about 10 N and 15 N. North of that CI remains virtually unchanged. In November CI increases significantly north of 15 N (up to 16 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ).\nshow that in regions of strong salinity stratification, like the Amazon and Orinoco river plumes, CI has a better skill in forecasting cyclone induced surface cooling. The following analysis will therefore be based on SST and CI changes in the hurricane season (Table 2). SSTs in the TC box are the same in the No-River and the Clear-River case. Hence the potential maximum intensity (MPI) is equal in both experiments. In the Colored-River experiment SSTs increase marginally (10.1 C). According to Emanuel [1999] that corresponds to an increase in TC intensity of about 20.6 hPa in MPI. The intensity reduction (DI) is a measure for a TC's relative deviation from MPI and is defined in Section 2.3. In the following we relate CI to an expected surface cooling under the TC eye and the corresponding intensity reduction. DT Eye is assumed to be half the wake cooling [Vincent et al., 2012a], which in turn depends on the strength of the TC (WPi) and the resistance of the ocean to vertical mixing (CI). It is derived by applying a first order fit on the relationship of modeled wake cooling to WPi and CI [Vincent et al., 2012b]: (2) with c 0 ,c 1 ,c 2 , and c 3 being the fit parameters. DT Eye is then translated into intensity reduction using the linear relationship found by Schade [2000]: Their analysis suggests that a 2.5 C temperature drop may be sufficient to shut down a cyclone completely, DI is therefore normalized to 2.5 C. Figure 11 shows DT Eye as a function of WPi for the mean June-November CI in the TC-box for each experiment. The expected surface cooling and intensity reduction in the No-River and Colored-River experiments are very similar. Hence the effects of BL and light attenuation on surface cooling almost cancel each other on average in the season and area relevant for TC development. A WPi4 TC for instance, would induce SST cooling of 20.48 C, and deintensify by 0.19 DI in the No-River case. In the Clear-River experiment the SST feedback is smaller (20.33 C) and the resulting intensity reduction is 0.13 DI. The presence of light absorbing material in the ocean however, does cancel and even overwhelm the freshwater effect on average, leading to the stronger SST feedback of 20.53 C (0.21 DI) for the WPi4 TC. The SST feedback is therefore 10.15 C weaker (20.06 DI) in the Clear-River case compared to no freshwater, but is 20.2 C stronger (10.08 DI) if light attenuation is considered as well. Thus leaving a small net river impact of 20.05 C additional SST feedback (10.02 DI) for WPi4 TCs. Since stronger TCs induce more mixing, the changes in ocean stratification become more important as WPi increases, and have less impact for weaker TCs. They range from a change in DI of 20.01 (WPi1) to 20.06 (WPi4) (20.1 (WPi5)) for the Clear-River compared to the No-River experiment and from 10.01 (WPi1) to 10.08 (WPi4) (10.10 (WPi5)), when comparing the Colored-River experiment to the Clear-River experiment. The small Net change is 10.0 (WPi1) to 10.02 WPi4 (10.02 (WPi5)). Note that WPi5 TCs are not likely to occur in the plume region and the value is therefore hypothetical, but is given in brackets for reference. The changes in intensity (DI) can also be expressed in terms of the minimum cyclone pressure (MCP) using equation 1. MPI depends on the atmospheric conditions and large-scale prestorm SSTs. Emanuel  32.6 6 1.0 34.5 6 1.0 31.9 6 1.1 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 [1987] finds that under typical conditions the MPI at 29 C SST is about 891 hPa. The atmospheric pressure is assumed to be 1015 hPa. Figure 12 shows the difference in MCP (DMCP5MCP 1 2MCP 2 ) between the experiments as a function of WPi and MPI derived from the respective DIs shown in Figure 11. Less intensity reduction in the Clear-River experiment leads to a reduction in MCP compared to no freshwater (Figure 12a). This reduction increases with WPi, but varies only weakly with MPI. It is small for WPi1 cyclones (21 hPa) and can be up to 210 hPa for WPi4 TCs (212 hPa WPi5). The corresponding relative intensity change (DMCP rel 5 DMCP pa2MCPControl ) is even less dependent on MPI and ranges from 1% for WPi1 TCs to 8% for WPi4 (10% WPi5) TCs (not shown). As discussed above, the ocean color effect opposes the freshwater effect, the consequence being an increase in MCP (Figure 12b). Note that the SST increase in the Colored-River experiment is considered by assuming a larger MPI Color (10.6 hPa). The MCP increase overpowers the decrease seen previously and ranges from 12 hPa (22%) for weak storms to 113 hPa (211%) (116 hPa WPi5) for strong storms. As a consequence the Net effect of the colored plume is negligible for weak TCs, but can mean a reduction of TC intensity by up to 13.6 hPa (24%) for WPi4 TCs (14.4 hPa WPi5) ( Figure 12c). The above results have been obtained assuming an ambient pressure of 1015 hPa. From the CFSR data it can be seen, that the mean sea level pressure over the WTNA varies between about 1012 hPa and 1018 hPa (not shown). Applying a different ambient pressure slightly shifts the results in the sense, that a lower ambient pressure (1012 hPa) leads to an about 20.4 hPa larger impact on WPi4 TCs in the Clear-River and Colored-River experiments, while a higher ambient pressure (1018 hPa) has the opposite effect (not shown). The dimensionless intensity reduction (DI) is here normalized by 2.5 C. In reality this value will vary with environmental factors, such as air humidity [Schade, 2000]. The analysis of Schade [2000] shows that the temperature threshold roughly varies between 1.5 C and 3.5 C for varying ambient relative humidity and SSTs. Applying different thresholds does not change the overall answer, regarding-near cancellation of freshwater and color effects, but the individual values are different (Table 3). A lower threshold (1.5 C) leads to an even larger impact of river-induced changes (up to 212.2 hPa MCP reduction induced by the clear plume). The impact of the clear and colored river plumes is reduced, when assuming that TCs are shut down at a surface cooling of 3.5 C (up to 25.1 hPa MCP reduction induced by the clear plume). The above calculations on TC intensity were for steady state TCs. However, TCs passing over the plume are within the tropical North Atlantic main development region, frequently affected by developing storms Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 [Goldenberg et al., 2001]. Mei et al. [2012] find that on average, storm intensification rates decrease almost linearly with the magnitude of surface cooling. TCs experiencing up to 21 C cooling intensify, while any stronger cooling initiates the cyclones' decay. Note that this deintensification is very different from the DI discussed above, DI being the relative deviation of a TC from its maximum sustainable intensity. Although the cooling definitions may be different, Vincent et al. [2014] suggest that the eye-cooling of Vincent et al. [2012a] can be considered to be half the surface cooling of Mei et al. [2012]. Under this assumption a WPi4 TC would experience surface cooling of at least 21.0 C in the No-River, only 20.7 C in the Clear-River and 21.1 C in the Colored-River experiment (Figure 11a). This corresponds to intensification rates of about 0.48 m/s/6 h (No-River), 0.68 m/s/6 h (Clear-River) and 0.45 m/s/6 h (Colored-River) as seen in Figure 11b. Hence the Clear-River potentially increases intensification rates by about 42% for WPi4 hurricanes, while light attenuation chancels this effect by reducing the intensification rates by 234%. This in turn results in a negligible net-impact (26%). Again, the impact of ocean stratification increases with wind power from WPi1 to WPi4 TCs: 10.02 to 10.20 m/s/6 h for the Clear-River effect, 20.03 to 20.23 m/s/6 h for the color effect and from 20.01 to 20.03 m/s/6 h for the net effect (Colored-River). Light attenuation effects on TC intensification rates in the Colored-River plume might therefore be of similar size, but opposite sign to Clear-River effects.\non the other hand is likely to modify atmospheric temperatures and circulation [Shell et al., 2003;Gnanadesikan et al., 2010]. Our study focuses on the oceanic part of TC intensity control and does not include any atmospheric feedbacks. Although the low-salinity plume enhances the BL and therefore reduces entrainment of cold water into the ML, we do not find the proposed warming of SSTs [Pailler et al., 1999;Ffield, 2007;Foltz and McPhaden, 2009] in the Clear-River experiment. That agrees with Masson and Delecluse [2001] and Balaguru et al. [2012b] who also found that the Amazon-induced BL thickening is not able to produce a significant change in SST. Vialard and Delecluse [1998] show that the BL in the western Pacific fresh pool can even lead to surface cooling. Similarly, Howden and Murtugudde [2001] saw a slight surface cooling (20.1 C) in the Bay of Bengal caused by rivers and White and Toumi [2014] report that the Congo plume has no effect on SSTs. Vinayachandran et al. [2012] and Seo et al. [2009] on the other hand report a slight warming (10.1 C) of the Bay of Bengal associated with freshwater discharge, and Park et al. [2011] model a warming in the South China Seas due to the Changjiang. However, none of the modeled SST modulations seem sufficient to assign observed temperature anomalies of up to 4 C [Ffield, 2007] in the Amazon plume to river-induced BL formation. Note however, that this only applies to the Amazon and Orinoco induced part of the BL. The total effect of the BL in the WTNA (created by rivers, rain and subduction) on surface temperatures might well be different. In contrast, the effect of more realistic light attenuation in the Colored-River experiment tends to warm the ocean surface. In our model any contribution of the Amazon and Orinoco to the western hemisphere warm pool will be through light attenuation rather than river-induced BL heating. Murtugudde et al. [2002] and Frouin et al. [2007] modeled an annual mean SST increase of up to 10.2 C and 10.8 C respectively in the Amazon and Orinoco plume area when accounting for chlorophyll absorption. This is similar to the SST increase in our study. Subsurface cooling due to modified light absorption in model studies has been previously reported [Lin et al., 2008;Gnanadesikan and Anderson, 2009]. The surface cooling in the upwelling regions near the coast is a result of cooled subsurface waters reaching the ocean surface and canceling the effect of surface heating [Lin et al., 2008;Ma et al., 2012]. The same effect explains surface cooling in winter when the thermocline deepens and the cooled subsurface waters reach the ML. Note that subsurface cooling overwhelms river-induced barrier layer heating. Therefore the absolute effect of the colored plume is to reduce the upper ocean heat content and temperature, while stability is increased. The ML temperature modulations in the Clear-River and Colored-River experiments can be understood using simple considerations. As Vialard and Delecluse [1998] pointed out, the warming effect of decoupling the ML from the deep ocean is competing with cooling due to solar penetration. As the ML shallows, more radiative flux leaves at its base. Neglecting any horizontal or vertical heat fluxes, the temperature tendency of the ML can be calculated from outgoing and incoming surface fluxes: where q o is the density (1025 kg/m 3 ), C p the heat capacity (3985 J/kgK) of sea water, and f(ML) is the fraction of solar radiation leaving the ML base. The ML is 19.5 m in the No-River and 17.7 m in the Clear-River case. This corresponds to 82.1% and 80.4% solar light being absorbed in the ML for Jerlov [1976] waters of type I. The annual mean solar flux (Q s ) is constant in both experiments (242 W/m 2 ). The mean latent, longwave, and sensible heat fluxes (Q n ) are directed upward and are almost the same in both experiments. The resulting temperature tendency is 20.21 C/month more cooling in the Clear-River experiment, which offsets ML heating by reduced entrainment. In the Colored-River experiment, 92% solar radiation are absorbed in the ML, and only 9% penetrate below. The surface warming is smaller than the subsurface cooling, leading to a significant decrease of the upper-ocean heat content. Neglecting changes in horizontal and vertical advection, this heat must leave the ocean in the form of enhanced surface fluxes. Indeed the latent and sensible heat losses are 23.4 W/m 2 and 20.8 W/m 2 larger. The magnitude of BL thickening and ML shallowing due to the Amazon and Orinoco is in good agreement with Balaguru et al. [2012b]. Masson and Delecluse [2001] also found local heating of the BL due to the Amazon and here we show that it is widespread. The seasonal cycle and magnitude of temperature inversions agrees well with Mignot et al. [2007] and de Boyer Mont egut et al. [2007], who observed temperature Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 inversions of up to 0.6 C in the plume area. The widespread (but small) subthermocline cooling due to BLs we find here has previously not been reported. Earlier studies also found a shallowing of the thermocline when applying more realistic light absorption profiles. Murtugudde et al. [2002] showed local shoaling of the thermocline by up to 18 m in the Amazon plume area, which is in agreement with our findings. Similarly, Sweeney et al. [2005] find that a 10-18% increase in the 1% light level increases the thermocline depth by 3-20 m in tropical regions. The freshwater plume does not significantly change TCHP, while CI increases due to higher stability. This confirms that TCHP is not a good proxy for surface cooling where salinity dominates stratification [Vincent et al., 2012b;Neetu et al., 2012]. Idealized calculations show that CI changes in the Clear-River experiment are mainly driven by enhanced stratification (91%). River-induced BL heating is therefore unlikely to have a large impact on SST feedbacks. Neetu et al. [2012] observe a reduction of 18.4/13.6 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 in CI for a surface freshening of 22.2/21.5 PSU in the northeastern Bay of Bengal/East Indian Coast. In the June-November plume area (marked by 35 PSU), we model a similar salinity reduction of 21.8 PSU, corresponding to 14.3 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 higher CI. According to Vincent et al. [2012b], the impact of stratification on surface cooling is relatively small for CIs exceeding 30 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , and more important for low CIs. The mean CI in the hurricane season can be up to 45 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 in the western Caribbean (Figures 5b and 5c), suggesting a small effect of the freshwater plume. However, CI is for example lower near the upwelling regions in the southern Caribbean and in the eastern WTNA, potentially creating a larger impact of river-induced changes. Jourdain et al. [2012] find that cyclonic rainfall can also reduce SST feedbacks since it increases ocean stability. However, they conclude that this effect is weak in the Bay of Bengal, due to the local BL. Similarly cyclonic rain effects may be negligible in the Amazon and Orinoco plume, where surface freshwater and subsurface salinity maxima enhance ocean stability. It has been implicitly assumed in this analysis, that ocean color and freshwater effects are independent. However, ocean color may influence plume dynamics and thus alter the freshwater effect. Similarly the dispersal of freshwater into the WTNA may affect ocean color. Note that the changes in plume size and surface salinity in the Colored-River experiment are marginal. Furthermore, combining the individual freshwater and color effects almost reproduces the results of the net colored river impact (see Table 1). This suggests that such nonlinearities in the ocean response may be small compared to the overall effect. We find that the impact of ocean stratification on cyclones increases with the TC strength itself. This is in agreement with Vincent et al. [2014], and can be explained by stronger TCs inducing more cooling. Note also, that slower TCs will induce more mixing and also experience more of their own surface cooling [Mei et al., 2012]. They will therefore be weakened to a larger degree. This effect is included in WPi, which is a measure of cyclone winds, translation speed and size. Are our findings consistent with other studies of the impact of barrier layers on tropical cyclone intensity? Ffield [2007] observed that 68% of all WTNA category 5 TCs pass over the plume area and thus suggest circumstantial evidence of a relationship, assuming that the plume is responsible for warm SST anomalies. Vizy and Cook [2010] demonstrate that the warm anomalies enhance the number of TCs by 60%. However, neither study provides direct evidence that the rivers are causing the warm anomalies. As discussed above, in this and other explicit river sensitivity studies [e.g., Masson and Delecluse, 2001;Balaguru et al., 2012b] the Amazon and Orinoco plume does not increase SSTs substantially. There may therefore be a connection between the more intense TCs passing over the warm pool region, but the role of the colored river plume may only be marginal. Balaguru et al. [2012a] compared global intensification rates in barrier layer and nonbarrier layer regions and conclude that the overall effect of BLs is to increase TC intensification rates by 50%. Neetu et al. [2012] observe and model reduced average SST cooling in the presence of barrier layers in the Bay of Bengal.  also showed reduced cooling in the Amazon and Orinoco plume in the wake of Hurricane Katia. None of these three, or other studies distinguish between turbid and nonturbid regions. Unlike presented here, possible effects of ocean/river color and barrier layers have not been separated. Another reason our finding may appear different to BL intensification arguments is that we only consider the river induced part of the BL. The barrier layer in the WTNA is however formed by river and rain freshening [Foltz et al., 2004], and subduction of high salinity waters [Blanke et al., 2002;Balaguru et al., 2012a]. We estimate that salinity stratification in the WTNA increases CI by about 8.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 , of which only about a quarter are caused by the Amazon and Orinoco plume. The near-cancellation of freshwater and Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 color effects on TC-intensity only refers to river-induced changes, but in any case the ocean color will reduce TC intensification. Gnanadesikan et al. [2010] report that the presence of light absorbing material causes Pacific TCs to propagate to higher latitudes. Their focus is on the frequency of TCs, but they also suggest that the intensity of typhoons may be increased. This appears to contradict our findings. However, their Genesis Potential Intensity index does not consider changes in subsurface temperatures and thermocline depths. Applying a downscaling approach Emanuel [2006] has shown, that a 10% increase in thermocline depth results in 4% more intense TCs. The thermocline depth in our study even decreases by 30%. Gnanadesikan et al. [2010] consider feedbacks of SST changes to the atmosphere like a strengthening of the Hadley circulation, while our study focuses on the oceanic feedback part. It may thus be possible to reconcile both studies, recognizing that the impact of light absorption is likely to be a complex combination of changing track, frequency and intensity. To account for a more realistic heat transfer into the upper ocean we have used a recently developed light attenuation algorithm [Lee et al., 2005]. The advantage of it being, that it considers all light absorbing particles, rather than just chlorophyll. However, only backscattering and absorption coefficients at 490 nm are used in this approach. Lee et al. [2005] argue that in terms of solar heating, positive and negative deviations from the 490 nm properties cancel on average. Light attenuation is solely derived from surface values, subsurface properties are inherently prescribed. This may turn out to be problematic when applied below the well mixed surface layer [Lee et al., 2005]. However, there is no satellite product which would reveal the subsurface distribution of light absorbing substances to this date. While CDOM commonly has terrestrial sources (eg. Del Vecchio and Subramaniam [2004], chlorophyll in the WTNA should not solely be assigned to the Amazon and Orinoco. Eddy, wind-driven or equatorial upwelling can also act as nutrient sources and therefore support primary production [Pennington et al., 2006], as do the upwelling regions along the Caribbean coastline [Hu et al., 2004]. Del Vecchio and Subramaniam [2004] find that chlorophyll abundance is the dominant contributor to light absorption outside the plume. The ocean color effect should rather be seen as the combined effect of all particle and nutrient sources in the WTNA. However, Hu et al. [2004] find a negative correlation between chlorophyll concentration and surface salinity in the main plume season and measurements of Subramaniam et al. [2007] suggest that light absorption is significantly enhanced in low salinity regimes. This suggests that the bulk of ocean color in the plume area can be traced back to the freshwater discharge.\nUsing simple relations between CI and TC intensity, we find that the potential impact of the Clear-River on steady state TCs ranges from about 21 hPa (weak TCs) to 25 to 2 12 hPa (strongest TCs occurring in the area). Light attenuation opposes this effect and is slightly larger in magnitude (16 to 116 hPa weakening for strong TCs). That leaves a small range of net Colored-River impact from 11.6 to 13.5 hPa for the strongest TCs. Stronger storms are more affected by the changes in ocean stratification since they induce more mixing [Vincent et al., 2014]. Results are similar for developing storms with 2% (weak TCs) to 42% (strongest TCs occurring over the plume area) higher intensification rates induced by the clear river. This is similar to the 50% increase in the presence of BLs found by Balaguru et al. [2012a] on the basis of a global analysis. Light attenuation on the contrary slows down intensification rates by a similar amount. The cancellation of freshwater and ocean color effects is based on a multiannual mean in the area and season relevant for TC development. The balance of the two mechanisms however, is complex and varies in time and space. The plume size for example has a large interannual variability, depending on precipitation, discharge, surface winds and ocean currents [Grodsky et al., 2014]. Chlorophyll concentrations vary with the euphotic zone depth, the amount of sunlight, and nutrient abundance. Therefore certain cyclones could be intensified or deintensified depending on the season and the oceanic conditions on their exact path. This will be different for each cyclone. The small net effect of the colored river plume is a specific characteristic of this region. Results may be different for other river plumes. In BL regions of low chlorophyll concentration, the net effect will still be an intensification of TCs as found in Balaguru et al. [2012a]. Furthermore BLinduced TC intensification can be caused by river and precipitation freshening, and subduction of low salinity waters. The overall effect of the total BL (river, rain and subduction induced) in the WTNA is therefore likely to dominate the color effect, even though the river-induced components cancel each other. The effect of light attenuation is likely to reduce TC intensification not only in river plumes, but in all areas with high surface chlorophyll concentration like the northern and south-eastern Indian Ocean or the tropical East Pacific. To show the effect of ocean color on TC intensity in observations, a study similar to Balaguru et al. [2012a], comparing TC intensification in color-affected and clear regions, could prove to be useful in the future."}, {"section_title": "Validation of the Clear-River Experiment", "text": "The seasonal cycle of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in model and observations is shown in Figure 3. Modeled mean SSTs are high in summer and autumn and lower in winter and spring. Generally SSTs are higher in the southern part of the model domain and colder in the north, the difference being about 2-3 C. This feature is part of the tropical western hemisphere warm pool, usually defined by temperatures above 28.5 C [Wang and Enfield, 2001]. Satellite observed SSTs (Figure 3b) are produced daily by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) at the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) using optimal interpolation from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) Pathfinder Version 5 data [Reynolds et al., 2007]. SSTs in ROMS are slightly too high compared to satellite observations in all seasons, the mean bias being 0.5 C. The bias is largest (up to 1 C) close to the South American coastline, within the North Brazil current. Since we examine the difference between two ROMS simulations we don't expect this to affect our overall results. The location and seasonal variation of the warm pool are represented well in the model. The modeled freshwater plume extent (as defined by the 35 PSU salinity contour) is also shown in Figure  3a. The plume is small in winter and starts spreading out into the tropical North Atlantic in spring, extending to 15 N. Following the peak of freshwater discharge in May, the plume grows and extends from the coast to 18 N, spanning from 65 to 42 W in summer. It peaks in August, covering an area of 2.8 3 10 6 km 2 . The Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans plume is still large in autumn, but starts to slowly diminish until it reaches a minimum in winter. Satellite observed surface salinity for 2012 from Aquarius (Level 3, V2.0) [Lagerloef, 2012] shows a similar extent and seasonal cycle as the model (Figure 3b). The modeled plume is slightly larger in the simulation in summer and autumn. Note that the Aquarius data are only for 1 year, but the interannual variability of the plume size can be very large [Grodsky et al., 2014]. The area mean seasonal cycle of salinity and temperature profiles and corresponding thermocline and ML depths in model and observations are shown in Figure 4. Observational profiles are from Argo floats. In our model domain 6396 temperature and 2219 salinity profiles have been available. The model captures the characteristic of the temperature profile fairly well. Throughout all seasons the mixed layer temperature is overestimated by about 0.5 C, in accordance with the SST bias. The temperature gradient below the thermocline is slightly larger in the model. The model underestimates ML salinity by 0.1 PSU to 0.3 PSU, and the salinity gradient is stronger compared to the Argo data. The thermocline is deepest in winter (265 m) and shallower in spring (252 m), summer (240 m) and autumn (242 m). Compared to observations it is too deep in the simulation by up about 8 m in winter, spring and summer and by about 5 m in autumn. The seasonal variation of the ML is smaller and it is about 18 m in each season. The modeled ML depth in winter is almost 20 m too shallow, resulting in a substantial overestimation of BL thickness in that season. This might be related to the CFSR precipitation being almost 50% too large in winter, compared to TRMM (tropical rainfall measuring mission) data (not shown). However, the model ML is only about 8 m too shallow and Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "The Freshwater Effect of the Amazon and Orinoco", "text": "In the following we compare ocean temperatures and stratification in the Clear-River experiment to the No-River experiment. Annual mean changes of relevant parameters and their standard deviations are given in Table 1. As expected, surface salinity in the Clear-River case decreases significantly ( Figure 6a). The plume spans almost across the entire model domain throughout the whole year. The annual mean reduction is 21.2 PSU and is maximum in summer. The signal is consistently large near the river outlets (more than 25 PSU), particularly in their respective high discharge seasons ( Figure 1). Away from the mouths, the lowsalinity signature is strongest north of the Amazon delta in spring and summer (up to 23.5 PSU). Salinity is significantly lower in the Caribbean in summer and autumn (22 PSU) and a large amount of freshwater is transported east by the North Brazil counter current. Note that the 35 PSU salinity criterion in Figure 3 did not show a widespread freshwater plume in winter and spring. However, this comparison suggests that the river impact on surface salinity is still important in those seasons. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "The Ocean Color Effect", "text": "In the Colored-River experiment we consider light absorption in addition to the freshwater effect. The analysis is based on the differences between the Clear-River and the Colored-River experiment, and therefore only shows the changes induced by ocean color. Applying realistic light attenuation in the WTNA changes the temperature profile substantially (Figure 7). The mean June-November surface temperature is about 0.1 C warmer. However, the modified light attenuation induces subsurface cooling, which significantly exceeds surface heating. The maximum mean cooling (20.6 C) occurs at about 50 m. SSTs increase from spring to autumn, except in the upwelling regions near the coasts (Figure 8a). Although this warming signal seems widespread and is consistent throughout the 10 simulated years (not shown), it is only significant in a rather small patch of the core plume area (up to 10.4 C). The area mean SST warming in summer is about 10.2 C. SSTs tend to slightly decrease in winter, when the thermocline deepens, leaving an annual mean warming of only about 10.1 C. The 100 m mean temperature on the other hand decreases, due to extensive subsurface cooling (Figure 8b). The annual mean is reduced by about 20.3 C. The temperature reduction is largest in autumn in terms of magnitude and spatial extent, frequently exceeding 20.5 C. The cooling is also prominent in summer and winter, but is hardly significant in spring. The average ML depth changes only slightly in the Colored-River experiment, but the thermocline shallows significantly throughout the whole year as a consequence of the colder ocean (about 28 m). The change is maximum from spring to autumn (about 210 m) and lower in winter (about 25 m), locally exceeding 220 m (not shown) and leading to slightly better agreement with Argo profiles. The uplift of the thermocline implies shallowing of the BL by an equal amount. Subsurface cooling halves the occurrence of temperature inversion. They are present in 17% of all days and places in the Colored-River experiment, compared to 31% percent in the Clear-River experiment. TIs are particularly reduced in summer and autumn, but are still a prominent feature in winter (not shown). The subsurface cooling naturally induces a reduction in TCHP (26.6 kJ/cm 2 or 15%). The seasonal cycle and spatial extent of TCHP reduction is very similar to 100 m mean temperature change (Figure 8c). TCHP decreases significantly in summer, within and east of the Caribbean, with local reductions of up to 220 kJ/ cm 2 . The decrease is even more prominent in autumn, with significant TCHP reductions across the whole plume area, frequently exceeding 220 kJ/cm 2 . The largest decrease is found in the Caribbean. As the subsurface cooling is less distinct in winter and spring, the TCHP change is smaller in winter and hardly significant in spring. Subsurface cooling and the reduction in TCHP are also reflected in a significant CI decrease (22.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 ). Colder water is at shallower depths and can more easily be mixed to the surface by passing storms. The Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2014JC010533 regional distribution and annual variation of the CI reduction (Figure 8d) largely reflects the changes in TCHP and 100 m mean temperature. However, in winter there is significant TCHP decrease in, and east of the Caribbean, which is not the case for CI. The reduction in CI is most prominent in the North Atlantic hurricane season, when the freshwater plume is at its maximum. It stretches almost across the whole model domain and can be up to 28 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 . Note that the subsurface cooling increases stratification and might hence contribute positively to a change in CI. We can estimate that effect by calculating CI for equal mixing depth, i.e., neglecting the fact that the water column does not need to be mixed as deeply. That leads to only 10.1 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 larger CI in the Colored-River experiment, compared to the Clear-River experiment, and is thus negligible.

TC tracks and intensities have been obtained from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [Knapp et al., 2010]. Between 1960 and 2013, about 300 TCs crossed the model domain ( Figure  10), of which about 130 reached major hurricane strength at some point in their life cycle (at least category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale). However, the Wind Power index (WPi) contains more information about SST cooling, than the hurricane category. Furthermore only WPi while crossing the plume area should be considered, since this is where river-induced changes can affect TC intensity. About 52 storms had already reached hurricane strength when passing through the model domain. From the TC data, the translation speed and maximum sustained wind speed can be obtained, and the corresponding WPi can be estimated from Vincent et al. [2012b, Figure 4b]. According to this estimate, at least 30 hurricanes between 1960 and 2012 were of WPi 5 3 (WPi3), of which about 19 reached WPi4. None of the observed TCs were of WPi5, while crossing the model domain. It can be seen from Figure 10a that most TCs will not actually pass the core plume area, but stay north of 10 N. We therefore concentrate on the mean values north of 10 N (TC-box) in the following. Furthermore, we will only consider June-November, this being the North Atlantic hurricane season. Vincent et al.

This would act to further reduce the modest mean SST warming in a coupled environment.

We concentrated on two aspects of the rivers' influence on the ocean. One is the stabilizing effect of the river freshwater, the other is light absorption by ocean color. Within the Amazon and Orinoco plume, the two mechanisms have opposing and effective canceling effects on TCs. On the one hand, SST feedbacks are likely to increase due to vertical stabilization. On the other hand, this effect is outweighed by subsurface cooling as a consequence of light attenuation, leading to a near-cancellation of the colored river effects on TC intensity. The freshwater shallows the ML and stabilizes the water column. Isolating the surface from entrainment cooling does not change SSTs in the model, since the warming effect is canceled by solar penetration [Vialard and Delecluse, 1998]. Reduced surface cooling on other hand, leads to modest BL warming (10.08 C). This heating does not significantly increase the heat available for TC development. However, the stable low-salinity plume inhibits vertical mixing by TCs and may therefore reduce SST feedbacks. CI is 12.2 (J/m 2 ) 1 3 higher in the presence of a plume. As this mechanism is not represented in TCHP, CI appears to be the better TC metric in the Amazon and Orinoco plume region. Freshwater induced changes in TC intensity are likely to be caused by increased stability, rather then modified temperatures. Considering ocean color in addition to freshwater changes the ocean state considerably. While the sea surface is only slightly warmer (10.1 C), the 100 m mean temperature is 20.3 C lower. This is likely to increase the surface cooling magnitude induced by TCs.
