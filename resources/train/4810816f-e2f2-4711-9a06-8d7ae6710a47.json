[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the past several decades, there have been pronounced structural changes in the U.S. farm sectorwith production shifting steadily to larger operations. Between 1982 and 2007, the midpoint farm sizethe size at which half of all land is on bigger farms and half is on smaller farmsalmost doubled from 589 to 1105 acres (MacDonald et al., 2013). At the same time, the midpoint acreage more than doubled in each of the five major field crops: corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Additionally, the share of output from farms with sales of at least $1 million increased from less than 30% in 1987 to over 60% in 2007 (Sumner, 2014). The shift in production to large farms has raised questions about the economic viability of small and mid-sized producers, and the rural communities that depend on these farm households. These and other concerns have helped spur Federal efforts to target resources toward smaller-scale operations through loan, risk management, marketing, and educational programs (USDA, 2017). The extent to which farming is characterized by economies of sizethat is, how much average unit costs decrease as farm size increasesis likely to influence the rate and extent of future consolidation. 1 The first objective of this study is to estimate the total factor productivity (TFP) and unit costs of crop farms of different sizes to understand how productivity and costs vary. This analysis focuses on operations located in the U.S. Heartland (Corn Belt) region that specialize in major field crops. To gain further insight into the long-run economic viability of small farms, the study also estimates how productivity has changed over time for crop farms of different sizes. It is possible that some recent technological advances (e.g., very large combine harvesters, precision agriculture technologies, improved seed varieties) have raised the productivity of larger operations more than smaller operations. This has implications for whether small farms can persist as viable economic units. Economies of size give large-scale operations a competitive advantageallowing production at a lower unit cost. If new technological advances favor larger operations, economies of size will increase over time and likely hasten the demise of small family farms. On the other hand, if small farms can increase productivity at a faster rate than large farms, it may be possible to reduce smaller farms' competitive disadvantage and potentially slow or even reverse the consolidation of production. This study is the first to inform this issue by estimating long-run trends in productivity for crop farms of different sizes. The second objective of this study is to estimate how much of the past aggregate productivity growth can be attributed to structural change (changes in the farm size distribution) versus other factors, including technological change. The recent consolidation of agricultural production has coincided with substantial growth in agricultural productivity: between 1982 and 2012, aggregate TFP increased by 46%an average annual growth rate of about 1.3% (ERS-USDA (2017)). In explaining the drivers of this productivity growth, most research has focused on technical progress and the role of research and development in promoting technological advances (e.g., Wang et al., 2015;Alston et al., 2010). Little research has examined the contribution of structural change to aggregate productivity growth. If large farms are more productive than smaller farms, as we find in this study, the widespread shift in production towards larger farms could explain a portion of the aggregate productivity growth observed over the past several decades (Huffman and Evenson, 2001). Additionally, understanding the extent to which structural change has explained past productivity growth can shed light on future productivity potential. If the scope for further consolidation of production is now less that it was in the pastbecause most output is now produced by large farmsthen aggregate TFP growth will likely slow in the years ahead unless the rate of technological progress increases. The third objective of this study is to better understand the relationship between farm size and aggregate productivity growth. The paper develops a new method for estimating aggregate agricultural productivity growth based on the share of production of farms in different size categories, shifts in the distribution of production across farms of different sizes, and changes in the productivity of different sized operations. This allows us to estimate how targeted policies that raise the productivity of farms of a particular size would affect aggregate TFP growth. Results show that targeting small operations would result in much less aggregate productivity growth than similar policies targeting larger operations, mainly because larger farms had higher average sales shares. However, the relative cost-effectiveness of targeted policies, in terms of raising aggregate productivity growth, depends on whether the policy costs are proportional to farm output or the number of farms targeted."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Empirical framework", "text": "There are two main approaches that can be used to compare the productivity change over time of farms of a similar size. If panel data were available, one approach is to assign farms to time-invariant size categoriesfor example, according to a farm's initial size. Calculating TFP change for each farm would allow for a straightforward comparison of average productivity change across farm size categories. If stochastic production function or data envelope analyses were performed, it would be possible to disaggregate TFP change for each size category into technical change, and technical and scale efficiency change (F\u00e4re et al., 1994;Orea, 2002). This approach has significant shortcomings if a substantial portion of farms transition between size categories over the study period: e.g., some small farms become large and some large become small. Using a sales-based farm size measure, Burns and Kuhns (2016) showed that over five years about 42% of midsize farms transitioned into either small or large farms. They also report five-year transition rates for small and large farms ranging between 21% and 33%. When farm size is fluid, as is likely the case over long periods of time, placing farms in timeinvariant categories does not permit a valid comparison of the productivity growth of similarly-sized operations. Another drawback of this approach, because it relies on panel data, is the potential for sample attrition bias. U.S. crop farms are characterized by five-year attrition rates of about 35-50%, depending on the size of the operation, crop specialization, and operator's age, among other factors (Key and Roberts, 2006). 2 Hence, only a fraction of farms would continue to be observed over a long period, such as the 30-year span considered in this analysis. The farms that remain in business over a long period would likely be very different from the population as a wholeand would have different levels of productivity. Hence, assertions about the population as whole from a sample of surviving farms could suffer from sample attrition bias unless this can be adequately addressed by the empirical model. The second main approach for making productivity growth comparisons across farm size is to categorize observations by size in each year. This cohort approach can use repeated cross-section or panel data to estimate changes in productivity by farm size groups (Morrison Paul et al., 2004). If the surveys are representative in each period, this approach is not vulnerable to sample attrition bias. The drawback to this cohort approach is that the farm size categories are fixed, so estimates of scale efficiency change for the farms in each size category will be close to zero (except, perhaps, for the largest farm size category, which typically is unbounded from above). Hence, this approach mostly ignores an important source of aggregate productivity growth: economies of size resulting from a shift in the farm size distribution. To illustrate the limitation of the cohort approach consider a simple example where there are two farm size categories, small and large, and size economies such that small farms have a TFP index value of 1 and large farms have a TFP of 2. Also assume for simplicity that there is no technical change over the study period, but there is a shift in production from small to large farms. If initially 50% of output is produced by each type of farm, then aggregate TFP in the first period is 1.5 (=0.50 \u2022 1 + 0.50 \u2022 2). If production shifts so that in the second period small farms produce 25% of output and large farms produce 75%, then aggregate productivity increases to 1.75 (=0.25 \u2022 1 + 0.75 \u2022 2). Because there was no technical change, a cohort analysis that compared the productivity change of farms of the same size would estimate zero productivity growth for small and large farms, even though aggregate productivity increased substantially. Hence simply comparing the productivity of farms in the same size category does not reveal the contribution of increasing farm size to aggregate productivity growth. In this study, we develop a framework for estimating the contribution of structural change to aggregate productivity growth using cohort data. Let the aggregate TFP in any period be approximated by the sales-weighted average TFP of S size categories: where \u03b8 s is the share of total sales produced by farms in category s and is the average TFP of farms in category s. It follows that the change in the aggregate TFP between two periods is: where \u0394 indicates the change between periods and the overbar represents the average of the two periods. The first term in parentheses is the contribution to aggregate TFP change from the change in the farm size distribution. The second term in parentheses is the contribution to aggregate TFP from the change in TFP from farms within each size category, where TFP \u03b8 \u0394 \u2022 s s is the contribution from the TFP change of farms in size category s. Note that the change in TFP for each size category, TFP \u0394 s , could be decomposed into changes in scale efficiency, technical efficiency and technical change. However, since the size categories are fixed, scale 2 Attrition rates are high in studies that use Census of Agriculture data in part because farms can only be tracked over time with an operator identification number. When an operator retires from farming and sells his farm business or passes it on to his children the operator ID will often change and this will be recorded as a farm exit. Additionally, the attrition rate is high because farmers who do not respond to the Census will be classified as having exited."}, {"section_title": "N. Key", "text": "Food Policy xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx efficiency change will be negligible, except perhaps for the largest category. To keep the analysis simple, and to focus attention of the importance of changes in the size distribution, we do not disaggregate TFP change for each category. In this study, we measure TFP using a Fisher index. A Fisher TFP index is a measure of outputs produced per unit of inputs, with prices used to weight the outputs and inputs. To compare TFP over time the weights (prices) should remain fixed in an index. The Laspeyres TFP index uses the initial year prices (t = 1) as weights: . The Paasche index uses the final year prices (t = T) as weights: . The Fisher index, is defined as the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes Pt . The Fisher index numerically approximates and has similar theoretical properties to the T\u00f6rnqvist index, but has the advantage over the T\u00f6rnqvist index in this application of being defined for zero-quantities (Diewert, 1978;Dumagan, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Defining farm size", "text": "An important consideration in measuring the relationship between farm size and productivity is how to measure farm size. The quantity produced, or when considering farms that produce more than one output, the value of sales, are commonly used to define farm size and to create farm size categories. However, it has long been recognized that using output or sales to define size may lead to a spurious correlation between farm size and productivity (Stigler, 1946). Correlation results because output, and therefore also sales, varies a lot from year-to-year and across farms due to random weather shocks, pests, etc. A farm having an unusually good (bad) harvest will have unusually high (low) sales and therefore unusually high (low) productivity. Hence sales and productivity may be correlated even if there is no difference in the underlying technology. 3 Because this study focuses on crop farms, harvested acres are used to measure farm size. In contrast to sales, the amount of land farmed does not vary a lot from year-to-year due to random yield shocks (except in extreme cases of crop failure, crop acreage is determined before yields are realized). Because land is an inputand thus inversely correlated to TFPerrors in measuring land could cause a spurious negative correlation between size and productivity (Benjamin, 1995;Carletto et al., 2013). However, in the U.S., crop acreage is generally accurately measured and is well known by the farmer, so measurement error is likely small. 4"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data for study are drawn from the quinquennial Agriculture Censuses conducted from 1982 to 2012. The Census is administered by the USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service with the aim of collecting information from all agricultural operations that produce, or would normally produce and sell, at least $1000 of agricultural products per year. To create a homogeneous sample and to reduce the influence of climate, soil and other regional effects, observations are limited to the \"Heartland\" farm production region. This region is defined by the USDA and consists of a set of contiguous counties, including all of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, and parts of Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Kentucky, and Ohio (Heimlich et al., 2000). The Heartland region contains 22% of all U.S. farms and 27% of cropland and produces 23% of U.S. farm output. To further increase the homogeneity of the sample we only include farms specializing in corn (for grain), wheat, soybeans, sorghum (for grain), barley, and oats. 5 Specialization is defined as having at least 90% of sales and 90% of harvested acres in these crops. This eliminates livestock operations and farms that grow other crops that might have substantially different production technologies. 6 Outputs include the observed quantities produced of the six field crops listed above plus \"other outputs\", which is the residual value of production (total production minus the value of the six major crops). To weight the outputs in the Fisher index we use each crop's average annual price corresponding to the year of the Census . Crop prices are from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics service (NASS). Inputs include land, labor, machinery, and other variable inputs. Land is the reported total acres harvested on the farm. Labor expenses include the costs of hired and contract labor plus the estimated opportunity cost of the operator's labor and other unpaid labor, including family labor. Hired and contract labor expenses are collected by the Census. To estimate the opportunity cost of the operator's labor, we first estimate the number of hours the operator worked on-farm by subtracting the number of days that the operator reported working off-farm from 240 days (full time work). The estimated on-farm work days are then multiplied by a daily wage rate based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey. The Census does not collect information about nonoperator household labor or other unpaid labor so this is estimated using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Using a sample from ARMS with similar characteristics, we regress unpaid labor on operator labor and measures of farm size and then use the estimated parameters to predict unpaid labor for the Census sample (see Appendix A for details). Unpaid labor is valued using the same wage as the operator. 7 Machinery expenses are based on the reported value of owned machinery and equipment used on-farm plus machinery and equipment rental expenses. The Census collects information on equipment rental expenses and the value of machinery used on farm. The value of machinery that is used on-farm is converted to an annual expense rate using a capitalization value of 0.15. Other variable input expenses include the reported amount paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, utilities and seeds. To calculate the Fisher index, input expenses (labor, machinery and other inputs) are converted to a quantity indexes, by dividing by an appropriate input price index. For labor we use the Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey; for machinery, the NASS Prices Paid Index for not included in the analysis because it includes several plant species that are not identified in the Censusmaking it impossible to accurately assign a price. Corn and sorghum that is grown for silage or greenchop are not included among the major outputs because the quantity produced is less accurately measured than when grown for grain. 6 Inconsistent Census data on livestock inputs is another reason livestock producers are not included in the analysis. Several livestock commodities (hogs, poultry, and eggs) are frequently grown under a production contract arrangement in which the contractor provides most of the inputs (e.g., feed and young animals). Since the 2002 Census, expenses paid by the contractor were not accounted for, making it impossible to compare inputs for these products across the study period. 7 On average, unpaid labor represents only 18% of the value of total labor inputs. The main results of the paper are not sensitive to whether unpaid labor is included in total labor."}, {"section_title": "N. Key Food Policy xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx", "text": "Machinery; and for other inputs, the NASS Farm Sector Prices Paid Index. These price indexes, along with a land price (the annualized average value of farm real estate per acre in the Heartland region) are also used for the initial and final year weights in the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes used to compute the Fisher index. In this study, we place farms into five size categories based on number of acres harvested: 0-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-1000, and over 1000 (Table 1). The farms in the sample produce primarily corn and soybeans, with the other crops representing a small fraction of total output. Farms vary widely in size: the average farm in the smallest category harvested 45 acres and had about $14,000 in major crop sales, whereas the average farm in the largest category harvested 1752 acres and had over $814,000 in major crop sales. Corn yields increased monotonically with farm size, with the largest farms producing about 18 percent more per acre than the smallest farms."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends in sales and TFP", "text": "The dramatic change in the farm size distribution between 1982 and 2012 is illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure shows the share of sales for each size category in each Census year, along with a fitted linear trend line. The study period saw production concentrating in the hands of the largest farms. Operations with more than 1000 acres increased their predicted share of total production from 17% in 1982 to 59% in 2012. In contrast, over the same period, the share of total production declined for the four smaller farm size categories. Midsized farms (250-500 acres) experienced the largest decline in market share, with their share falling from about 30% to 10%. Increasing returns to size can be illustrated by plotting the results of a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression of the TFP index on farm size (acres harvested) (Fig. 2). The estimated relationship is graphed for 1982, 1997, and 2007 (1987 and 2002 were excluded for visual clarity). The graph shows data for 2007 rather than 2012 because there was an extreme drought in the Heartland region in 2012, which lowered productivity substantially that year. The figure shows TFP increasing with farm size, over the size range shown (up to 1500 acres). The figure also shows that TFP increased between each of the three Censuses, at all farm sizes. To gain insight into how productivity changed over time by farm size, we first examine trends in corn yields (Fig. 3). Corn is by far the most widely produced crop in the Heartland region, which provides a large sample for comparisons. To account for the fact that 2012 was an exceptional drought year in the Heartland which resulted in unusually low yields, we calculate a linear trend without using the 2012 observations. Between 1982 and 2007, predicted corn yields for the smallest farms increased at an average rate of 1.00 bushels per year. In contrast, for the four largest size categories expected corn yields increased at an average rate of 1.14-1.18 bushels per acre per year. Over 30 years, this amounts to an increased corn yield differential between smallest and the larger farms of 4.2-5.4 bu/ac (as a reference, small farms had predicted yields in 2012 of 137 bu/ac and large farms 159 bu/ac).

Note: The figure shows the results of a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression of a Fisher TFP index on farm size in each year. The Fisher TFP index is a measure of the quantity of output produced relative to the quantity of inputs usedsee text for details. An increase in the TFP index from 1 to 1.5 would imply a 50% increase in total factor productivity. A more complete picture of productivity change can be seen comparing TFP trends from 1982 to 2012 for each farm size category (Fig. 4). As with the corn yields, we account for the drought year by fitting a linear trend to TFP without using the 2012 data. Even more pronounced than with corn yields, the rate of growth in TFP is slower for the smallest size group (estimated TFP changes are reported in the first column of Table 3.) While the predicted TFP for farms in the four largest size categories increased by 47-59% between 1982 and 2012, TFP for the smallest farms increased by only 17%. Hence, the difference in productivity between farms with fewer than 100 acres and all other farms widened between 1982 and 2012. If this trend continues, it suggests that farms in the smallest size category will see a further deterioration in their competitive position and their share of total output will likely continue to shrink. We explore the factors underlying the lagging productivity growth of the smallest farms in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Technology and size economies", "text": "Using information on input expenditures from the Census, we can compare unit costs across farm size categories and over time to gain insight into the factors driving returns to size (Table 2). Unit costs are calculated as the input expenses divided by a Fisher output index. Input expenses for labor, machinery and variable inputs are described in the data section. For land, input expenses are estimated by multiplying harvested acres by an estimated national average rental rate. Consistent with size economies, unit costs declined with farm size. In 2012, small farms (less than 100 acres) spent $2.96 per unit, midsize farms (250-500 acres) $1.72 per unit, and large farms (at least 1000 acres) $1.61 per unit. Over half of the $1.35 unit cost difference between the smallest and largest farms was attributable to labor costs and 27% was due to a capital costscompared to only 8% and 11% for land and variable inputs, respectively. Hence, the available technology allowed large farms to use labor and capital much more cost effectively than small farms; the size advantage was limited for land and variable inputs. The relatively small differences in land productivity across size categories imply small differences in yields (assuming land prices do not vary by size). This is confirmed by the data on corn yields, which show relatively small differences across farm sizes (Fig. 3). What explains the lower unit costs of labor and capital for larger farms? The unit labor cost advantages for larger farms likely stem from characteristics of the farm labor market and the availability of laborsaving technologies. Partly because of transaction costs associated with employing and supervising hired labor, most production in the U.S. occurs on farms that are family-owned and operated (Cochrane, 1993). Labor-saving technologies allow farms with a limited amount of family labor to produce at a larger, more efficient scale. Labor-saving technologies include large tractors, harvesters and other equipment that reduce the amount of labor required per acre. In addition, genetically engineered seeds can allow for fewer applications of herbicides and pesticides, which also reduces unit labor costs (Gardner et al., 2009). Lower capital costs per unit may exist because capital equipment is \"lumpy\" and large pieces of equipment and machinery can be operated more cost effectively on large operations. Moving and setting up large pieces of equipment is costly, and these costs can be minimized when fields are large and contiguousconditions more prevalent on large operations (MacDonald et al., 2013). Larger farms may also be able to use capital more efficiently by reducing the time that costly capital equipment is idle. Large farms are able to more fully employ equipment without having to incur the transactions costs associated with renting in equipment. Small farms could in theory purchase large-scale equipment and rent it out rather than idle it, but there are transactions costs associated with renting out equipment and limits to how many farms can enter the rental market. Consistent with the slower TFP growth rates for the smallest farms that was shown in Fig. 3, the data also show an increasing divergence in unit costs. Between 1982 and 2012, nominal unit costs increased by $0.32-0.39 for farms with more than 100 acres compared to $0.62 for the smallest farms, a difference of $0.23-$0.30 (bottom row, Table 2). 8 This increasing divergence in unit costs was driven by changes in labor and variable input unit costs: the difference between smallest and largest farms increased by $0.13 for unit labor costs and by $0.11 for variable input costs; there was little divergence in machinery or land unit costs (last column, Table 2). The increasing unit cost divergence for the smallest farms suggests that some of the new technologies that were adopted between 1982 and 2012 that allowed farmers to use labor and variable inputs (seed, fertilizer, pesticides, and energy) more efficiently were less well-suited for Note: The figure shows the average corn yields for farms growing corn in each size category in each year and it shows an estimated linear trend, which is estimated without using the 2012 data.

An increase in the TFP index from 1 to 1.5 would imply a 50% increase in total factor productivity. and consequently less likely to be adopted by the smallest operations. New labor and variable input saving technologies include larger combines and harvesters that allow farmers to cultivate more land with the same amount of labor. Other innovations include GPS-equipped precision agriculture technologies that allow farmers to more closely match input applications to the crops' needs, which can reduce the amount of seed, fertilizer and pesticides used. Using information about crop yields, terrain topography, organic matter content, moisture levels, nitrogen levels, etc., on-board computers can operate variable rate controllers on farm equipment to optimize the application of inputs. GPS-guided autopilot systems also allow farmers to reduce skips and overlap when planting and applying agrochemicals, which also reduces variable input costs. The fact that the smallest farms have lagged larger farms in reducing variable input costs is consistent with the lower adoption rates of precision farming technologies by smaller operations that have been reported in other studies (Schimmelpfennig, 2016;Daberkow and McBride, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Size economies and aggregate TFP change", "text": "How much of the past aggregate productivity growth can be attributed to structural change versus size-specific TFP growth? Following (2) we use the estimated average sales share, change in shares, average TFP, and change in TFP for each size category to calculate the aggregate TFP change in percentage terms (baseline scenario, Table 3). To reduce the influence of outlier years, we use the predicted value of the sales shares and TFP levels (that is, the fitted values from the linear trends shown in Figs. 1 and 3). The aggregate TFP of crop farms in the Heartland grew an estimated 63.7% (=52.9 + 10.8) between 1982 and 2012, or 1.5% per year. This estimate is slightly higher than the 1.3% annual growth rate estimated by the USDA for the entire U.S. agricultural sector (ERS-USDA, 2017). Productivity growth for crop farms in the Heartland region may have exceeded the national average in part to the extent that crop production experienced more rapid TFP growth than livestock production. Alternatively, because farmland in the Heartland region is relatively flat and contiguous, farmers could more efficiently use large-scale farm equipment and advanced precision agriculture technologies (MacDonald et al., 2013). We estimate that 17% (=10.8/63.7) of aggregate productivity growth between 1982 and 2012 was attributable to the shift to larger and more productive operations. Put another way, by 2012, total output was 7.1% (=1.637/1.529) greater because of the farm size distributional changes than it would have been with no distributional changes. The remaining 83% (=52.9/63.7) of aggregate TFP growth was due to the increasing TFP of the average farm in each size category. This TFP growth was due to factors other than farm size changeincluding technical change (the adoption of more productive technologies) and technical efficiency change (greater ability to achieve maximum output given a set of inputs and the technology). The magnitude of these other sources of aggregate productivity growth increased steadily with farm size (column 3, Table 3). TFP growth for the smallest farms contributed 0.6 percentage points to aggregate TFP growth whereas TFP growth for the largest farms contributed 22.4 percentage points. The contribution increased with farm size mainly because larger farms had higher average sales shares. For example, farms with less than 100 acres produced only 3% of total output on average from 1982 to 2012, compared to 38% for farms with at least 1000 acres. Consequently, increases in TFP for larger operations resulted in a greater expansion of output and a bigger contribution to aggregate TFP growth."}, {"section_title": "Targeted policies to increase productivity", "text": "If policymakers have the objective of slowing the rate of consolidation of production, one approach would be to devise policies that raise the productivity of smaller farms. Raising the productivity of smaller farms could make them more profitable, presumably causing fewer to exit the industry. Such productivity-enhancing policies might include targeted subsidized loans or tax breaks for purchasing new machinery and equipment, or targeted agricultural extension assistance. A potential drawback with targeting small farms, as opposed to larger farms, is that smaller operations produce relatively little output, so effect of the targeted policy on aggregate productivity growth would be limited. To illustrate how targeted policies differentially affect aggregate productivity depending on the size of the farms targeted, consider the effect of a hypothetical policy that increased the productivity growth of targeted farms by 10 percentage points while having no effect on the farm size distribution. 9 We estimate the effects of the policy in 2012, assuming it had been implemented in 1982. If the smallest farms (less than 100 acres) were targeted, this policy would have increased the TFP of these farms by 26.8% instead of 16.8%, and their average TFP (as a percent of initial total TFP) would have increased from 83.1 to 86.9 (scenario 1: Table 3). The policy would have had two effects on aggregate TFP. First, the contribution to aggregate TFP for the average farm with less than 100 acres would have increased 0.3 percentage points (from 0.6 to 0.9). Second, gains from structural change would have been smaller. As farms left the smallest category, aggregate TFP would have dropped by 3.4 points instead of 3.2 (the increase in TFP from growth in the other size categories would have been the same). In total, aggregate productivity growth would have increased by only 0.2 percentage points. The effect of a similar policy that targets midsized farms (250-500 acres) is shown in scenario 2. The 10 percentage point increase in the productivity growth rate means midsized farms would have contributed 11.8 percentage points to the total aggregate growth (up from 9.9 points). However, because midsized farms were more productive on average over the period, structural change would have contributed a smaller amount to aggregate productivity growth (9.8 points compared to 10.8). In sum aggregate productivity would have increased by only 0.9 percentage points. In comparison, consider a hypothetical policy that raised the productivity growth of the largest farms by 10 percentage points (scenario 3, Table 3). The contribution to aggregate TFP from farms with more than 1000 acres would have increased by 3.8 percentage points (from 22.4 to 26.2). As farms shifted into the largest category between 1982 and 2012, the gains from structural change would have been greater than beforeproductivity would have increased by 72.5 percentage points compared to 69.8 in the baselinean increase of 2.7 points. The net effect would have been an increase in aggregate TFP of 6.5 percentage points. Hence, the policy targeting the largest farms would have increased aggregate TFP 32 times more than a similar policy targeting the smallest farms and 7 times more than the policy targeting midsized farms. The magnitude of the difference in the policy effects between the largest farms and the smaller farms would have been even greater had we considered the effects of the policies on structural change. Targeting the small and midsized farms would have likely slowed the shift in production to larger farms. Since larger farms are more productive, slowing the shift to larger farms would have reduced aggregate productivity growth. In contrast, targeting the largest farms would have increased the rate of consolidation, which would have increased the rate of aggregate productivity growth. The net effect of targeting farms of different sizes on aggregate productivity growth is shown column 1 of Table 4. While the effect on aggregate productivity growth increases with the size of farm targeted, the cost-effectiveness of the targeted policiesdefined in terms of aggregate productivity gains per policy dollardepends on policy costs.

Note: TFP \u0394 s is the change in predicted TFP for farms in size category s between 1982 and 2012, TFP is the predicted initial aggregate TFP for all farms, and TFP s is the average of the 1982 and 2012 predicted TFP for farms in size category s. The bold font indicates the values that are different from the baseline scenario. 9 The evolution of the size distribution would likely change in response to the policy. However, this change is difficult to predict and therefore is not modeled here. We discuss the likely implications of the effect of the policy on the size distribution later in the section. policy costs are roughly proportional to the number of farms targetedwhich might be approximately the case with targeted agricultural extension policiesthen targeting small farms would likely be much less cost-efficient than targeting larger farms. This can be seen in Table 4. Between 1982 and 2012, the smallest farms represented about a third of all crop farms in the Heartland region (column 2), which would make it very costly to provide extension or other similar types of policies to this group. Put another way, targeting the smallest farm category would results in very little increase in aggregate output per farm (column 4). In contrast, the largest farms represented only 9% of all farms over this period, so targeting these farms would have resulted in a large increase in aggregate output per farm. In fact, the aggregate productivity gain per farm share is 70 times greater for the largest farms compared to the smallest farms. On the other hand, if policy costs are roughly proportional to farm outputwhich might be the case with loan or risk management polices then cost-effectiveness is less closely correlated with farm size. 10 As discussed earlier, larger farms produced a greater share of aggregate output between 1982 and 2012 than did smaller farms (column 3). If policy costs are proportional to output, then it would be substantially less costly to target a smaller farm size category. For smaller farm categories, a targeted policy has a smaller effect on aggregate output, but also a lower costso the effect on cost effectiveness is ambiguous. This is shown in column 5: the percentage point increases in total output per sales share for the smallest four farm size categories are roughly the same. The largest farms are roughly two to three times more cost effective than the smaller farmswhich is a much less extreme difference."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study used quinquennial Agricultural Census data collected from 1982 to 2012 to estimate the TFP of five size classes of grainproducing farms in the U.S. Corn Belt. We found strong evidence of economies of size in each Census year. The productivity differences across farm size categories are reflected in substantially higher unit costs of the smallest operations. These findings support the hypothesis that economies of size was a contributing factor behind the consolidation of commodity crop production that occurred in the U.S. over the last 30 years. Findings also indicate that the smallest crop farms (less than 100 harvested acres) fell further behind large farms in terms of productivity in recent decades. Between 1982 and 2012, TFP growth rates were similar across farm size classes except for the smallest, which had a significantly slower growth rate. If past trends continue, this suggests that the productivity disadvantages for smaller operations will persist, and in the case of the smallest farms, will expand. Consistent with slower TFP growth for the smallest farms, the study found that the difference in unit costs between the smallest farms and larger farms increased over the study period. Most of the unit cost divergence can be explained by changes in the unit costs of labor and variable inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and energy). This suggests that some technological advances in recent decades, such as very large combine harvesters and precision agriculture technologies, lowered unit labor and variable input costs less for the smallest farms. Lower adoption rates of precision agricultural technologies on the smallest farms, which have been observed in other studies, might explain why the labor and variable input costs disparities increased, and why the farm productivity growth of the smallest farms has lagged behind that of larger operations. Because of size economies, crop farm consolidation contributed significantly to aggregate agricultural productivity growth in the Corn Belt. Between 1982 and 2012, the share of output produced by crop farms with at least 1000 acres increased from 17% to 59%. Using a new method for disaggregating TFP growth, we estimate that the aggregate TFP of specialized crop farms in the Heartland region increased by 64% or 1.5% per year between 1982 and 2012, and that about one-sixth of this growth was attributable to the shift in production to larger more productive farms. Hence, while technological change and technical efficiency change were the most important sources of aggregate productivity growth in recent decades, the contribution from the farm size distribution change was substantial. The data provide no indication yet of a slowdown in crop consolidation or productivity growth in the Heartland region. However, with most output in the region now produced by large farms, it is plausible that the pace of consolidation will slow in the coming decades. A slowdown in the rate of productivity growth in hog production after 2004 was observed in the U.S. hog sector following a rapid shift in production to very large farmsa size at which returns to scale were close to constant (McBride and Key, 2013). If the rate of consolidation of crop production slows in the coming decades, then aggregate TFP growth rates will likely decline as well, unless the rate of technological progress increases. Finally, this study illustrated some of the tradeoffs associated with productivity growth policies that target farms of a particular size. Policies that raise the productivity of small farms could increase the economic viability of these farms and potentially slow the rate of consolidation. However, the study showed that targeting small farms would result in relatively little in aggregate productivity growth compared to targeting larger farms. For example, a hypothetical productivity-enhancing policy targeting farms with at least 1000 acres of cropland would have increased aggregate productivity 32 times more than a similar policy targeting farms having less than 100 acres and 7 times more than a policy targeting farm having between 250 and 500 Table 4 Aggregate productivity increases from targeted productivity-enhancing policies relative to the farm and sales shares.

Note: The \"percentage point increase in aggregate productivity\" is the estimated additional increase resulting from a policy that increases the productivity growth of targeted farms by 10 percentage points from 1982 to 2012. The table shows the effects of five distinct policies each targeting one of the five farm-size categories (see Table 3 and text for more details). 10 Loan or risk management programs could plausibly have costs that are roughly proportional to output. This would be the case for loan programs if most of the program costs (e.g., default costs) are proportional to the loan amount, and the loan amount is roughly proportional to farm size. This would be the case for risk management programs if the costs (indemnity payments) are proportional to the amount of cropland insured, which in turn is proportional to total output."}, {"section_title": "acres.", "text": "At the same time, the cost effectiveness of targeted policies in terms of aggregate productivity gains per policy dollar depends on the policy costs. If costs are roughly proportional to the number of farms targeted which might be the case with targeted agricultural extension policies then targeting smaller farms would likely be substantially less effi-cient than targeting larger farms (or not targeting at all by farm size). On the other hand, if policy costs are roughly proportional to farm outputwhich might be the case with loan or risk management polices then the efficiency costs of targeting smaller farms would likely be much smaller. Appendix A. Estimating unpaid labor input for Census of Agriculture Before 2012, no questions were asked on the Census of Agriculture about the quantity of non-operator family labor or other unpaid labor that worked on-farm. To address this missing data issue, we estimate the quantity of unpaid farm labor using information from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS is a detailed survey of a representative sample of U.S. farm households conducted annually since 1996 by the USDA Economic Research Service and NASS. The ARMS collects the same information as the Census but also includes more detailed questions about production costs, assets, and off-farm employment. Relevant to this study, the ARMS also asks about the amount of unpaid time the operator's spouse and family and other operators spend working on the farm. This information allows us to predict the quantity of unpaid labor used on farm as a function of highly correlated variables that are observed in the Census: the operators' on-farm labor, and the size of the farm (defined by harvested acres and value of production). To estimate the parameters in the predictive model, we first create an ARMS sample to match the Census sample. We do this by limiting the ARMS sample using the same criteria used in this study: being located in the Heartland region and specializing in production of the major commodity crops (see data section for details). We use ARMS data collected from 1996 to 2012all the survey years available that overlap with the Census data. The matched sample includes 21,912 observations. As expected, the ARMS data reveal that the unpaid farm labor hours increases with farm size and the operator's farm labor (Table A1). On average, operators work on farm about 3.4 times as many hours as unpaid labor, and this ratio decreases with farm size. The data show that the labor productivity of operator and unpaid labor (as measured by value of production per hour) increases dramatically with farm size. We take advantage of the fact that unpaid labor hours is correlated with the operators' hours and with farm size to estimate the quantity of unpaid farm labor. We regress unpaid labor on operator hours, harvested acres, the natural log of harvested acres, value of production, and a time trend. The linear regression model has an R-squared of 0.38 and all the variable coefficients are significant at the 99% level. We use the estimated coefficients with the Census data variables to predict unpaid labor time for each farm in the Census sample. The opportunity cost of unpaid labor is estimated as the predicted quantity of unpaid labor (in days) multiplied by the same daily wage rate used for hired and operator labor (based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Average Hourly Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey). Using the Census data, the productivity of estimated unpaid labor (A Fisher output index divided by unpaid labor days) increases over time because of the negative time trend coefficient and because the positive operator labor coefficientas operator's labor productivity increases, unpaid labor productivity also increases. Because unpaid labor is a small share (18%) of total farm labor (which also includes hired, contract and operator labor), including the unpaid labor estimates has a very small effect on the results presented in the paper."}, {"section_title": "Table A1", "text": "Operator labor and unpaid labor quantities for crop producers in the Heartland.
