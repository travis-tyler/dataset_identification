Over the past decade, violence in America has steadily increased, spreading and penetrating national security which has gradually decreased citizens' confidence in the ability to protect their families and communities. For the first time since the 1970s, the incidence of violent acts against strangers occurs more frequently than violence between individuals who know each other (Hughes and Hasbrouk, 1996). America, the preeminent military power, is at-risk because of the onslaught of violent incidents invading every phase of daily life in urban, suburban, and rural locales (Ceperley and Simon, 1994;Ballard and McCoy, 1996;Hoffman, 1996). Violence and trauma in urban neighborhood communities create destruction at unsafe levels that impact the school learning environment in urban schools. High levels of urban unemployment and poverty have been cited as causes (Kober, 1994;USEd, NCES, Challenge, 1996). Since the late 1980s, trends show that urban patterns of violence and trauma are increasingly being reflected in suburban and rural communities as well; however, less is known about causes (Kadel and Follman, 1993;Haberman, 1994;Larson, 1994;Shanker, 1995;Ballard and McCoy, 1996). In order to know more about school violence, more enlightenment about violence in general is required. Increasingly, schools outside urban areas are no longer the safe havens they once were. Schools throughout America are I 3 2 at-risk of no longer being places where students are free to develop and learn the skills required to become successful, productive, and contributing citizens (Walker and Gresham, 1997). A 1993 National School Boards Association (NSBA) study reported that of 720 school districts, 82 percent reported an increase in violence over the past five years, across all geographic areas (National School Boards Association, 1993). Daily, news media reports support these trends. For example, two widely reported high school shooting incidents, each by a student gunman, occurred during fall of the 1997-98 school year. In early October 1997, a male student at Pearl High School, located in a suburban community outside Jackson, Mississippi, was charged with the shooting deaths of two students and with wounding several more students. Five other Pearl High male students and one male graduate of the school were subsequently charged with conspiracy in connection with the shootings. In early December 1997, a male student at Heath High School, located in rural West Paducah, Kentucky, was charged with firing a stolen semiautomatic pistol into a circle of praying students. This incident was the first shooting ever to occur in the 7,000student McCracken County school district (Jacobson and White, 1997). In late February 1998, two male middle school students in a Maryland suburb were arrested after transporting a homemade bomb on a school bus and planting the bomb in a school locker. The principal discovered the bomb and evacuated the school building before the bomb exploded.  (Schwartz, 1998). Youth violence in school settings appears to be random, spontaneous, and unpredictable. Self-inflicted youth violence is cited among concerns of American Indian youth who see their violent world claiming youth through drug-induced deaths, gang violence, and teen suicides (Crow, 1997). These incidents and concerns present examples of the evidence that increasing violence occurring in communities has not escaped the schools. In the early 1980s, schools failing in their mission to serve the national interest was the educational concern presented in A Nation at Risk released in April 1983(USEd, Risk Report, 1983. This landmark report did not address what has since become a central focus which will define our country's future--violence in the school teaching and learning environment and the resulting impact on student achievement. Few people would challenge the findings of recent school violence reports which declare that America's schools and classrooms have changed dramatically during the past decade because of violence in the school setting. Violence is a serious problem and the heightened awareness of the public's concern about violence in schools has been reflected in several important reports citing school tragedies resulting from incidents of school violence (National School Safety Center, 1993;Applebome, 1994;Johnson and Immerwahr, 1994;Harris, 1995;USEd, NCES, Victimization, 1995;USHHS, CDC, 1995;USEd, Press, 1996;Elam et al., 1994Elam et al., , 1995Elam et al., , 1996Elam et al., , and 1997USEd, NCES, Crime, 1997;USED, NCES, Violence, 1998). Summaries of recent important school violence reports are presented in Appendix A. The magnitude of crime, violence, victimization, and associated disruption in America's schools severely impairs the educational process and the normal psychological development of many students. Because the trauma in the urban community at large is even more prevalent, a cascade of highly disruptive factors negatively impacts students' academic achievement (USEd, Network, 1993). The argument has been made that for children, inner-city experiences, including the school learning environment, can be compared to life in communities at war (Garbarino et al., 1992;Lewis and Fox, 1993;USEd, NCES, Safety, 1996). In some suburban and rural communities, experiences are rapidly becoming equally dangerous (Shanker, 1995;Ballard and McCoy, 1996). One of the most critical problems confronting educators today is the ability to immediately and dramatically improve the academic performance levels of students especially in environments where school violence is prevalent. Data on violence is readily accessible from the constant flow of violence information widely disseminated through media reports, public surveys, electronic information and the research literature (Ascher, 1994;USEd, NCES, Crime, 1997). The challenge for policymakers and practitioners is to interpret the relationship of reported trends to school policy decisions and develop effective practices to curb school violence and increase student learning (Youth Violence Policymakers Guide, 1996). School districts and administrators are responding to school crime and violence by employing measures such as installing metal detectors, hiring and arming security guards, locking and chaining school doors, mandating school uniforms, and conducting random searches of student bookbags and lockers (Flannery, 1997). Some schools have been altered to the extent that they resemble detainment facilities which detracts from the positive learning environment. Several recent reports have suggested that easy availability of guns and weapons to youth gangs has made a profound impact on our society over the last decade creating a perception that violence is a common occurrence in our daily lives (Ceperely and Simon, 1994;Larson, 1994;Weisenburger, et al., 1995;Schwartz, 1996;USEd, NCES, Crime, 1997). The tone of some reports suggests that a large portion of the nation has become desensitized to the extensive and detrimental effects of violence (Norland, 1992;Northwest Regional Laboratory, 1994;Mazen and Hestand, 1996;Edelman, 1994Edelman, , 1995Edelman, , and 1996 . School safety has become a priority for parents, students, teachers, administrators, politicians, and policymakers. One of the National Education Goals for the year 2000 is to create school environments that are free of violence and drugs (USEd, 1993, NCES Goals)."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "The wide attention to youth and school violence issues from a variety of sources indicates the need for effective coordinated responses by local, state, and federal agencies (National School Boards Association, 1993;Moyers, 1995;Edelman, 1994Edelman, , 1995Edelman, , and 1996. Individuals, groups, and community organizations are beginning to work in partnership with schools to develop a number of diverse approaches, model programs, strategies, and initiatives designed to stop youth violence (USEd and DHHS, Together, 1993;Justice, 1994;National Conference Papers, 1994;USGAO, 1995;Leistyna and Sherblom, 1995). Coordinated commitments to prevent the occurrence of violent incidents and to provide intervention strategies, as well as to solve consequences of violent acts, present a synchronized effort leading to maximum success and long-term effectiveness in combating violence throughout communities (McCombs, 1994;USEd, Mercer, 1995) . According to violence-prevention experts, no simple solution exists and ending the youth violence epidemic will not be easy (Kadel and Follman, 1993). Learning cannot take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation (Craig, 1992;USEd, NCES, Goals, 1993;Riley, 1993;Regional Laboratory for Educational Improvement, 1995;Shanker, 1995). A primary goal of today's schools must be to develop strategies and provide resources that will reduce the number and intensity of school violence incidents (Knox, 1997). A. 8"}, {"section_title": "Description of School Violence", "text": "Daily, the nation's schools are becoming more unstable based on increasing numbers of students exhibiting disruptive behavior leading to violent acts in the school setting. Disruptive or externalizing behavior is described as demeanor that is antisocial, defiant, challenging, negatively aggressive, noncomplying, acting-out, etc. The impact of violent acts in schOols extends beyond the typical minor, soon forgotten, incidents expected of most students during their normal course of development. Such disruptive student behavior continues to be one of the most profound issues confronting schools (Bullock et al., 1983;Evans and Evans, 1985;Hranitz and Eddowes, 1990;Kadel and Follman, 1993). A multitude of information is available on the subject of violence and its relationship to every aspect of human existence. Some of the data is focused on the emotional consequences of violence such as victims developing feelings of sorrow, grief, bereavement, shock, denial, protest, anger, depression, despair, revenge, rejection, and fear (Oates, 1988;Reasoner, 1995) . Other information addresses violence issues by suggesting causes are related to physiological and genetic linkages; psychological impacts; sociological conditions; and behavioral patterns (Burrowes et al., 1988;Wallach, 1993;Soriano et al., 1994;Prutzman, 1994). At the national level, plans are being formulated to expend a large portion of tax dollars on comprehensive school reform efforts to improve the nation's delivery system for education and increase student performance (USEd, Comprehensive, 1998). However, schools are not likely to realize optimal success with educational reforms and student learning initiatives until effective school violence prevention and intervention strategies are developed and implemented (Shanker, 1995;Schwartz, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "The early research proposal included a collective review of electronic information, research literature, public opinion polls, and media reports all presenting the national concern that disruptive youth violence in schools negatively impacts the educational process and normal development among students as well as the well-being of educators and other school personnel (Coleman, September 1995). Findingg cited throughout the research literature suggest a relationship between behavior and achievement (Craig, 1992;Kadel and Follman, 1993;Ascher, 1994;Haberman, 1994;Furlong and Morrison, 1994;Harris, 1995;Gilbert, 1996) . We know that school violence is a serious problem that has thrust student learning priorities into the background and school security concerns into the forefront (Schwartz, 1996;Gilbert, 1997) . There is limited research analyzing types of school violence and student achievement in reading and mathematics by school type (public, Catholic, nonsectarian private, and other private religious schools); by location (urban, suburban, and rural communities); and by background characteristics of students. An earlier study analyzed data from the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) to identify dependent 20 9 variables with high zero-order correlations between behaviors and selected independent school variables as predictors of students' problem behaviors (Weishew and Peng, 1993). For this study, data from NELS:88 were analyzed to measure aspects of school violence plus student background variables regressed on consolidated reading and mathematics scores from cognitive tests administered during the NELS:88 study. According to educational information, a student's reading ability is thought to be greatly influenced by factors outside the school setting (Regional Laboratory, 1995). Mathematics achievement is considered to be an indicator of what is learned in school (USEd, NCES, Condition, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of tIle Study", "text": "The purpose of this study was,to analyze the relationship between school violence and student achievement in reading and mathematics among.eighth graders. Students who exhibit disruptive and violent behavior pose a dilemma to the education community. Despite numerous efforts over a number of years, schools have not effectively impacted the educational and life outcomes for these students. The impact of recent reform efforts seems to have been limited and not systemic, pervasive or comprehensive enough to result in wide-scale success necessary for large proportions of students to achieve academically and be internationally competitive (Johnson, 1997). On the plus side, a number of promising violence intervention and prevention efforts have been reported (USGAO, 1995). On the other hand, better measures are needed to identify causal relationships and to suggest additional opportunities for school violence prevention and intervention strategies (USGAO, 1995). There is a dearth of research on the overall effectiveness of violence prevention efforts and the connection to student "}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Study", "text": "The study is significant because: violence is an escalating problem in America; there is a scarcity of research linking school violence issues to students' academic achievement; and most school-based efforts operate under the premise that violence is a learned behavior and therefore, tend to focus on devices for increasing security rather than on appropriate support for the educational needs of students. For the majority of students, the important issue may be less one of violent personal attack and more one of stolen property and threats that color their perceptions and induce anxiety and fear while in school (Hanke, 1996). However, witnessing acts of violence, in addition to being personally victimized by violence, can also cause students to be fearful and anxious, affect a student's willingness to attend school, and impact on a student's ability to learn and be socialized at school (Flannery, 1997). Data from NELS:88, the best available existing comprehensive and representative student data, were used to analyze and understand the connection between school violence and student achievement. NELS:88 is a survey of students followed from the eighth grade to the early years of college # (1988 to 1994), augmented by parent, school administrator and teacher surveys. The base year student data, gathered during the 1988-89 school year, were investigated cross-sectionally for this study (USEd, NCES, Guide, 1994). The results of this investigation will enable examination of common themes and differences among all types of schools. The information will enable educators to interpret, anticipate, and develop effective school policy and programs for optimal teaching and learning while faced with solving school violence problems."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "In summary, the following research questions were examined: What is the nature of violence in school settings in urban, suburban, and rural communities? The pervasive nature and problems of societal crime and violence and the public's concern about the resulting invasion on the school learning environment were introduced and reviewed in Chapter I. Concern about the prevalence of crime and victimization leading to school violence, has permeated the education system since the 1950s (Asmussen, 1992) . The 1974 Congress responded to the persistent and increasing problem of school violence by mandating a national survey of the prevalence of school crime, the factors associated with its perpetration, and the effectiveness of existing measures to ameliorate student victimization. This mandate led to the Safe Schools Study (National Institute of Education (NIE], 1986) which showed disturbing trends in the nation's schools (Flannery, 1997). The NIE report revealed that while teenagers spend up to one-fourth of their waking hours at school, 40 percent of the robberies and 36 percent of personal attacks against them occurred at school (Rapp, Carrington, and Nicholson, 1986). The significant emotional, economic, and social costs of school violence were illustrated by the survey. For example, students in junior high schools were victimized by other students at higher rates than high school students, and a third of junior high students in large cities said they avoided places at school such as the rest room because of fear of being victimized by a Increasing numbers of students reported staying home from school because they feared for their safety. More than 100,000 teachers reported they were threatened with physical harm, and over 5,000 teachers reported being physically attacked each month. Attacks on teachers were much more likely to result in injury for teachers compared to assaults between students (Moles, 1986;Hanke, 1996;Flannery, 1997). The report of the Safe Schools Study documented the significant economic costs of school crime and violence, estimated to be $200 million annually. Burglaries were reported to occur five times more often in schools than in businesses. The average cost of each theft was reported to be about $150. Incidents of vandalism were also higher than expected, occurring an average of one time per month in a quarter of the schools surveyed (Flannery, 1997). From 1950From to 1975 the school setting shifted from acts of violence against property to violence against persons, and fights shifted from words to weapons, with sometimes lethal outcomes (Rubel, 1977;Flannery, 1997). The results of the Safe Schools Study created continued interest in the nature and extent of school crime and violence, the impact on the school learning environment, and the economic and social costs (Flannery, 1997). The consequence of violence and victimization for students who reported high levels of fear and concern about their safety and security prompted several efforts to combat school crime. These concerns led to the inclusion of questions about school-related victimization in the annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The first NCVS that contained school-related victimization items examined the period of time from 1974 to 1981 (Toby, Smith, and Smith, 1986;Flannery, 1997). The data showed that although school crime and victimization were rapidly increasing, levels had remained fairly constant during the years examined. The NCVS documented that over half the criminal incidents for victims ranging in age from 14-17 occurred at school. A significant number of youth were victimized by robberies, experienced aggravated and simple assaults, and larceny at school (Toby, et al., 1986)."}, {"section_title": "Contrary to the NIE Safe Schools", "text": "Survey, the NCVS found that 40-50 percent of victimizations perpetrated in schools were committed by strangers (Flannery, 1997). These findings led to the creation of a School Crime Supplement to the NCVS. This survey of over 10,000 youth ranging in age from 12-19 who attended school during the first six months of the 1988-89 school year showed that 9 percent of students had been victims of crime in or around school: 7 percent reported at least one property crime and 2 percent a violent crime (Bastian and Taylor, 1991). Students over the age of 17 were less likely to be victims of crime than younger students, with ninth graders the most likely to be victimized and twelfth graders least likely to be victimized compared to students in other grades. The survey revealed that 18 percent of students \"sometimes\" feared being the victim of an attack; younger students reported more likely to fear an attack than older students; 16 percent of students reported that a teacher had been threatened or attacked at their school; 15 percent of respondents reported that gangs existed in their school, 6 percent reported they avoided locations in their school because they feared attack, and 2 percent said they had taken a weapon to school to protect themselves (Bastian and Taylor, 1991;Flannery, 1997). There was little difference in the rate of reported crime victimization at school for youth residing in central cities (10 percent) than in suburban areas (9 percent) and rural locales (8 percent) (Bastian and Taylor, 1991 (Greenbaum and Turner, 1989). This overview of schools was implemented during the same school year the NELS:88 study was conducted. More recently, growing numbers of students and teachers reported they are seriously concerned for their safety at school (Hranitz and Eddowes, 1990;O'Connor, 1993;Ascher, 1994;Larson, 1994;Jackson, 1995;Gilbert, 1996;Knox, 1997 showing that half of students in grades 6-12 witnessed some type of crime or victimization at school, and about 1 in 8 reported being directly victimized at school (Nolin, Davies, and Chandler, 1996). Students bringing guns or other weapons to school is the school violence issue currently receiving the greatest public attention and concern (Smith, 1990;O'Connor, 1993;Stephens, Gangs, 1994;Talley and Walz, 1996;Justice, 1996). Weapons in schools are a reflection of their easy access in the community, presence in many homes, and the apparent widespread attitude in American society that violence is an effective way to solve problems (Butterfield and Turner, 1989;Norland, 1992;Kachur, 1994;Hanna and Maddalena, 1995 (Butterfield and Turner, 1989;Ceperley and Simon, 1994;Weisenburger, et al., 1995;USEd, NCES, Crime, 1997 and Weisman, 1991;Stephens, Strategies, 1994;USEd, NCES, Status, 1997). Surveys consistently show that the primary reason students carry a weapon to school is for protection rather than with the intent to perpetrate harm on someone else (Sheley and Wright, 1993;Flannery, 1997 Sixteen percent said they had been in a physical fight in the past year, and almost one-third said they had property such as books, clothing, or a vehicle deliberately damaged or stolen during the past year (Flannery, 1997). The linkages between violent and disruptive behavior and poor social adjustment have been well-established (Patterson, 1982;Kazdin, 1987;Plomin and Rowe, 1990;Polond, 1994;Reasoner, 1995;Talley and Walz, 1996) (Flannery, 1997). Nearly two-thirds of the cities responding had fewer than 50,000 residents and almost half were located in suburban areas. While the overall level of school violence was highest for urban districts, nearly one-third of respondents in all types of jurisdictions (central city, suburban, nonmetropolitan, or rural reported increases in school violence (Flannery, 1997) . Results from a survey by the National School Boards Association (1993) showed that more than 80 percent of school  (Rossman and Morley, 1996;Flannery, 1997 (Mansfield, et al., 1991). Lifetime prevalence of teacher victimization by physical attack 24 is more than three times higher (10 percent versus three percent in schools with 41 percent or more of students receiving free or reduced lunch than in schools in which 10 percent or less of students receive free or reduced lunch. Ten percent of teachers reported that they had been verbally abused by a student in a one week period (Mansfield, et al., 1991). Eleven percent of students and 12 percent of teachers reported a petty theft of their possessions over a one month period (National Institute of Education, 1986). Nine percent of youth ages 12 to 19 reported being the victim of one or more crimes in or around school. Two percent of students reported they were the victim of violence (Bastian and Taylor, 1991). Possession of weapons, fights and other assaults among students are other important aspects of school violence. Following is a summary of the primary findings associated with weapons, fighting, and other assaults at school: In the National Crime Victimization Survey more males (3 percent) than females (1 percent) reported having taken a weapon to school (Bastian and Taylor, 1991). At least 71 persons were killed with guns at schools during the period 1986-90 (Smith, 1990). Sixty-eight percent of officials from urban, suburban, and rural police departments reported that a small number of students carry weapons such as handguns or knives to school (Harris, 1995). Twenty-seven percent of students reported that most violent incidents take place on the school grounds; 15 percent reported incidents occur in the school neighborhood; and eight percent said most acts of violence occur in school buildings 25 (Harris, 1995). Most teachers and students believe that when violence takes place in the school building it generally occurs in public areas--hallways and staircases were most frequently mentioned by (64 percent of teachers and 55 percent of students). However, 27 percent of students reported that a significant portion of incidents occur in more hidden areas such as boy's and girl's rest rooms and locker rooms, where teachers are less likely to see incidents firsthand. Only two percent of .teachers mentioned locker rooms. Students more than teachers believe that incidents are more likely to take place in classrooms (24 percent of students versus 12 percent of teachers (Harris, 1995). The vast majority of urban, suburban, and rural public school teachers (98 percent) have never carried a weapon to school. Those teachers who have taken some form of precaution most frequently carry mace (44 percent) for self defense (Harris, 1995). Eleven percent of public school teachers have been victims of acts of violence that occurred in or around schools. Most of the incidents involved students (95 percent). Sixteen percent of teachers in schools with all or many minority students have been victims of crimes in or around their school (Harris, 1995). Students, more frequently are victims of school violence (23 percent), and among students with generally poor grades, (mostly C's, D's and F's), the incidence is higher (39 percent). This holds true for students in all regions of the nation, grade levels, and urban, suburban, and rural school locations. However, boys are twice as likely as girls to be 26 victims of school violence (30 percent compared with 16 percent) (Harris, 1995). Use of alcohol and drugs by students is another dimension of school violence. All students are potentially at risk for alcohol and drug use given the widespread availability of alcohol, legal and illegal drugs. Seventy percent of public school students and 52 percent of private school students reported that drugs are available at their school (Bastian and Taylor, 1991). Nearly 13 percent of eighth-graders, 23 percent of tenthgraders, and 30 percent of twelfth-graders had five or more drinks in a row in a two-week period during the 1990-91 school year (Johnson et al., 1992). Research findings draw heavily on the work of Hawkins and his colleagues (1992) which categorizes psychological, family, and school f'actors in relationship to adolescent use of alcohol and drugs. In summary: 1. It is clear, however, that parents who are considerate and supportive, yet firm in their beliefs, seem to protect their adolescents from drug use (Baumrind, 1991;Haberman, 1994). improving their self-concept by recognizing a variety of student accomplishments; and by facilitating a variety of student groupings and interactions (Benard, 1992;Harris, 1995 Conversely, the number of drug using friends has the most direct influence on students' drug use (Reid, 1989;Moyers, 1995). Correcting for erroneous perceptions of the prevalence and acceptability of drug use among peers is critical (Hansen and Graham, 1991;Poland, 1994). Benard (1992) and Asher (1994) indicate that the challenge for.the 1990s is to develop and implement strategies that help youth succeed in staying drug-free in spite of adverse conditions in their families, schools, and communities."}, {"section_title": "Individual psychological and interpersonal factors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The extensive literature review provided a wealth of school violence information. However, there is inadequate empirical data that relates the most prevalent types of school violence problems and patterns of school violence to student performance issues.

Their perception, fed by a variety of reports and observations, is that urban students achieve less in school, attain less education, and encounter less success in the labor market in later life (Johnson and Immerwahr, 1994;Schwartz, 1996;USEd, NCES, Challenge, 1996;Knox, 1997).

Bias (due to nonresponse)--Difference that occurs when respondents differ as a group from nonrespondents on a characteristic being studied. For NELS:88, the overall unit response is high (93.4 percent for students and 98.9 percent for schools) which lessens the problem of nonresponse bias. Additionally, NELS:88 applies reweighting adjustment to reduce nonresponse bias which serves to alleviate the bias problem (USEd, NCES, Student, 1990;USEd, NCES, School, 1990). Weapons--Devices used with the intent of inflicting harm. Weight--The base year measure (BYQWT) for the student sample applied to analyses to produce' national population estimates and reduce bias.

The following student factors had the lowest statistical correlations to student achievement: all racial/ethnic groups except Hispanic students (.025); all schools except Catholic (-.023); students' victimized at school (-.021); all racial groups except black students (-.021); and all racial/ethnic groups in the other category (.011). Given the large student sample size (n=24,599), it is relatively easy to get significant scores. scores were > 1.95 except the category for all \"other\" racial/ethnic groups which showed a t score < 1.95. Regression Model 1--All school violence plus all background variables were regressed on both performance variables. Fourteen school violence variables were found to be too many which caused collinearity difficulties (See Table 13). In order to reduce the problem of multiple collinearity, it was determined that the 14 school violence variables fall into three school violence categories: personal behavior; victimization; and violence perception (See Table 3) . Data reduction was performed for each set of variables by running a principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation. Factor scores for each student were obtained by the normal regression method for the three dimensions of violence: personal behavior; victimization; and violence perception. Regression Model 2--The regression was rerun using three school violence factor scales (See Table 3 FVIO > perf R2 = .08 Table 14 presents the total variance explained by R square scores and the standardized regression coefficients for students' background characteristics: sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status quartile, school type and school location. Note. p>.05 The associations between the independent variables and student achievement showed the following results. When the incidence of negative personal behavior increased, there was a negative effect on achievement for males (.084) and females (.066) with the greater effect on achievement for males. When the incidence of negative personal behavior increased, there was a negative effect on achievement for all racial/ethnic groups. However, the most for Asian/Pacific American students (.080); second for white students (.068); and next for black students (.061). When the incidence of negative personal behavior increased Hispanic students (.049) and Native American students (.038) showed lesser effects on achievement among all racial/ethnic groups. Cultural influences may be related to this finding. The academic achievement of black students did not appear to be inordinately impacted when the incidence of negative personal behavior increased, as might have been expected. The academic achievement of students in the high/medium socio-economic status quartile was most impacted when the incidence of negative personal behavior increased (.065); second for students in the low/medium socio-economic status quartile (.064); next for students in the low socio-economic status quartile (.045); and least for students in the high socioeconomic status quartile (.054). Students attending public schools showed higher negative effects on student achievement when the incidence of negative personal behavior increased (.080); second for students in 65 private non-religious schools (.047); next for students in private other religious schools (.026); and least for Catholic school students (.020). When the incidence of negative personal behavior increased for students in all locales, there was a negative effect on achievement which was highest for.rural schools (.081); next for urban schools (.074); and least for suburban schools (.071). There was an increase in reading and mathematics achievement scores for every increase in students' socio-, economic status level. When the incidence of negative personal behavior increased, there was a negative effect on achievement, more for males than females. Asian/Pacific American students were most impacted among all racial groups surveyed when the incidence of negative personal behavior increased. The achievement of students in rural schools was influenced most when the incidence of negative personal behavior increased; students in urban schools were next; and then students in suburban schools. When students have personal behavior problems, their achievement level decreases. It is important to highlight a critical school violencestudent performance connection. Although it was small in percent variance explained terms, it remained operative regardless to which statistical controls were introduced. There is no question that students who exhibit violent and disruptive behavior perform poorly and pose a dilemma to educators. The more negative the student's personal behavior, the greater the negative impact on the student's achievement (See Table 13). Students' victimization and perception of violence showed lower levels of negative influence on achievement. The analysis tables reveal interesting patterns of school violence behaviors among eighth grade students attending public, Catholic, private other religious and private non-religious schools. Eighth grade students in 1988 responded in similar patterns in public schools and private non-religious schools: (See Table 6 Robbery/theft at School; Table 7 Vandalism of School Property; Table 11 Student Use of Alcohol; and Table 12 Student use of Illegal Substances.

That is one of the startling findings among federal data collected for the first time as part of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which is conducted every other year by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly 1 of 4 students had been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug at school during the year preceding the survey. More than 16,000 students were polled for the first time about violencerelated and drug-related behavior that occurred on school property. The new questions appeared at the request of the National Education Goals Panel, an independent federal body responsible for helping the nation achieve the Department of Education's GOALS 2000 initiative. National data 109 collected at state and local levels showed that: 1) male students were more likely than female students to carry a weapon to school; 2) Hispanic students were more likely than white or Black students to have been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug. Of students responding, 4.4 percent reported having missed at least one day of school during the previous month because they felt unsafe at school or in traveling to/from school; and 3) younger students and Black and Hispanic students were more likely to miss school because they felt unsafe. The results of the survey indicate that kids are being affected by violence, in schools and in communities. Violence is getting in the way of their education (USHHS, CDC, 1995). 10., Violence and Discipline Problems in U. S. Public Schools: 1996-97 This school violence survey was conducted in response to the seventh goal of the National Education Goals which states that by the year 2000, \"all schools in America will be free of drugs and violence and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol, and offer a disciplined environment that is conducive to learning.\" In response to this goal, the Congress passed the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994, which provides for support of drug and violence prevention programs. As part of this legislation, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is required to collect data to determine the \"frequency, seriousness, and incidence of violence in elementary and secondary schools.\" NCES responded to this requirement by commissioning a survey, the Principal/School Disciplinarian Survey on School Violence, 1996-97. The survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,234 regular public elementary, middle, and secondary schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the spring and summer of 1997. The survey requested information on four main topics: the incidence of crime and violence that occurred in public schools during the 1996-97 academic year; principals (or school disciplinarians') perceptions about the seriousness of a variety of discipline issues in their schools; the types of disciplinary actions schools took against students for serious offenses; and the kinds of security measures and violence prevention programs that were in place in public schools. KEY FINDINGS: (1) More than half of the U.S. public schools reported experiencing at least one crime incident in 1996-97, and 1 in 10 schools reported at least one serious violent crime during that school year. (2) Crime and violence were more of a problem in middle and high schools than in elementary schools. Middle schools and high schools were more likely to report that they had experienced one or more incidents of any crime and one or more incidents of serious violent crime than elementary schools. (3) Schools that reported serious discipline problems were more likely to have experienced one or more incidents of crime or violence, and were more likely to experience serious violent crime than those with less serious discipline*problenis. (4) Most public schools reported having zero tolerance policies towards serious student offenses. (5) Most schools reported that they employed low levels of security measures to prevent violence. (6) Most schools reported having formal school violence prevention programs (USEd, NCES, Violence 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Desian, Sample, and Response Rate", "text": "This national longitudinal study is being conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of Education (USEd, NCES, Research, 1996).

The first stage involved a universe of 38,774 (40,000) schools, the primary sampling unit. An initial pool of 1,032 schools was selected through stratified sampling with probability of selection proportional to eighth grade size and with over sampling of private schools. After replacing ineligible nonparticipant schOols, a total of 1,051 schools (815 public schools and 236 private schools) participated in the study and provided usable student data. The second stage involved sampling 202,996 eighth grade students enrolled in 1,051 participating schools and produced a random selection of 26,432 eighth graders, of which 24,599 participated in the study during the 1988 spring term. On average, each school was represented by approximately 25 students from the randomly sampled 8th grade school rosters. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled to permit analysis of the performance of language minority students resulting in augmentation of approximately 2-3 language minority students per school. Figures were rounded to reflect the base-year analysis population: a cross-sectional cohort sample size of 25,000 originally surveyed eighth grade students (24-26) students per school) attending 1,000 schools (800 public and 200 Catholic and other private schools) across the nation in 1988. Data about the school and students were collected from school administrators, parents, teachers, and students. In 1988, the school survey completion rate was 98.9 percent (n=1,052); the student survey completion rate was 93.4 percent (n=24,599) and is nationally representative of 1988 eighth grade 113 students in public and private schools in the United States (USEd, NCES, Programs, 1995;Coleman, May 1996). The analytic procedures for analyzing NELS data may be cross-sectional or longitudinal. Cross-sectional analysis provides a view at a single point in time and is the procedure used in this investigation to provide descriptive estimations and answers to the research questions of this study. Longitudinal analysis permits the measurement of change over time. The NELS:88 eighth grade cohort has been followed at two year intervals: first follow-Up in 1990 with tenth graders; second follow-up in 1992 with high school seniors; and third follow-up in 1994, the second year following high school completion. The next follow-up is tentatively scheduled for the year 2000. By that time, many in this cohort will have finished their postsecondary education and completed a transition into the labor force. Others will have been in the labor force for about eight years. NELS:88 data supports cross-sectional analyses of eighth graders to answer questions about the characteristics of students and the educational system, and tests hypotheses about the underlying causes of school violence factors associated with student performance (Weishew and Peng, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Technical Limitations", "text": "When constructing a working data file with composites, the researcher is guided to follow two 'rules for selecting composites.

There is one exception to this rule. When the analysis population is the eighth grade cross-sectional cohort, composites are selected from the base-year student file because they cover the full cross-sectional cohort sample of students in the original schools. The follow-up data files cover only base year sample members retained in the study, and not all of the originally surveyed eighth graders (USEd, NCES, Seminar, 1996). While there are more recent data files with school violence composites, this investigation adhered to the research rule exception and utilized the base year data files for the analysis population, the eighth grade cross-sectional cohort.
