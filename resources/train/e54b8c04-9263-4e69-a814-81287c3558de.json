The system was constructed with one large unstructured grid covering the Atlantic Coast from Nova Scotia to Florida and a smaller, limited domain unstructured grid covering the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads and the adjacent continental shelf regions. It was demonstrated that, with the large domain grid, the model could simulate the hurricane induced storm surge reasonably well using astronomical tide at the open boundary condition and in turn, provide boundary condition for the limited domain model. Since the difficulty o f specifying the open boundary condition in the limited domain was solved using this dual-grid methodology, the model achieved the predictive capability for forecasting storm surge as long as accurate atmospheric wind is provided. The high resolution, limited domain grids could, at the same time, be used to map inundation features in details inside the Chesapeake Bay.."}, {"section_title": "WRF-GFS", "text": "The storm surge modeling system has been linked with different atmospheric models.

Realistic simulations conducted in this study demonstrated that the high-resolution unstructured grid, which is able to resolve complex bathymetry, topography, and coastline structure, could generate accurate storm surge and inundation results if LiDAR data are incorporated. The high-resolution grid and accurate LiDAR topographic data are essential for generating accurate inundation maps. One o f the significant findings in this study is that the coastal Ekman dynamics does play an important role in water exchanges between continetial shelf and the Chesapeake Bay.

Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "Storm surge is an abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm, and whose height is the difference between the observed level o f the sea surface and the level that would have occurred in the absence o f the cyclone (National Hurricane Center, NWS, 2009). In the past several decades, there are many storm surge studies conducted in the Chesapeake Bay (Bretschneider, 1959;Harris, 1963;Pore, 1965;Valle-Levinson et al., 2002;Wang et al., 2005;Li et al., 2006;Shen et al., 2006aShen et al., , 2006bShen et al., , 2008. Harris (1956) is the first one who started systematic studies on the storm surges due to hurricanes on the East Coast o f the United States. In his paper 'characteristics o f the hurricane storm surge', Harris (1963) summarized five distinct processes that can alter the water level in tidal water regions during a storm surge: (a) the pressure effect, (b) the direct wind effect, (c) the effect o f the earth's rotation, (d) the effect of waves, and (e) the rainfall effect. Pore (1965) included two more factors involved in the generation and modification o f storm surges in the Chesapeake Bay: (1) the height o f the tide in the Atlantic Ocean near the entrance o f Chesapeake Bay and (2) modifying effects o f coastline configuration and bathymetry. Numerical model studies o f hurricane-induced storm surge began in the early 1970s. Jelesnianski (1972) developed the Special Program to List Amplitude o f Surges from Hurricanes (SPLASH) in 1972. After that, Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) was developed and widely used by N OAA for coastal flooding and inundation forecasts along the G ulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard o f the United States ( Jelesnianski et al., 1984;Jelesnianski et al.,1992). Despite its popularity, the SLOSH model has several disadvantages that need to be improved. First, because its' use o f structured grid, the SLOSH model has a limitation in resolving complicated coastlines and thus severely restricts its capability for accurate simulation o f inundation. Second, the advection terms in the momentum equations are neglected in this model, which will influence the accuracy o f the simulation. In recent decades, many other models using different numerical schemes have been developed for the simulation o f storm surges in different areas (Lynch, 1983;Blumberg and Mellor, 1987;Flather et al., 1991;Luettich et al., 1992;W esterink et al., 1992;Hubbert and M clnnes, 1999). One o f these models is the ADCIRC model, which employs the unstructured grid and is able to resolve the complex coastline and the bathymetry o f shallow water quite well. In recent years, due to the potential increase in the strength and frequency o f hurricanes and their associated storm surges related to global warming, there is a renewed interest for improving storm surge and inundation models along the G ulf Coast and the Eastern Coast o f the USA (Valle-Levinson et al,. 2002;W ang et al., 2005;Bernier and Thompson, 2006;Kohut et al., 2006;Li et al., 2006;W eisberg and Zheng, 2006;Shen et al., 2006aShen et al., , 2006bShen et al., , 2008. However, up to date, there is no forecasting model developed in the Chesapeake Bay. This study aims at developing a storm surge and inundation forecasting system for the Chesapeake Bay. The forecasting system adopted the unstructured grid strategy and made model calculation over a large domain with a very high grid resolution near the coast and inside the Chesapeake Bay. This approach will allow us to set up an early warning system before Hurricane makes landing and ease to specify open boundary for forecasting. At the same time, the high-resolution unstructured grid, aided by incorporation o f LiDAR data, will greatly enhance the accuracy o f inundation simulation in the Chesapeake Bay."}, {"section_title": "Science context o f this study", "text": "The storm surge and associated inundation can cause severe loss o f life and immense damage to the property in coastal areas, which is usually due to lack o f warning and insufficient Isabel. According to U.S. Census data, more than 16 million people live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and this population continues to grow. Factoring in the anticipated sea-level rise, continuing coastal development, and potential increases in the frequency and severity o f storms possibly related to global warming, the people o f the Chesapeake Bay region and their property are facing ever increasing risks. To reduce the economic and environmental impacts o f future storms on the Chesapeake Bay area, a sufficient accurate storm surge and inundation prediction model is highly desirable. However, such a model is still lacking due to following reasons: 1insufficient resolution and accuracies in the meteorological forecasting fields; (2) inadequate resolution and accuracy o f the topographic and bathymetric data; (3) difficulties in obtaining the open boundary condition during the storm condition; (4) insufficient computational power for setting up a high resolution grid over a large domain simultaneously. These problems are expected to be partially solved by the employment o f the following developments in this study: (1) A powerful computing system was employed in the storm surge simulation. Thanks to the advance o f the computer technology, a heterogeneous cluster computing system named SciClone at College o f William and Mary has been used in this study. Specifically, a subcluster named Typhoon, which has 72 dual-processors, dual-core servers, was employed. It has supplied enough computational power for calibrating and running the storm surge model. At the same time, a computationally efficient numerical model named Eulerian-Lagrangian Circulation (ELCIRC) is employed to set up the storm surge model in order to get the best computational speed for prediction purposes. Previous study (W ang et al., 2005) has proved the capability o f this model for simulating the storm surge. In the future, the parallel computing technology will be employed as well for more powerful computing capability. (2) Model grid resolution is vital in a numerical model to predict surge and inundation accurately in low-lying coastal areas (Shen et al., 2006c). The structured grid that has been widely used in the previous studies is not able to resolve the complex coastline and low-lying coastal areas at a high resolution while still covering a large domain, since it cannot freely change spatial resolution in a given grid. In contrast to the structured grid, the unstructured grid could have a high resolution in coastal areas and relatively low resolution in the open ocean at the same time. Some unstructured grid models using a finite difference scheme have been developed previously, but the problem with those models is that they are usually restricted by the CFL condition when increasing the grid resolution. In this study, the ELCIRC model, with the employment o f the semi-implicit and Eulerian-Lagrangian schemes, is less restricted by the stability condition, which means that a large time step can be used. Thus, a high-resolution grid can be employed without much decrease in computational speed compared to other unstructured grid models. (3) W ithout accurate topographic data, a high-resolution grid is not quite useful to predict the inundation accurately. Fortunately, the high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging LiDARtopographic data is now available. This LiDAR technology is a state-of-the-art technology that can measure the land topography at a horizontal resolution o f 1 meter. With the employment o f LiDAR topographic data in the Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach areas, our high-resolution grid can generate an accurate inundation prediction. Despite the use o f powerful computer resource and an efficient numerical model, questions as to whether the model could run with such a high-resolution grid quickly and stably enough and how much the LiDAR data could help improve the prediction quality o f inundation in the lower Bay area were uncertain before this study. This study proved that the model could be set up with the high-resolution grid and could simulate storm surge and inundation efficiently and that the LiDAR data is quite necessary for the inundation simulation. boundary conditions approach will be used to obtain a series o f wind fields with increasing resolution. The tandem use o f WRF and RAMS will provide a range o f potential wind fields. An ensemble forecast is a collection o f two or more forecasts predicting at the same time. For the wind part, NWS will run WRF within a 6-hr forecast cycle for a 7-to-14-day period for each case. The WRF model will use the Global Forecast System (GFS) and North American Mesoscale model (NAM) as initial and boundary conditions. In addition, the NAM (12-km) and GFS (~32km) also will provide two more independent wind fields (in coarse grid shown to produce more accurate forecasts than individual model runs. The seven-field atmospheric ensemble will drive our storm surge model, creating a 6-hr 7-ensemble forecast of storm surge in the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries."}, {"section_title": "Description o f ELCIRC model", "text": "In order to simulate storm surge in a large modeling domain with high-resolution grids in the nearshore, a computationally efficient numerical model is required. For this reason, ELCIRC, which has the advantage o f allowing large time step without severely restricted by CFL condition, is used to simulate the storm surge and inundation in the Chesapeake Bay. The numerical model ELCIRC, originally developed by Zhang et al. (2004), uses an orthogonal, unstructured grid with mixed triangular and quadrilateral grids in the horizontal and the z-coordinate in the vertical. The model is capable o f simulating both two-dimensional and three-dimensional hydrodynamics and transport processes. When using one vertical layer, the formulation o f the model automatically reduces to the 2D depth-integrated version. The governing equations were discretized according to a semi-implicit scheme. The barotropic pressure gradient in the momentum equation and the flux term in the continuity equation are treated semi-implicitly, with implicitness factor 0.5 < Q < 1; the vertical viscosity term and the bottom boundary condition for the momentum equations are treated fully implicitly; and all other terms are treated explicitly. This ensures both stability (Casulli and Cattani, 1994) and computational efficiency. Different from the traditional treatment o f advection terms using explicit schemes, this model employs the Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme to treat the advection terms so that it will not be severely restricted by the CFL condition. In fact, with the use o f the semi-implicit and Eulerian Lagrangian schemes, this model can simulate storm surge using a high-resolution grid over a large domain while still maintaining a relatively large time step. This model also employed a robust wetting-and-drying algorithm so that the inundation process can be well simulated. The ELCIRC model has been successfully used for simulation o f hurricane-induced storm surge in a previous study (Wang et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Governing equations", "text": "The ELCIRC model solves for the free surface elevation, 3D water velocity, salinity, and temperature, with its formulation from a set o f six hydrostatic equations based on the Boussinesq approximation, which represent mass conservation (in both 3D and depth-integrated forms),  To make these equations attain closure, an equation o f state is also used in the model: where p(S,T,p) (kg tm 3) is the density at one standard atmosphere, and K(S,T,p) is the secant bulk modulus.

Wind drag coefficient CD s is calculated using Large and Pond's (1981) formulation, which is: The bottom drag coefficient CD b is typically variable in space, and might also vary at various temporal scales (e.g., through current-w ave interactions or long-term changes in bottom texture).

However, parameterization o f turbulent vertical mixing is still an open question in coastal modeling. There are multiple options in the use o f the ELCIRC Model, including a zero-equation model and multiple tw o-and-a-half equation models. The two-and-a half equation turbulence closure schemes, like Mellor &Yamada, kinetic energy and mixing length, have been tested in this study but no satisfactory results were obtained. A possible explanation o f this is that the resolution o f our vertical grid is not high enough to get accurate results with these closure schemes. In fact, our model is using a z-grid and the vertical grid resolution in the Bay and coastal area is only 5 meters in the surface layers, so some shallow areas have only 1 to 2 layers, which is insufficient to obtain accurate eddy viscosity using turbulence closure schemes. To use these schemes, more vertical layers need to be included. This will decrease the computational speed and thus is not a good option for a prediction model. At the same time, these schemes are highly dependent on the baroclinic mode, which means the model needs to simulate the salinity and temperature in order to get the correct density distribution. This will make this model more complicated and it is beyond the scope o f this study. Generally, without enough measurement data, it is hard to set up the initial conditions of temperature and salinity for the entire large domain and the open boundary conditions for every time step. The baroclinic mode will slow down the computational speed significantly. Considering the difficulty o f specifying the boundary condition and computational speed, a baroclinic model was not used. Therefore, rather than using the tw o-and-a-half equation turbulent scheme, a semi-empirical formulation combining current dependent eddy viscosity with wind wave-dependent eddy viscosity, (Davies, 1997), was shown to generate reasonable results. The formulation o f wind wave-dependent eddy viscosity was based on Dobroklonsky, (1947) and Ichiye (1967). The formulae are shown here: the eddy viscosity generated by current and 0 . 0 2 8 -^e 1 is the wave-generated eddy viscosity. For the deep ocean areas, 0.00251(/|2 is the eddy viscosity generated by current and 5 M3 -2-1 2.84 x 10 x---e L is the wave generated eddy viscosity. For the current generated eddy g viscosity, 0.0025/i|(/| has been widely used in shallow water modeling, so it was employed in our model when water depth is less than 200 m.

One is the large domain grid for the storm surge prediction purpose covering the Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia to Florida; the other is the small, limited domain grid covering the land parts in the Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach areas for the inundation prediction purpose. Adequacy o f the grid resolution is one o f the key issues for accurately predicting nearshore storm surge and inundation along the coast and inside the Bay. Numerical studies show that storm surge modeling requires a much higher grid resolution than normal tide simulation due to the spatially varying wind forcing function that interacts with the geometric complexities o f land boundaries and near coastal bathymetry (W esterink et al., 1992). Thus, both o f the grids are generated with high resolution in the nearshore area and the small domain one has even higher resolution, as high as 50 meters in shallow water areas and for low-lying land. The domain size o f a model is also an important issue for storm surge simulation since hurricanes and northeasters are large-scale phenomena. Blain et al. (1994) found that a small domain is inadequate for storm surge simulation because cross-shelf boundary conditions are in the regions o f significant storm surge generation. As such, a large domain (with an area extending beyond the scale o f the storm) is needed in order to specify the proper open boundary condition and more realistically capture the physics associated with storm surge generation and propagation. That is why the large domain grid is generated. Because it is very difficult for a structured or curvilinear grid to have a very fine grid nearshore and also to cover a large modeling domain, an unstructured grid was used to resolve the complex The small, limited domain grid has 218,553 cells and 116,504 nodes. The high-resolution grid needs a high-resolution bathymetric and topographic data set. To ensure that the model domain in the lower Bay has correct and accurate prediction capability for inundation for Virginia Beach, a high-resolution bathymetric and topographic data set from LiDAR data is employed. LiDAR is a technology that uses laser pulses to determine the distance to an object or surface. In fact, the distance to an object is determined by measuring the time delay between transmission o f a pulse and detection o f the reflected signal. This could be applied to the measurement o f topography on land with a one-meter-by-one-meter horizontaal resolution. The LiDAR data we used was remapped to lOm-by-lOm because the database for 1 m-by-1 m data was too large and the resolution o f our grid, which is in 50 m to 100 m, does not require 1 m-by-1 m bathymetric data. LiDAR data has been mapped into the high-resolution Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach grid in the lower Bay. With the combination o f the high-resolution unstructured grid and LiDAR data for representing inter-tidal zone, the model is capable o f simulating the inundation process that occurs near the low-lying shoreline during hurricane and northeaster events. In order to generate the grid, the coastline is obtained from the coastline extractor website: http://rimm er.ngdc.noaa.gov/. The coastline data is then transformed to shape file format by a script, which is from the NOAA website as well. The grids are then generated by the commercial program JANET, using the shapefile o f the coastline. This grid generator is designed to generate ELCIRC conforming grids by Delaunay triangulation. JANET provides a number o f powerful tools that help in generating an orthogonal grid. For example, JANET permits the modeler to redistribute the nodes on the boundary polygons to control the element sizes. It allows restriction o f maximum permissible inside angles, which help generate triangles with acute angles. It allows isolating certain areas within the grid for which separate refinement or coarsening criteria can be applied. If the grid is too big, JANET also permits splitting the grid into several submeshes and dealing with these submeshes separately and then merging them together. This property o f the grid generator allows the modeler to efficiently generate the grid with the desired quality. Another important property o f JANET is that it can check and optimize the orthogonality o f the grid automatically, which is very useful in maintaining the orthogonality. After the grid is generated, the bathymetric and topographic data is mapped into the grid using a bilinear interpolation scheme. The dataset we are using is shown in Table 2.1. For the open ocean, the Global R elief Model (E T 0 P 0 2 ) in 2-arc-min (about 3.6-km) resolution is employed; for the coastal area and the Bay, the Coastal R elief Model in 3-arc-sec (about 90-m) horizontal resolution and 0.1 m vertical resolution is used; and for the land part o f the lower Bay, the high resolution LiDAR data in 10-meter resolution is used. It is well-known that the change in water level depends on the change in volume and the volume is the product o f cross section and depth. Considering the cross section usually has the uncertainty on the order o f tens o f meters but the error o f the bathymetry (depth) is usually on the scale o f meter, we can learn that the error o f the volume is mostly from the uncertainty o f the cross section other than depth. Therefore, the water level will not very sensitive to the uncertainty o f the bathymetry (depth)."}, {"section_title": "Large domain projection", "text": "The longitude/latitude coordinate system is a projection is small, about 7.5m/km in the south and 16m/km in the north, which is much smaller than the grid resolution (~ 2000 m) in these areas. When the grid is generated, the shoreline in longitude/latitude is first projected to the UTM coordinate system and then the grid is generated in the UTM system. After the grid is generated, wind and pressure forces from the atmospheric model using other projections could be projected to our UTM system as well, so that the wind could be interpolated into our grid. database o f tidal constituents (Mukai et al., 2002).

Here only the major tidal constituents o f M 2, S2, N 2, Ki, Oj and Qi are compared. As it can be seen in Table 2.2, the model simulates the dominant tidal constituent (M2 tide) along the Atlantic Coast quite well."}, {"section_title": "Tidal calibration", "text": "For the M2 tide, the difference between the modeled tide and NOAA value at most o f the stations is less than 10 cm except at St. Simons Island, GA. The mean difference is 0.05 m and the standard deviation o f the difference is 0.05 m, which is 7.8% o f the mean observed tidal amplitude. The discrepancy mainly comes from the stations far away from the Chesapeake Bay, where the grid resolution is not very high. Since the grid may not resolve the complex bathymetries o f these stations very well, a relatively large difference can be expected. Generally, the M2 tidal results with errors within 10 cm are acceptable for the stations along the Atlantic Coast. For the constituent o f S2, the mean difference is -0.01 m and the standard deviation o f the difference is 0.01 m, which is about 9.1% o f the mean observed S2 tidal amplitude. For the c o n s titu e n t^, the mean difference is 0.01 m and the standard deviation o f the difference is 0.01 m, which is about 6.7% o f the mean observed S2 tidal amplitude. For Ki, the mean difference is 0 m and the standard deviation o f the difference is 0.01 m, which is about 10% o f the mean observed Ki tidal amplitude. For Oi, the mean difference is -0.01 m and the standard deviation of the difference is 0.01 m, which is about 14.3% o f the mean observed Oi tidal amplitude.

It is demonstrated that the amplitude and phase o f the modeled tide is quite reasonable when compared to the observations along the Atlantic coast. Overall, the large domain model is capable o f tide simulation along the Atlantic Coastline. As can be seen in Table 2.4, for Chesapeake Bay stations where the high-resolution grid is ensured, the model results agree with the observations even better. For the M2 tide, the differences for most o f the stations in the Bay are within 2 cm, except Stations Yorktown, Sewells Pt. and Cambridge, which have 5 cm, 4 cm, and 4 cm differences, respectively. All these three stations are located in the tributaries at locations with more detailed bathymetry that might not be resolved very well by our grid, but the tide simulations in other stations along the main  Table   2.5, for the M2 tide, the difference for the phase between the modeled tide and NOAA observations at all the stations is less than 15 degrees; for the S2 tide, the difference is less than 20 degrees; for the N 2 tide, the difference is less than 20 degrees. It is demonstrated that the amplitude and phase o f the modeled tide is reasonable when compared to the observations in the Chesapeake Bay. Overall, with higher resolution in the Bay, the large domain model simulated the tide very satisfactorily in the Bay. Overall, the large domain model was demonstrated to be able to simulate the tide along the Atlantic Coastline and in the Chesapeake Bay reasonably well. After the large domain model was calibrated, it could be used for generating the open boundary condition for the small domain. When the grids were generated, each o f the open boundary nodes o f the small domain grid has an exact corresponding node in the large domain grid. Thus, the water elevations o f these nodes at each time step were saved when the large domain model was running. After the simulation o f the large domain model was completed, a water elevation history file was generated and it could be read into the small domain model to specify the water elevation at each open boundary node at each time step. That is the coupling process o f the two models.  forcing was conducted initially to spin-up the tide. Then the wind and pressure data for two storm surge cases from the different atmospheric models were input to force the large domain hydrodynamic model. For each wind and pressure field, the wind speeds, directions, and pressures were compared with the observations from NOAA separately to check the quality o f each wind. The root-mean-square (RMS) error values o f wind speeds, directions, and pressures were calculated to compare the capability o f different atmospheric models. Through the procedure, the WRF-GFS wind was found to be the most reliable wind. For each run with different atmospheric winds, water-level predictions from our storm surge model were compared against the observed water levels at 9 tidal-gage stations located throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. RMS, relative errors, correlation coefficients and the skill score were calculated to assess our m odel's predictive capability. Appendix A gives the mathematical definitions o f these statistical measures. Using the boundary condition output from the large domain model, the small domain model predicted the inundation and the results were presented via visualization. In this study, the inundation simulation is only using the WRF-GFS wind since it is the most reliable wind. For the GFS wind, as can be seen in Figure 3.2, at Stations CBBT, Sewells Point, Cambridge, the wind speeds compare well with the observations except they slightly overestimate after the peak. At Station Lewisetta, the wind speeds are overestimated a little bit before the peak and The GFS modeled pressures are generally underestimated before the depression, but match the depression quite well. Statistically, the RMS calculated using the observed and modeled wind and pressure data for each station are shown in For the NAM wind, the wind speeds, wind directions, and pressures comparisons are shown in  Pa. These statistical measures demonstrated that the NAM modeled wind and pressure have more error than the GFS modeled wind and pressure. For the WRF-GFS wind, as can be seen in Figure 3.8, at Stations CBBT, Sewells Point, Lewisetta, Cambridge, the wind speeds compared well with the observations except they slightly overestimated after the peak. At Station Lewisetta, the wind speeds are overestimated a little before the peak as well. The wind speeds at Station Thomas Point are underestimated before and after the peak, but matched the peak. At Station Tolchester Beach, the wind speeds are overestimated more than the NAM and GFS winds. In Figure 3.9, the WRF-GFS modeled wind directions compared very well with observed wind directions from Hour 24 to Hour 96 at  Figure 3.10, the WRF-GFS modeled pressure are generally underestimated a little after the depression, but match the depression quite well. Overall, as can be seen in Figure 3.8, Figure 3.9, and Figure 3.10, the WRF-GFS wind is better than the GFS and NAM winds. The scatter plots o f the modeled wind against the observed wind are shown in Figures 3. 11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.17, 3.18, 3.19. Three stations are selected to represent the wind in the lower Bay (CBBT), the middle Bay (Lewisetta) and the upper Bay (Thomas point). For each station, the wind speed, wind direction and pressure are plotted seperately. As can be seen in Figure 3.11,3.12 and 3.13, the RMS error o f the modeled wind speed at CBBT is 2.55 m/s, the RMS error o f the wind direction is 8.54 degree and the RMS error o f the pressure is 164.04 Pa. As shown in Figure 3. RMS is calculated without Station Tolchester, it is 2.98 m/s, which is better than the GFS and NAM winds. The mean RMS o f wind direction and pressure for WRF-GFS wind are also better than those for GFS and NAM. Thus, the higher-resolution WRF model did generate better wind and pressure fields than the lower-resolution GFS and NAM models. For the W RF-NAM wind, the wind speeds comparison is shown in Figure 3.20. For all the stations except Tolchester Beach, the wind speeds compared well with the observations. Specifically, the wind speeds are overestimated a little after the peak at Station Cambridge. At Station Tolchester Beach, the wind speeds are overestimated as winds generated by other atmospheric models from NWS. Overall the wind speeds simulated by the WRF-NAM model matched even better than those generated by the WRF-GFS wind, but the problem o f the WRF-NAM wind is that it has more fluctuations, so the wind speeds are not as smooth as the WRF-GFS wind. For the wind directions, as shown in Figure 3. It is consistent with our observation based on the plots, but the fluctuations prevent the WRF-NAM wind from being the best choice. At the same time, the mean RMS o f pressure for WRF-NAM wind (238.29Pa) is worse than that for WRF-GFS (152.62). Thus, WRF-GFS wind is overall better than W RF-NAM wind. For RAMS gridl wind, it can be seen in Figure 3.23 that the wind speeds are generally underestimated at all stations except Tolchester Beach, At Tolchester Beach, the wind speeds are overestimated like other winds. In Figure 3. Figure 3.25, the RAMS gridl modeled pressures have a big underestimation during the depression, especially in the stations located in the lower Bay. In Table 3.1, the mean RMS o f six stations for the wind speed is 3.94 m/s; for the wind direction, the mean RMS is 31.31 degrees; for the pressure, the mean RMS is 378.95 Pa. The mean RMS o f wind speed, direction and pressure for the RAMS G ridl wind are worse than those for the WRF-GFS wind, especially the pressure. For the RAMS Grid2 wind, as shown in Figure 3.26, Figure 3.27, and Figure 3.28, the wind speeds, wind directions, and pressures at all the stations are quite similar to the pattern o f the RAMS Grid 1 wind, but the wind speeds o f the RAMS Grid2 wind are slightly increased and the pressures are slightly decreased. For the statistical measures in For the RAMS Grid3 wind, the wind speeds compared well with the observations (Figure 3.29 Figure 3.31, the RAMS grid3 modeled pressures have a big underestimation during the depression, especially in the stations located in the lower Bay. As can be seen in Beach.This is consistent for all the 7 different modeled winds. In looking at the sighting o f the instrument there are some trees to the north and east o f the instrument which might cause some sheltering. Thus, the observations might be lower than the real wind. Also since we are dealing with a 4 km grid it is possible that most o f that grid is over the water so that when a value is calculated it might be more representative over the water which would have the higher winds. (Billet, 2009). In summary, the best wind obtained was by using the WRF-GFS wind for the Bay area and the GFS wind for other areas outside o f the WRF model domaindoes not cover."}, {"section_title": "Water elevation comparison", "text": "In the last section, the 7 different winds generated by different atmospheric models are compared with the observations so that the quality o f these winds is known. In this section, storm tide simulations during Hurricane Isabel with 7 different winds are compared with the observations to see if the prediction skill o f our hydrodynamic model is consistent with the quality o f these winds. For the water elevation results with the GFS wind, it can be seen in Figure 3.32 that the modeled water elevations at the 9 stations in the Bay compared well with the observations overall. However, the water elevations generated with the GFS wind are overestimated at the lower Bay For the water elevation results with the NAM wind, it can be seen in Figure 3.33 that the modeled water elevations at the 4 stations o f CBBT, Kiptopeke, Sewells Point, and Cambridge are not smooth but with fluctuations. In the upper Bay, the modeled water elevations are a little bit underestimated before the peak but matched the peak. In fact, based on the wind comparisons, it is known that the NAM wind and pressure have several fluctuations that would generate the fluctuations o f water elevations. As shown in Table 3.3, for the water elevations generated with the NAM wind, the RMS is within 0.17 m in the lower Bay and is within 0.21 m in the upper Bay. The mean RMS is 0.18 m. The mean relative error is 6.09%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.96, and the mean skill score is 0.97. So the water elevations generated with the NAM wind are worse than those generated with the GFS wind, which is consistent with the idea that the quality o f the NAM wind is worse than that o f the GFS wind. The water elevations generated with the WRF-GFS wind matched the observations very well lower Bay (CBBT). As shown in Figure 3.35, the water elevations are underpredicted at station Baltimore. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.19 m, the relative error E is 3.80 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.99 and the skill score is 0.98. In Figure 3.36, the modeled water elevations are compared well with the observations at station Lewisetta. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.12 m, the relative error E is 3.73 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.98 and the skill score is 0.98. In Figure 3.37, the modeled water elevations are compared very well with the observations at station CBBT. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.12 m, the relative error E is 3.82 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.97 and the skill score is 0.98. For the statistical measures at other stations, as can be seen in Table 3.4, the RMS is within 0.13 m in the lower Bay and is within 0.19 m in the upper Bay. The mean RMS is 0.15 m. The mean relative error is 4.11%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.98, and the mean skill score is 0.98. These statistical measures proved that the WRF-GFS wind generated better water elevation simulations than did either the GFS wind or the NAM wind. For the water elevations generated with the WRF-NAM wind, it can be seen in Figure 3.38 that the water elevations are underestimated both in the lower and upper Bay. In fact, the analysis o f winds and pressures in the last section showed that the pressures generated with WRF-NAM are higher than the observations during the depression. The difference between the modeled pressures and observations in the lower Bay is about 400 to 600 Pa. In terms o f the inverted barometer effect, roughly a drop o f 100 Pa could generate a 0 .0 1-m increase in water elevation. Here the pressures are 400 to 600 Pa higher than the observations, which could generate a 4-cm to 6-cm underestimation o f water elevation in the lower Bay. Statistically, the RMS o f water elevation generated with the WRF-NAM wind (Table 3.5) is within 0.18 m in the lower Bay, which is higher than that o f water elevation generated with the WRF-GFS wind (0.13m). The difference is 0.06 m, which is consistent with the inverted barometer effect. The mean RMS is 0.16 m. The mean relative error is 5.97%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.97 and the mean skill score is 0.97. Overall, the water elevations generated by the W RF-NAM wind are worse than those generated with WRF-GFS in terms o f these statistical measures. For the water elevations generated with the RAMS G ridl wind (Figure 3.39 Table 3.6, the RMS is within 0.19 m in the lower Bay and is within 0.19 m in the upper Bay. The mean RMS is 0.16 m. The mean relative error is 5.32%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.96 and the mean skill score is 0.97. Based on these statistical measures, the water elevations generated with the RAMS G ridl wind are worse than those generated by the WRF-GFS wind. The water elevations generated with the RAMS Grid2 winds (Figure 3.40) are overestimated in the lower Bay during the peak. The overestimation in the lower Bay is also due to the incorrect pressure field. In fact, the pressures generated with the RAMS Grid2 are even lower than those generated by the RAMS G ridl, so more overestimation is expected. At the same time, the wind speeds generated by the RAMS Grid2 also increased compared to that generated by the RAMS G ridl. Combining the decrease in pressure and increase in wind speeds, the water elevations are overestimated more in the lower Bay and are no longer underestimated in the upper Bay. As shown in Table 3.7, the RMS is within 0.21 m in the lower Bay and is within 0.13 m in the upper Bay. It proved that the water elevations are getting worse in the lower Bay and getting better in the upper Bay. The mean RMS is 0.15 m. The mean relative error is 4.86%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.97, and the skill score is 0.97. Overall, these are still worse than the water elevations generated with the WRF-GFS wind. The water elevations generated with the RAMS Grid3 wind (Figure 3.41) are overestimated in the lower Bay during the peak and overestimated a little bit in the upper Bay during the peak. This could be expected since the pressures generated by the RAMS Grid3 is even lower than those generated by the RAMS Grid2 and the wind speeds generated by the RAMS Grid3 are higher than those generated by the RAMS Grid2. As can be seen in Table 3.8, the RMS is within 0.23 m in the lower Bay and is within 0.16m in the upper Bay. The mean RMS is 0.17m. The mean relative error is 5.51%, the mean correlation coefficient is 0.97, and the mean skill score is 0.97. These proved that water elevations generated with the RAMS Grid3 wind are worse than those generated with the WRF-GFS wind as well. Overall, the water elevations simulated with the WRF-GFS wind and pressure fields during Hurricane Isabel are the best overall o f the simulations with the 7 different types o f winds. Water elevations simulated by the GFS wind are better than those simulated by the NAM wind. The water elevations generated with WRF-NAM, RAMS (G ridl, Grid2, Grid3) are not very good due to the poor quality o f pressure and wind fields. The quality o f the water elevation simulations is consistent with the quality o f wind and pressure fields. That means that our hydrodynamic model could generate accurate water elevations with accurate wind and pressure fields.\nFor the water elevation results with the GFS wind, it can be seen in Figure 3.   Table 3.11, the RMS in the lower Bay is around 0.12 m and in the upper Bay is around 0.26 m. The mean RMS is 0.19 m. The mean relative error is 30.62%, even worse than results with the GFS wind. In the lower Bay the relative error is from 5.99% to 7.55%, but in the upper Bay the relative error is especially high, which is more than 40%. The highest relative error is 57.11% at Annapolis. The average mean correlation coefficient is 0.83. In the lower Bay the correlation coefficient is not very bad, from 0.94 to 0.96, but in the upper Bay the correlation coefficient is less than 0.8 and the worst correlation is 0.66 at Baltimore. The mean skill score is 0.82. It is higher in the lower Bay (around 0.97) and lower in the upper Bay (from 0.65 to 0.75). These statistical measures proved that the N AM wind generated even worse water elevation than the GFS wind. For the water elevation results with the WRF-GFS wind (Figure 3.70), the water elevations in the lower Bay compared well with the observations except that they slightly underestimated on  Figure 3.71, the water elevations are underpredicted before the peak at station Baltimore. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.18 m, the relative error E is 28.0 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.90 and the skill score is 0.84. In Figure   3.72, the modeled water elevations are underpredicted before the peak at station Lewisetta. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.18 m, the relative error E is 12.94 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.97 and the skill score is 0.93. In Figure 3.73, the modeled water elevations are compared very well with the observations at station CBBT. The RMS error o f the water elevations is 0.14 m, the relative error E is 8.96 %, the correlation coefficient r is 0.96 and the skill score is 0.95. The statistical measures for all the stations in the Bay are shown in Table 3.12. The RMS in the lower Bay is around 0.14 m and in the upper Bay is around 0.18 m. The mean RMS is 0.17m, which is better than those obtained by using the GFS and NAM winds. The mean relative error is 19.13. In the lower Bay the relative error is from 8.00% to 8.96%, but in the upper Bay, the relative error is higher, which is more than 20%. Second, there might be some processes already going on before Tropical Storm Ernesto. It is possible that before this period, some processes that drive the water into the bay were already going on, but our model did not catch it since our simulation is not last long enough. In fact, from the plots o f pressures, it seems like there is a low pressure before the TS Ernesto came. This low pressure might cause a small surge in the Bay which is not simulated by our model and thus the underestimation appeared from 8/30/2006 to 9/1/2006. These are only the possible reasons. Additional studies need to be done in order to determine the exact cause o f the underestimation."}, {"section_title": "Inundation simulation", "text": "Inundation simulation is using the high-resolution small domain grid with the outputs o f the large domain model as the open boundary condition. The inundation simulation is only using WRF-GFS wind since it is the best wind available.

It can be seen in Figure 3.42 that the model is shown to reproduce the peak flood levels to a high degree o f accuracy. It is hard to find the exact inundation map for the lower Bay during Hurricane Isabel, but the The inundation map above from VDEM is the MOM map which represents the worst scenario of inundation for each category hurricane, thus, the coverage o f inundated area will be larger than that generated by our model with the same category hurricane.  is estimated at 40 knot. By 1800 UTC that day, extratropical Ernesto was centered very near Washington, D.C., and after that time the system began to weaken. On 3 September, it was no longer producing gale-force winds as it accelerated across Pennsylvania and New York into Southeastern Canada, and it was absorbed into a larger extratropical low pressure system the next day (Knabb et al., 2006).  The WRF-GFS modeled speeds (Figure 3.56) compared with the observations very well at Stations CBBT, Rappahanock, Cambridge and Thomas Point. At Station Lewisetta, the modeled wind speeds matched the observation quite well except for a fluctuation during the peak. At Station Tolchester Beach, the modeled wind speeds are overestimated more than GFS and NAM winds. In Figure 3.57, the modeled directions matched the observations well. In Figure 3.58, the  Table 3.9. As can be seen in Table 3.9, for wind speed, the fluctuations existing in the pressures generated by all three models. The pressure gradients generated by the WRF-GFS model are smoother than those generated by GFS and NAM. In summary, the best wind obtained was by using the WRF-GFS wind for the Bay area and the GFS wind for the other areas that the WRF model does not cover, but the quality o f the wind is worse than that for Isabel.\nThe inundation simulation for TS Ernesto is only using the WRF-GFS wind as well since it is the best wind available. Only the modeled water elevations o f the stations in the lower Bay are compared with the observations. As can be seen in Figure 3.74, the model is shown to reproduce the peak flood levels to a high degree o f accuracy. It is hard to find the exact inundation map for the lower Bay during Tropical Storm Ernesto, so the storm surge inundation map from www.vaemergence.com is still used for the comparison. Ernesto was even weaker than a Category 1 hurricane, the modeled inundation map is generally consistent with but the inundated area is less than the storm surge inundation map generated by VDEM. Figure 3.   In Figure 4.1, plots o f 30 hour-length water elevations at station CBBT were generated with different forecasting winds. It is obvious that the water elevations generated with different winds do have differences. The water elevations generated with WRF-GFS winds matched the observations the best. The water elevations generated with NAM and WRF-NAM winds were underestimated during the peak and overestimated after the peak. The water elevations generated with RAMS winds (Grid 1, Grid2, and Grid3) were overestimated during the peak and underestimated after the peak. Figure 4.2 shows the difference between the modeled and observed water elevations at station CBBT. It can be seen that the water elevations generated with WRF-NAM and NAM were underestimated as low as approximately 0.5 m during the peak period and overestimated more than 0.5 m after the peak. The water elevations generated with RAMS Grid 1 wind were overestimated 0.7 m during the peak and underestimated 0.3 m after the peak. The difference between the modeled water elevations generated by WRF-GFS wind and the observations is generally within 0.2 m. For Station Kiptopeke in the lower Bay, it can be seen in Figure 4.3 that the pattern o f the time series plot o f water elevations generated with different winds is quite similar to that at Station CBBT. Figure 4.4 shows the difference between the modeled and observed water elevations at Station Kiptopeke. It can be seen that the water elevations generated with WRF-NAM and NAM were underestimated as low as about 0.4 m during the peak period and overestimated about 0.5 m after the peak. The water elevations generated with RAMS G ridl wind are overestimated 0.5 m over the peak and underestimated 0.3 m after the peak. The difference o f the modeled water elevations by WRF-GFS wind and observations is generally within 0.2m. For Station Sewells Point in the lower Bay, it can be seen in Figure 4.5 that the water elevations generated with different winds have an even larger deviation than those at Stations CBBT and Kiptopeke. Figure 4.6 shows the difference between the modeled and observed water elevations at Station Sewells Point. It can be seen that the water elevations generated with WRF-NAM and NAM were underestimated as low as 0.5 m during the peak period and overestimated more than 0.5 m after the peak. The water elevations generated with RAMS G ridl wind were overestimated about 0.9 m during the peak and underestimated 0.4 m after the peak. The difference o f the modeled water elevations by WRF-GFS wind and observations is generally within 0.3m. It can be seen at the three stations in the lower Bay (CBBT, Kiptopeke and Sewells Point), the patterns o f the water elevation plots with different winds are very similar. The observations are generally in the envelope generated by the ensemble water elevations. The deviation increases from the Bay mouth to the inner lower Bay. As can be seen in Figure 4.7, at Station Lewisetta the deviation o f the water elevations generated with different winds decreased compared with that at Station Sewells Point. The water elevations generated with WRF-GFS and GFS winds were overestimated after the peak. The water elevations generated with NAM and W RF-NAM winds were underestimated during the peak and overestimated after the peak. The water elevations generated with RAMS winds (G ridl, Grid2, and Grid3) compare well with the observations. Figure 4.8 shows the difference between the modeled and observed water elevations at Station Lewisetta. It can be seen that the difference between the water elevations generated with WRF-NAM and NAM is larger than that in the lower Bay. The water elevations generated with W RF-NAM winds were underestimated by about 0.3 m during the peak period, but the water elevations generated with NAM winds were underestimated by about 0.5 m during the peak. The water elevations generated with WRF-GFS winds are overestimated 0.3 m after the peak. The difference o f the modeled water elevations by RAMS winds and observations is generally within 0.3 m. For Station Cambridge, it can be seen in Figure 4.9 that the deviation o f the water elevations generated with different winds increased. The water elevations generated with NAM and WRF-NAM winds are underestimated over the peak. The water elevations generated with other winds are not so bad. Figure 4.10 shows the difference between the modeled and observed water elevations at Station Cambridge. It can be seen that the water elevations generated with WRF-NAM and NAM are overestimated about 0.4 m and 0.2 m separately before the peak and underestimated 0.7 m and 0.9 m separately during the peak period. The water elevations generated with WRF-GFS winds are overestimated 0.3 m after the peak. The difference o f the modeled water elevations by RAMS wind and observations is generally within 0.4 m. For the three stations in the upper Bay (Annapolis, Baltimore and Tolchester Beach), as can be seen in Figure 4.11, Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.15, respectively, the deviation o f the water elevations generated with different winds increases while moving to the upper Bay. The deviation is mainly from WRF-NAM and NAM winds. At these stations, the water elevations generated with NAM and WRF-NAM winds are underestimated during the peak and overestimated before the peak. Beach after the peak. The water elevations generated with NAM are underestimated 1.2 m at Annapolis, 1.4 m at Baltimore, and 1.5 m at Tolchester Beach during the peak. As can be seen in the figures o f ensemble results, the observed water elevations generally fell in the range o f the water elevations generated with different winds. So our storm surge model could generate a range o f the modeled storm surge and give the best and worst conditions that would occur. From the comparisons, it can be seen that the WRF-GFS and GFS winds are generally more reliable than other winds for most o f the stations in the Bay and the WRF-NAM and NAM winds are the two most unreliable winds. The WRF-NAM and NAM winds could generate more than 1 meter error in water elevation simulations, so when the N AM and W RF-NAM winds are included in the ensemble runs, one should be careful utilizing the results. A possible way is to exclude the NAM and W RF-NAM winds while forecasting. This study only generated the range o f possible water elevations with different winds during Hurricane Isabel, but did not generate water elevation predictions by averaging all the water elevations simulated with different winds because the simple average was unable to yield good water elevations. More studies should be done in order to utilize the ensemble techniques. Initially, we set up the storm surge model in two-dimensional mode. It was found that the water elevation in the lower bay is overestimated after the peak water level during Hurricane Isabel (Figure 4.17). Several attempts had been tried in solving this problem. Eventually, it was discovered that the overestimation only occurred when the wind blew from the south toward the north. Given the only one vertical layer o f 2D model, Ekman transport may not be accurately simulated. In this situation, without enough Ekman transport to drive the water out o f the Bay, the model simulation inside the Bay is overestimated. In other words, this overestimation could be due to the artifact o f formulation in 2D model which is unable to resolve the vertical structure o f Ekman layer. In the continental shelf, the water column has a minimum o f a surface Ekman layer, an interior layer, and a bottom Ekman layer, which a one-layer 2D model cannot resolve. Ideally, the best way to test the hypothesis is to set up a full blown three-dimensional model with fine resolution in the vertical everywhere. As has been discussed in Chapter 2, section 2.2.4, it is not practical and overkill to develop a full 3D model with all baroclinic effects included for storm surge prediction. As a compromise, a quasi-3D model was set up, in which baroclinic effect is neglected, and the resolution in the vertical grid given is relatively coarse. The detail assignment o f the vertical grid was described in page 34, Chapter 3. One o f the issues associated with setting up the quasi-3D model is how to specify vertical eddy viscosity. Traditionally, twoand-a-half-equation turbulent closures were used in the 3D model, but since our model is only a quasi-3D model, these methods were not used. Instead, a semi-empirical formulation from Davies (1997), as discussed the in Chapter 2, section 2.2.4, was employed in our model. The same parameters used in the 2D model for the bottom drag coefficient were used in the 3D model. As can be seen in Figure 4.18, with the quasi-3D model, much improved results were obtained and the previous problem o f overestimation (after the storm peak) no longer exists. In addition, the current velocity and eddy viscosity profiles for the 3D and the 2D model were investigated. The location chosen was at node 25165 in the continental shelf (Figure 4   Coriolis force. It can be seen in Figure 4.22 that with Coriolis force, the modeled water elevation matches the observations very well, but without the Coriolis force, the water level before the peak is underestimated and after the peak is overestimated. This could be explained as follows: Without Coriolis force, the Ekman effect was missing. As a consequence, when the north to northeast wind was blowing (From 9/17/2003 0:00 UTC to 9/18/2003 12:00 UTC), there is not enough water driven into the Bay (right hand side o f the wind direction). In contrast, after the storm peak, when the southeast and south wind is blowing (9/19/2003 0:00 UTC to 9/19/2003 22:00 UTC), without the Ekman transport, the water in the Bay mouth area was overestimated because water was not driven offshore quickly enough. This experiment validated the hypothesis that the Ekman dynamics is an important process that drives the water exchanged between the bay and the continental shelf. It also demonstrated that a quasi-three dimensional model can improve the simulation if the Ekman layer structure in the vertical is incorporated. It is worth noting that turning o ff the Coriolis force will not only influence the simulation o f Ekman dynamics but also other geophysical processes, such as, Kelvin wave (a wave in the ocean that balances the Earth's Coriolis force against a topographic boundary), geostrophic current (a balance between the Coriolis effect and the pressure gradient force in the continental shelf), and so on. These processes will not be simulated correctly when the Coriolis force is turned off. During the strong wind, however, the Ekman dynamics are the most dominant process that involves the Coriolis force; thus our experiment manifests the importance o f the Coriolis force associated with Ekman dynamics."}, {"section_title": "Wind and pressure comparison", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Specification o f limited domain boundary condition", "text": "During the hurricane, the water elevation in the continental shelf is dynamically very different from the water elevations in a normal tide condition. The rapid changes o f water elevations in the continental shelf must also have dramatic influence on the water elevations in the Bay. Thus, for an accurate inundation simulation, it is necessary to specify a proper open boundary condition using the water elevation outputs from the large domain model for the high-resolution limited domain model. To test the importance o f the open boundary condition for the small limited domain, two simulations -one with tide boundary condition and the other with outputs from the large domain model -were run using exact the same inputs and parameters. The results are shown in Figure 4.23, Figure 4.24 and Figure 4.25 for the lower Bay, middle Bay and upper Bay, respectively. It can be seen in Figure 4.23 that for the simulation with the outputs from the large domain as the boundary conditions (red line), the modeled water elevations matched the observations in the lower Bay very well. For the simulation with tide as the boundary conditions (black line), the water elevations at the three stations in the lower Bay are simulated quite well before the peak and during the peak, but the water elevations drop quickly after the peak and are underestimated about 0.5 m after 9/19 3:00 UTC. As can be seen in Figure 4.24, the water elevations at the three stations in the middle Bay from the simulation using the tide as the boundary condition are underestimated about 0.3 m during the peak and are underestimated about 0.5 m after the peak. For the three stations in the upper Bay, the water elevations from the simulation using the tide as the boundary condition are underestimated before and during the peak (Figure 4.25). The underestimation is around 0.3 m to 0.5 m. This experiment demonstrated that it is necessary for the limited domain model inundation model to use the outputs from the large domain model as the open boundary condition. Otherwise, it will cause 30 to 50 cm underestimation o f the water elevation during a hurricane. This in turn will cause the model to generate an incorrect inundation map."}, {"section_title": "Effect o f the accuracy o f topographic data on inundation simulation", "text": "The accurate simulation o f the inundation highly depends on the resolution o f the grid covering the land area. It might be adequate to use a relatively low-resolution grid for an area where the topography does not significantly change, but it is not proper to use a low-resolution grid for an area with different kinds o f topographic features. For example, if there is a sand bar or sea wall along a low-lying coastal area, this area may not be inundated with the protection o f these features. The simulation will be correct when a high-resolution grid is used and these features are well-represented. However, a low-resolution grid may generate the results that this area is inundated during a hurricane, which is totally wrong. That is why the high-resolution grid was generated for the Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads area. However, the high-resolution grid can not guarantee the correct inundation results without accurate topographic data. Here an experiment is conducted to examine the influence o f the high-resolution grid with and without accurate LiDAR data on the inundation. Two simulations are conducted with the same setup and using the water elevation outputs from the large domain model as the open boundary condition. The only difference for the two simulations is that one horizontal grid is with accurate LiDAR data as the topography but the other not. Figure 4.26 shows the inundation map at 9/18/2003 2 1:00 UTC generated by the simulation using the LiDAR data and Figure 4.27 shows the inundation map at the same time but generated by the simulation using the grid without LiDAR data. In fact, there are several obvious differences. 3 areas are selected for the comparison and each area is labeled with a number. For area 1, the simulation with LiDAR data shows no inundation occurred in this area near the Back Bay in Virginia Beach, but the simulation without LiDAR data shows a large area is inundated. It might be due to that the sea wall along the Virginia Beach protecting these low-lying areas from inundation, but the simulation without from the Virginia Department o f Emergency Management, it can be seen that the inundation generated by the grid with LiDAR data is more realistic.
