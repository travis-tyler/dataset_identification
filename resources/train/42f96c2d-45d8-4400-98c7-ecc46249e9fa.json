[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Vulnerability assessments combine quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of species or natural communities to current and future threats. When combined with the economic, ecological or evolutionary value of the species, vulnerability assessments quantify the relative risk to regional species and natural communities and can enable informed prioritization of conservation efforts. Vulnerability assessments are common practice in conservation biology, including the potential impacts of future climate scenarios. However, geographic variation in scenarios and vulnerabilities is rarely quantified. This gap is particularly limiting for informing ecosystem management given that conservation practices typically vary by sociopolitical boundaries rather than by ecological boundaries. To support prioritization of conservation actions across a range of spatial scales, we conducted the Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment (GCVA) for four natural communities and eleven focal species around the Gulf of Mexico based on current and future threats from climate change and land-use practices out to 2060. We used the Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value (SIVVA) tool to assess both natural community and species vulnerabilities. We observed greater variation across ecologically delineated subregions within the Gulf Coast of the U.S. than across climate scenarios. This novel finding suggests that future vulnerability assessments incorporate regional variation and that conservation prioritization may vary across ecological subregions. Across subregions and climate scenarios the most prominent threats were legacy effects, primarily from habitat loss and degradation, that compromised the adaptive capacity of species and natural communities. The second most important threats were future threats from sea-level rise.

Due to threats from climate change and other factors, conservation agencies and organizations are often tasked with assessing threats to species and natural communities and prioritizing conservation actions. Vulnerability assessments are tools that can be used in this process [2] . Often, these assessments are executed at small spatial and short temporal scales that reflect the constraints and priorities of the executing agency more than they reflect biology and extirpation or extinction risk [3] [4] [5] . We conducted a multi-scale, multi-species and multi-habitat vulnerability assessment within a global biodiversity hotspot (northern Gulf of Mexico, USA) [6] to assess and help prioritize conservation efforts and to investigate the degree to which spatio-temporal scale impacts assessment and prioritization. Previous assessments in the Gulf region have focused on the state or regional-level [7] and none explicitly combined climate change, sea-level rise, and traditional land-use threats into a single vulnerability assessment.\nNumerous methods exist for assessing the vulnerability of species and natural communities [3] and using that information in a prioritization process [8] [9] [10] [11] . Many of these methodologies assess vulnerability to a specific threat, such as the impact of land-use or climate change, or separately evaluate the costs and logistics of potential mitigation strategies. For these tools to be effective for prioritization, there must be a way for individual assessments to be holistically considered in the decision-making process. Tools such as the Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value (SIVVA) [11, 12] are modular and have the capacity to include multiple metrics such as vulnerability and value into a single prioritization system. SIVVA provides an easy to use instrument that can be applied at the species or natural community level, providing the flexibility to use the same tool with multiple units of assessment. The SIVVA framework also quantifies the relative value that species might possess to aid in their prioritization. Values include elevated priority if, for example, a species is evolutionarily unique, economically important, locally endemic, or of ecological importance as a highly interactive species [13] . Previous applications of SIVVA include statewide assessments in Florida [11, 14] and Georgia [15] .\nWe conducted a multi-scale, multi-species and multi-habitat vulnerability assessment of the northern Gulf of Mexico to enhance conservation planning and implementation while supporting the goals of regional stakeholders. The Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment (GCVA) used the SIVVA framework to assess the vulnerability of four natural communities and a set of eleven associated focal species to develop a prioritization framework for conservation efforts that examined multiple threats. This effort is the first to assess and compare vulnerabilities for the same species within and across multiple spatial scales and future scenarios, and one of the first systematic vulnerability assessments to cross multiple political (US state) boundaries. We addressed three questions that have application within and beyond our study area: 1) Do vulnerabilities and priority rankings vary by region? 2) Which factors drive vulnerability and priority rankings in this region? Globally, land-use patterns are the primary driver of extinctions and extinction risk [16] [17] [18] [19] , but in coastal regions sea-level rise may play a larger role [11] . 3) Do conservation values and the way different types of information is weighted matter? Previous work has shown relatively modest impacts of alternative value systems as reflected by differential weighting of vulnerability and value criteria [11, 15] ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Experts provided assessments on natural communities and species using the SIVVA tool (section 2.1). We first outlined the study area of interest (section 2.2), defined the natural communities and species (section 2.3) of interest, and developed multiple maps and scenarios (section 2.4) to inform expert assessments. Statistical analyses relative to our hypotheses are given in section 2.5."}, {"section_title": "SIVVA criteria", "text": "Separate applications of the SIVVA tool were used to evaluate species and natural communities. For species, we used SIVVA as described in [11, 12] . A table of criteria used in the SIVVA for species analysis is available in S1 Table. For natural communities, we used a separate incarnation of the SIVVA tool designed especially for natural communities [14] . A description of the SIVVA for natural communities (SIVVA NATCOM) assessment tool can be found in S1 Table and elsewhere [14] . Both versions have the same scoring system within a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Experts are given specific guidelines for each criterion on how to provide a numerical score between 0 and 6. In this scoring system, a 0 means that not enough information is available; a score of 1 or 2 means positive impacts; a score of 3 means no impact; and a score of 4, 5, or 6 means increasingly negative impacts.\nCriteria within each module of SIVVA are weighted and weights may be adjusted. A summary score was computed for each module by multiplying the weight of the criteria by the score from 1 to 6 and normalizing by the maximum total number of points, which creates a value on a scale from 0 to 1. An overall prioritization score was tallied by averaging across modules. Computing a mean score across all modules with equal weighting assumes that information on status, vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and conservation value should all be weighed equally in a prioritization scheme. A variety of value schemes exist in the field of conservation biology [20] ; to reflect these differences we present four alternative weighting systems that differentially weight the score from each module (see Results). These alternative weighting schemes are one way of examining how variable priorities are under different value systems that might, for example, elevate the importance of conservation value over vulnerability, or vice versa.\nIn SIVVA NATCOM there are three modules: Ecosystem Status, Vulnerability, and Conservation Value. The Ecosystem Status module draws heavily from the IUCN framework [21, 22] . Ecosystem status includes three sets of criteria, of which the set with the highest score (the worst status) is counted and the others are ignored (S1 Table) . The first set of criteria assesses the decline in area over the last fifty years, since 1750 (pre-Columbian era), and over any 50-year period including the present and future. The second set of criteria assesses the decline in ecosystem function over the same three timeframes. The third set of three criteria assesses the rarity of an ecosystem type with a focus on important differences between geographic extent, area of occupancy, and total area. These differences address the subtleties of how area is calculated; for example, several small, isolated habitat patches that form the same area as fewer large and continuous patches.\nThe second module is Vulnerability and includes nine criteria (S1 Table) . These include quantitative estimates of area loss due to sea-level rise and land use change. Qualitative assessments include the impacts of fragmentation, alteration of disturbance regime, altered hydrology, inherent or imposed limits on range shifts, degradation of the abiotic environment, and other factors that would alter biotic processes and interactions.\nThe third module is Conservation Value and includes three criteria. These criteria assess the endemism of the community type, the number of highly interactive or rare species within that community, and the ecosystem services provided. The benefits of SIVVA NATCOM over existing assessments is that while it includes all of the major categories of existing tools, it also standardizes the score (a number between zero and one), provides a flexible framework for weighing different types of information differently, and is transparent in the way that different information is valued.\nIn SIVVA for Species there are four modules. The Vulnerability (Exposure + Sensitivity) module contains twelve criteria that address threats such as habitat loss to sea-level rise, erosion, and land use change, and species sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, and salinity changes. The Adaptive Capacity module contains six criteria that address intrinsic characteristics of the species that may allow it to cope with projected changes, such as species mobility, genetic diversity, and ability to colonize new areas. The Conservation Value module includes five criteria on endemism, evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological interactions, ecosystem services, and recovery potential. The Information Availability module includes five criteria on the data available for a species' life history and documented responses to threats. The criteria are explained further in [11, 12] ."}, {"section_title": "SIVVA execution", "text": "The GCVA used expert opinion that was gathered through SIVVA.

These scenarios bracket uncertainty related to economic growth and global versus local sustainability efforts.\nSea surface temperature (SST) and surface ocean salinity (SOS) came from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios 2.6 and 8.5 in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) [37] .

The influence of individual assessors on the resulting scores was evaluated by comparing their mean scores to the mean valuation across all assessors and by ensuring that variation across assessors for the same species or natural community was less than the mean variation across all assessments of species or natural communities, respectively.\nTo address our first question we determined how much variation in SIVVA scores was due to climate scenarios versus geographic subregions using a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). To address our second question we identified drivers of vulnerability rankings by listing the vulnerability criteria most highly ranked for each natural community and focal species. We addressed our third question about conservation values and the implications of weighing different types of information unequally by re-ranking natural communities and species under four distinct weighting schemes and assessing the impact on prioritization ranks.\nTwo types of uncertainty were accounted for: (1) scoring uncertainty, when an expert thinks more than one value is likely; and, (2) insufficient knowledge due to limited data available for the species. These two types of uncertainty are distinct: scoring uncertainty reflects uncertainty about the impacts of a vulnerability, whereas insufficient knowledge reflects a lack of information about a source of vulnerability. There may be limited direct life history data available for a given species, but the implications of sea-level rise for that species might be highly certain; for example a rare orchid may be poorly known to science but no orchids thrive in salt water inundation (high certainty but low information availability). Alternatively, a species may have high information availability, such as the well-studied Gulf Sturgeon, but low certainty about how this species will respond to sea-level rise. To account for scoring uncertainty, assessors could check a box next to the criterion to show they are not sure of the proper score, which is a value between 1 and 6. When this box is checked, in the final score computation, 0, +1, or -1 is added to the score that is marked as uncertain, and 1000 Monte Carlo simulations are run to recalculate the effect on the overall score. For example, if the user chooses a value of 3.5 for one criterion, the final score calculation measures the impact of 1000 simulations where that score is changed to 3.5 + 1 = 4.5, 3.5-1 = 2.5, or 3.5 + 0 = 3.5 to assess the variation on the summary score. If that criterion is heavily weighted, this uncertainty will impact the final summary score much more than if it is not heavily weighted, such that uncertainty about a fairly trivial criterion is not equivalent to uncertainty about a critical criterion. Insufficient knowledge is accounted for by reporting the proportion of criteria scored and by comparing the summary score to the proportion calculated as the total points divided by the maximum possible points available if all criteria had been scored.\nOur assessments included both quantitative and qualitative scores. We elected to treat SIVVA scores as quantitative variables because they conformed to normality according to Shapiro-Wilks test.

Similar to the assessments of natural communities, ecosystem services were the most influential component of the Conservation Value module. Lastly, the criterion that consistently ranked the highest in the Information Availability module was the availability of published literature on basic life history. In this module, high scores translate into high information availability and thus an elevated priority. This result was not surprising given that the high profile of the species we assessed typically meant that these species were also well-studied. As with natural communities, species vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity showed little spatial variation by subregion, but high variability across climate scenarios (Fig 4; see section  3 .3.2). Vulnerability scores tended to be higher than Adaptive Capacity or Conservation Value scores (Fig 5, Table 3 ).

This work demonstrates significant regional variation in vulnerability, with little to no effect of climate model choice on the resulting assessment (Figs 2 and 4) . This finding is important because climate model projections vary dramatically, particularly at timescales of 50 to 100 years into the future [48] . One consequence of this variability is that researchers frequently bracket the uncertainty in their assessments of extinction risk using low, mid-range, and high change climate models [49] . The variability across these models can be dramatic, resulting in projected global biodiversity losses from 18% at the low end to up to 35% of species diversity [19] . Ours is among the first to compare variation due to climate model to regional variation within the same species or natural community. The degree to which climate scenario matters less than regional spatial variability warrants further research, particularly given that our timeline extended to 2060 and most climate projections do not deviate from each other dramatically until between 2050 and 2100. Future research should assess both the impacts of climate model on extinction risk, vulnerability, and prioritization, but also the degree to which regionally distinct populations react to threats. In the case of the GCVA, that regional variation in adaptive capacity greatly exceeded variation due to climate models. Vulnerability assessment of Gulf Coast, USA Among the future threats that species and natural communities face, we find that sea-level rise is a major and primary contributor to vulnerability. However, the presence of pathways to migrate is as or more important than the direct impacts of sea-level rise, and our assessment reveals significant regional variation in the presence of pathways to migrate inland or upslope. Thus, while the impacts of sea-level rise vary regionally due to tidally adjusted elevations and slope profiles [50] , this variation may be negligible relative to differences in the adaptive capacity of species and communities to shift their distributions [51, 52] . We found that regional variation in land-use impacts, which may squeeze species \"between the devil and the deep blue sea\" are as or more important than regional variation in sea-level rise [53] ."}, {"section_title": "Historical habitat loss and degradation affect vulnerability and value more than projected future threats from climate change (or anything else)", "text": "The current status of all four natural communities was ranked by assessors as having a greater influence on future viability than the vulnerability to projected threats (Fig 3) . It is possible that the legacy impacts of land-use since the Industrial Revolution are difficult to assess with as much precision as those of future threats, but in our case assessor uncertainty was low relative to the differences between current ecosystem status and future vulnerability. While changes in natural community extent since the Industrial Revolution have been extensive in the southeastern US [54] , much of the southeastern coastal plain flora and fauna remained relatively stable for millions of years prior to the Industrial Revolution [6] . This stability prior to human influence suggests an innate adaptive capacity in species and natural communities to deal with climate and sea-level rise oscillations. Projected changes in climate and sea-level rise out to 2060 or even 2100 are not outside of the variation experienced in this region over the last 100,000 years [55] [56] [57] [58] . Natural communities would therefore potentially be able to respond to expected climate change variability in the next century, but that innate ability is compromised by human land-use and loss of ecosystem extent and health. While climate change poses a serious threat to species and natural communities, the primary drivers of extinction risk are still the legacy effects of two centuries of habitat loss and degradation [59, 60] .\nOur assessment included a criterion on potential indirect impacts due to deteriorated abiotic conditions or the loss of key biotic interactions; however, the lack of data made this criterion difficult to evaluate for many assessors. This is a key area for future research because many extinctions linked to climate change are often indirect [61] as a result of the complexity of ecological interactions in natural systems. This and other data gaps, for example the lack of detailed spatial mapping of mangroves throughout much of Louisiana and Texas, are also a valuable product of this research and can be used for targeted programs that help fill these data gaps."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We address three questions that are broadly applicable outside of our study area in the Gulf Coast. First, we show that vulnerability to future threats varied significantly more by region than by climate scenarios, suggesting that future vulnerability assessments may need to evaluate the relative importance of geographic scale. Moreover, the common approach of adopting global or state rankings from the IUCN or NatureServe [62] for state or regional conservation planning may not reflect local conditions. Secondly, we demonstrated that the most variable criteria were the impacts of sea-level rise and, importantly, the potential to migrate as a potential response to sea-level rise or other encroachments. Third, we identified substantial variation in prioritization ranks across value systems representative of the broader conservation community for different stakeholders. Previous results using these methods revealed consistent rankings across these same sets of value systems [11, 12] . In those cases, the interpretation was that the species that ranked highly due to one threat or criterion, also ranked highly due to other threats and criteria. Because the threats were more homogenous in these previous assessments, differential weighting of criteria did not have a large effect. Rankings likely varied across values systems in this study because each species faced fairly unique threats. It is also possible that the variation in rankings among our species and natural communities was influenced by how we chose those entities; a random or more systematic selection process might yield different patterns, at least for species. The implication of this work for the broader conservation community is that variation in how information is weighted may or may not significantly influence the prioritization scores, particularly in the Gulf Coast. In the future, researchers should empirically assess the impact of their value systems on their resulting conservation prioritizations.\nThe GCVA allows for unique interpretations to be made for conservation actions given the hierarchical nature of our assessment, from species to the natural communities that contain those (and other) species. We find that the threats that focal species face are typically the same threats faced by the broader natural communities in which those species reside. Thus, our findings support the use of carefully chosen indicator and umbrella species for vulnerability assessments [63, 64] . We also found it striking that results with respect to regional variation in vulnerability relative to variability due to climate models were consistent in both our species and natural communities assessments-this pattern was not unique to a handful of species. The most important outcomes of this multilevel assessment for conservation are the specific threats identified (S3 File), which can be used to help guide conservation actions and mitigate conflicting interventions [65] [66] [67] .\nSupporting information S1 Table.
