[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A modern nation, as a modern business, must have adequate information on many complex interrelated aspects of its activities in order to make decisions. Land use is only one such aspect, but knowledge about land use and land cover has become increasingly important as the Nation plans to overcome the problems of haphazard, uncontrolled development, deteriorating environmental quality, loss of prime agricultural lands, destruction of important wetlands, and loss of fish and wildlife habitat. Land use data are needed in the analysis of environmental processes and problems that must be understood if living conditions and standards are to be improved or maintained at current levels.\nIn this dynamic situation, accurate, meaningful, current data on land use are essential. If public agencies and private organizations are to know what is happening, and are to make sound plans for their own future action, then reliable information is critical.\nThe variety of land use and land cover data needs is exceedingly broad. Current land use and land cover data are needed for equalization of tax assessments in many States. Land use and land cover data also are needed by Federal, State, and local agencies for water-resource inventory, flood control, water-supply planning, and waste-water treatment. Many Federal agencies need current comprehensive inventories of existing activities on public lands combined with the existing and changing uses of adjacent private lands to improve the management of public lands. Federal agencies also need land use data to assess the environmental impact resulting from the development of energy resources, to manage wildlife resources and minimize man-wildlife ecosystem conflicts, to make national summaries of land use patterns and changes for national policy formulation, and to prepare environmental impact statements and assess future impacts on environmental quality."}, {"section_title": "NEED FOR STANDARDIZATION", "text": "For many years, agencies at the various governmental levels have been collecting data about land, but for the most part they have worked independently and without coordination. Too often this has meant duplication of effort, or it has been found that data collected for a specific purpose were of little or no value for a similar purpose only a short time later.\nThere are many different sources of information on existing land use and land cover and on changes that are occurring. Local planning agencies make use of detailed information generated during ground surveys involving enumeration and observation. Interpretation of large-scale aerial photographs also has been used widely (Avery, 1968) . In some cases, supplementary information is inferred on the basis of utility hookups, building permits, and similar information. Major problems are present in the application and interpretation of the existing data. These include changes in definitions of categories and data collection methods by source agencies, incomplete data coverage, varying data age, and employment of incompatible classification systems. In addition, it is nearly impossible to aggregate the available data because of the differing classification systems used.\nThe demand for standardized land use and land cover data can only increase as we seek to assess and manage areas of critical concern for environmental control such as flood plains and wetlands, energy resource development and production areas, wildlife habitat, recreational lands, and areas such as major residential and industrial development sites.\nTwo Land use classification systems initially proposed by James R. Anderson for conference use were designed to place major reliance on remote sensing, although supplementary sources of information were assumed to be available for the more elaborate of the two (Anderson, 1971) . The classification system for the New York State Land Use and Natural Resources Inventory, developed mainly at the Center for Aerial Photographic Studies at Cornell University, had been designed for use with aerial photography at 1 :24,000 scale, and although devised specifically for New York State, it was adaptable for use elsewhere. To take advantage of the New York experience, Ernest E. Hardy and John T. Roach were invited to collaborate in preparing the definitive framework of the proposed classification. Definitions of land use categories used in New York were carefully reviewed and were modified to make them applicable to the country as a whole. The resulting classification was presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 671. Because of his past experience with the Commission on Geographic Applications of Remote Sensing of the Association of American Geographers, Richard E. Witmer was invited to participate with the others in this revision of the classification system. Attention was given mainly to the more generalized first and second levels of categorization. Definitions for each of the categories on these two levels were subjected to selective testing and evaluation by the U.S.G.S., using data obtained primarily from high altitude flights as part of the research in connection with the U.S.G.S. Central Atlantic Regional Ecological Test Site (CARETS) Project (28,800 mi2 or 74,700 km2), the Phoenix Pilot Project (31,500 mi2 or 81,500 km2), and the land use mapping for the Ozarks Regional Commission (72,000 mi2 or 186,500 km2).\nThe work of Pettinger and Poulton (1970) provided valuable insight into the land use mosaic of the Southwestern United States. Some of the categorization for barren land and rangeland suggested by these researchers has been adopted in this land use and land cover classification system."}, {"section_title": "DESIGNING A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR USE WITH REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES", "text": "There is no one ideal classification of land use and land cover, and it is unlikely that one could ever be developed. There are different perspectives in the classification process, and the process itself tends to be subjective, even when an objective numerical approach is used. There is, in fact, no logical reason to expect that one detailed inventory should be adequate for more than a short time, since land use and land cover patterns change in keeping with demands for natural resources. Each classification is made to suit the needs of the user, and few users will be satisfied with an inventory that does not meet most of their needs. In attempting to develop a classification system for use with remote sensing techniques that will provide a framework to satisfy the needs of the majority of users, certain guidelines of criteria for evaluation must first be established.\nTo begin with, there is considerable diversity of opinion about what constitutes land use, although present use of land is one of the characteristics that is widely recognized as significant for planning and management purposes. One concept that has much merit is that land use refers to, \"man's activities on land which are directly related to the land\" (Clawson and Stewart, 1965) . Land cover, on the other hand, describes, \"the vegetational and artificial constructions covering the land surface\" (Burley, 1961) .\nThe types of land use and land cover categorization developed in the classification system presented in this report can be related to systems for classifying land capability, vulnerability to certain management practices, and potential for any particular activity or land value, either intrinsic or speculative.\nConcepts concerning land cover and land use activity are closely related and in many cases have been used interchangeably. The purposes for which lands are being used commonly have associated types of cover, whether they be forest, agricultural, residential, or industrial. Remote sensing image-forming devices do not record activity directly. The remote sensor acquires a response which is based on many characteristics of the land surface, including natural or artificial cover. The interpreter uses patterns, tones, textures, shapes, and site associations to derive information about land use activities from what is basically information about land cover.\nSome activities of man, however, cannot be directly related to the type of land cover. Extensive recreational activities covering large tracts of land are not particularly amenable to interpretation from remote sensor data. For example, hunting is a very common and pervasive recreational use of land, but hunting usually occurs on land that would be classified as some type of forest, range, or agricultural land either during ground survey or image interpretation. Consequently, supplemental information is needed to identify lands used for hunting. Supplemental information such as land ownership maps also is necessary to determine the use of lands such as parks, game refuges, or water conservation districts, which may have land uses coincident with administrative boundaries not usually discernable by inventory using remote sensor data. For these reasons, types of land use and land cover identifiable primarily from remote sensor data are used as the basis for organizing this classification system. Agencies requiring more detailed land use information may need to employ more supplemental data.\nIn almost any classification process, it is rare to find the clearly defined classes that one would like. In determining land cover, it would seem simple to draw the line between land and water until one considers such problems as seasonally wet areas, tidal fiats, or marshes with various kinds of plant cover. Decisions that may seem arbitrary must be made at times, but if the descriptions of categories are complete and guidelines are explained, the inventory process can be repeated. The classification system must allow for the inclusion of all parts of the area under study and should also provide a unit of reference for each land use and land cover type.\nThe problem of inventorying and classifying multiple uses occurring on a single parcel of land will not be easily solved. Multiple uses may occur simultaneously, as in the instance of agricultural land or forest land used for recreational activities such as hunting or camping. Uses may also occur alternately, such as a major reservoir providing flood control during spring runoff and generating power during winter peak demand periods. This same reservoir may have sufficient water depth to be navigable by commercial shipping the year round and may additionally provide summer recreational opportunities. Obviously all of these activities would not be detectable on a single aerial photograph. However, interpreters have occasionally related flood control activities to drawdown easements around reservoirs detectable on imagery acquired during winter low-water levels. Similarly, major locks at water-control structures imply barge or ship traffic, and foaming tailraces indicate power generation. Pleasure-boat marinas, as well as the wakes of the boats themselves, can be detected on high-altitude photographs. Although each of these activities is detectable at some time using remote sensing, many other multiple-use situations cannot be interpreted with the same degree of success. The example of the reservoir does provide insight into another facet of the problem's solution, however, and that is the possibility and need for acquiring collateral data to aid in the understanding of a multiple-use situation.\nThe vertical arrangement of many uses above and below the actual ground surface provides additional problems for the land use interpreter. Coal and other mineral deposits under croplands or forests, electrical transmission lines crossing pastures, garages underground or on roofs of buildings, and subways beneath urban areas all exemplify situations which must be resolved by individual users and compilers of land use data.\nThe size of the minimum area which can be depicted as being in any particular land use category depends partially on the scale and resolution of the original remote sensor data or other data source from which the land use is identified and interpreted. It also depends on the scale of data compilation as well as the final scale of the presentation of the land use information. In some eases, land uses cannot be identified with the level of accuracy approaching the size of the smallest unit mappable, while in others, specific land uses can be identified which are too small to be mapped. Farmsteads, for example, are usually not distinguished from other agricultural land uses when mapping at the more generalized levels of the classification. On the other hand, these farmsteads may well be interpretable but too small to be represented at the final format scale. Analogous situations may arise in the use of other categories.\nWhen maps are intended as the format for presenting land use data, it is difficult to represent any unit area smaller than 0.10 inch (2.54mm) on a side. In addition, smaller areas cause legibility problems for the map reader. Users of computer-generated graphics are similarly constrained by the minimum size of the computer printout."}, {"section_title": "CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA", "text": "A land use and land cover classification system which can effectively employ orbital and high-altitude remote sensor data should meet the following criteria (Anderson, 1971 ):\n1. The minimum level of interpretation accuracy in the identification of land use and land cover categories from remote sensor data should be at least 85 percent. 2. The accuracy of interpretation for the several categories should be about equal. 3. Repeatable or repetitive results should be obtainable from one interpreter to another and from one time of sensing to another. 4. The classification system should be applicable over extensive areas. 5. The categorization should permit vegetation and other types of land cover to be used as surrogates for activity. 6. The classification system should be suitable for use with remote sensor data obtained at different times of the year. 7. Effective use of subcategories that can be obtained from ground surveys or from the use of larger scale or enhanced remote sensor data should be possible. 8. Aggregation of categories must be possible. 9. Comparison with future land use data should be possible. 10. Multiple uses of land should be recognized when possible.\nSome of these criteria should apply to land use and land cover classification in general, but some of the criteria apply primarily to land use and land cover data interpreted from remote sensor data.\nIt is hoped that, at the more generalized first and second levels, an accuracy in interpretation can be attained that will make the land use and land cover data comparable in quality to those obtained in other ways. For land use and land cover data needed for planning and management purposes, the accuracy of interpretation at the generalized first and second levels is satisfactory when the interpreter makes the correct interpretation 85 to 90 percent of the time. For regulation of land use activities or for tax assessment purposes, for example, greater accuracy usually will be required. Greater accuracy generally will be attained only at much higher cost. The accuracy of land use data obtained from remote sensor sources is comparable to that acquired by using enumeration techniques. For example, postenumeration surveys made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census revealed that 14 percent of all farms (but not necessarily 14 percent of the farmland) were not enumerated during the 1969 Census of Agriculture (Ingram and Prochaska, 1972) .\nIn addition to perfecting new interpretation techniques and procedures for analysis, such as the various types of image enhancement and signature identification, we can assume that the resolution capability of the various remote sensing systems will also improve. Resolution, or resolving power, of an imaging system refers to its ability to separate two objects some distance apart. In most land use applications, we are most interested in the minimum size of an area which can be recognized as having an interpretable land use or land cover type. Obviously, such a minimum area depends not only on the type and characteristics of the imaging system involved, but pragmatically also on the order of \"generation\" of the imagery, that is, how far the study image is removed in number of reproduction stages from the original record. The user should refer to the most recent information available in determining the resolution parameters of the system.\nThe kind and amount of land use and land cover information that may be obtained from different sensors depend on the altitude and the resolution of each sensor. There is little likelihood that any one sensor or system will produce good data at all altitudes. It would be desirable to evaluate each source of remote sensing data and its application solely on the basis of the qualities and characteristics of the source. However, it is common practice to transfer the data to a base map, and no matter what the guidelines are, it is difficult to use a base map without extracting some additional data from such maps. Topographic maps, road maps, and detailed city maps will generally contribute detail beyond the capabilities of the remote sensor data.\nThe multilevel land use and land cover classification system described in this report has been developed because different sensors will provide data at a range of resolutions dependent upon altitude and scale. In general, the following relations pertain, assuming a 6inch focal length camera is used in obtaining aircraft imagery."}, {"section_title": "Classification", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Level", "text": "Typical data characteristics I LANDSAT (formerly ERTS) type of data II High-altitude data at 40,000 ft (12,400 m) or above (less than l:8O,OOO scale) III Medium-altitude data taken between 10,000 and 40,000 ft (3,100 and 12,400 m) (1:20,000 to 1:80,000 scale) IV Low-altitude data taken below 10,000 ft (3,100 m) (more than 1:20,000 scale)\nAlthough land use data obtained at any level of categorization certainly should not be restricted to any particular level of user groups nor to any particular scale of presentation, information at Levels I and II would generally be of interest to users who desire data on a nationwide, interstate, or statewide basis. More detailed land use and land cover data such as those categorized at Levels III and IV usually will be used more frequently by those who need and generate local information at the intrastate, regional, county, or municipal level. It is intended that these latter levels of categorization will be developed by the user groups themselves, so that their specific needs may be satisfied by the categories they introduce into the structure. Being able to aggregate more detailed categories into the categories at Level II being adopted by the U.S.G.S. is desirable if the classification system is to be useful. In general, Level II land use and land cover data interface quite effectively with point and line data available on the standard U.S.G.S. topographic maps.\nThis general relationship between the categorization level and the data source is not intended to restrict users to particular scales, either in the original data source from which the land use information is compiled or in the final map product or other graphic device. Level I land use information, for example, while efficiently and economically gathered over large areas by a LANDSAT type of satellite or from high-altitude imagery, could also be interpreted from conventional large-scale aircraft imagery or compiled by ground survey. This same information can be displayed at a wide variety of scales ranging from a standard topographic map scale, such as 1:24,000 or even larger, to the much smaller scale of the orbital imagery, such as 1 :1,000,000. Similarly, several Level II categories (and, in some instances, Level III categories) have been interpreted from LANDSAT data. Presently, though, Level II categories are obtained more accurately from high altitude photographs. Much Level III and Level IV land use and land cover data can also be obtained from high altitude imagery. This level of categorization can also be presented at a wide range of scales. However, as the more detailed levels of categorization are used, more dependence necessarily must be placed on higher resolution remote sensor data and supplemental ground surveys.\nThe principal remote sensor source for Level II data at the present time is high-altitude, color-infrared photography. Scales smaller than 1:80,000 are characteristic of high-altitude photographs, but scales from 1: 24,000 to 1: 250,000 generally have been used for the final map products.\nThe same photography which now is used to construct or update 1: 24,000 topographic maps or orthophotoquads at similar scales is a potential data source for inventorying land use and land cover. The orthophoto base, in particular, commonly can enable rapid interpretation of Levels I and II information at relatively low cost. The cost of acquiring more detailed levels of land use and land cover data might prohibit including such data on large-scale maps over extensive areas.\nRecent experiments (Stevens and others, 1974) The categories proposed at Level II cannot all be interpreted with equal reliability. In parts of the United States, some categories may be extremely difficult to interpret from high-altitude aircraft imagery alone. Conventional aerial photography and sources of information other than remote sensor data may be needed for interpretation of especially complex areas. On the basis of research and testing carried out in the U.S.G.S. Geography Program's Central Atlantic Regional Ecological Test Site (CARETS) Project, the Phoenix Pilot Project, and in land use mapping for the Ozarks Regional Commission (U.S. Geological Survey, 1973) , it has been determined that the cost of using such supplementary information can be held to reasonable levels.\nAt Level III, which is beyond the scope of the present discussion, use of substantial amounts of supplemental information in addition to some remotely sensed information at scales of 1 :15,000 to 1: 40,000 should be anticipated. Surprisingly detailed inventories may be undertaken, and by using both remotely sensed and supplemental information, most land use and land cover types, except those of very complex urban areas or of thoroughly heterogeneous mixtures can be adequately located, measured, and coded.\nLevel IV would call for much more supplemental information and remotely sensed data at a much larger scale."}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPING THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM", "text": "In developing the classification system, every effort has been made to provide as much compatibility as possible with other classification systems currently being used by the various Federal agencies involved in land use inventory and mapping. Special attention has been paid to the definitions of land use categories used by other agencies, to the extent that they are useful in categorizing data obtained from remote sensor sources.\nThe definition of Urban or Built-up Land, for example, includes those uses similarly classified (Wooten and Anderson, 1957) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, plus the built-up portions of major recreational sites, public installations, and other similar facilities. Agricultural land has been defined to include Cropland and Pasture; Orchards, Groves, Vineyards, Nurseries, and Ornamental Horticultural Areas; and Confined Feeding Operations as the principal components. Certain land uses such as pasture, however, cannot be separated consistently and accurately by using the remote sensor data sources appropriate to the more generalized levels of the classification. The totality of the category thus closely parallels the U.S. Department of Agriculture definition of agricultural land.\nThe primary definition of Forest Land employed for use with data acquired by remote sensors approximates that used by the U.S. Forest Service (unpublished manual), with the exception of those brush and shrubform types such as chaparral and mesquite, which are classed as forest land by the Forest Service because of their importance in watershed control. Because of their spectral response, these generally are grouped with Rangeland types in classifications of vegetation interpretable from remote sensing imagery.\nThe principal concept by which certain types of cover are included in the Rangeland category, and which separates rangeland from pasture land, is that rangeland has a natural climax plant cover of native grasses, forbs, and shrubs which is potentiality useful as a grazing or forage resource (U.S. Congress, 1936; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1962 , 1971 . Although these rangelands usually are not seeded, fertilized, drained, irrigated, or cultivated, if the forage cover is improved, it is managed primarily like native vegetation, and the forage resource is regulated by varying the intensity and seasonality of grazing (Stoddard and Smith, 1955) . Since the typical cropland practices mentioned just above are characteristics of some pasture lands, these pasture lands are similar in image signature to cropland types.\nThe definition of Wetland incorporates the major elements of the original U.S. Department of the Interior definition (Shaw and Fredine, 1956 ) as well as the combined efforts of the U.S.G.S. working group on wetlands definition. The land use and land cover classification system presented in this report (table 2) includes only the more generalized first and second levels. The system satisfies the three major attributes of the classification process as outlined by Grigg (1965) : (1) it gives names to categories by simply using accepted terminology; (2) it enables information to be transmitted; and (3) it allows inductive generalizations to be made. The classification system is capable of further refinement on the basis of more extended and varied use. At the more generalized levels it should meet the principal objective of providing a land use and land cover classification system for use in land use planning and management activities. Attainment of the more fundamental and long-range objective of providing a standardized system of land use and land cover classification for national and regional studies will depend on the improvement that should result from widespread use of the system. As further advances in technology are made, it may be necessary to modify the classification system for use with automatic data analysis. The LANDSAT and Skylab missions and the high-altitude aircraft program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have offered opportunities for nationwide testing of the feasibility of using this classification system to obtain land use information on a uniform basis.\nThe approach to land use and land cover classification embodied in the system described herein is \"resource oriented,\" in contrast, for example, with the \"people orientation\" of the \"Standard Land Use Coding Manual,\" developed by the U.S. Urban Renewal Administration and the Bureau of Public Roads (1965) . For the most part the Manual is derived from the \"Standard Industrial Classification Code\" established and published by the former Bureau of the Budget (U.S. Executive Office of the President, 1957).\nThe people-oriented system of the \"Standard Land Use Coding Manual\" assigns seven of the nine generalized first level categories to urban, transportation, recreational, and related uses of land, which account for less than 5 percent of the total area of the United States (tables 1 and 3). Although there is an obvious need for an urban-oriented land use classification system, there is also a need for a resource oriented classification system whose primary emphasis would be the remaining 95 percent of the United States land area. The U.S.G.S. classification system described in this report addresses that need, with eight of the nine Level I categories treating land area of the United States that is not in urban or built-up areas. Six of the first level categories in the standard land use code are retained under Urban or Built-up at Level II in the U.S.G.S. system. Even though the standard land use code and the U.S.G.S. classification differ considerably in their major emphases, a marked degree of compatibility between these two systems exists at the more generalized levels and even at the more detailed levels. "}, {"section_title": "USING THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM", "text": "The use of the same or similar terminology does not automatically guarantee that the land use data collected and coded according to two systems will be entirely compatible. The principal points of departure between other classifications and the U.S.G.S. system originate because of the emphasis placed on remote sensing as the primary data source used in the U.S.G.S. classification system. Because of this emphasis, activity must be interpreted using land cover as the principal surrogate, in addition to the image interpreter's customary references to pattern, geographic location, and so forth. This process necessarily precludes the possibility of information being generated which identifies ownership-management units such as farms or ranches or relating detached uses, included in a specific ownership complex, to the parent activity. For example, warehouses cannot be related to retail sales when the two occurrences are separated spatially. The actual cover and related uses are mapped in each ease, rather than injecting inference into the inventory process.\nInferences used for prediction could cause problems for the land use interpreter where land use is clearly in transition, with neither the former use nor the future use actually being present. In most such eases, it is tempting to speculate on future use, but all that can actually be determined in such wide-ranging situations is that change is occurring. Large clear-cut areas in the southeastern forests, for example, are not always returned to forests and might assume any of a variety of future uses, such as a residential subdivision, an industrial site, an area of cropland, or a phosphate mine. The \"sagebrush subdivision\" of the Southwest may have all the potential earmarks of future settlement, such as carefully platted streets, and yet never experience any construction. Such cleared open areas should be identified as \"Transitional Areas.\"\nSince Level II will probably be most appropriate for statewide and interstate regional land use and land cover compilation and mapping, and since Level II categories can be created by aggregating similar Level III categories, the Level II categorization may be considered to be the fulcrum of the classification system. The classification system may be entered at the particular level appropriate to the individual user, and the information generated may be added together with data generated by others to form an aggregate category at the next higher level. As an example, if a local planning group had devised a Level III classification of a particular group of land uses and had included sufficient definitional information of their land use categories, their data could be compiled into a larger inventory by a state or regional planning group compiling data by use of the Level II categories. Such data, in turn, could serve as part of the database for a national inventory.\nSeldom is it necessary to inventory land uses at the more detailed levels, even for local planning. Having greater detail does, however, provide flexibility in manipulating the data when several different purposes must be served. The cost of interpreting, coding, and recording land use data at the more detailed levels is necessarily greater than if the data were handled at more generalized levels. This extra cost reflects the increase in cost of remote sensor and collateral data acquired at larger scales, as well as the increase in interpretation costs.\nThe U.S.G.S. classification system provides flexibility in developing categorization at the more detailed levels.. Therefore, it is appropriate to illustrate the additive properties of the system and to provide examples for users wishing to develop more detailed categorization. The several examples given below represent possible categorizations. Users should not consider themselves limited to categories such as these but should develop categories of utmost utility to their particular needs. It should be emphasized that, whatever categories are used at the various classification levels, special attention should be given to providing the potential users of the data with sufficient information so that they may either compile the data into more generalized levels or aggregate more detailed data into the existing classes.\nOne example of subcategorization of Residential Land as keyed to the standard land use code would be: Some users may wish such additional criteria employed at Level III as degree of activity or idleness or degree of improvement, while others may place such items in Levels IV or V. What may be a primary category for one user group may be of secondary importance to another. As stated by Clawson and Stewart (1965) , \"One man's miscellany is another man's prime concern.\" No one would consider publishing a map of current land use of any part of the Western United States without having irrigated land as a major category. With the flexibility inherent in this classification system, an accommodation of this type of need can be made easily, provided that irrigated land is mapped or tabulated as a discrete unit which can be aggregated into the more general categories included in the framework of the classification. A possible restructuring which would accommodate the desire to present irrigated land as a major category would be:\nIrrigated agricultural land Nonirrigated agricultural land Cropland Cropland Pasture Pasture\nOrchards, Groves and so forth Orchards, Groves and so forth"}, {"section_title": "DEFINITIONS", "text": "An attempt has been made to include sufficient detail in the definitions presented here to provide a general understanding of what is included in each category at Levels I and II.

Agricultural land, forest, wetland, or water areas on the fringe of Urban or Built-up areas will not be included except where they are surrounded and dominated by urban development. The Urban or Builtup category takes precedence over others when the criteria for more than one category are met.

Linear residential developments along transportation routes extending outward from urban areas should be included as residential appendages to urban centers, but care must be taken to distinguish them from commercial strips in the same locality. The residential strips generally have a uniform size and spacing of structures, linear driveways, and lawn areas; the commercial strips are more likely to have buildings of different sizes and spacing, large driveways, and parking areas. Residential development along shorelines is also linear and sometimes extends back only one residential parcel from the shoreline to the first road.\nAreas of sparse residential land use, such as farmsteads, will be included in categories to which they are related unless an appropriate compilation scale is being used to indicate such uses separately Rural residential and recreational subdivisions, however, are included in this category, since the land is almost totally committed to residential use, even though it may have forest or range types of cover. In some places, the boundary will be clear where new housing developments abut against intensively used agricultural areas, but the boundary may be vague and difficult to discern when residential development occurs in small isolated units over an area of mixed or less intensive uses. A careful evaluation of density and the overall relation of the area to the total urban complex must be made.\nResidential sections which are integral parts of other uses may be difficult to identify. Housing situations such as those existing on military bases, at colleges and universities, living quarters for laborers near a work base, or lodging for employees of agricultural field operations or resorts thus would be placed within the Industrial, Agricultural, or Commercial and Services categories."}, {"section_title": "COMMERCIAL AND SERVICES", "text": "Commercial areas are those used predominantly for the sale of products and services.

The main buildings, secondary structures, and areas supporting the basic use are all included office buildings, warehouses, driveways, sheds, parking lots, landscaped areas, and waste disposal areas.\nCommercial areas may include some noncommercial uses too small to be separated out. Central business districts commonly include some institutions, such as churches and schools, and commercial strip developments may include some residential units. When these noncommercial uses exceed one-third-of the total commercial area, the Mixed Urban or Builtup category should be used. There is no separate category for recreational land uses at Level II since most recreational activity is pervasive throughout many other land uses. Selected areas are predominantly recreation oriented, and some of the more distinctive occurrences such as drive-in theaters can. be identified on remote sensor imagery. Most recreational activity, however, necessarily will be identified using supplemental information. Recreational facilities that form an integral part of an institution should be included in this category. There is usually a major visible difference in the form of parking facilities, arrangements for traffic flow, and the general association of buildings and facilities.

Light industrial areas may be, but are not necessarily, directly in contact with urban areas; many are now found at airports or in relatively open country. Heavy industries use raw materials such as iron ore, timber, or coal. Included are steel mills, pulp and lumber mills, electric power generating stations, oil refineries and tank farms, chemical plants, and brick making plants. Stockpiles of raw materials and waste-product disposal areas are usually visible, along with transportation facilities capable of handling heavy materials.\nSurface structures associated with mining operations are included in this category. Surface structures and equipment may range from a minimum of a loading device and trucks to extended areas with access roads, processing facilities, stockpiles, storage sheds, and numerous vehicles. Spoil material and slag heaps usually are found within a short trucking distance of the major mine areas and may be the key indicator of underground mining operations.

For that reason, any statistical summary of the area of land uses in this category typically represents only a partial data set. Statistical area summaries of such land uses aggregated from Levels III and IV, though, would include more accurate area estimates.\nMajor transportation routes and areas greatly influence other land uses, and many land use boundaries are outlined by them. The types and extent of transportation facilities in a locality determine the degree of access and affect both the present and potential use of the area.\nHighways and railways are characterized by areas of activity connected in linear patterns. The highways include rights-of-way, areas used for interchanges, and service and terminal facilities. Rail facilities include stations, parking lots, roundhouses, repair and switching yards, and related areas, as well as overland track and spur connections of sufficient width for delineation at mapping scale.\nAirports, seaports, and major lake ports are isolated areas of high utilization, usually with no well-defined intervening connections, although some ports are connected by canals. Airport facilities include the runways, intervening land, terminals, service buildings, navigation aids, fuel storage, parking lots, and a limited buffer zone. Terminal facilities generally include the associated freight and warehousing functions. Small airports (except those on rotated farmland), heliports, and land associated with seaplane bases may be identified if mapping scale permits. Port areas include the docks, shipyards, drydocks, locks, and waterway control structures.\nCommunications and utilities areas such as those involved in processing, treatment, and transportation of water, gas, oil, and electricity and areas used for airwave communications are also included in this category.

On high-altitude imagery, the chief indications of agricultural activity will be distinctive geometric field and road patterns on the landscape and the traces produced by livestock or mechanized equipment. However, pasture and other lands where such equipment is used infrequently may not show as well defined shapes as other areas. These distinctive geometric patterns are also characteristic of Urban or Built-up Lands because of street layout and development by blocks. Distinguishing between Agricultural and Urban or Built-up Lands ordinarily should be possible on the basis of urban-activity indicators and the associated concentration of population. The number of building complexes is smaller and the density of the road and highway network is much lower in Agricultural Land than in Urban or Built-up Land. Some urban land uses, such as parks and large cemeteries, however, may be mistaken for Agricultural Land, especially when they occur on the periphery of the urban areas.\nThe interface of Agricultural Land with other categories of land use may sometimes be a transition zone in which there is an intermixture of land uses at first and second levels of categorization. Where farming activities are limited by wetness, the exact boundary also may be difficult to locate, and Agricultural Land may grade into Wetland. When the production of agricultural crops is not hindered by wetland conditions, such cropland should be included in the Agricultural category. This latter stipulation also includes those cases in which agricultural crop production depends on wetland conditions, such as the flooding of ricefields or the development of cranberry bogs. When lands produce economic commodities as a function of their wild state such as wild rice, cattails, or certain forest products 'commonly associated with wetland, however, they should be included in the Wetland category. Similarly, when wetlands are drained for agricultural purposes, they should be included in the Agricultural Land category. When such drainage enterprises fall into disuse and if wetland vegetation is reestablished, the land reverts to the Wetland category.\nThe Level II categories of Agricultural Land are: Cropland and Pasture; Orchards, Groves, Vineyards, Nurseries, and Ornamental Horticultural Areas; Confined Feeding Operations; and Other Agricultural Land."}, {"section_title": "CROPLAND AND PASTURE", "text": "The several components of Cropland and Pasture now used for agricultural statistics include: cropland harvested, including bush fruits; cultivated summer fallow and idle cropland; land on which crop failure occurs; cropland in soil-improvement grasses and legumes; cropland used only for pasture in rotation with crops; and pasture on land more or less permanently used for that purpose. From imagery alone, it generally is not possible to make a distinction between Cropland and Pasture with a high degree of accuracy and uniformity, let alone a distinction among the various components of Cropland (Hardy, Belcher, and Phillips, 1971) . Moreover, some of the components listed represent the condition of the land at the end of the growing season and will not apply exactly to imagery taken at other times of the year. They will, however, be a guide to identification of Cropland and Pasture. Brushland in the Eastern States, typically used to some extent for pasturing cattle, is included in the Shrub-Brushland Rangeland category since the grazing activity is usually not discernible on remote sensor imagery appropriate to Levels I and II. This activity possibly might be distinguished on low-altitude imagery. Such grazing activities generally occur on land where crop production or intensive pasturing has ceased, for any of a variety of reasons, and which has grown up in brush. Such brushlands often are used for grazing, somewhat analogous to the extensive use of rangelands in the West.\nCertain factors vary throughout the United States, and this variability also must be recognized; field size depends on topography, soil types, sizes of farms, kinds of crops and pastures, capital investment, labor availability, and other conditions. Irrigated land in the Western States is recognized easily in contrast to Rangeland, but in the Eastern States, irrigation by use of overhead sprinklers generally cannot be detected from imagery unless distinctive circular patterns are created.

Many of these areas may be included in another category, generally Cropland and Pasture, when identification is made by use of small-scale imagery alone. Identification may be aided by recognition of the combination of soil qualities, topography, and local climatological factors needed for these operations: water bodies in close proximity which moderate the effects of short duration temperature fluctuations; site selection for air drainage on sloping land; and deep well-drained soils on slopes moderate enough to permit use of machinery.

The waste-disposal problems justify a separate category for these relatively small areas.

On such lands, when trees reach marketable size, which for pulpwood in the Southeastern United States may occur in 2 to 3 decades, there will be large areas that have little or no visible forest growth. The pattern can sometimes be identified by the presence of cutting operations in the midst of a large expanse of forest. Unless there is evidence of other use, such areas of little or no forest growth should be included in the Forest Land category.

In the United States, tundra occurs primarily in Alaska, in several areas of the western high mountain ranges, and in small isolated locations in the higher mountains of New England and northern New York. The timber line which separates forest and tundra in alpine regions corresponds to an arctic transition zone in which trees increasingly are restricted to the most favorable sites.\nThe vegetative cover of the tundra is low, dwarfed, and often forms a complete mat. These plant characteristics are in large part the result of adaptation to the physical environment one of the most extreme on Earth, where temperatures may average above freezing only 1 or 2 months out of the year, where strong desiccating winds may occur, where great variation in solar energy received may exist, and where permafrost is encountered almost everywhere beneath the vegetative cover.\nThe number of species in the tundra flora is relatively small compared with typical middle-and lowlatitude flora, and this number of species decreases as the environment becomes increasingly severe with changes of latitude and altitude. The tundra vegetation consists primarily of grasses, sedges, small flowering herbs, ]low shrubs, lichens, and mosses. The vegetative cover is most luxuriant near the boreal forest, with the ground surface usually being completely covered. As the plant cover becomes sparse, shrubs become fewer and more bare areas occur. Species diversity is lowest near the boundaries of permanent ice and snow areas, where only isolated patches of vegetation occur on the bare ground surface.\nThe vegetation of the tundra is closely associated with other environmental factors. Minor manmade disturbances, as well as micro\u2022 environmental changes over short distances, can have significant effects. Minor changes in available moisture or wind protection, for example, can result in different plant associations. Similarly, man's activity in the tundra may engender new drainage patterns with resultant changes in plant community or erosion characteristics (Price, 1972) .\nThe boundaries between Tundra, Perennial Snow or Ice, and Water are best determined by using images acquired in late summer. The Forest LandTundra boundary in the Arctic tends to be transitional over a wide area and characterized by either incursion of forests where site improvement occurs, as along the flood plains or river valleys, or by increasing environmental severity, as on exposed dry uplands. This Forest Land-Tundra boundary is much easier to delineate in alpine areas. The Barren LandTundra interface occurs where one or more of the environmental parameters necessary for vegetation growth is deficient and also would be determined best with late-summer imagers.\nUsing the results of various investigations, Level II categories of Tundra based primarily on what is interpretable from remote sensor image signatures are: Shrub and Brush Tundra, Herbaceous Tundra, Bare Ground Tundra, Wet Tundra, and Mixed Tundra."}, {"section_title": "SHRUB AND BRUSH TUNDRA", "text": "The Shrub and Brush Tundra category consists of the various woody shrubs and brushy thickets found in the tundra environment. These occur in dense-to-open evergreen and deciduous thickets, with the latter dominated by types such as the various birches (Betula), alders (Alnus) or willows (Salix), as well as many types of berry plants. Low evergreen shrub thickets are characterized by such dominant types as Empetrum and various members of the heath family, such as Cassiope, Vaccinium and Ledum (Viereck and Little, 1972) ."}, {"section_title": "HERBACEOUS TUNDRA", "text": "Herbaceous Tundra is composed of various sedges, grasses, forbs, lichens, and mosses, all of which lack woody stems. A wide variety of such herbaceous types may be found in close proximity on the tundra.\nSites having sufficient moisture usually are covered with a thick mat of mosses together with sedges such as Carex and Eriophorum (cotton grass) in almost continuous and uniform tussocks, as well as other herbaceous forms such as types of bluegrass (Poa), buttercups (Ranunculus) and lichens such as Cladonia and Cetranria. Drier or more exposed sites usually trend toward a sparse moss-lichen mat."}, {"section_title": "BARE GROUND TUNDRA", "text": "The Bare Ground Tundra category is intended for those tundra occurrences which are less than one third vegetated. It usually consists of sites visually dominated by considerable areas of exposed bare rock, sand, or gravel interspersed with low herbaceous and shrubby plants. This type of tundra is indicative of the most severe environmental stress and usually occurs poleward of the areas supporting the more luxuriant herbaceous and shrub forms and on higher mountain ridges. The various species of Dryas, such as white mountain-avens, are dominant in Arctic regions, as are the sandworts (Minuartia) and mountainheaths (Phyllodoce). Bare Ground Tundra gradually merges with one or more of the Barren Land categories on its more severe margin."}, {"section_title": "WET TUNDRA", "text": "Wet Tundra is usually found in areas having little topographic relief. Standing water is almost always present during months when temperatures average above the freezing level. Numerous shallow lakes are also common (Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission for Alaska, 1973) . Permafrost is usually close to the surface, and various patterned ground features may be evident. Sedges (Carex) such as cotton grass are characteristically dominant, and a few shrubby plants may occur on adjacent drier sites. Rooted aquatic plants are also common. Wet Tundra is delineated best on imagery acquired in late summer."}, {"section_title": "MIXED TUNDRA", "text": "The Mixed Tundra category is used for a mixture of the Level II Tundra occurrences where any particular type occupies less than two-thirds of the area of the mapping unit. Where more than onethird intermixture of another use or uses occurs in a specific area, it is classified as Mixed Tundra. Where the intermixed land cover categories total less than one-third of the specific area, the category appropriate to the dominant type of Tundra is applied."}, {"section_title": "PERENNIAL SNOW OR ICE", "text": "Certain lands have a perennial cover of either snow or ice because of a combination of environmental factors which cause these features to survive the summer melting season. In doing so, they persist as relatively permanent features on the landscape and may be used as environmental surrogates. Snow, firn (coarse, compacted granular snow), or ice accumulation in these areas exceeds ablation, which is the combined loss of snow or ice mass by evaporation and melt-water runoff. Adjacent lands most commonly will be classed as Water, Wetland, Barren Land, or Tundra, with their common boundaries being distinguished most readily on late summer imagery.\nThe terminology and nomenclature of any subdivision of Perennial Snow or Ice areas are always subject to considerable debate, but a Level II breakdown into categories of Perennial Snowfields and Glaciers seems to be appropriate for use with remote sensor data. Such a subdivision is based on surface form and the presence or absence of features indicating glacial flow. In addition, these forms and flow features may be related to stage of development and certain periglacial or glacial processes."}, {"section_title": "PERENNIAL SNOWFIELDS", "text": "Perennial Snowfields are accumulations of snow and firn that did not entirely melt during previous summers. Snowfields can be quite extensive and thus representative of a regional climate, or can be quite isolated and localized, when they are known by various terms, such as snowbanks.\nThe regional snowline is controlled by general climatic conditions and closely parallels the regional 32 degrees F (0oC) isotherm for the average temperature of the warmest summer month. The use of the term \"line\" is somewhat misleading, because the \"snowline\" represents an irregular transitional boundary, which is determined at any single location by the combination of snowfall and ablation, variables which can change greatly within short distances because of changes in local topography and slope orientation.\nSmall isolated snowfields occurring in protected locations can develop into incipient or nivation cirques, which become gradually hollowed by the annual patterns of freezing and thawing, aided by downslope movement of rock material. They are circular to semicircular and often develop ridges of mass-wasted materials called protalus ramparts at their downslope margins. As Flint (1957) has pointed out, \"Such cirques, of course, are not in themselves indication of glaciation, they indicate merely a frost climate.\"\nSnowfields can normally be distinguished from the following Glacier category by their relative lack of flow features."}, {"section_title": "GLACIERS", "text": "Glacial ice originates from the compaction of snow into firn and finally to ice under the weight of several successive annual accumulations. Refrozen melt water usually contributes to the increasing density of the glacial ice mass. With sufficient thickness, weight, and bulk, flow begins, and all glaciers exhibit evidence of present or past motion in the form of moraines, crevasses, and so forth.\nWhere the snowline of adjacent ice-free areas extends across the glacier, it is known as the firn limit, which represents the dividing line between the glacier's two major zones, the zone of accumulation and the zone of ablation. While glaciers normally are recognized easily, certain glacial boundaries may be subject to misinterpretation, even by the experienced interpreter. Flow features upglacier from the firn limit typically are obscured by fresh snow, forcing the image interpreter to depend on secondary information such as valley shape or seek a more discriminating sensor. Similarly, morainal material may cover the terminus (or snout) of the glacier because of ablation, making boundary determination in that vicinity difficult. This latter problem occasionally is compounded by the presence of considerable vegetation rooted in the insulating blanket of ablation moraine.\nFurther subdivision of glacial occurrences, mainly on the basis of form and topographic position, would include: small drift glaciers (sometimes called Uraltype or cirque glaciers); valley glaciers (also called mountain or alpine glaciers); piedmont glaciers; and icecaps (or ice sheets).\nOther features have somewhat the surface form of true glaciers, such as \"rock glaciers.\" Since these are composed primarily of fragmented rock material together with interstitial ice, they are classified as Bare Exposed Rock. In order to provide a systematic and uniform approach to the presentation of land use and land cover information in map format, a scheme of color coding is employed (table 4) . In this scheme, Level I land uses are color coded using a modified version of the World Land Use Survey (International Geographical Union, 1952) color scheme. Level II land uses can be presented using the two-digit numeral appropriate to the land use category, such as \"21,\" which would signify Cropland and Pasture. The use of some type of system other than a further stratification "}, {"section_title": "MAP PRESENTATION", "text": ""}]
