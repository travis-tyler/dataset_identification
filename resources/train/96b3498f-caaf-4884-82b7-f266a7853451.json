[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose With the aim of facilitating the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative proposed two stages based on the memory performance: early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI). The current study was designed to investigate structural differences in terms of surface atrophy and microstructural changes of the hippocampus in EMCI and LMCI.\nMethods Hippocampal shape modeling based on progressive template surface deformation was performed on T1-weighted MRI images obtained from 20 cognitive normal (CN) subjects, 17 EMCI patients, and 20 LMCI patients. A template surface in CN was used as a region of interest for diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Cluster-wise group comparison was performed based on DTI indices within the hippocampus. Linear regression was performed to identify correlations between DTI metrics and clinical scores.\nThe hippocampal surface analysis showed significant atrophies in bilateral CA1 regions and the right ventral subiculum in EMCI, in contrast to widespread atrophy in LMCI. DTI VBM analysis showed increased diffusivity in the CA2\u2212CA4 regions in EMCI and additionally in the subiculum region in LMCI. Hippocampal diffusivity was significantly correlated with scores both for the Mini Mental State Examination and on the Modified Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale. However, the hippocampal diffusivity did not vary significantly with the fractional anisotropy.\nConclusions EMCI showed hippocampal surface changes mainly in the CA1 region and ventral subiculum. Diffusivity increased mainly in the CA2\u2212CA4 regions in EMCI, while it decreased throughout the hippocampus in LMCI. Although axial diffusivity showed prominent changes in the right hippocampus in EMCI, future studies need to confirm the presence of this laterality difference. In addition, diffusivity is strongly correlated with the cognitive performance, indicating the possibility of using diffusivity as a biomarker for disease progression."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the most common type of dementia, the main symptom of which is cognitive decline associated with memory failure. It is unclear how AD will progress, and the clinical symptoms appear later than the disease onset, which makes early diagnosis and intervention difficult. 1, 2 An earlier diagnosis could help to reduce cognitive deterioration and/or treatment costs. It is also important to under- To overcome these problems, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) proposed two stages-early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI)-based on the education-adjusted scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II. 3, 4 Patients with EMCI and LMCI were subdivided solely on the Logical Memory II score of the Wechsler Memory Scale, but other biomarkers such as the hippocampal volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers also showed empirical trajectories suggesting that EMCI could be a transitional stage. 5 Thus, understanding differences between EMCI and LMCI might facilitate the understanding of disease progression specifically in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nShape-based morphometry has often been applied for analyzing structural changes in subcortical structures, including in the hippocampus. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Researchers have previously used volumetric analyses for quantitatively assessing hippocampal atrophy as a marker for the progression of AD. 13, 14 However, changes in volume in certain regions can be compensated for by atrophy or dilation in other locations, which may obscure changes in the total volume. This indicates that volumetric analyses may not reveal the true association between local deformations and the disease or risk factors. 12 Additionally, volumetric analyses do not give information about the morphological changes that characterize the appearance and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. A precise analysis of these changes could provide useful early diagnostic information and help to identify individuals at risk.\nEarly studies using diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in AD focused particularly on fractional anisotropy (FA). However, some studies [15] [16] [17] found this measure to be insensitive to early white-matter disruption in AD. Furthermore, most of the relevant studies [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] have focused on the changes in largescale white-matter tracts. This approach is based on the idea that white-matter changes could be the result of Wallerian degeneration, which involves earlier loss of cortical neurons. 25, 26 Also, clinical abnormalities have been shown to be correlated more strongly with gray-matter changes than with white-matter changes, 27 and the presence of cortical gray-matter damage has been demonstrated by diffusion MRI in multiple sclerosis. 25 A few studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] have investigated microstructural changes within the hippocampus in AD. They demonstrated increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the left hippocampus to be the best predictor of disease progression. However, these analyses relied on manual segmentation of the hippocampus or did not use masking to isolate the hippocampus. This limitation may be attributed to the risk of partial volume effects and the complexity of segmentation.\nIn the present study we adopted a novel segmentation method that involves subtle volume extraction and better shape reconstruction to input images compared to previous methods. 12 We also decomposed the MD into axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in order to assess the gray-matter abnormalities in EMCI. The overall aim of this study was to characterize the morphometric and microstructure changes in subregions of the hippocampus in EMCI in order to identify the early signature of AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "In the phase ADNI2 database, subjects who underwent both T1-weighted and DTI with a visit identifier of \"ADNI2 Screening MRI-New Patient\" comprised 49 cognitive normal (CN) subjects, and 27 EMCI, 34 LMCI, and 47 AD patients. As an initial study, subjects were sampled with the following criteria: aged 60-75 years, education duration of 12-20 years, and gender matching within groups. Note that the lack of female data for EMCI limited the number of subjects in each group.\nThe T1-weighted and DTI images of 77 subjects (20 CN, 17 EMCI, 20 LMCI, and 20 AD) were gathered from the ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The MRI protocol is described elsewhere. 34 We only used the images acquired at the first visit of each subject. The following clinical and neuropsychological assessments were included: global Clinical Dementia Rating, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (MADAS-Cog), and Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory I & II.

In addition, the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in specific hippocampal subfields and the associated neuronal loss are well documented. The presence of tangles has typically been reported to occur first in the entorhinal cortex, followed by spreading to the subiculum and CA1, then to CA2 and CA3, and finally to CA4. 40 A postmortem study of AD brains also found that the subiculum and CA1 were the most affected regions. 41, 42 These findings confirm that EMCI may predate LMCI in the perspective of AD progression.\nLMCI was characterized by a volume decrease in the left hippocampus but additional atrophy relative to EMCI in the right hippocampus (Figs. 2 and 3) . A previous study 43 found left-less-than-right asymmetry of the hippocampal atrophy as a characteristic change in aMCI. However, one study 44 found that right hippocampal changes can occur up to 10 years before the clinical onset of AD. Although that study employed a volumetric analysis, its findings suggest that damage to the right hippocampus characterizes a transition from healthy aging to MCI. This discrepancy could also plausibly be explained based on the characteristics of aMCI patients or differences in difficulties between verbal and visual memory tests. Impairments in verbal memory would presumably be detected more easily by caregivers than those of visual memory. Thus, there is a greater likelihood of including verbal-type aMCI-which would be associated with greater atrophy in the left hippocampus-than visual-type aMCI according to previous studies. As a result, left-right asymmetry of the hippocampus could be collective changes in EMCI and LMCI.\nOur DTI analysis also revealed microstructure changes in the hippocampus. DTI is commonly used to measure the \nlarge-scale integrity of the white matter. However, there have been recent studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] of microstructural changes within the gray matter. In the present study we found progressively larger regions of increased diffusivity during the disease progression, starting from the CA2-CA4 regions in EMCI to the bilateral CA2-CA4 and subiculum regions in LMCI (Fig. 4) . While macroscopic changes in EMCI and LMCI showed right hippocampal surface atrophy, microscopic changes were characterized by left hippocampal gray-matter abnormalities. Considering the increased AxD in the right hippocampal CA2-CA4 regions, with mild atrophy in the CA1 region and the subiculum in EMCI, microscopic changes may precede those of surface atrophy. Furthermore, these differences in morphometry and microstructure could represent early changes in MCI. These findings might indicate that microstructural changes such as synaptic loss, neuronal soma changes, and neuronal disorganization occur along with the neuronal loss in the hippocampus. 45 Hippocampal asymmetry was also found in the linear relationship between diffusivity and clinical score (Fig. 5) , which is consistent with the finding of den Heijer et al. 46 The diffusivity in a relatively small area of the right hippocampus was correlated with the clinical scores, and this might be due to earlier gray-matter disruption in the right hippocampus in EMCI. Hippocampal dissociation was previously demonstrated using optogenetics in mice. 47 That study showed that optogenetic silencing of either the left or right hippocampal CA3 region impaired the short-term memory, while only left hippocampal CA3 silencing impaired the long-term memory. Considering this dissociation, we suggest that early graymatter abnormalities in the right hippocampal CA2-CA4 regions in EMCI can cause short-term memory loss while long-term memory in MCI remains intact.\nPrevious studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] have mainly found increased MD within the hippocampal gray matter, along with no AxD changes. An increase in MD is often attributed to the progressive loss of cellular barriers or an increase in extracellular water content, such as occurs during neurodegeneration. [48] [49] [50] However, our findings showed significant overlap between MD and AxD, with a relatively partial overlap between MD and RD. Considering that MD is the combination of AxD and RD, the main difference in MD could be due to AxD Table 2 ). A recent study 51 found negative correlations between the traverse relaxation rate (R2) and DTI eigenvalues both in vitro and in vivo. R2 is the reciprocal of the transverse relation time (T2) multiplied by 1,000 ms/s. In the presence of damage, this measure decreases as the amount of tissue water increases, which reflects abnormalities in the structural integrity of tissues.\n51-54 Rulseh et al. 51 found lambda 3 to be the most sensitive index for R2. However, considering RD as a combination of lambda 2 and 3, its sensitivity might be lower than that of lambda 1, which corresponds to AxD. Thus, to explain the elevation of water content as well as tissue damage, AxD could be a better index of neuronal damage within hippocampal gray-matter abnormalities.\nThis study was subject to several limitations. First, the number of subjects included in the analysis was small in order to observe progressive changes in MCI. As an initial study, we sought to control age, years of education, and gender in the cohort, while targeting subjects who were newly added in the ADNI2 phase in 2014. However, it was difficult to control the gender distribution in the EMCI group. Moreover, it is well known that males show higher diffusion properties than females, which made gender control a crucial factor in this study. We therefore targeted a rather small number of subjects in each group in order to control gender. Second, the initial design of this study did not consider subject inclusion criteria such as AD conversion or positivity for AD biomarkers. In order to focus on progressive changes, potential subjects who may progress to AD should be considered. However, screening was applied only once without follow up in several subjects in this study, or only MRI data were available. Lastly, a longitudinal study involving LMCI convertors from EMCI could better capture the progressive changes in MCI subtypes. Rather than group comparisons of EMCI and LMCI, consecutive changes within the same subjects should be considered in future studies.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated morphological and microstructural changes of the hippocampal surface in EMCI using structural MRI and DTI. EMCI showed hippocampal surface changes mainly in the CA1 region and the right ventral subiculum, and diffusivity increases in the CA2-CA4 regions. In addition, the diffusivity results showed laterality changes (especially in AxD) in EMCI. These results indicate that certain regions of the right hippocampus are affected earlier than those in the left hippocampus. However, further studies are needed to confirm these laterality changes. We also demonstrate that the diffusivity in the hippocampus is strongly correlated with the cognitive performance, indicating the possibility of using diffusivity as a biomarker for AD progression."}, {"section_title": "Correlations between microstructural changes and clinical scores", "text": "Clusters correlated with the MMSE and MADAS-Cog clinical scores were found in the hippocampus in the EMCI, LMCI, and AD groups (Fig. 5, Table 2 ).
