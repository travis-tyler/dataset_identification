Developed and managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education, SSOCS has been administered seven times, most recently during the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 school year. The 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 SSOCS administration (SSOCS:2018) was funded by NCES, with supplemental funding provided by the National Institute of Justice.\nSSOCS collects information from public school principals about the prevalence of violent and serious violent crimes occurring in their schools. Portions of this survey also focus on school security measures, school security staff, the availability of mental health services, parent and community involvement at school, and staff training. SSOCS data can be used to examine the relationship between violent incidents in schools and the programs, practices, and policies schools have in place to prevent and reduce crime.\nThe findings presented in this report are based on a nationally representative, stratified, random sample of 4,803 U.S. public schools. 1 Data collection for SSOCS:2018 began on February 20, 2018, and continued through July 18, 2018. While SSOCS has historically been conducted by mail with telephone and e-mail follow-up, the 2018 survey administration experimented with an online questionnaire. The 2018 survey administration also experimented with offering a $10 cash incentive to a subset of sampled schools.\nA total of 2,762 primary, middle, high, and combined schools provided complete questionnaires, yielding a weighted response rate of 62 percent. Per NCES Statistical Standards, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was performed since the weighted response rate was less than 85 percent. The results of this analysis suggest that the characteristics of nonresponding schools differed significantly from those of responding schools. However, the unit nonresponse bias analysis also provided evidence that the nonresponse weighting adjustments used for SSOCS:2018 removed most of the observed nonresponse bias in characteristics known for both respondents and nonrespondents. To the extent that missingness in the survey variables is correlated with the variables used to adjust for nonresponse, the nonresponse adjustments should serve to mitigate nonresponse bias in the SSOCS:2018 survey estimates (although some bias may remain after adjustment). For more information about SSOCS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methodology\u00e2\u0080\u0094including how response rates were calculated and the details of the nonresponse bias analysis\u00e2\u0080\u0094please see Appendix B: Methodology and Technical Notes.\nThe purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate cross-tabulation procedures. For a detailed description of the variables presented in the tables, please see Appendix C: Description of Variables. This report also includes selected findings and figures. These items demonstrate the range of information\n1 The SSOCS sample frame includes regular public schools, public charter schools, and schools with partial or total magnet programs. The SSOCS sample frame excludes special education schools, vocational schools, alternative schools, virtual schools, newly closed schools, home schools, ungraded schools, schools with a highest grade of kindergarten or lower, Department of Defense schools, schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Education, and schools in the U.S. outlying areas and Puerto Rico.\n1\n\n\favailable from SSOCS:2018 data, rather than provide a comprehensive presentation of all observed differences. Estimates from SSOCS:2018 are based on a random sample of K\u00e2\u0080\u009312 schools and all results are weighted to represent the population of U.S. public schools. When using data from a sample, some margin of error will always be present because data are available from only a portion of the total population. Consequently, data from samples can provide only an approximation of the true or actual value. To account for sampling error, the comparisons drawn in the selected findings below have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s t statistic to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant; thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are mentioned in the findings. For some selected findings that present counts, a 95% confidence interval is also presented. A 95% confidence interval can be constructed such that if an estimation procedure were repeated many times, 95 percent of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population value. As a confidence interval presents the range of values that is likely to encompass the true or actual value, it provides an important indication of the margin of error for an estimate.

In contrast, a higher percentage of schools located in cities reported at least one incident of vandalism (40 percent) than did schools located in suburbs (33 percent), towns (31 percent), and rural areas (27 percent) (table 3).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 During the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 school year, there were an estimated 3,600 incidents nationwide involving the possession of a firearm or explosive device at school (table 4).4\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 A higher percentage of middle schools reported that student bullying occurred at school at least once a week (28 percent) than did high schools (16 percent) or primary schools (9 percent). Also, higher percentages of middle and high schools reported that cyberbullying occurred at school or away from school at least once a week (33 and 30 percent, respectively) than did primary schools (5 percent) (table 5).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Some 35 percent of disciplinary actions taken by schools in response to student involvement in the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device involved an out-ofschool suspension lasting 5 or more days, 14 percent involved the transfer of students to specialized schools, and 5 percent involved the removal of students with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year (table 6).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lower percentages of schools located in towns (38 percent) and rural areas (34 percent) reported having a threat assessment team during the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 school year than did schools located in cities (50 percent) and suburbs (49 percent) (table 7).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Of the written plans that schools may have to address various crisis scenarios, the ones reported most commonly were for natural disasters (94 percent), active shooters (92 percent), and bomb threats or incidents (91 percent) (table 8) (figure 2).\n2 Violent incidents include rape, sexual assault other than rape, robbery (with or without a weapon), physical attack or fight (with or without a weapon), and threat of physical attack (with or without a weapon). Nonviolent incidents include theft; possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs. 3 The 95% confidence interval for \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolent incidents\u00e2\u0080\u009d ranges from 872,500 to 1,052,200. The 95% confidence interval for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonviolent incidents\u00e2\u0080\u009d ranges from 449,700 to 502,600. 4 The 95% confidence interval for \u00e2\u0080\u009cincidents involving the possession of a firearm or explosive device\u00e2\u0080\u009d ranges from 2,800 to 4,300.\n3\n\n\f\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Among schools with at least 50 percent minority enrollment, half (50 percent) reported involving students in restorative circles.

The school may be at the same location as your school. 2 Examples of other disciplinary actions provided to respondents were suspension for less than 5 days, detention, etc. 3 \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrimary schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiddle schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigh schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 13. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCombined schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d include all other combinations of grades, including K\u00e2\u0080\u009312 schools. Grade 13 is used to designate high school students who are enrolled in programs where they can earn college credit in an extended high school environment, or CTE students in a high school program that continues beyond grade 12. NOTE: This table shows the number of disciplinary actions received by students, not the number of students who were involved in offenses involving the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device. In cases in which a student received multiple disciplinary actions for a single offense, only the most severe disciplinary action is counted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeapon\u00e2\u0080\u009d was defined for respondents as any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill. This includes look-alikes if they are used to threaten others. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirearm or explosive device\u00e2\u0080\u009d was defined for respondents as any weapon that is designed to (or may readily be converted to) expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. This includes guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe bombs, or similar devices designed to explode and capable of causing bodily harm or property damage. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about school crime and policies to provide a safe environment.

The types of licensed professionals who may provide mental health services include psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioners, psychiatric/mental health nurses, clinical social workers, and professional counselors. Some schools reported having mental health services available but did not specify any location at which the services were provided; thus percentage distributions may not sum to 100 percent.

SSOCS collects detailed information from public schools on the incidence, frequency, seriousness, and nature of violence affecting students and school personnel. SSOCS also collects information on the programs, practices, and policies schools have in place to prevent and reduce crime. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent crimes in regular public primary, middle, high, and combined schools.\nSSOCS has been conducted seven times, covering the 1999\u00e2\u0080\u00932000, 2003\u00e2\u0080\u009304, 2005\u00e2\u0080\u009306, 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009308, 2009\u00e2\u0080\u009310, 2015\u00e2\u0080\u009316, and 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 school years. The responsibility for the design and conduct of the survey lies with NCES, and the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 SSOCS data collection (SSOCS:2018) was administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. Although historically SSOCS has been conducted as a mail survey with telephone and e-mail follow-up, the 2018 data collection experimented with an online questionnaire. In this experiment, approximately one-fourth of the sampled schools were randomly assigned to initially receive instructions to complete the online questionnaire and the remaining schools received a paper questionnaire. The 2018 data collection also included an incentive experiment in which about half of the sampled schools received a $10 cash incentive. For more information on the experiments, see the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nData collection began in February 2018. Invitations including log-in information to complete the survey via the online questionnaire were mailed to schools in the internet treatment group on February 20, 2018. Paper questionnaires were mailed to schools in the paper treatment group on February 23, 2018. Data collection continued through July 18, 2018.\nA total of 2,762 public schools submitted complete questionnaires, including 671 primary schools, 975 middle schools, 997 high schools, and 119 combined schools.\nSample Design\nThe sampling frame for SSOCS:2018 was constructed using the 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009315 Common Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe data file, an annual data collection of all public K\u00e2\u0080\u009312 schools and school districts.1 The SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools, charter schools, and schools with partial or total magnet programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.2\nThe objectives of the SSOCS sampling design are twofold: (1) to obtain overall cross-sectional and subgroup estimates of important indicators of school crime and safety, and (2) to yield precise estimates of change in these indicators between survey administrations. To attain these objectives, a stratified, random sample of 4,803 public schools was drawn for SSOCS:2018. The\n1 At the time of sampling, the 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009315 CCD was the most recent data file available. 2 The SSOCS sample frame excludes special education schools, vocational schools, alternative schools, virtual schools, newly closed schools, home schools, ungraded schools, schools with a highest grade of kindergarten or lower, Department of Defense schools, schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Education, and schools in the U.S. outlying areas and Puerto Rico.\nB-2\n\n\fsame general sampling design\u00e2\u0080\u0094including stratification variables, number of strata, method of sample allocation, and sorting of variables before selection\u00e2\u0080\u0094was used for SSOCS:2018 as for the previous survey administrations.3\nHowever, for the first time, SSOCS used a reverse Keyfitz procedure to minimize the probabilities that a school would be selected to participate in both the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 SSOCS and the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 National Teacher and Principal Survey (another school-based NCES data collection) (Keyfitz 1951; Rust and Johnson 1992). Since the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 NTPS data collection window overlapped with the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 SSOCS data collection window, this procedure was implemented to minimize overlap between the two samples as a way of reducing burden on respondents. Since the NTPS sample was chosen first, the reverse Keyfitz procedure set a probability for each SSOCS school conditional on the probability of selection for that school in NTPS and whether the school was in the NTPS sample. In short, the schools that were selected for NTPS had their conditional probabilities of selection for SSOCS decreased and the schools that were not selected for NTPS had their conditional probabilities of selection for SSOCS increased. For more information on the Keyfitz procedure, see the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nTo account for declining response rates as well as to allow for analysis of the internet and incentive experiments, SSOCS:2018 began with a larger sample than in previous SSOCS administrations. Because the majority of school violence is reported in middle and high schools, a larger proportion of the expected respondent count of 2,755 schools was allocated to middle and high schools. The target respondent count was allocated to the four school levels, as follows: 691 primary schools, 967 middle schools, 989 high schools, and 108 combined schools.\nThree variables that have been shown to be associated with school crime\u00e2\u0080\u0094school level, locale, and enrollment size\u00e2\u0080\u0094were used to create strata (i.e., groups) in SSOCS:2018, with the population of schools stratified into four school levels, four locale categories, 4 and four enrollment size categories5 (Diliberti, Jackson, and Kemp 2017; Chen 2008; Langbein and Bess 2002; Miller 2004). The expected respondent count within each school level was allocated to each of the 16 cells formed by the cross-classification of the four categories of enrollment size and four categories of locale. The target number of responding schools allocated to each of the 16 cells was proportional to the sum of the square roots of the total student enrollment over all schools in the cell.\nThe target respondent count within each stratum was then inflated to account for anticipated nonresponse; this inflated count was the sample size for the stratum. The strata were sorted by percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment, 6 Census region, 7 and state, and a sample of 4,803 schools was selected using a systematic design, with a constant sampling rate in each stratum.\n3 Adopting the same basic design for all survey administrations increases the precision of the estimates of change. 4 The four locale categories are city, suburb, town, and rural. 5 The four enrollment size categories are less than 300 students, 300\u00e2\u0080\u0093499 students, 500\u00e2\u0080\u0093999 students, and 1,000 students or more. 6 The four categories of percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment are more than 95 percent, more than 80 percent to 95 percent, more than 50 percent to 80 percent, and 50 percent or less. 7 The four Census regions are the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.\nB-3\n\n\fFor more information on the sample design, see the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u0093 18 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nData Collection\nFive months before the onset of data collection, recruitment operations began with school districts that require prior approval before allowing sampled schools in their district to participate in the survey. On February 12, 2018, the principals of the sampled schools were sent advance letters that informed them that their school had been sampled and included a toll-free number to call with any questions. Advance letters were also mailed to Chief State School Officers and superintendents to notify them about the survey and to request that they encourage schools under their purview to participate.\nBetween February 20 and February 23, 2018, principals of sampled schools were sent a package containing either a letter with log-in information to complete the survey or a paper questionnaire and a return envelope. Half of the packages in each group included a $10 cash incentive. All principals\u00e2\u0080\u0094regardless of the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assigned treatment group\u00e2\u0080\u0094received a brochure and a cover letter describing the importance of the survey.\nThree weeks after the initial mailout, a reminder telephone operation began. The primary objective of the reminder telephone operation was to follow up with the principal or school contact to determine the status of the questionnaire; however, the interviewer could complete the SSOCS interview over the phone at the respondent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request. The interviewer could also offer the internet option to respondents who were in the paper treatment group and offer the paper option to those who were in the internet treatment group. Throughout the data collection window, nonresponding schools also received reminder e-mails and replacement packages, as appropriate.\nReturned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. Where necessary, telephone follow-up was used to resolve discrepancies or missing data identified during editing.\nExcluding the non-survey items that collect information about the respondent, the SSOCS:2018 questionnaire included 261 subitems. For a survey to be considered complete, all of the following completion criteria had to be met:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Answers were required for at least 157 of the 261 total subitems.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Of the 261 total subitems, 76 were categorized as critical. Responses were required for at least 61 of the 76 critical subitems. Responses provided to the critical subitems counted toward the total 157 subitem responses needed for a survey to be considered complete.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Items 30 and 38 had additional completion criteria; responses were required for at least 18 of the 30 subitems within item 30 and at least 3 of the 5 subitems within the first column of item 38.\nB-4\n\n\fQuestionnaires that did not meet the established completion criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the SSOCS:2018 data file. If a questionnaire that was considered to be complete at the end of data collection contained missing values, the missing values were imputed (i.e., the missing values were replaced with estimates derived from data reported by schools with similar characteristics or from data available in the sampling frame).\nA copy of the SSOCS:2018 paper questionnaire can be found in Appendix D: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 School Survey on Crime and Safety Questionnaire. More detailed information about the SSOCS:2018 data collection and data processing procedures can be found in the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nWeighting\nSample weights allow inferences to be made about the population from which the sample units were drawn. Due to the complex nature of the SSOCS:2018 sample design, weights are necessary to obtain population-based estimates, to minimize bias arising from differences between responding and nonresponding schools, and to calibrate the data to known population characteristics in a way that reduces sampling error. The procedures used to create the SSOCS:2018 sampling weights are described below.\nEach school was assigned an initial (base) weight equal to the ratio of the number of schools available in the sampling frame in the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stratum to the number of schools sampled from the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stratum. In other words, a school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base weight was equal to the inverse of the sampling rate within its stratum. The weights were adjusted to correct for nonresponse by multiplying each school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base weight by the inverse of the response rate within the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjustment cell. Adjustment cells were defined using variables available in the sampling frame. A Chi-Squared Interaction Detection (CHAID) analysis, which automatically identifies variables predictive of response, was used to define the adjustment cells. The CHAID analysis identified the following variables as being predictive of response: school locale; number of full-timeequivalent (FTE) teachers; percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment; school enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher ratio; and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.\nVariables that are predictive of response are likely to be sources of nonresponse bias. These variables were therefore used to define the weighting adjustment cells. The nonresponse adjustments allowed the weighted distribution of the responding schools to resemble the initial distribution of the total sample (see the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnalysis of Unit Nonresponse Bias\u00e2\u0080\u009d section below).\nThe nonresponse-adjusted weights were then raked to agree with known population counts, which were obtained from the sampling frame, by school level, enrollment size, and locale. This step helps to reduce bias in the estimates due to nonresponse and/or undercoverage and may improve the precision of some estimates. As noted previously, the three variables used for raking (school level, enrollment size, and locale) have been shown to be correlated with school crime (Diliberti, Jackson, and Kemp 2017; Chen 2008; Langbein and Bess 2002; Miller 2004).\nUnit Response Rates\nA unit response rate is, at its most basic level, the ratio of surveys completed by eligible respondents to the total count of eligible respondents using the base weights (i.e., prior to\nB-5\n\n\fnonresponse adjustments). Unit response rates are traditionally reported because they reflect the potential effects of nonsampling error and indicate whether portions of the population are underrepresented due to nonresponse. To calculate any of these measures, it is first necessary to know the outcome of each sampled case. Table B-1 shows the outcomes of the 4,803 cases selected for participation in SSOCS:2018, as well as the weighted unit response rates by selected school characteristics.8 The overall weighted9 unit response rate was 61.7 percent.\n\nTable B-1.

The 261 subitems include a minimum of 80 percent of the 76 critical subitems, 60 percent of item 30 subitems, and 60 percent\n\nof item 38 subitems in column 1. Questionnaires that did not meet these criteria were considered incomplete and are excluded from the SSOCS:2018\n\ndata file.\n\n2 Nonrespondents include schools whose districts denied permission to NCES and those eligible schools that either did not respond or responded but\n\ndid not answer the minimum number of items required for the survey to be considered complete.\n\n3 Ineligible schools include those that had closed, merged with another school at a new location, changed from a regular public school to a non-\n\nregular school, or are not a school. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a school\u00e2\u0080\u009d generally refers to a school record for an organization that does not provide any classroom\n\ninstruction (e.g., an office overseeing a certain type of program or offering only tutoring services).\n\n4 The weighted response rate is calculated by applying the inverse of the probability of selection to the calculation of the unweighted response rate.\n\n5 \u00e2\u0080\u009dPrimary schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiddle schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigh\n\nschools\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 13. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCombined\n\nschools\u00e2\u0080\u009d include all other combinations of grades, including K\u00e2\u0080\u009312 schools.

While it is possible that some nonresponding schools (i.e., schools whose districts denied permission to NCES and those schools that either did not respond or did not submit a complete survey) were also ineligible, the calculation of the unweighted and weighted response rate assumed that all nonresponding schools were eligible. This is the most conservative approach to calculating the response rate. 9 The weighted response rate is calculated by applying the inverse of the probability of selection (including the sampling adjustment factor) to the calculation of the unweighted response rate.\nB-6\n\n\fAnalysis of Unit Nonresponse Bias\nThe existence of nonresponding schools has the potential to introduce bias into survey estimates, depending on the magnitude of the nonresponse and whether differences exist between responding and nonresponding schools in characteristics related to the estimates of interest. Because NCES Statistical Standard 4-4 requires analysis of nonresponse bias for any survey stage with a base-weighted unit response rate less than 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent of this bias in SSOCS:2018 (U.S. Department of Education 2014).\nComparisons of the sample and target population, respondents and nonrespondents, and relative response probability across frame variable categories were examined to identify potential sources of bias. The school characteristics used in the unit nonresponse bias analysis were school locale; number of FTE teachers; school level; region; percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment; school enrollment size; student-to-FTE teacher ratio; and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. These variables are available for all U.S. public schools from the CCD, and thus were known for all schools sampled for SSOCS:2018 regardless of whether they responded. Based on these characteristics, the analysis found that there were significant differences between responding and nonresponding schools. For example, schools with an enrollment of 1,000 students or more, city schools, and schools in which less than 50 percent of students are White, non-Hispanic were significantly underrepresented among respondents, relative to their share of the target population (see table B-1).\nTo provide a fuller picture of the risk of bias in key estimates, correlations between the school characteristics and survey variables were analyzed, and key estimates were compared between the lowest propensity respondents (i.e., schools with characteristics resembling those of nonrespondents) and other respondents. The school characteristics (which are known for both respondents and nonrespondents) were found to be correlated with a number of survey variables (which are known only for respondents). This implies that the observed bias in school characteristics, if not adjusted for, would likely lead to bias in key SSOCS:2018 estimates.\nA CHAID analysis was conducted to inform the selection of weighting classes to be used to produce nonresponse-adjusted weights. Based on the CHAID analysis, the base weights were adjusted for potential nonresponse bias in school level; locale; enrollment size; percentage of White, non-Hispanic enrollment; region; percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch; student-to-FTE-teacher ratio; and number of FTE teaching staff. The results show that before the nonresponse adjustment, approximately 56 percent of the 32 categories from the eight school characteristics were significantly biased. After the adjustment, only about 3 percent were significantly biased. Therefore, the adjustments were effective in removing most of the observed bias in the eight frame characteristics. Because these characteristics are known to be correlated with survey variables, this suggests the weighting adjustments incorporated into the SSOCS:2018 weights help to mitigate nonresponse bias in key estimates.\nB-7\n\n\fHowever, some estimates may be subject to nonresponse bias that is not related to the observable characteristics used to create nonresponse-adjusted weights. This type of bias would not be removed by weighting adjustments. Therefore, data users are cautioned that, because survey variables are not observed for nonrespondents, the exact amount of nonresponse bias remaining in key estimates cannot be known with certainty and is likely to vary between estimates.\nFor more information on the analysis of unit nonresponse, please see the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nItem Response Rates\nJust as some principals chose to not respond to the SSOCS:2018 survey request, there were some principals who did respond but did not answer all of the survey items. Unweighted item response rates are calculated by dividing the number of sampled schools responding to an item by the number of schools to which the item was applicable. Weighted item response rates are calculated in the same way by weighting each school by the inverse of its probability of selection.\nWeighted 10 item-level response rates in SSOCS:2018 were generally high, ranging from 87 to 100 percent. The mean item response rate for SSOCS:2018 was about 98 percent. Of the 261 subitems in the SSOCS questionnaire (i.e., all subitems in the questionnaire except the nonsurvey items that collect information about the respondent), most (235) had response rates greater than 95 percent, 24 had response rates between 90 and 95 percent, and 2 had response rates below 90 percent. The two subitems with response rates below 90 percent are listed below:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 C0326\u00e2\u0080\u0093Number of recorded incidents of physical attacks or fights with a weapon (weighted response rate of 89 percent)\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 C0330\u00e2\u0080\u0093Number of recorded incidents of physical attacks or fights without a weapon (weighted response rate of 87 percent)\nAnalysis of Item Nonresponse Bias\nNCES Statistical Standard 4-4 requires an analysis of item nonresponse bias for any item with a base-weighted item response rate less than 85 percent. No specific items were analyzed for potential nonresponse bias because all SSOCS:2018 items met the threshold of 85 percent response.\nImputation Procedures\nFiles containing missing data can be problematic because, depending on how the missing data are treated, analysis of incomplete datasets may cause different users to arrive at different conclusions. Another problem with missing data is that certain groups of respondents may be more likely than others to leave some survey items unanswered, creating bias in the survey estimates. When completed SSOCS:2018 surveys contained some level of item nonresponse\n10 Base weights (which are equal to the inverse of each school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probability of selection) were used to calculate item response rates.\nB-8\n\n\fafter the conclusion of the data collection phase, imputation procedures were used to create values for all questionnaire items with missing information.\nThe imputation methods utilized in SSOCS:2018 were tailored to the nature of the survey item. Three methods were used: ratio, direct copy, and clerical. These methods are described in detail in the School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009318 Data File User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manual (Padgett et al. 2019).\nSampling Variability\nEstimates derived from a probability sample are subject to sampling error because only a small fraction of the target population is surveyed. In surveys with complex sampling designs, such as SSOCS:2018, estimates of standard errors that assume simple random sampling typically underestimate the variability in the point estimates. The standard errors in this report were produced using the jackknife replication method. The standard errors associated with the estimates discussed in this report can be found in appendix A.\nNonsampling Error\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsampling error\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations and data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems such as unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interpretations of the meaning of survey questions, response differences related to the particular month or time of the year when the survey was conducted, response differences related to the different data collection modes, the tendency for respondents to give socially desirable responses, and mistakes in data preparation.\nIn general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. For SSOCS, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them, where possible. For instance, during the survey design phase, cognitive testing of the new and revised questionnaire items was conducted with public school principals. Cognitive testing provided the opportunity to check for consistency of interpretation of questions and definitions as well as to eliminate ambiguous items. In addition, extensive editing of the questionnaire responses was conducted to check the data for accuracy and consistency. Cases with missing or inconsistent items were recontacted by telephone to resolve problems. Data entered for all surveys, whether they were received by mail, Internet, or telephone, were reviewed to identify anomalies and to verify that data appeared correct.\nB-9\n\n\fStatistical Tests\nThe analyses in this report use tests of significance based on a two-tailed Student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s t statistic at the .05 level. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula:\nwhere x1 and x2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups) and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant; thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are included in the findings. Certain characteristics discussed in this report may be related to one another, but this analysis does not control for such possible relationships. Therefore, no causal relationships should be inferred from these results. For some selected findings and figures that present counts, a 95% confidence interval is also presented. A 95% confidence interval can be constructed such that if an estimation procedure were repeated many times, 95 percent of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population value. A 95% confidence interval can be computed by using the following formula:\nwhere \u00ed\u00a0\u00b5\u00ed\u00b1\u00a5\u00ed\u00a0\u00b5\u00ed\u00b1\u00a5 is the estimate obtained from the sample, \u00ed\u00a0\u00b5\u00ed\u00bc\u008e\u00ed\u00a0\u00b5\u00ed\u00bc\u008e is the standard deviation, and n is the number of observations. For a 95% confidence interval, z is equal to 1.96.\nB-10\n\n\fReferences\nChen, G. (2008). Communities, Students, Schools, and School Crime: A Confirmatory Study of Crime in U.S. High Schools.

While evacuating to the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s field makes sense for a fire drill that only lasts a few minutes, it may not be an appropriate location for a longer period of time. The evacuation plan should encompass relocation procedures and include backup buildings to serve as emergency shelters, such as nearby community centers, religious institutions, businesses, or other schools.

All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their classrooms.\nMental health disorders \u00e2\u0080\u0093 collectively, all diagnosable mental disorders or health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning.\nMental health professionals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 mental health services are provided by several different professions, each of which has its own training and areas of expertise. The types of licensed professionals who may provide mental health services include psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioners, psychiatric/mental health nurses, clinical social workers, and professional counselors.\nPhysical attack or fight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an actual and intentional touching or striking of another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of bodily harm to an individual.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7,#&\u00c2\u00a4 110205\nD-3\n\nFORM SSOCS-1 (10-19-2017)\n\n\fDEFINITIONS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Continued\n\nThe following words are bolded and marked by an asterisk (*) wherever they appear in the questionnaire.

Everyone would be brought indoors and building personnel would close all windows and doors and shut down the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). This would create a neutral pressure in the building, meaning the contaminated air would not be drawn into the building.\nSpecial education student \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a child with a disability, defined as mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities, who needs special education and related services and receives these under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\nSpecialized school \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a school that is specifically for students who were referred for disciplinary reasons, although the school may also have students who were referred for other reasons. The school may be at the same location as your school.\nTheft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the unlawful taking of another person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm. This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or of motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.\nThreat assessment team \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a formalized group of persons who meet on a regular basis with the common purpose of identifying, assessing, and managing students who may pose a threat of targeted violence in schools.\nTreatment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a clinical intervention addressed at lessening or eliminating the symptoms of a mental health disorder. This may include psychotherapy, medication treatment, and/or counseling.\nVandalism \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the willful damage or destruction of school property, including bombing, arson, graffiti, and other acts that cause property damage. This includes damage caused by computer hacking.\nViolence \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actual, attempted, or threatened fight or assault.\nWeapon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill. This includes look-alikes if they are used to threaten others.\n\nFORM SSOCS-1 (10-19-2017)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7,#&\u00c2\u00a4 110205 D-4\n\n\fSURVEY INSTRUCTIONS:\nFor most questions, please mark the box that best reflects your school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circumstances.
