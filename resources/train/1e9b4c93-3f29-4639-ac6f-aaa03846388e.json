Both mean body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of obesity for children have been stable since the early 2000s (1) . Childhood obesity is associated with adverse health in adulthood, including conditions such as heart disease and cancer (2) . Research is needed to understand the factors that may set the stage for childhood obesity.\nChildcare arrangements before and after school are an important childhood experience, as almost 50% of school-aged children in the USA are cared for during the hours before or after school by a person other than a parent (3) . Over the last decade, the percentage of children receiving relative-provided childcare, parental care and centre-based care has also remained stable (4) . Understanding whether childcare is linked with obesity could provide opportunities to treat and prevent childhood obesity.\nSeveral studies in the USA and the UK have found that preschool-aged children who receive informal, non-institutional care, such as care from a relative, were more likely to be obese than children who attended childcare centres or were cared for only by their parents (5) (6) (7) (8) . In the USA, children under the age of 6 months who were cared for primarily in a home that was not their parents' had higher weightfor-length z-scores at ages 1 and 3 years compared with children cared for primarily in their own home or in a childcare centre (5) . In Canada, children ages 2-4 years who received either centre-based care or childcare from a relative or an unrelated person were more likely to be obese at ages 4-10 years than those cared for only by parents (9, 10) . Studies in Europe and the USA reported that infants who received care either from a relative or in a centre were more likely to be obese later in infancy than children who received parental care (8, 11) . Some studies in Europe and the USA have found that preschool-aged children who received centre-based childcare had higher odds of becoming obese in later childhood than those who did not receive centre-based care (12) (13) (14) , while another study in the USA found no relationship between childcare arrangements in preschool and obesity (15) .\nSome studies have found that children who were cared for by a relative, particularly a grandparent, were more likely to be obese (6, 7) . Among elementary and middle-school children in the USA, about 13% are cared for by siblings and 14% by grandparents (3). In the USA, Taiwan and Japan, children who received some childcare from grandparents had higher risks of obesity than children who were not regularly cared for by grandparents (17) (18) (19) . In Hong Kong, 11-year-olds who were cared for by grandparents and other family members were more likely to be overweight or obese than children cared for only by parents (16) . Because diet, physical activity (20, 21) and caretaking behaviours (18) may be linked with children's weight, the associations between relative-provided care and children's weight may be linked to of how strictly different caregivers monitor children's diet and physical activity behaviours. Indeed, studies have reported that children's eating habits are less carefully monitored in relatives' homes compared with their parents' home (18) and that grandparents may encourage excess eating and use food as a reward when caring for children (19, 20, 22) .\nPrevious studies of the implications of childcare arrangements for children's weight have focused on young children. The goal of this study is to describe childcare arrangements and their links with obesity among school-aged children. Compared with younger children, school-aged children spend less time in childcare, are more independent and receive less supervision, even when receiving care (3). This study examines care before and after school among fifth graders and relates these with direct anthropometric measurements. Because of the variation in care arrangements and obesity rates among children of different race and ethnic groups in the USA, this study also examines the relationship between care arrangements before and after school and obesity separately for children by race and ethnic group."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), a nationally representative survey of children first interviewed as kindergarteners in the 1998/1999 school year or first-graders in 1999, who were then followed through the eighth grade. The ECLS-K includes interviews with parents, children, teachers and direct child anthropometric measurements (23) . The data for this study are from the sixth wave of data collection, collected in spring 2004, when the children were in fifth grade (11280 children). We excluded children with missing information on key variables, yielding an analytic sample of 9617 children (85%).\nThe main dependent variable for this analysis was a dichotomous indicator of whether a child was obese. The ECLS-K used trained assessors to directly measure children's height in inches to the nearest 0.25 in. with a Shorr board and weight in pounds with a digital scale; both height and weight were measured twice per wave and averaged for improved accuracy (24) . We used the 2000 Center for Disease Control Growth Reference to calculate BMI z-scores standardized to the reference population for the child's age and sex (25) . Children with BMI z-scores \u226595th percentile were classified as obese. Our results are consistent when overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) is the primary outcome instead of obesity (available on request).\nThe exposure of interest was children's primary before-school or after-school care arrangement. The ECLS-K asked parents how many hours each week the child spent in a non-parental care arrangement before or after school. If parents answered at least 1 h, the child was coded as regularly receiving non-parental care. Parents were then asked the number of hours their child received care from each provider. The person or centre that provided the most care time was coded as the primary care provider. Based on the answers to these questions, we created the following mutually exclusive categories of childcare arrangements: care only by parents, care by relatives, care by an adult unrelated to the child, centre-based care and multiple care providers including homes, centres or a combination thereof. Care provided by a parent not residing in the household was considered parental care. For children whose primary care provider was a relative, we created a variable indicating whether the relative was a grandparent, aunt or uncle or sibling.\nThe multivariate models were adjusted for child characteristics, household structure and socioeconomic characteristics that may be associated with both obesity and childcare arrangements: sex, race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian and mixed race); whether the child's parents were currently married; number of siblings in the household; number of adults in the household; whether either of the child's parents was born outside of the USA; mother's employment (full time, part time, looking for work and not working); mother's education (less than high school, high school graduate, college graduate, doctorate or professional degree); household socioeconomic quintile; urbanicity of school location (large city, large town and small town); and US Census region (Northeast, Midwest, West and South).\nWe first estimated the proportion of children in each childcare arrangement, both overall and stratified by child's obesity status, to determine which childcare arrangements were more common for obese compared with non-obese fifth graders. To investigate whether childcare arrangements were associated with obesity, we then estimated a bivariate logistic regression model with type of childcare arrangement as the predictor variable. We estimated multivariate logistic regression models, including the characteristics described earlier to determine whether there is an association between types of childcare arrangements before or after school and obesity, net of confounding from observed characteristics.\nIn an additional set of models restricted to children who received care from parents or a relative as their primary before-school or after-school care arrangement (n = 8074), we estimated bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions with the primary relative care provider as the main predictor variable.\nSome studies have indicated that children from different race and ethnic groups experience different childcare arrangements (3, 6) . To determine whether the implications of childcare arrangements also differ across these groups, we re-estimated the previous regressions including interaction terms between the primary childcare variables (type of childcare and primary relative care provider) and the child's race and ethnicity.\nThe ECLS-K used a multistage probability sampling procedure to select schools and children. Therefore, to make nationally representative inferences, all analyses were survey-weighted using the probability, cluster and strata weights calculated in the ECLS-K. Data were analyzed in April and May 2015 using Stata 12 SE."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Among fifth graders, 65% of children were regularly cared for before or after school by only their parents ( (Table A1) .\nNon-obese children were more often cared for only by parents compared with obese children (65.8% vs. 62.1%, p = 0.053), and obese fifth graders were more often cared for by relatives compared with non-obese children (21.7% vs. 18.2%, p = 0.039). There were no statistically significant differences for other care arrangements.\nIn bivariate models, children who were cared for by a relative were more likely to be obese than children who were only cared for by parents [odds ratio {OR}: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.55] ( Table 2) , but this association was explained by differences in household characteristics (parents' marital status and number of children and adults in the household). Indeed, the number of adults in the house was also positively associated with child obesity (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.39).\nTo explore further the relationship between childcare provided by relatives and obesity, model 2 in Table 2 was estimated for children who primarily received care from a relative, where the reference group is children who received care only from parents. In the bivariate model, children who were regularly cared for by siblings were more likely to be obese compared with children who were only cared for by parents (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.22). This relationship was explained by socioeconomic differences between children who were and were not obese: household socioeconomic status and mother's education and employment. There were no significant associations between care arrangements with grandparents, aunts or uncles and child obesity.\nWhile parents were the primary care providers before or after school for the majority of children across all race and ethnic groups, other care arrangements varied. Care from only parents was most common among non-Hispanic White fifth graders (69%) but least common among nonHispanic Black fifth graders (54%) ( Table A2) . Non-Hispanic White children also had the highest prevalence of care by adults not related to them, American Indians had the highest prevalence of care from relatives, Asians/Pacific Islanders had the highest prevalence of multiple sources of care, and mixed-race children had the highest prevalence of centre-based care. Given these differences in care arrangements and the differences in the prevalence of obesity (1,3) , we examined the associations between childcare arrangement and obesity for children by race and ethnic group. Table 3 presents two models (all compare Hispanic children to non-Hispanics): the first model (Panel A) examines the relationship between the type of childcare and obesity and the second (Panel B) examines the relationship between the primary relative care provider and obesity (among children who only received care from parents and other relatives). For relative care, Hispanic children did not have statistically different odds of obesity compared with non-Hispanic children (Panel B). However, Hispanic children who were cared for by an adult who was not a relative, such as a nanny or babysitter, were statistically significantly more likely to be obese compared with non-Hispanic children in similar childcare arrangements (Panel A) (OR: 5.11, 95% CI: 2.00, 13.06). This association remains significant after controlling for the other characteristics (OR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.84, 10.77). These associations were not statistically different for non-Hispanic White children, non-Hispanic Black children , Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indians and mixed-race children (results available upon request). Results were estimated using logistic regression models. Coefficients are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses. Categorical variables were entered as dummies with one group omitted."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study examined associations between childcare arrangements before and after school and the risk of obesity among fifth graders. About one-third of US fifth graders regularly receive care from a person other than a parent before or after school, while one-fifth receive care from other relatives. Children who were cared for before or after school by relatives, especially those who received care from siblings, were more likely to be obese than children who only were cared for by their parents. However, these relationships were explained by differences in household structure and socioeconomic status. Hispanic children who were cared for by an adult not related to them had significantly higher odds of obesity than non-Hispanic children, even after controlling for other risk factors. Previous studies have found positive associations between childcare from relatives, especially grandparents, and obesity among preschool-aged children (8, 11) . Our results suggest that childcare arrangements may not have these health implications for older children. Studies specifically focused on the relationship between childcare and obesity for Hispanic children have found that childcare was unrelated to obesity at age 4 years (15), but nonparental care may be protective for obesity at the start of kindergarten (6). Our results are for older children, who often receive less nutrition and physical activity monitoring from those caring for them compared with younger children (3). Also, unlike the previous studies, our data include a nationally representative sample of Hispanic children, while previous studies used non-representative or sub-national samples.\nThe risk of obesity for Hispanic children who receive care from unrelated adults could be linked to caregiving practices. For example, Hispanic adults are more likely than White adults to encourage children they are caring for to watch television (26) . However, differences in childcare practices between Hispanic parents and non-parental caregivers have been insufficiently studied. Research to identify which childcare practices differ and which create an obesogenic environment may identify care-based reasons for obesity.\nAn area for future research emerging from this study is childcare from siblings. Compared to adults, siblings may provide less supervision when they are baby sitting. While previous studies have indicated that grandparents often use childcare practices that may promote obesity, little is known about the care provided by siblings (19, 20, 22) .\nThe relationship between informal care arrangements and obesity in Hispanic children should also be investigated further. Throughout elementary school, the prevalence of obesity in the USA is highest among Hispanic children in comparison with all other race/ethnic groups (27) . In fact, the prevalence of obesity is almost 10 percentage points higher among Hispanic kindergarten children than non-Hispanic children (27) . Childcare arrangements could be linked to disparities in obesity (6, 27) .\nThis study is limited by the use of cross-sectional data, whereby we cannot establish time ordering and causality. We also do not know the quality of the care being provided or characteristics of the care provider -two factors that may be linked with children's weight. Additionally, in the USA, about 5% of elementary-school children and 27% of middleschool children care for themselves after school (3). The relationships we found between non-parental care arrangements and obesity may be biased downward if some children who actually care for themselves are classified as only receiving parental care. Children who were dropped for missing data were significantly more likely to live in the Midwest and the West and less likely to live in the South; results could be affected if children in the Midwest and the West have both different childcare arrangements and obesity risks. There were no statistically significant differences between children in the analytic sample and those dropped due to missing data on the other demographic, family or school variables. The data for this study are from 2004, but, to date, the ECLS-K is the only data set that includes both anthropometric measurements and childcare information in a nationally representative cohort. Additionally, trends in BMI and obesity, relative-provided childcare, parental care and centre-based care have remained fairly stable since the 2000s, which allows findings to still be generally applicable today (1, 4) .\nThis study explored the implications of childcare arrangements for obesity. For school-aged children, childcare arrangements do not represent an independent risk factor for obesity, although obese children are more often cared for by relatives than non-obese children. Childcare arrangements constitute an important decision for families not only early in childhood but also during the elementary-school years. Recommendations that encourage care providers and childcare centres to promote healthful eating and physical activity and eliminate screen time may help to reduce childhood obesity. Health programmes in communities with high use of relative-provided childcare and other types of childcare could consider outreach to these care providers to empower them to promote healthful eating and physical activity and reduce screen time during the times when they provide care. Childcare centres can also suggest to families strategies to promote healthy eating and physical activity. Evaluation research is needed to determine if school-based before-school and after-school programmes could be used as loci for obesity prevention, especially for children from disadvantaged communities."}, {"section_title": "Conflict of Interest Statement", "text": "No conflict of interest was declared.
