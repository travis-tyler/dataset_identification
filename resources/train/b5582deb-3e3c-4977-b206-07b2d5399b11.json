Regression analysis has been widely applied to AD research to relate clinical and biomarker data such as predicting cognitive outcomes from MRI measures.

However, the complex relationship among imaging markers are often overlooked or simplified in the existing methods. To address this issue, we present a new sparse learning method by introducing a novel network term to more flexibly model the relationship among imaging markers.

Neuroimaging data, which characterize brain structure and function and its longitudinal changes, have been studied as potential biomarkers for early detection of AD. Regression models have been studied to relate imaging markers to AD phenotypes such as cognitive outcomes.\nEarly applications focused on traditional regression models such as stepwise regression [6] , which predicted cognitive outcomes one at a time. To address the relationships among multiple outcomes, multi-task learning strategies were recently proposed for achieving improved prediction performance. For example, \u2113 2,1 -norm [8, 11] was emploed to extract features that have impact on all or most clinical scores; and a sparse Bayesian method [7] was proposed to explicitly estimate the covariance structure among multiple outcome measures.\nDespite of the above achievements, few regression models take into account the covariance structure among predictors. Since brain structures tend to work together to achieve a certain function, brain imaging measures are often correlated with each other. A recent study proposed a prior knowledge guided regression model, using the group information to enforce the intra-group similarity [10] . However, the relationships among brain structures are much more complicated than a simple partitioning of all the structures into nonoverlapping groups. To overcome this limitation, we present a new sparse learning method by introducing a novel network term to more flexibly model the relationship among brain imaging measures. This new model not only preserves the strength of \u2113 2,1 -norm to enforce similarity across multiple scores from a cognitive test, but also takes into account the complex network relationship among imaging predictors. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to the ADNI data."}, {"section_title": "Network-Guided Sparse Regression", "text": "Throughout this section, we write matrices as boldface uppercase letters and vectors as boldface lowercase letters. Given a matrix M = (m ij ), its i-th row and j-th column are denoted as m i and m j respectively. The Frobenius norm and \u2113 2,1 -norm (also called as \u2113 1,2norm) of a matrix are defined as and , respectively.\nWe focus on multi-task learning paradigm, where imaging measures are used to predict one or more cognitive outcomes. Let {x 1 , \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, x n } \u2286 \u211c d be imaging measures and {y 1 , \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, y n } \u2286 \u211c c cognitive outcomes, where n is the number of samples, d is the number of predictors (feature dimensionality) and c is the number of response variables (tasks). Let X = [x 1 , \u2026,\nx n ] and Y = [y 1 , \u2026, y n ].\nMotivated by using the \u2113 1 norm (Lasso, [5] ) to impose sparsity on relevant features, the \u2113 2,1 norm [3] was first proposed to taking into account the relationship among responses while still preserving the sparsity advantage of Lasso. The object function is: (1) This approach couples multiple tasks together, with \u2113 2 norm within tasks and \u2113 1 norm within features. While the \u2113 2 norm enforces the selection of similar features across tasks, the \u2113 1 norm helps achieve the final sparsity. It has been widely applied to capture biomarkers having affects across most or all responses. Yet in this model the rows of W are equally treated, which implies that the underlying structures among predictors are ignored. To address this issue, Group-Sparse Multi-task Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method [9] was proposed to exploit the interrelated structures within and between the predictor and response variables. It assumes 1) possible partition exists among predictors, and 2) predictors within one partition should have similar weights.\nHowever, in practice the relationship among predictors may not be as simple as a straightforward partition. For example, imaging markers can be grouped by different brain circuitries, which may overlap with each other. In addition, instead of partitioning predictors into groups, the relationship among predictors can be represented more generally by a network (e.g., Figure 1 (a)). To model these more complicated but more flexible structures among predictors, we propose a new Network-Guided \u2113 2,1 Sparse Learning (NG-L21) model as follows. The key idea here is to introduce a new regularization term ( ) to the \u2113 2,1 model (Eq (1)) and formulate the objective function as: (2) where \u03b1 is a sparse matrix in which each row indicates a neighborhood relationship within a network of connected predictors. given as prior knowledge, where nodes are predictors. In this study, the network is constructed as follows: An edge (i, j) is inserted to the network if and only if r(i, j) exceeds a given threshold (e.g., 0.5 used in our experiments), where r(i, j) is the Pearson correlation coefficient between predictors i and j calculated based on the training data. Fig. 1(b) shows an example correlation network. Based on the network, we can define the knowledge matrix \u03b1 as follows: for each edge i, j in the network, we create a row in \u03b1 with i-th entry as \u22121, j-th entry as 1 and all the other entries as zeros. The intuition is that the weight difference between two correlated predictors should be minimized, which is reflected by the new regularization term of . We call this model NG-L21. Instead of using \u22121 and 1 in \u03b1, we can fill in the actual \u2212r(i, j) and r(i, j) values for each edge (i, j). Thus, the more correlated a feature pair is, the more constraint the pair is imposed by. We call this weighted model NG-L21 w .\nEq. (2) can be solved by taking the derivative w.r.t W and setting it to 0:\nwhere D 1 = \u03b1 T \u03b1, a matrix in which each row integrates all the neighboring relationships.\nFor i-th row, it is the sum of all the rows in \u03b1 whose i-th element is not zero. D 2 is a diagonal matrix with the i-th diagonal element as .

According to\nStep 2 in the algorithm, we have Finally we have:\nThe last but one step holds, because [8] for any vector w and w 0 , we have . Thus, the algorithm decreases the objective value in each iteration. Since the problem is convex, satisfying the Eq. (2) indicates that W is the global optimum solution. Therefore, this algorithm will converge to the global optimum of the problem.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nThis study included 179 AD and 205 healthy control (HC) participants ( Table 2 as joint response variables), and Wechsler Memory Scale III logical memory (LogMem). Using the regression weights derived from the HC participants, all the imaging measures were pre-adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education, handedness, and intracranial volume, and all the cognitive measures were pre-adjusted for the baseline age, gender, education and handedness.\nRegression was performed separately on each cognitive task (MMSE, RAVLT, or LogMem) using the MRI measures as predictors, where the proposed NG-L21 and NG-L21 w methods and three competing regression methods (Linear, Ridge and L21) were evaluated. Pearson correlation coefficients r between the actual and predicted cognitive scores were computed to measure the prediction performance. Five-fold cross validation was employed to obtain an unbiased estimate of regression performance.

Rather than including all pairwise links, threshold 0.5 was applied to connect only highly correlated nodes. For nodes that were not very correlated, constraints should not be imposed to make their regression weights similar to each other. A network was created using only the training data. Thus, our 5 cross-validation trials yielded 5 networks that were almost identical. One example was shown in Fig. 1(b) , where totally 85 structures out of 99 had qualified links with correlation coefficient higher than 0.5. To incorporate this connectivity information into the proposed models, we examined the weighted network in NG-L21 w and non-weighted one in NG-L21. While in the weighted network each link between structures was assigned the value of their correlation coefficient, non-weighted network treated all the links equally. Table. 3 is the performance comparison among all five methods. NG-L21 and NG-L21 w both demonstrated an improved performance over the other three methods, while L21 performed the best among the three competing methods. The difference between NG-L21 and NG-L21 w was minor, and the weighted method only led to slight improvements than non-weighted one for TOTAL, TOT6 and LogMem. This could be partially due to the small range of the edge weights (0.5-1.0). To further make sure the improvements of the proposed methods were not by chance, we calculated p-values from the paired sample t test between two sets of cross-validation correlation coefficients from two different methods. According to the last two rows in Table 3 , both NG-L21 and NG-L21 w outperformed L21 significantly for predicting all the tested cognitive outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Prediction Performance and Biomarker Identification", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Shown in", "text": "Finally, we examined the biomarkers identified by different methods. Shown in Fig. 2 was an example comparison of resulting regression coefficients among four methods (NG-L21 w was extremely similar to NG-L21 and thus not shown), where 99 MRI measures were used to predict MMSE score. Each methods occupied two panels, representing the left and right hemispheres respectively. Apparently NG-L21 and L21 both showed sparse patterns while Linear and Ridge methods yielded non-sparse patterns that were hard to interpret. In addition, NG-L21 tended to select slightly more features than L21 as correlated measures were forced to be selected together in NG-L21, which yielded not only more stable patterns across cross-validation trials but also more biologically meaningful and more interpretable results. The MRI markers identified by NG-L21 yielded promising patterns that matched prior knowledge on neuroimaging and cognition. MMSE measured overall cognitive impairment; and thus its result (Fig. 2) included important AD-relevant imaging markers such as hippocampus, amygdala, inferior lateral ventricle, entorhinal cortex, and middle temporal gyri. Both LogMem and RAVLT were memory tests; and thus their results (Fig. 2) included regions relevant to memory, such as hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyri and parahippocampal gyri."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We presented a new network-guided sparse learning model NG-L21 and demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to the ADNI data for predicting cognitive outcomes from MRI scans. While spatial correlation had been considered in several voxel-based feature selection and learning models [2, 4] , the existing studies on predicting cognitive outcomes from ROIbased MRI measures often ignored [7, 8] or simplified [10] the relationships among these ROI predictors. The proposed NG-L21 model aimed to bridge this gap and introduced a novel network term to flexibly model the relationship among imaging markers. An efficient algorithm was developed to implement this model and was shown to be able to achieve global optimum. Its application to the ADNI data exhibited the following strengths of the NG-L21 model: (1) It could flexibly take into account the complex relationship among imaging markers in a network format rather than a simple grouping scheme used in [10] . (2) As a multi-task sparse learning framework, it could identify a compact set of imaging markers related to multiple cognitive outcomes. (3) By considering the correlation among predictors, it yielded not only improved prediction performance but also more stable crossvalidation feature selection patterns. Different from traditional Lasso and L21 methods that tended to select only one relevant feature from a group of highly correlated ones, the NG-L21 model could jointly identify these correlated features, making the results more stable and easier to interpret. Table 3 Mean prediction performance over five cross-validation trial is reported for each experiment, where the performance is measured by correlation coefficients between the actual and predicted cognitive scores in each trial. The p values, calculated from the paired sample t test between two sets of cross-validation correlation coefficients, are shown for comparing two proposed methods with L21. "}]
