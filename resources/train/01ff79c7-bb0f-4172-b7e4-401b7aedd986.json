The proposed method models the distribution of GM and WM tissues grouping the voxels belonging to each tissue in ROIs associated to a specific neurological disorder.

The proposed algorithm was used over these images to parcel ROIs associated to the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Additionally, this method can be used to extract a reduced set of discriminative features for classification, since it compresses discriminative information contained in the brain. Voxels marked by ROIs which were computed using the proposed method, yield classification results up to 90% of accuracy for controls (CN) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and 84% of accuracy for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD patients.

Due to the increasing life expectancy and ageing of the population in developed nations, they are expected to affect 60 million people worldwide over the next 50 years. A distinctive example of these neurodegenerative disorders is the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Indeed, the latest estimates argue for global prevalence of AD to be quadrupled by 2050. slow, degenerative disease related to pathological amyloid depositions and hyperphosphorylation of structural proteins in the brain [1] . Its progression depends on every individual, and it usually begins showing signs of mild memory problems which turn into severe brain damage some years later. As for other neurological disorders, there is currently no cure for the AD; however early diagnosis may help to slow down the rapid advance of the disease. Although the development of the disease depends on the individual, aging, etc. there are many common symptoms in addition to structural changes in the brain. Some specific imagebased diagnostic methods for AD and other neurological disorders that use functional imaging have been developed previously. Since AD causes loss of brain function, affecting the areas of the brain related to memory, thought and language, it is possible to deal with automatic diagnosis tools by learning patterns associated to brain functions. In fact, there exist some methods that aim to detect functional brain variations [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] by exploiting the information contained in the images to learn patterns associated to cerebral damage.\nAD can usually be diagnosed by means of neuropsychological tests [7] , but at an early stage of the disease, when symptomatic cognitive problems are perceptible, a noticeable neurodegeneration has already occurred [8] . However [9, 10] , suggest that pathological manifestations of AD can be detected some years earlier, before cognitive problems arise. This would allow to start specific therapy for the patient at early stages of the disease. In fact, works such as [1, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] are focused in the use of both different statistical and artificial intelligence methods to reveal patterns in MCI patients relating to either structural artrophy in MRI or functional patterns that allow to differentiate them from AD or control patients (CN). The most functional imaging-based techniques use Single Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) [2, 3, 15] or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images [4, 16] to detect decreased blood perfusion or decreased glucose metabolism in brain areas associated to AD. These methods aim to build models from a set of labelled images to be used for further classification of new patients. In this way, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used in [4, 17] to model functional images in order to select regions of interest (ROIs) for AD. Unfortunately, GMM-based methods are not straightforward to apply for ROI computation in MRI due to the high number of voxels and the high number of Gaussian components to be estimated. Consequently, it may result unfeasible in practice. See [18] for a comprehensive explanation of the maximum likelihood method and a performance comparison with other existing methods. That work concludes that the maximum likelihood estimates are the most accurate, closely followed by the regression-type estimates, quantile method, and finally, the method of moments. The only disadvantage of the maximum likelihood estimation is that this technique is most computationally expensive.\nOther works such as [19, 20] use principal component analysis to extract relevant features for AD diagnosis linked to discriminative regions, though. Similarly [21] , defines association rules over discriminative regions. Nevertheless, such works use functional images to reveal discriminative regions and to classify brain images.\nNeurodegeneration relating to AD produces abnormal structural changes in the brain, which eventually result on extreme shrinkage of the hippocampal volume or extreme reduction of its cortical thickness, as well as a severe enlargement of the internal ventricles. However, some structural changes associated to early AD are revealed to be similar to those caused by natural ageing process. Therefore, despite AD diagnosis can be addressed by detecting these structural changes [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , it is not straightforward to distinguish them in early stages of the disease, when only minor symptomatic cognitive dysfunctions are evidenced (i.e. progressive MCI patients) [28] . A review of different methods for automatic classification of AD using MRI images from the ADNI database can be found in [13] .\nUnlike methods that use intensity voxels for classification [29] , most methods based on MRI begin with an image segmentation into different tissues and, later, a comparison of tissue distribution. Thus [30] , uses an ensemble of sparse classifiers directly over the segmented tissues [30] , without parcelling ROIs. Other works, however, take into account the tissue distribution in relevant brain regions related to AD. These regions, namely Regions of Interest (ROI), can be obtained by grouping voxels into anatomical regions using a labelled atlas [13, 31, 32] . ROI-based methods such as [33] parcel the brain into ROIs or segment the hippocampus [34, 35] by wrapping an anatomy atlas, in order to compare tissue volumes in CN/AD or MCI/AD patients. These works report classification accuracies up to 90% on diagnosed AD patients through postmortem analysis. Thus, as ROIs reveal brain areas linked to neurodegeneration, selection of voxels belonging to ROIs plays an important role in the classification task by allowing the classifier to be fed with the most discriminative information. Therefore, extracting relevant ROIs from training images that can be treated as markers, can finally determine the classification results.\nCurrent trend on studies focused on AD/CN and MCI/AD classification consist on using a single imaging modality. As shown above, some methods use functional imaging whereas other use structural MRI, and the analysis of each image modality can reveal different markers associated to the disease. For instance, MRI analysis reports grey matter atrophy that usually results in differences in both, the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Additionally, it has been proved that early changes in the hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex are related to evidences of early AD, while this is not so obvious in other cerebral structures [1, 36] . In fact, our contribution shows that incorporating patterns revealed from differences in white matter helps to achieve better classification results.\nPrevious works such as [37] use MRIs from each class instead of segmented images in order to compute ROIs. On the other hand, in [37] , class prototypes are computed by using the LVQ algorithm [38] and new images are projected onto these prototypes to extract features in a similar way to the eigenface approach [39] . Besides, in [24] , a method to extract ROIs from MRIs avoiding segmentation is shown. In this case it is not necessary to perform a MRI segmentation; conversely, image preprocessing such as intensity normalization must be carried out. However, the level of accuracy provided by this method is significantly lower than the one provided by our approach, especially for MCI/AD classification, since it deals with early AD diagnosis.\nIn our work, structural MRI is used to automatically reveal 3D brain regions associated to AD by means of analyzing the distribution of WM and GM tissues in the brain. The computed ROIs are later used as a mask in order to extract voxels from relevant regions for subsequent analyses. Thus, regions linked to a specific brain disorder are automatically computed by quantizing the space into a number of regions that group similar voxels. This way, it is not necessary to get additional information from any anatomy atlas. Additionally, a measurement of relative importance is calculated for each ROI on the basis of its discriminative capability for AD diagnosis. This is accomplished by computing a number of prototype vectors using the SOM algorithm that quantize the space taking into account differences between CN and AD images. Consequently, the receptive field of each SOM unit represents a ROI on the image and its relative importance can be computed by means of the discriminative power of each voxel. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed method to extract and to selecting ROIs. The devised method has been evaluated in terms of its ability to classify new patients (not used in the training stage) correctly, through extensive experiments performed over the 1075-T1 ADNI database.\nThe main contributions of this work can be summarized in the following:\n1. A method for automatic ROI delineation is proposed, using SOM to quantize the feature space composed by voxel coordinates and information regarding voxel differences between classes. 2. It automatically reveals brain areas (ROIs) according to patterns learnt to differentiate CN and AD patients (or MCI/AD patients).\n3. A relative importance measurement is also computed for each ROI, to indicate its discriminative capability. 4. The method has been assessed through extensive experiments using 818 images from the 1075-T1 ADNI database, yielding 90% (AUC 0.92) and 84% (AUC 0.84) of classification accuracy within CN/AD and MCI/AD, respectively.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section materials and methods shows the materials and methods used in this work, including the necessary background to support the next sections and details on the database used to assess the proposed method. Examples of ROI computation are also provided in this section. Experimental results section provides classification results using ROIs computed with the proposed method over the database previously described.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimers disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.

During the training stage, the prototypes keep the most representative part of the input data, while the units on the output space (i.e. 2D or 3D lattice) holding similar prototypes (in terms of Euclidean distance) are moved closed together into a group. Thus, some important features of the input space can be inferred from the output space [42] , regarding the input space modelling, density distribution of the data space and feature selection. SOM training is performed in a competitive way so that just a single neuron wins (i.e. its prototype vector is the most similar one to the input data instance). The most similar prototype to the input data sample is called Best Matching Unit (BMU) and it is computed as:\nwhere v k is the k-sample from the input space, v i is the iprototype (i.e. the weight associated the the i-unit) and S is the output SOM space. Moreover, prototypes of neurons belonging to the neighbourhood of the BMU are also updated according to\nwhere a(t) is the learning factor and h i,j (t) is the neighbourhood function defining the unit surrounding the BMU v i .\n, where a 0 is the initial learning rate and T is the training length. SOM training is accomplished in two phases. The first one provides a rough organization of the map by setting the initial radius to round(max (1, ffiffiffiffiffi ffi nd p )) (where nd is the number of SOM units) and the initial learning rate a 0 to 0.1. The second phase aims to fine-tune the map, and uses a smaller initial neighbourhood radius, specifically round(max(1, ffiffiffiffiffi ffi nd p =2)). Moreover, the learning rate is also smaller in this phase, specifically a 0~0 :05.\nThe training process generates the prototype vectors v i which quantize the data manifold and represent cluster centres on the data, mapped to each BMU. As SOM units are located at different positions in a 3D lattice, the feature space is projected onto a 3D space."}, {"section_title": "Statistical significance of voxels", "text": "A MRI is composed of a high number of voxels according to a previously-stated image resolution. Images in the ADNI database used in this work contain 12161456121 voxels after normalization. Since not all the voxels result equally discriminative for classification [21] , they could be ranked according to a specific discriminative criterion. Thus, the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) [43] which is characterized by its separation capability as shown in [43, 44] has been used to compute the discriminative power of each voxel. In the two-class separation case, FDR is defined as \nFrom equations 4 and 5, a FDR image which contains the corresponding FDR value at each precise voxel position can be defined. FDR value increases as the variable results in more discriminative values between the two classes. FDR values are further incorporated to the ROI computation stage to calculate the relative importance of each ROI. At this point, it is important to highlight that FDR is considered a part of the training stage. Thus, it is computed by using only images from the training subsets during cross-validation, ensuring that test data is never used for training. Figure 2 shows the FDR values computed for some relevant slices on the coronal and axial planes, according to the scale shown in the colorbar. In these figures relevant areas related to the Alzheimer's disease such as the hippocampus appear with a high FDR value, indicating a higher discriminative power over other areas."}, {"section_title": "Feature generation and ROI modelling", "text": "Due to the high number of voxels present in a MR image, methods that aim to compress or synthesise the information contained in these voxels in a reduced number of features allow the diminishing of the classification task's computational cost. Regardless of this process, non-relevant features can be taken out. One of the classical tools for dimensionality reduction is the wellknown Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [43] . PCA can be used to generate a reduced number of features from the MRI voxels in order to improve both, classification accuracy and computational effectiveness. In this paper we present a new approach that generates ROIs by quantizing the MRI space by using a SOM, and results using PCA and Voxel as Features (VAF) methods are provided as baselines for comparison.\nPrincipal Component Analysis. PCA generates an orthonormal basis vector indicating the maximum variance directions. Thus, the projection onto this basis maximizes the scatter of all the projected samples. The PCA method can be briefly described as follows. Let X~\u00bdx 1 ,x 2 ,:::,x N be the sample set of training vectors, where N is the number of patients in the MRI database. Thus, each image is converted into a column vector that comprises the intensities of each voxel. After normalizing X to zero mean and unity variance, we obtain a new whithened dataset Y [43] and its covariance matrix can be computed as~1 N YY T . The eigenvectors W and eigenvalues l of S can be computed by solving SW~Wl. Thus, the eigenvectors or principal components (PCs) of the covariance matrix, define the directions of maximum variance of the data manifold. Usually, the eigenvectors are chosen in increasing-variance order, in such a way that the first eigenvectors compress the most part of the variance explained [43] . Subsequently, the projections of the data samples onto the S low dimensional space spanned by the principal components are used in the classification task. ROI modelling using SOM. The method presented in this paper aims not only to reduce the dimensionality of the input space but also to compute ROIs and then weight them according to their relative importance. The core idea of the method consists on quantize the MRI space by a number of prototypes which model the intensity distribution in different brain areas. Thus, information about intensity is incorporated to the quantization process in order to group the voxels according to their intensity level and being later capable to model the MRI intensity distribution in the SOM space. Therefore, the feature space is composed by vectors which contain the voxel's three-coordinates location in the three first coordinates and the intensity difference between CN and AD images. Such a difference image is computed as . From the BMU concept described in section, the RF of a unit i (RF i ) can be defined as\ndenoting the set of input data vectors for which v i is the BMU. Subsequently, the relative importance of each ROI is computed according to the following equation\nwhere I(x i ) and FDR i denote the intensity and the FDR value respectively, of the voxel at coordinates (\ni ). Figure 3 shows the SOM units after training when using a 3D cylindrical (infinite plane) lattice [38] . The first three coordinates of the SOM prototypes determine the position of each unit which represents a cluster centre. The fourth coordinate is depicted using different colours indicating the importance of the ROI according to the colorbar.\nThe core idea behind the presented method consists on quantizing the space to a number of model vectors, and to categorize them according to their relative importance and the level of intensity in the difference image. Consequently, the number of extracted ROIs corresponds to the number of units in to its R value. In these figures, different patterns associated to CN and AD are revealed and they are clearly shown.\nFigures 6(a) and 6(b) show the difference between CN and AD images in the left column and the ROIs computed in the right column. Each ROI is marked with a different colour that indicates the relevance of that ROI according to its discriminative power. ROIs depicted in Figure 6 have been computed using FDR values above 90% of its maximum value.\nSimilarly, Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show difference images and ROIs coloured according to its discriminative power for MCI/AD images. It is worth mentioning that most relevant ROIs computed by the proposed method, specially in GM, are compatible with areas that appear in literature as representative regions of AD, located in the temporal lobe, such as hippocampus and the superior temporal gyrus which are responsible for the individual's memory formation, speech perception, and language skills [45, 46] . In the case of MCI patients, the method truly reveals structural changes mainly focused on the hippocampus area."}, {"section_title": "Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)", "text": "Classification of the feature vectors consisting of the relative importance measure computed as indicated in the ROI modelling section is accomplished by means of Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs were introduced in 70's by Vapnik [47] and consisted of a set of supervised learning methods widely used for classification and regression [47, 48] , which were designed to split off a set of binary-labelled data by means of a hyperplane. Specifically, they compute the maximal margin hyperplane to achieve maximum separation between classes. SVMs operate by building a decision function in the form f : R n ?f+1g using ndimensional training vectors x i and class labels l i :\nin such a way that f is able to correctly classify new samples (x,l). Linear discriminative functions define decision hyperplanes in a multidimensional feature space:\nwhere u is the weight vector and u 0 is a bias (threshold). This way, u T xzu 0 \u00a71 if class y i~z 1 and u T xzu 0 \u01921 if class y i~{ 1, and the weight vector u is orthogonal to the decision hyperplane. Finding the optimal separating hyperplane is accomplished by an optimization task consisting of finding the unknown parameters u i ,i~1,::,n which define the decision hyperplane. Let x i ,i~1,:::,s be the feature vectors of the training set X . These belong to one of the two classes, either u 1 or u 2 . If the classes are linearly separable, the objective would be to design a hyperplane that correctly classified all the training vectors. As a result, that hyperplane is not unique and the optimization process focuses on maximizing the generalization performance of the classifier, which can be defined as the effectiveness of the classifier to operate with new data. Among some other criteria, the maximal margin hyperplane is usually selected since it provides the maximum margin of separation between the two classes. Since the distance from a point f to the hyperplane is given by z~Dg(x)D=EuE, to scale u and u 0 so that the value of g(x) is z1 for the nearest point in u 1 and {1 for the nearest points in u 2 , reduces the optimization problem to maximizing the margin 2=EuE with the constrains:\nThus, designing the classifier leads to a non-linear (quadratic) optimization task subject to a set of linear inequality constrains. The solution u is found to be a linear combination of N s \u0192s feature vectors and the optimum hyperplane is called the support vector machine.\nFor non-linearly separable data, the optimization process needs to be modified to work in combination with kernel techniques, so that the hyperplane that defines the SVM corresponds to a nonlinear decision boundary in the input space. The use of kernels enables to map the data into some other dot product space F (namely, feature space) through a non-linear transformation w : R N ?F , and perform the described linear algorithm in F . Thus, the decision function is nonlinear in the input space and takes the form\nwhere parameters a i and si are the solution for the optimization process, solved by either Quadratic Programming (QP) or the wellknown Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) [49] and the support vectors [47] (i.e. the training vectors that are closest to the linear classifier since lie on either of the two hyperplanes, i.e. u T xzu 0~+ 1. In our case, we used a Radial Basis Function (RBF) K(x, l)~exp({cE(x{lE 2 ) as kernel function. In fact, the use of radial basis functions as kernels in SVMs have proved to supply better results than linear kernels for different applications [11, 50] ."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "To demonstrate the relevance of the proposed ROI selection method for diagnosis purposes, we applied the devised ROI selection algorithm to the overall database described in the Database subsection, including CN, MCI and AD patients. Such a procedure aims to objectively evaluate the discriminative power of the computed ROIs. Thus, classification through SVM supervised learning is carried out to group the images according to the value of R obtained in equation 8 for each ROI. All the classification experiments were performed considering different subsets for cross validation. Specifically, sets of CN/AD and MCI/AD patients were obtained from the data manifold using k-fold, which takes k images for testing and use the rest for training. As usual, we used 10-fold (k = 10) in our experiments. Results for CN/AD and MCI/AD classification are shown in Figures 8 and 9 , respectively. These results were compared to the Voxels As Features (VAF) technique [5, 51] which uses all the intensity voxels to feed the classifier in both, training and testing stages. In other words, VAF does not concern any feature generation or selection technique. On the contrary, scaled versions of the probability maps obtained as indicated in the Image Preprocessing section from segmented images, were used as features. Since VAF uses all the information contained in the images without selecting discriminative voxels, it may decrease the classification performance. Our method, which uses voxel selection and feature generation associated to ROIs, outperforms the VAF approach as shown in Figure 8 . Additionally, experiments using PCA as described in the Statistical significance of voxels section, were performed for comparison. Our proposed method also outperforms the approach which uses PCA for feature extraction as shown in Table 2 as well. The experiments described above state that computed ROIs effectively indicate brain areas concerning AD, as above described. In fact, hippocampus and primary auditory cortex areas are marked as relevant regions in the computed ROIs. We also found that ventricles were marked too, which would correspond to brain areas as indicated in the literature [45, 46, 52] affected by atrophy process linked to neurodegeneration in AD. Similarly to the experiments described above for CN/AD patients, experiments that aim to differentiate between MCI and AD patients were carried out. Thus, MCI/AD classification results are shown in Figure 9 . In this case, as image differences between MCI and AD are not so evident as in the CN/AD case, specific feature generation and reduction methods may result especially relevant to improve classification outcomes. Moreover, brain areas revealed through differences between MCI and AD patients are not as clear as in the CN/AD case, and ROI selection helps figure out patterns relating to MCI. In this way, computed ROIs show differences mainly focused in the hippocampus area, stating differences associated to the atrophy in this brain area.\nAt the same time, ROIs extracted from MCI patients have been assessed by means of classification experiments. Figures 8 and 9 shows the performance of our method, which clearly outperforms the VAF approach. Moreover, these results set the stability in terms of the number of SOM prototypes of the proposed approach to compute ROIs and their relevance for classification. Figure 8 also states the effectiveness of the proposed method for extracting relevant brain areas relating to to AD, and the assignment of a relative relevance value to each one of these regions. Thus, accuracy values up to 90% and sensitivity values up to 87% were obtained, outperforming the classification results obtained when features are computed by means of classical techniques such as PCA. On the other hand, classification results between MCI and AD are shown in Figure 9 , providing 83% of accuracy and 76% of sensitivity levels. Moreover, Figure 10 (a) shows the Receiving Operating Curve (ROC) for MCI/AD classification, yielding an Area Under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92. Similarly, ROC curve for MCI/AD is depicted in Figure 10(b) , where the computed AUC was 0.84, indicating high sensitivity for AD patients.\nIt is worth noting that there are several factors that may affect the classification results. One of them is related to the gold-standard diagnosis in the ADNI database, as only living subjects were analysed. This fact is specially relevant due to the difficulty for diagnosing AD in vivo [8, 51] . In fact [51] , shows that AD classification accuracy level diminishes when autopsy data is not available. In other words, patients whose medical records are contained in the ADNI database do not usually show severe AD, but mild AD symptoms [8] . This way, as results provided in this work are close to the ones obtained in other recent works such as [13] . Therefore, it can be stated that differences in MCI patients determine the effectiveness of ROI computation. Consequently, the experiments brought about within this work show the importance of the feature selection methods in AD diagnosis through MRI imaging, which are even more relevant in the case of MCI classification.

Specifically, a three-dimensional Self-Organizing Map is used to model MRI images selecting ROIs related to a particular neurological disorder. Images from controls and AD patients are used to compute tissue differences by means of voxel contrastation. Subsequently, the MRI space is quantized, computing a number of prototype vectors from features extracted taking into account the spatial relationship among voxels, figuring out similar areas within the difference image. Additionally, the relative importance of each cluster is computed by means of the cluster sizes and the statistical significance of the discriminative power of the voxels that make up the ROI. The spatial relationship among clusters is also preserved in the SOM output space due to the SOM's topology preserving properties. The method has been assessed by selecting a set of images from the ADNI [40] database, using the ROIs automatically computed using the presented approach. Moreover, most relevant ROIs computed across this method, specially in GM, are compatible with areas that appear in literature as representative regions of AD such as hippocampus [45, 46, 52] . The classification results provide average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of up to 90%, 87% and 92%, respectively, for 10 cross-validation folds, while the AUC is 0.92. On the other hand, our method is capable to distinguish MCI from AD patients up to 83% of accuracy and AUC of 0.84. Classification experiments state the effectiveness of the proposed method to select relevant brain areas that are related to Alzheimer's disease. Since structural differences between MCI and AD are not as clear as in the CN/ AD case, results obtained for MCI/AD classification indicate the applicability of the method for an early diagnosis of AD. Furthermore, it is also devised to be applicable to uncover some other hidden neurological disorders, through small structural brain alterations, as well as be useful to explore adjacent brain areas related to such disorders."}]
