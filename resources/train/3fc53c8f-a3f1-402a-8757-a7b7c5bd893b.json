For example, between 1968 and 1987 their market share in nonreal estate farm lending in the U.S. ranged from a high of 66.8 percent (9.7 billion dollars) in 1968, to a low of47.3 percent (32.8 billion dollars) in 1981, closing at 53, I percent in 1987 (Walraven and Rosine) . The fluctuation in the market share is a combination of the adjustment in the volume of funds lent by banks to the agriculture sector and the adjustment in the number of banks lending to the agriculture sector.\nIn Texas, the proportion of banks with zero agricultural loans outstanding increased from 16,6 percent in 1968 16,6 percent in to 35.5 percent in 1987 16,6 percent in . Between 1980 16,6 percent in and 1987 I commercial banks, which had been active agricultural lenders in this period, had zero nonreal estate agricultural loans outstanding in 1987. Many factors have led to these fluctuations in agricultural lending.\nIt is expected that recent deregulation of commercial banks has affected agricultural lending. Since the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (particularly with the elimination of interest rate ceilings --commonly known as regulation Q) banks have increased their competitiveness in acquiring loanable funds, mainly in form of time deposits (Bundt and Schweitzer; Waldrop; Keely and Zimmerman).\nHowever, these time deposits are associated with higher and more variable costs that increase the overall risk of the bank operation. Moreover, changes in the type and characteristics of a bank's loanable finds can elicit a realignment of the bank's asset portfolio to reflect the new composition of its liabilities. The competition for Ioanable funds has an effect on the cost and availability of loan finds to agricultural borrowers.\nBorrowing costs go up as lenders attempt to transfer some of these higher costs incurred in acquiring funds to borrowers. Loan funds to agricultural borrowers may be curtailed, for example, as banks seek to match their interest rate sensitive liabilities with interest rate sensitive, nonloan assets.\nBanks might increase security requirements, or decrease the term of the loan.\nBanks might also opt to increase the supervision of the loans to increase performance.\nA tobit econometric procedure was used in this study to examine the effects of selected demand and supply factors on agricultural lending.\nIn particular, the impact that increased commercial bank reliance on the interest sensitive deposits after deregulation has on funds that banks allocate to agriculture relative to other investment opportunities was examined.\nAlso, independent banks were compared to multi-bank holding company (MBHC) affiliates to determine the impact of bank organization on the share of agricultural loans in their asset portfolios.\nThere were 1053 Texas banks included in this study. Each of these banks was in business before deregulation ( 1978) and after deregulation (1987) .\nIn 1978, 7.3 percent and 25.8 percent of the rural and urban banks were MBHC affiliates, respectively.\nBy 1987, 24.3 percent and 56.9 percent of the rural and urban banks were MBHC affiliates, respectively, Thus, it is important to study the impact this move toward MBHC organization has on agricultural lending. Although the data used in this study are unique to Texas, inferences drawn can be extended to commercial banks in the U.S,"}, {"section_title": "Model Development", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tobil Procedure", "text": "As noted above, several banks have eliminated agricultural loans from their portfolios, Therefore, an econometric analysis of an uncensured sample of banks with agricultural loans as the dependent variable would have several zero values. In other words, the dependent variable is part qualitative (to lend or not to lend) and part quantitative (the amount lent). The analysis of such a limited dependent variable is called tobit analysis. This technique is designed to study models with a dependent variable having the property that many observations take on a single value (as in zero dollars lent for agriculture), with the remaining observations following the usual characteristic of a continuous variable (dollars lent to agriculture), It has received wide application to such problems as the study of automobile purchases, models of labor supply, and household purchase of fresh vegetables. 1\nIn his pioneering work, Tobin analyzed household expenditure on durable goods as a fimction of income and other variables.\nHe noted the distortion in the data resulting from the fact that many households did not purchase a durable good during the year of survey, with the possible explanation that because expenditures on durable goods are not continuous, purchases are not made until the \"desire\" to buy the good exceeds a certain level. However, desires cannot be observed, only expenditures, and those will be nonzero only if the good is purchased.\n\"Negative\" expenditures, corresponding to various levels of desire below the threshold level, cannot be observed, and all households with no purchases are recorded as showing zero expenditure, with no distinction made between households who were close to buying the good and those who had very little desire to do so.= The same is true with commercial banks. There is a certain threshold beIow which a bank would not effect an agricultural loan transaction (or any loan transaction for that matter), although there would be variations between different borrowers and lenders reflecting transaction costs, risks, etc. Lending is not done until the \"desire\" to lend exceeds a certain level. Desires, however, cannot be observed.\n\"Negative loans,\" corresponding to various levels of desire below this threshold level are recorded as zero agricultural loans, with no distinction made between commercial banks that are close to lending to agriculture and those that have very little desire to do so. Previous research has circumvented the problem of limited dependent variables by excluding banks with zero agricultural loans when investigating factors affecting agricultural lending.\nData samples have been limited to agricultural banks with existing agricultural loan portfolios (e.g., Barry and Pepper) . This omission, however, creates sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979) . Rather than delete banks with zero agricultural loans outstanding from the sampie, tobit analysis is used to account for this information and to adequately portray the full range of commercial bank behavior (Tobin) .\nTo understand this behavior, it is important to note that the changes in commercial bank lending BetubIzu and Lea(ham Factotx Af/ec(tng Cotnmerc/al Bank Lending to Agriculture to the agricultural sector involve two types of adjustments: a) changes in the number of banks lending to the agricultural sector, and b) changes in the number and size of agricultural loans made by commercial banks already lending to agriculture. The time-series observations on the changes in total agricultural lending reflect both types of adjustment. However, it is impossible to estimate the separate types of adjustment from aggregate time-series data based on average bank lending to the agricultural sector (Thraen, et al.) . Cross-sectional data, on the other hand, include observations on individual banks -. some of which are agricultural Iendcrs, and others are not. One could estimate the quantity adjustment coefficients by exclusion of those banks that were not lenders to agriculture at the time of the survey. However, it is also possible to estimate both the lending volume adjustments of commercial banks already lending to agriculture, and the lending volume adjustments due to the entry or exit of banks by using the tobit estimation procedure."}, {"section_title": "The Theoretical Model", "text": "Let Y'xp+E (1) be a regression equation for which all basic assumptions are satisfied.\nFor commercial banks that made agricultural loans, Y is equal to the actual agricultural loans made. For those banks that did not, Y represents an index of the \"desire\" to make agricultural loans. The X matrix is a set of factors thought to affect Y. The~is a conformably defined parameter vector, and E represents the stochastic disturbance term of the regression.\nThe value of Y cannot be observed when loans are not made. Thus, instead of using Y,~is used and is defined as\nThe new equation is y<i = 'yp +~a\nwhere~is truncated at zero and & is truncated at -X~, This further implies that the lower tail of the distribution of Y' (and thus of E\") is cut off and the probabilities are piled up at the cut-off point. Consequently, the mean of Y\"is different from that of Y, and the mean of EC' is different from that ofe which is zero. This is true whether the points for which Y' equal zero arc included or not included in the sample. Therefore, limiting the range of the values of the dependent variable leads to a nonzero mean of the disturbance and the biasness and inconsistency of the least squares estimators. Equation (3) will be estimated using the tobit procedure. The (3 parameters will be estimated using the maximum likelihood method (assuming normality of the disturbance term). This procedure assures the large-sample properties of consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated coefficients so that conventional tests of significance are applicable.\nFollowing McDonald and Moffit, different elasticities, evaluated at the means, can be computed as follows: It can be shown that the sum of equations (5) and (6) is equal to equation (4) (McDonald and Moffit) . In other words, the unconditional elasticity of making agricultural loans can be broken down into its component parts: a) the elasticity of making agricultural loans, for current lenders to agriculture, and b) the elasticity of the probability of making agricultural loans. By looking at the two components, one can find out which component reacts most to changes in the explanatory variables. Thus, besides the usual parameter estimates, the tobit procedure provides these elasticities that serve as a measure of the impact of changes in an independent variable on agricultural lending, not just for current agricultural lenders, but for those that would quit or enter agricultural lending as well."}, {"section_title": "Variable Description", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Regressand", "text": "The model regressand, Y', was defined as the ratio of outstanding nonreal estate agricultural loans to total bank assets for each commercial bank. Banks have different investment options, including agricultural lending. Using total assets as the denominator shows the relative importance of agricultural loans in the bank's investment program by recognizing the nonloan investment options available to a bank (e.g., government securities) that compete with agricultural loans for investable funds. This ratio increases/decreases 'as more funds are moved in/out of agriculture relative to other investment opportunities.\nFarm real estate loans were excluded from the study because commercial banks, historically, have not offered significant amounts of this category of loans."}, {"section_title": "The Regressors", "text": "Thirteen model regressors (table 1) were chosen to reflect the supply and demand factors affecting Y', These regressors included five bank variables, six agricultural variables and two general variables. The five bank variables included in the model, designed to capture factors affecting a bank's allocation of investable funds among competing investment opportunities, are: the bank's deposit composition, the level of competition faced by the bank, its organizational structure (specifically its association with a multi-bank holding company), location, and equity base.\nThe six agricultural variables included in the model are: farm profitability, farm risk, value of farmland and buildings, size of farming community, ownership of farmland, and the level of farm mechanization. These variables affect the degree to which agriculture attracts investable funds from commercial banks. The variables population and oil production were also included in the study because they are expected to affect the demand and availability of commercial banks' investable finds. Each variable is discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Deposit M-ucture", "text": "A ratio of a bank's time and savings deposits to total deposits (DEPOSIT) was used to represent the proportion of total deposits that are sensitive to interest rate changes. It can be argued that there is a positive relationship between DEPOSIT and loans in general because time and savings deposits enhance the stability of Ioanable funds.\nTherefore, banks need less liquidity and can invest more money in loans.\nh can also be argued that there is a negative relationship. Deposits are more interest rate sensitive and banks may choose to increase investments in interest rate sensitive assets and to decrease investments in loans,\nBanks may choose to invest in more investment securities like U.S. treasury securities because their interest rate movement more closely matches the interest rate movements on deposits, thus, reducing interest rate risk. This may especially be true in the post-deregulation era that is characterized by volatile interest rates. Banks could use adjustable interest rates on loans to make them more sensitive to interest rate movements. However, repricing a loan can result in additional transaction costs to the bank and transferring risk to a borrower may increase the likelihood of a loan default. It is not clear which effect overshadows the other. Thus, the sign on the estimated coefficient is indeterminate a priori."}, {"section_title": "Competition", "text": "The competition faced by an individual bank in a certain community or sector (e.g., agriculture) should affect its investment decisions. This is particularly true if there are specialized lenders. The major competitor of commercial banks Be!ubiza and Leatham: Factors Affecting Commercial Bank Lending in the nonreal estate farm loan market is Production Credit Associations (PCAS). A commercial bank is likely to allocate less money to agriculture relative to its total assets in areas where PCAS and other competing commercial banks are very active. The number of alternative credit sources in the community has previously been used as a proxy for competition (Barkley et al,) , However, this does not consider the size of the competitors.\nIn this study, the proxy for bank competition was based on the volume of assets of its competitors in its market. A bank's market area was delineated by county boundaries, Although this might not be true in all cases, it has been found a reasonable assumption under conditions where the study does not focus on local market characteristics and the flow of funds (Barry and Pepper; Gilbert) . A competition index was computed that consisted of PCA assets and total assets of the commercial banks operating in the same county, The proxy for competition faced by a bank was computed as compe~ition indexi = 1 -bank assets , (7) total assets where the competition index (COMPETITION) is a measure of the amount of competition faced by the jth bank in its market area, with O denoting laok of competition and I denoting maximum competition; bank assets refer to the total assets of the jth bank; and total assets refer to all the combined assets of PCAS and commercial banks operating in the county.

Moreover, rural banks are more likely to lend more money to agriculture relative to their assets than urban banks because rural banks are more dependent on the agricultural economy.\nThus, a negative estimated coefficient would be expected for urban banks.\nItwas estimated that a rural bank with $100 million dollars in assets was lending an average of $2.3 million more to agriculture than a similar urban bank (table 5). A comparison of the estimated coefficients for MBHC affiliation and location reveals that location plays a bigger role than MBHC affiliation in determining the level of the agricultural loan portfolio."}, {"section_title": "Farm Profitability", "text": "A firm that is achieving a high rate of return on its assets can increase the return to equity by increasing its leverage, as long as the rate of return on assets exceeds the rate of interest paid on farm debt (Collins). Thus, farmers in a county with profitable farming operations would demand more agricultural loans.\nSimilarly, banks in such a county would be willing to commit a higher proportion of their asset portfolio to agricultural loans because of the reduced likelihood of loan defaults by the farm borrowers.\nThis variable, which was defined as the ratio of net cash income from farm sales to total farm assets in each county (PROFIT), is expected to have a positive coefficient."}, {"section_title": "Farm Risk", "text": "The ratio of the coefficient of variation of farm income to the coefficient of variation of total income in each county (RISK) was used as a measure of farm risk. It is expected that counties with higher farm risk would attract less agricultural lending from commercial banks.\nThus, the estimated coefficient should be negative."}, {"section_title": "Equity", "text": "Value of Farmland and Buildings An important function of bank capital is to reduce risk, Koch discusses three ways in which this is achieved.\nFirst, it provides a cushion for firms to absorb losses and remain solvent. Second, it provides ready access to financial markets and thus guards against liquidity problems caused by deposit outflows.\nThird, it constrains growth and limits risk taking. A well-capitalized institution is in a better position to take on risk by investing more in loans and less in safe assets like government securities. Its large equity base would cushion the institution against large loan losses. However, the decision makers of less capitalized institutions may choose a similar investment strategy to increase expected profits, although at a greater risk. It is consistent with this risk/return preference for them to invest in more risky assets such as loans because of their higher expected returns. Thus, the estimated coefficient of the equity variable, which was defined as the ratio of the bank's total equity to its total assets (EQUITY), is indeterminate.\nA lender can reduce the likelihood of loan losses by requiring that land be used as collateral on nonreal estate loans. A farm located in an area with high farmland and property values will likely have a higher collateral value. Higher collateral values support higher levels of debt. The property value was standardized across communities by dividing the total value of farmland and farm buildings in a county by the total acres of farmland (LAND).\nAn area with high farm property values, however, may also be in an area that offers greater nonagricultural business opportunities.\nIn fact, such areas will likely be located near commercial and industrial centers.\nThese commercial and industrial businesses (and consumers in the communities) will compete for bank loans. Thus, agricultural loan portfolios of commercial banks in these areas may be smaller. Therefore, the sign of the estimated coefficient is indeterminate, a priori.\nThe negative equity coefficient suggests that less capitalized banks had more agricultural loans relative to their assets than more capitalized banks ( "}, {"section_title": "Be/ul)/za and Lea[ham Factors A//iec//ng Commercial B&k Lending 10 Agrudture", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Size qf Farming Community", "text": "Banks located in predominantly agricultural communities will likely obtain a large percentage of their deposits from farm firms.\nTo cultivate a strong bank-borrower relationship, these banks are likely to lend a greater proportion of their investable funds to the local farming community.\nMoreover, there is a feedback effect, by which a thriving local community will increase the deposits, providing more Ioanable funds for the bank.\nHowever, specializing in agriculture can lead to financial difficulties for the bank in case of an economic downturn in the local economy.

In fact, several credit scoring studies have found land ownership to be an important factor in discriminating between potentially good agricultural loans and bad loans (Dunn and Frey; Luiburrow, Barry and Dixon; Reinsel).\nHowever, there are other important credit factors such as management ability, repayment ability, and borrower integrity, factors that are not unique to owner operators. Moreover, tenant farmers may not have as much equity capital as owner-operators and may require more nonreal estate financing.\nThe ownership of farmland variable, defined as the ratio of the number of farmers operating their own land to the total number of farmers in each county (OWNER), is expected to have a positive estimated coefficient."}, {"section_title": "Level of Farm Mechanization", "text": "Counties with more mechanized operations are assumed to require more debt capital to finance equipment and operating expenses.\nThus, this variable, defined as the estimated market value of all machinery and equipment in the county (MACHINE), is expected to have a positive estimated coefficient.\nThe estimated coefficient of farm machinery was not statistically significant, although it had the expected positive sign (table 5) , suggesting little correlation between the level of agricultural loan portfolios at commercial banks, and the value of farm machinery in the respective communities."}, {"section_title": "Population", "text": "Population was used as a proxy for consumer loan demand in each county.

Oil production will stimulate the local economy directly from employment and oil producing business activities, and indirectly from oil profits retained in the community.\nThe increase in economic activity may lead to an increase in local deposits, thus increasing banks' loanable funds. However, the increase in economic activity will Iikcly increase loan demand for working capital, expansion of nonagricultural businesses, and consumer loans that compete with agricultural loans.
