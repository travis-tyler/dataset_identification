[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The ocean's heat capacity is about 1000 times larger than that of the atmosphere, with a net heat uptake about 20 times greater than the atmosphere (Levitus et al., 2005). This large amount of heat is mainly stored in the upper ocean layers and plays a crucial role in global climate change (Levitus et al., 2005;IPCC, 2007). Previous studies have suggested that strong warming trends are found in the upper ocean at three ocean basin latitudes but that cooling regions are found primarily in shallow equatorial areas and some high-latitude sections. For instance, cooling occurs at 150 m subsurface depths of the Pacific centered on the equator and also occurs in the 32\u00b0N to 48\u00b0N region (Levitus et al., 2005;Ishii et al., 2006;IPCC, 2007). The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) of sea surface temperature (SST) has been the focus of many past studies (Mantua et al., 1997;Zhang et al., 1997; Corresponding author: ZHU Cong-Wen, tomzhu@cams.cma.gov.cn 1999a, b; Yang et al., 2004). These studies have suggested that a PDO event can last 20\u221230 years and that SST anomalies are most visible in the North Pacific/North American regions. Previous studies have focused primarily on the North Pacific, and less attention has been paid to the tropical Pacific (Zhou et al., 2002). Recent studies have suggested that sea temperatures at the subsurface layer also exhibit decadal variation and that sea temperature variability occurs primarily in the tropical Pacific ocean subsurface (Zhang et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2008Su et al., 2009). A modeling study suggested that recent warming over tropical oceans, especially warming associated with tropical interdecadal variability and centered over the central and eastern Pacific, has played a major role in the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) (Li et al., 2010). The present study explores the following two questions: is there a PDO-like pattern in the subsurface ocean temperature; and is it linked to the PDO event and the weakening of EASM? The main dataset used in this study is a new monthly-assimilated subsurface temperature (version 6.7) for the period 1945\u22122005 (Ishii et al., 2003(Ishii et al., , 2006. These data cover the global oceans, contain uniformly girded fields at a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0, and are available at 16 levels at an upper 700 m depth. The Ishii dataset is based on the World Ocean Database 2005 (WOD05; Boyer et al., 2006) and the Centennial in situ Observation Based Estimates (COBE) of sea surface temperatures (Ishii et al., 2005). Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography (ARGO) profiling buoy data has been used in the recent years, and the expendable Bathythermograph (XBT) depth bias correction (Hanawa et al., 1995) is also applied in the current version. The Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 1.4.2 (SODA1.4.2) during 1958\u22122001 is utilized to make comparisons with the Ishii dataset. This dataset covers global oceans with horizontal resolution of 0.5\u00b0\u00d70.5\u00b0 at 40 standard depth levels up to 5374 m (Carton et al., 2005). rates in the eastern Pacific. In contrast, sea temperature appears to decrease between 100 and 300 m depth, especially between 100 and 200 m in the western Pacific, where the cooling rate of sea temperature is about \u22120.25\u00b0C/decade. In accordance with prior studies, the present study defines 100\u2212200 m depth as the subsurface layer (Li and Mu, 1999;Chen et al., 2002). Thus, cooling at the subsurface layer in the tropical western Pacific is obvious and exhibits a sharp contrast to the surface warming in the equatorial Pacific. The depth of the 20\u00b0C isotherm is generally considered to be the depth of the tropical thermocline, which is shallow in the eastern Pacific (50 m) and deep in the western region (160\u2212200 m). The center of cooling at the subsurface layer is found along the equatorial Pacific thermocline (Fig. 1). The temperature trends based on the Ishii and SODA datasets are similar, but the strongest decreasing trends from the SODA dataset are located in the equatorial central Pacific ocean, which has a relatively larger decrease rate."}, {"section_title": "Trends of sea temperature in tropical Pacific ocean", "text": "Harmonic analysis was used to identify the separate components of decadal and interannual sea temperature variations. To quantify these two parts, we partition mean annual sea temperature [ ( ), 1,44 Y i i = ] into three components (Wang and Xu, 1997) where Y d denotes the sum of the first six Fourier harmonics (period longer than 7 years), Y a represents the sum of the 7th to 22nd harmonics (period ranging from 2 to 7 years), and R is the residual. Hereafter, we refer to the Y d as interdecadal variability and Y a as interannual oscillation. Thus, any ENSO signal that represents less than 7 years of oscillations in the interdecadal variability of sea temperature is filtered. ily in the equatorial eastern Pacific (10\u00b0S\u221210\u00b0N, 150\u2212 80\u00b0W) and the northwestern Pacific (30\u221250\u00b0N, 150\u00b0E\u2212 180\u00b0\u2212150\u00b0W). In contrast, variations in the subsurface layer cover a large region, from 15\u00b0S and 15\u00b0N between 120\u00b0E to 160\u00b0W (Figs. 2c and 2d). This region is located in the tropical western Pacific warm pool (WPWP). The two datasets suggest the same pattern on a decadal time scale."}, {"section_title": "Tropical Pacific decadal oscillation (TPDO)", "text": "We applied the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) to the monthly SST and subsurface ocean temperature (SOT) anomalies to identify their decadal modes. Figure 3 shows the first EOF and the corresponding principal components (PCs) for SST and SOT anomalies. The first EOF accounts for 23.8% and 18.0% of the total variance, respectively. The first EOF for SST anomalies (SSTA) displays a PDO pattern (Fig. 3a), where a dipole of SSTA appears in the western and central North Pacific ocean and the tropical eastern Pacific. The spatial mode in the first EOF of SOT anomalies (Fig. 3b) is very similar to that of ENSO. A zonal dipole of SOT anomalies appears in the subsurface layer in Pacific ocean, where the western and central tropical Pacific has negative values and the eastern Pacific has positive values. In the present study, this mode in SOT is referred to as the tropical Pacific decadal oscillation (TPDO). A nonparametric statistical test, Mann-Kendall (MK), is used to examine the significant trends in PCs. The MK test does not need to hypothesize the statistical distribution of data samples in advance (Wei, 1999). The first PCs of SST and SOT anomalies contain an abrupt shift between cool and warm states in the late 1970s by using the MK test (Figure is not shown), which is consistent with previous studies (Nitta and Yamada, 1989;Huang et al., 2003;Xiao and Li, 2007). The two PCs show remarkable upward trends and are well correlated with each other (Fig. 3). The positive correlation coefficients with and without the trends are +0.81 and +0.79, respectively. To identify the linkage between TPDO and PDO, we defined the PC of SOT as the TPDO index in the present study. Past studies show that large-scale atmospheric circulation exhibited a decadal shift in the late 1970s in the Northern Hemisphere (Trenberth and Hurrell, 1994). For instance, the EASM has weakened since the late 1970s (Wang, 2001), and tropical eastern Pacific SST warming has played a major role in EASM weakening during recent decades (Li et al., 2010). Therefore, TPDO can be potentially useful to decadal research of EASM. We regress the SST onto TPDO index and find that the regressed SSTA is similar to the PDO in structure and magnitude, with the warm SSTA in the eastern equatorial Pacific and coastal western North America and the cool SSTA in the North Pacific region (Figure is not shown). The spatial pattern is analogous to the ENSO mode when we regress the subsurface ocean temperature on TPDO index and the warm SOT anomalies in eastern equatorial Pacific, with the cool counterpart in the western Pacific. The correlation coefficient reaches a maximum of +0.84  when TPDO index is lagged by the PDO index by 2 months (Fig. 4). Therefore, a change of TPDO is likely related to PDO variation."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The trends and decadal oscillations in the surface sea temperature and the 100\u2212200 m subsurface ocean temperature during 1945\u22122005 are analyzed on the basis of harmonic and EOF methods. Significant cooling trends in the SOT are found in the tropical western Pacific over the past 60 years. The EOF analysis suggests that the tropical Pacific decadal oscillation of SOT displays an ENSO-like zonal dipole pattern, and it is closely correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation in the SST anomalies. The correlation coefficient between the TPDO and PDO is +0.81 and reaches a maximum of +0.84 when TPDO lags PDO by 2 months. Therefore, a change in TPDO is likely related to the change of PDO. The long-term change of TPDO best explains decadal warming in the tropical eastern Pacific SST and has a potential impact on the weakening of East Asian summer monsoons after the late 1970s. The present study only discussed the statistical links between PDO and the TPDO, and the mechanism maintaining the TPDO and the feedback of TPDO on PDO are not clearly stated. These issues are worthy of exploration in a future study."}]
