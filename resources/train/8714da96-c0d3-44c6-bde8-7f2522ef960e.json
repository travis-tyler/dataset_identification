The concepts developed to explain these mysterious apparitions have a long and intriguing history. During medieval times, comets were considered as atmospheric phenomena, or signs, sent by an angry God to warn the sinful people of Earth to repent. In other words, it was considered as a bad omen. As a matter of fact, most comet appearances in the past were linked to many historical tragedies, such as King Harold's death in the battle of Hasting shortly after comet Halley's appearance. It wasn't until the early nineteenth century that specific tools became available to define the physical nature of comets.\nThe purpose of this research was to investigate the unsteady motion of small rigid particles in unsteady creeping flows, especially in the context of crystal growth application in microgravity. The unsteady motion of small particles in a viscous suspension is found in a number of technical and scientific applications, including colloidal suspensions, bubbly flows in liquid reservoirs, fluid markers for particle image velocimetry, and in several other flows of engineering and scientific interest. The governing equations that describe the motion of rigid particles under these conditions were studied and solved analytically in the present work in order to clarify some specific aspects of g-jitter effects on fluid markers (small, spheroidal particles). The particle equation of motion in unsteady Stokes flow is a classical equation in theoretical fluid mechanics (Maxey and Riley, 1983), and is useful as a limiting case for problems lying outside of the realm of linear flows. The renewed interest on the properties of these linear integro-differential equations reflects the demand that novel technologies place on the understanding of the related unsteady diffusion phenomena. Crystal growth processes provide some of the most interesting industrial applications that involve the motion of small particles in creeping flows. Crystals are grown slowly in a matrix fluid for a variety of applications in the semiconductor and other industries. The possibility of growing near-perfect crystals under micro-gravity conditions raised the interest of these industries in creating space-based factories, and may well be one of the most promising applications of space technology in the near future. In fact, the most compelling reason to justify orbital flights and the construction of a Space Station is that some manufacturing technologies would benefit from low-gravity environments. In order to be economically viable, the products of such manufacturing industries should concentrate high economic value per mass and per volume. Such conditions are met, for example, by the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries. The idea is that, in a micro-gravity environment, the growth of crystals approaches isotropic behavior in the macro-scale, provided that the matrix fluid is kept unperturbed. In theory, larger crystals could be eventually grown in a micro-gravity environment. The challenge in this case is to seek the most stable conditions for the matrix fluid, and to compensate for the inherent corrective motions of a space unit. In order to meet these challenges it is necessary to understand the intricate relationship between the matrix fluid and the particles in suspension. Both the growth of the crystallizing front and the motion of small, detached structures in the matrix fluid are approximately described by the unsteady diffusion equation in semi-infinite media. In particular, one may retrieve information on slow-motion currents of the matrix fluid through study of the behavior of small marker particles suspended in the matrix. These slow currents caused by the motion of the crystallizing front and by thermal gradients affect the homogeneity of the resulting crystals. In order to improve the quality of crystals manufactured under micro-gravity conditions, and to assess the role of low-amplitude disturbances in orbital units, understanding of the unsteady diffusion phenomena involved becomes imperative. Recent experimental evidence suggests a much higher occurrence of low-amplitude, high frequency disturbances (g-jitter) in the Space Shuttle environment than previously expected (see Trolinger et al., 1997). These disturbances are inherently unsteady, and are likely to be a characteristic of any space unit. The unsteady effects of these vibrations on the motion of small particles in the matrix fluid can only be assessed if the equations that describe the creeping flow motion of these particles are understood in detail. The study of these equations thus becomes an important step to develop improved crystal-growth technology, and may prove to be useful to develop corrective adjustments to reduce the effect of vibrations. Relevant physical properties for this analysis include: the fluid to particle density ratio, alpha (\u03b1), the particle radius (a), the frequency of oscillation or main mode of g-jitter (\u2126), the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (\u03bd), the dimensionless local acceleration given by the Strouhal-Reynolds product (Sl Re p ), and the dimensionless convective term represented by the particle Reynolds number (Re p ).\nInvasion of natural communities by nonnative species constitutes a major threat to biodiversity globally (Lodge 1993). Invasive alien species not only compete with natives on a species scale, but some alter the way an ecosystem functions, e.g., primary productivity, decomposition, hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and natural disturbance regimes (Vitousek andWalker 1989, Mack et al. 2000). One of the earliest examples of ecosystem-level change caused by alien plant invasion in Hawai'i showed that the grass Andropogon virginicus alters rain forest hydrology by preventing normal soil evaporation as well as effective transpiration (Mueller-Dombois 1973). In other research, invasive plants have been known to increase transpiration and evaporation of intercepted rainfall (Versfield andvan Wilgen 1986, Gordon 1998). Of particular concern in Hawai'i are the studies of a common invasive tree, Schinus terebinthifolius. On Lana'i, Stratton et al. (2000) and Stratton and Goldstein (2001) concluded that, relative to native Hawaiian plants, S. terebinthifolius exhibits high rates of water uptake during the wet season and higher water use efficiency during the dry season. Mohala i ka Wai, a community group on the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i, and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply (HBWS) have a strong interest to determine the impact of S. terebinthifolius and other alien species on the hydrological cycle in M\u0101kaha Valley. Located on the dry leeward coast of O'ahu, more than 60% of M\u0101kaha Valley experiences arid to semi-arid climate with a mean annual rainfall of less than 1800 mm (NCDC 2004). Despite the fact that stream flow rates have declined since the 1960s, the HBWS has pumped water out of M\u0101kaha Valley since 1989. Mohala i ka Wai and the HBWS formed a partnership in September 2000 in order to address community concerns about access to water resources and the preservation of the M\u0101kaha watershed. Remote sensing has been recognized as a valuable and effective technology with which to detect, monitor, and manage invasive species (Beyers et al. 2002, Joshi et al. 2004. Although other land use/land cover maps exist for M\u0101kaha Valley, they consist of a limited number of vegetation classes and do not portray fine spatial detail for these classes. This is due in part to the fact that analysis was constrained by remotely sensed data of coarse spatial resolutions (30 -80m). In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of fine-resolution (2.5 -4m) satellite data in delineating native and invasive species communities with the goal of producing a detailed vegetation map over M\u0101kaha Valley.\nContinuous fiber ceramic composites (CFCC) are novel, advanced class of materials in which there is an increased interest in their elevated-temperature applications such as aerospace and automotive structural members, hot gas nozzles, and jet engine components. CFCCs are able to withstand very high temperatures, (>1200 o C) with the capability to preserve high strength and modulus properties [1][2][3]. Ceramic materials however, possess many unsolved problems such as low fracture toughness and strength, and poor resistance to creep and fatigue [4,5]. In this work, an attempt has been made to solve these problems by incorporating Yttrium Oxide Nanoparticles in CFCC.\nThe main mission of MIMIC is to take magnetic readings of Mars, in order to get a more complete understanding of the history of the planet, and what it is today. In order to do so, we will have to use magnetometers which bring in about 7Mb/day of data. From the satellite as a whole, we will be taking in a total of 19.62 Mb/day. Using a relay satellite to get our data down to ground control, we will have a downlink rate of 8kb/s giving us a downlink volume of 22Mb/day. Due to the fact that both the total data and the downlink volume are of about equal size, raises a concern. In the event of disruption in communication, where our downlink is downsized, we will not be able to send out all of our data during our given communication window. If for some reason we don't have a communication window, we will be unable to take in anymore data. As a solution, we will use compression algorithms to give us a data margin that will shorten the time needed to send down data, as well as making it possible to store a few days worth of data. \nThis is the era of satellites. Voyager 1 probably reached the termination shock (furthest edge of the solar system) last year. Satellites are ubiquitous. In hard-to-reach areas they allow communication via satellite phone. They have created a revolution in archeology, geology and other disciplines involving field work, through the use of the Global Positioning System. We have become more aware of the world surrounding us, including the solar system and beyond, because of the use of satellites. Naturally, we would like to find ways of operating satellites more efficiently, in order to minimize costs. The goal of this project is to provide analytical insight on finding efficient ways of transferring satellites to different orbits. When launching a satellite into space, one of the common problems that scientists have to deal with is perturbation. Due to the air drag of the farther reaches of the earth's atmosphere, a satellite's orbit diminishes. In order to keep it in space, we periodically have to increase the satellite's horizontal speed and transfer it to a higher orbit. Transferring satellites or shuttles to different orbits is also required for \"rendezvous\"when two shuttles, or a shuttle and satellite, have to meet. Satellites have traditionally used chemical propulsion for orbit transfer. Since about 1990, longer lasting electro-ionic propulsion systems have been considered. But these systems provide lower thrust, resulting in longer transfer times, sometimes lasting for several months. This particular project is dedicated to exploring methods of finding periodic trajectories that potentially minimize the transfer time."}, {"section_title": "What are comets?", "text": "A comet is a small body composed mainly of ice and dust in an elliptical orbit around the sun. They originated from the cold outer reaches of the solar system. In the comet's pristine state, its surface consists of amorphous ice, dust and other volatiles. Comets have many different parts, as illustrated in Figure 1. Most comets are composed of the nucleus, coma, tail and a hydrogen envelope. The nucleus, typically about 10 kilometers across, is composed mostly of dust and ices of carbon dioxide, water, ammonia and methane. The coma is a dense cloud of gas and dust particles around the nucleus. This can extend to 35,000 miles and it is formed as the comet gets close to the sun. There are two kinds of cometary tails. The ion tail of the comet is formed when the gas in the coma is ionized by sunlight. The dust tail is formed by tiny dust particles blown by the solar wind. The hydrogen envelope is a clear area that surrounds the coma and grows as it gets closer to the sun. Comets have been valuable in space exploration because they help us understand the evolution of our solar system as well as the origin of life. They represent relics of early solar system processes, and can give us clues to the chemistry and physical conditions when the solar system was forming. There are two types of comets: periodic and nonperiodic comets. Periodic comets have a period that is less than 200 years. That means that it takes less than 200 years for it to go around the sun. These comets originated from the kuiper belt and orbits around the sun in a regular schedule. Their names usually start with a P, or a number followed by a P. Non-periodic comets on the other hand, have a period greater than 200 years. They originated from the oort cloud and takes thousands of years to orbit around the sun. Their names usually start with a C, followed by a year."}, {"section_title": "The Aging Process", "text": "Although most comets have been stored in the cold outer reaches of the solar system since their formation 4.5 billion years ago, there are many processes, which have affected them since that time. Aging of the cometary nuclei refers to the effects since the time of its formation that have chemically or physically altered the nucleus. While stored in the oort cloud, it undergoes many different chemical alterations, including a possible crystalline core. As the comet approaches the sun, the aging process accelerates. The solar energy becomes sufficient to sublimate the amorphous ice and releases the gas trapped inside. The released gas causes the dust grains to flow away from the nucleus and the low gravity drags it into a cloud to form the coma. This process starts near 5-6 AU, but doesn't drag much dust until 3 AU. When gases inside the nucleus expand under the heat of the sun, they often shoot out through holes or weak spots in the crust of the nucleus. The expanding dust and gas escape as jets, which has the same effect as thrusters in a spacecraft. Theoretically, we know that the aging process must occur, but we don't have abundant evidence of the details. In order to understand how representative these samples are of the earliest era of our history, we need to understand its process of aging. This project will look for evidence that comets do develop a thick dusty mantle on the surface. Doing this includes searching for  evidence of uneven sublimation in the form of jets in the dust comae of both periodic and nonperiodic comets. This will provide evidence on whether the development of a coma as comets age is correlated with the appearance of jets. Understanding where the most primordial material is can lead to a better understanding of life's origins."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The computer used to analyze the comet pictures is run by the Solaris system. Because of this, learning UNIX was essential to perform the necessary tasks of the project. An online program called Ephemerides was used to make the observing plans for the comet pictures needed. This program provides the exact coordinates of a comet at any given time from a specific location (website: ssd.jpl.nasa.gov). After obtaining the pictures, an image-processing program called IRAF was used to analyze the pictures and look for the presence of jets. Four different techniques were used to analyze the pictures: the shift, smooth, rotate, and unsharp masking techniques. In the shifting technique, the pictures were shifted a certain number of pixels and then subtracted from the original. In the smoothing and unsharp masking techniques, the pictures were smoothed and subtracted from the original. In the rotating technique, the pictures were rotated at their center and subtracted from the original.\nThe overall breadth of this subject matter spans an exceedingly large area from insects to astronomers. The description of Mauna Kea as a whole, something that can be easily digested by the general public, is in fact a description of the natural history of Mauna Kea. There are so many aspects and features of Mauna Kea this project was restricted to the summit areas alone. Within those areas, the research conducted was separated into their respective areas depending on their relations to Mauna Kea, usage or anthropogenic effects. The main areas of description are; The History of Astronomy on Mauna Kea, Culture, Geology, Flora, and Fauna. Over the course of this project, many people were interviewed, both formally and informally, to discuss what this project could achieve. Through interviews with rangers like Kimo Pihana and Pablo McLeod and interactions with the public on Mauna Kea, the project and what it should contain and look like materialized. Many trips to the summit were needed for interviews, research and photographs. Every observatory on Mauna Kea was contacted and informed of the type of outreach being conducted. Along with the observatories, several scientists who are experts in their respective fields of research associated with Mauna Kea were also contacted and involved in planning and research. In particular, Jack Lockwood PhD, a former USGS volcanologist, was an excellent source of information and field advisor. Part of the goal of this project is to include areas of current research on Mauna Kea aside from just astronomy. A major area of research being conducted now is the study of how anthropogenic factors are affecting the Wekui bug habitat and if they can be successfully relocated. This monitoring project is part of a larger project being conducted for an Environmental Impact Statement for the Keck Telescopes to add more \"outrigger\" telescopes to their facility. These are important current events that are shaping the future of Mauna Kea and that will be posted and updated on the website to further bring together information in an easy accessible source. Adobe software was purchased to aid in the design and construction of the brochure and companion website. Also used was Sony Cybershot digital camera purchased to take highresolution photographs that can easily be reproduced, blown up to poster size and diminish any possible conflicts involving using other people's photographs. With the adobe software, the website has taken shape. Only since beginning the site construction, the site can appreciate the full size and scope of this entire project. When the website is set to be published or \"go live\" it will consist of at least eighty individual pages that have already been established, formatted and organized. This number will vary over time with continual changes and development on Mauna Kea. The author will carry out the updating and maintenance until a suitable replacement can be found. Because of the size constraints of a brochure, only the most important information will be printed while encouraging interested people to explore the website.\nThere are many different ways to approach the problem of storing memory. One such way is to \"stock up\" on flash memory. However, space missions, such as MIMIC, are heavily based on mass and volume, in which you want to limit the amount of hardware. Therefore, this method is not practical for our situation. Individuals who use computers use different compression algorithms every day. One uses compression algorithms when sending emails, to zip and unzip files, etc\u2026 The basic job of compression algorithms is to take in data and assign short code-words to input blocks with high recurrence, and long code-words to those with low probabilities. So when a compressed file is sent, the contents are basically two things: the compressed codes, and a \"library\" (which is then used to uncompress the codes). There are two types of compressions. The first, lossy compression, is normally used for pictures and videos. Lossy gives much better compression ratios than with lossless compression. One reason for this is the recurrence of certain colors within a given picture. For example, in a picture where one area is completely black, (which happens often) instead of saying black for every single pixel in that area, you can simply say something like \"the next 10000 pixels are black.\" This will compress the file considerably. Another advantage to lossy compression is the ability to change or adjust the original image to force more frequencies, which in turn will give you a better compression. An unfavorable aspect of lossy compression is its tendency to slightly alter the decompressed version of the image. The new image might be off by a few pixels from the original, but this effect is not perceptible to the unaided eye. The difference between the two is almost impossible to notice. The second type of compression is lossless, which is used for text documents. For lossless compression, the decompressed file must arrive exactly as it was sent, identical to the original. Lossless still allows for rather respectable compression ratios, which average about 3:1. Text files require lossless compression. It would be unacceptable to change an 'a' to a 'z' or an 'e' to a 'k'. A small change such as this could dramatically alter the document as a whole. Obviously in our case, we needed to use lossless compression because every single piece of data is very important. Once this choice of compression was made, it was then necessary to research different types of methods available. Under lossless compression, there are two most commonly used methods. The first is called Huffman Compression, and the second is called Lempel Ziv Compression (LZW)."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "About 14 non-periodic comets and 9 periodic comets were collected and analyzed, which yields a total of about 250 comet pictures. The four IRAF techniques described were used to search for the presence of jets in these pictures. Out of the 23 comets, only comet Hale-Bopp showed obvious features. Figure  3 illustrates the shifting technique used in a comet that did not have features. This comet is called 78P/Gehrels. The picture above is the original picture. After shifting and subtracting it from the original, the picture below is what it would look like. In this case, the picture was shifted vertically. No jets were present in this comet at the time the picture was taken.  Figure 4 illustrates the shifting technique used on comet Hale-Bopp, which showed obvious features. The picture above is the original picture of comet Hale-Bopp. After applying the shifting technique, the picture below is what it would look like. Any of the four techniques yields the same result. The lines that appear to be like water ripples are the features on the comet's surface. That means that this comet has a lot of active zones (jets) on its nucleus. The comet was about 1.4 AU from the sun when the picture was taken, which explains the presence of features. The comet has become very active due to the sublimation of amorphous ice and the abundant expansion of gases in the nucleus, which are released as jets as they shoot out from inside the nucleus."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The techniques used can be tricky as each comet requires a different number of pixels to be used for a certain technique to work. In other words, if one comet showed features by shifting it 5 pixels vertically, it might not work for the next comet. Therefore, there isn't a set procedure to use for each comet for analysis. Most of the time, trial and error and the process of elimination are applied to determine what works and what doesn't. Out of all the comets collected, only one had features in it. All of these comets are expected more or less to have features because all of them had a distance of 2 AU and below when the picture was taken. That distance should have been sufficient to heat up the comet and produce jets. However, certain factors can be considered to explain why no features were found. The jets could be on the other side of the comet that is not facing our direction. The picture taken could have been the side that is not active yet. In addition, it is possible that the comet produced jets maybe an hour, a day, or a week after the picture has been taken. In other words, just because the picture does not have jets does not imply that the comet does not have features at all. This is why it is very important to try to take pictures as often as possible. Some things make it difficult for pictures to be taken, one of them, being our dependence on weather. If the weather is bad (i.e. cloudy, rainy), we cannot take pictures. In addition, the use of the telescope is not available all the time. The telescope time has to be reserved in advance. So that makes it difficult, especially when the night reserved for a person turns out to be a cloudy or a rainy night. The person's technique could also be a factor on why there are no features present. If the technique is not executed correctly, especially with the big range of possible pixel combinations to choose from, the comet will not show features. But this error would have to be very big for it to be the main cause. To prove that, a pixel combination that is far from the one that works for"}, {"section_title": "Figure 4: Image of comet Hale Bopp showing features after the application of the IRAF techniques", "text": "Hale-Bopp was used and even then, some features are still present, or if not features, it certainly looks like a clue that something is there. Due to these factors, more pictures should be taken and analyzed."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Comet pictures were taken and analyzed using the IRAF program. Four different techniques were used to observe the pictures and search for the presence of features in the form of jets. Comet Hale-Bopp showed obvious features using any of the four techniques out of all the 23 different comets (about 250 comet pictures) taken. Future improvements for this project would be to take more pictures of the same comets, or even new ones to search for jets. Doing so will make it more possible for features to be found due to the dependency of the analysis/results to when the comet will produce active zones.\nWe developed a method to extract the order of derivative that best characterizes the history drag of a solitary spherical particle in an oscillating fluid cell. The problem is formulated in terms of dimensionless parameters, and we are particularly interested in regimes characterized by Strouhal (Sl) numbers >1 and particle Reynolds numbers < 0.5. These experiments were conducted in order to evaluate stationary history effects. The data refers to ground experiments that simulate microgravity response by determining the motion of spherical particles tethered to a fluid cell that oscillates sinusoidally. This research will allow for the correct characterization of g-jitter and micro-convection effects on the motion of suspended crystals in microgravity environments. Coimbra, C.F.M. L'Esperance, D., Lambert, R.A., Trolinger, J.D., and Rangel, R.H. (2004). \" \nIn this study, we assessed the utility of fine-resolution satellite imagery in discriminating invasive and native vegetation communities. It was strongly felt that fine resolution satellite imagery is very useful in mapping invasive and native species. Some invasive species were detectable at the species level, and others at the community level. The vegetation maps produced from this study should aid in understanding of the spatial extent of certain native alien and native species within M\u0101kaha Valley. Complications of remote sensing in a tropical environment include the effects of topography and high species diversity; however, much potential exists to increase the accuracy of current vegetation maps.\nThe slip condition that UAVs experience when flying at high altitudes does affect the aerodynamics of flight. Four major conclusions can be drawn from this research: 1. At higher altitudes, the slip condition plays a more prominent role in its effects on the aerodynamics of the UAV. 2. Higher altitudes result in the increased dominance of the shear contribution. 3. The slip condition increases the lift and moment coefficients for the UAV. 4. The slip condition decreases the drag coefficient of the UAV. Increasing the lift and decreasing the drag coefficient can be beneficial to the overall design and efficiency of the aircraft. A suggestion for a continuation of this project would be to generate the plots for C D , C L and C m as a function of the angle of attack. This seems to be specially needed for higher altitudes where cruising conditions at sea level are clearly inappropriate. Also it would provide information about the longitudinal static stability of the UAV through the pitch stiffness C m,\u03b1 . The results in the present work clearly show the need for an improved understanding of the effects of low Reynolds number flows on the aerodynamics of the UAV. Mauna Kea is one of the five volcanoes that make up the Island of Hawai'i. In Hawaiian, \"Mauna Kea\" means \"White-Mountain\", referring to the summit area that is often covered with snow during the winter months. Towering above the Pacific Ocean at 4,207 meters, Mauna Kea measures 10,023 meters from ocean floor to the summit cinder cone Pu'u Wekiu, making it the tallest mountain in the world. Combined with the active volcanism, the glaciations of Mauna Kea have left many unique geologic features. The isolation of Mauna Kea's summit and surrounding areas has allowed some species to develop special characteristics that help them take advantage of the extreme weather, abundance of sunlight, and lack of moisture. Some of the insect and plant species found on Mauna Kea are not found anywhere else in the world. Mauna Kea's prominent height above the surrounding ocean and remoteness has made it an important location for atmospheric and astronomical observatories. Since the construction of a crude road to the summit in the early 1960s, Mauna Kea has attracted vast numbers of tourists, scientists, hunters and outdoor enthusiasts alike. It was determined that few or no authors currently, or at that time, had focused solely on Mauna Kea's summit area for a discussion of Natural History. \nEvery astronomer in the world knows what the observatories on Mauna Kea have to offer in terms of research. However, many people who visit Hawaii on vacation or otherwise do not even know that it snows on the Big Island or glaciers during the last ice age made the adz rock that enabled the Hawaiians to flourish in such an isolated locale. This is why it is fundamentally important for this project to cover all of the different aspects of Mauna Kea. Its goal is not to simply further advertise the observatories on the summit areas, but to enlighten visitors to the sensitive nature of Mauna Kea, to tread lightly and understand there is more than dirt and rock, but unique and diverse tenacious species of plants and animals who have made a niche for themselves up there. The same can be said of the astronomers themselves. \nThree different types of continuous fiber ceramic composites with varying % of Yttrium oxide nanoparticles were manufactured following preceramic polymer pyrolysis route. Yttrium Oxide with an average particle size of 29 nm was used as the nanoparticle reinforcement. Woven ceramic fiber reinforcements (Nicalon\u2122) fabric was used here. Preceramic polymer (KiON CERASET\u00ae) was mixed with the nano size fillers in the presence of a surfactant agent, which gives a good dispersion of the particles during the process. A characterization analysis of the samples using scanning electron microscopy revealed excellent quality of the parts. All the samples tested fractured inside the uniformly stressed region of flexure specimen (i.e., between the upper loading points of the fixture). The test results indicated a +4.55% increase and a -7.56% decrease in flexural strength for the 5% and 10% composition test specimens, respectively, when compared with test specimens without nanoparticles. Nanoparticle inclusions had no effect on the manufacturing process. Future work improvements would be to devise a method to optimize the amount of nanoparticles to include into the specimens in order to achieve optimum mechanical properties of this novel class of advanced composite materials.\nThe general problem of optimizing the operation of a satellite is an important problem to NASA. Our project is meant to provide a useful insight on both theoretical and practical solutions to the specific problem of minimizing the time of transfer. Because the equations are so complicated, we use both the analytical techniques from the Differential geometry and the Numerical simulations to better understand how the system works. The analytical system that we derived and the graphic interface will be used in the data analysis by those, who conduct numerical simulations to study this program.

The fluid velocity U in equation 1is the fluid velocity at the current position of the particle.

We seek to determine the amplitude and phase ratio between the particle and the fluid velocities v and u for a harmonically driven flow field u = sin (\uf020 t). In order to do that, we apply fractional calculus techniques to a generalized particular solution of the form and we determine M and N by isolating kin terms.

The amplitude ratio \u03b7 is given by where We developed a procedure to determine the order of differentiation q for the term that governs history drag directly from the experimental data, and are characterizing such order of differentiation with very little uncertainty. Using the experimental data we solved for q. We recovered the optimum order of differentiation that best represents the history drag, q, from the experimental data obtained by Coimbra et al. (2004), confirms q is approximately \u00bd. We recovered the value of q analyzing the data points and applying equation 9. Our theoretical analysis was expanded to include viscous history effects. These effects have not been considered in previous studies of particle motion onboard of orbiting spacecraft, even though preliminary estimates indicate that as much as 60% of the forces depending on the relative velocity between the particle seeds and the fluid cell may result from the \"viscoelastic\" history component. The incorporation of these forces into the analysis consists of a major research accomplishment and will allow the correct characterization of g-jitter and micro-convection effects on the motion of suspended crystals in microgravity environments."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Figure 2 -The graph shows the recovered values of q for 28 trials of the experiment conducted by Coimbra et al.

Upon analyzing the data points obtained from the experiment conducted by Coimbra et al (2004) the optimum values recovered for q for four values of alpha as shown in Fig. 2. Most of these values lie within 0.5 -0.6. There were some data points that did not yield an optimum value and were therefore omitted from figure 2. These data points were characterized by lower Strouhal numbers than the other data points and require additional analysis because of an apparent systematic error of the shaker at lower frequencies.\nThe results of the research conducted have been a prodigious amount of material that has been sorted, fact checked and constructed into brochure and web suitable material.

The flexure strength for the 5% composition increased approximately by 4.55% compared to the 0% composition. However, the 10% composition decreased in flexure strength by approximately 7.56%. The explanation for this low strength for the 10% composition is believed to be due to the excessive amount of nanoparticles in which the formation of agglomerates was highly feasible. These agglomerates may have acted as inclusions or high stress concentration areas. However, a 5% incorporation of Yttrium nanoparticles produced positive results in which the flexural strength did indeed increase. Future study would possibly be to optimize the percentage of nanoparticles so as to achieve an optimum flexural strength. Nanoparticle inclusions had no effect on the manufacturing process. Characterization of the manufactured CFCC specimens was performed using a SEM, which revealed good part quality and proper consolidation of the final specimen as shown in Figure 5."}, {"section_title": "MAPPING INVASIVE SPECIES IN M\u0100KAHA VALLEY, O'AHU USING FINE RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY", "text": "Michele Harman Global Environmental Science University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa Honolulu, HI 96822"}, {"section_title": "ABSTRACT", "text": "The spread of alien plant species has long been recognized as one of the most significant environmental changes due to its ability to decrease biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes. In M\u0101kaha Valley, O'ahu, there is a need to evaluate the impact of alien species invasion on local hydrology for sustainable water resource management. A detailed vegetation map depicting the current spatial extent of invasive and native plant species is required. In this study, we assessed the utility of fine resolution satellite imagery in discriminating invasive from native vegetation communities. Two fine resolution images were acquired over M\u0101kaha: a QuickBird (2.4m multi-spectral resolution) and an IKONOS (4m multi-spectral resolution) image. These images were classified using unsupervised classification algorithms and compared with existing vegetation maps. These sensor images were classified into four to five discriminable native-and invasive-dominated vegetation classes whereas most of these classes were labeled as a single \"forest\" class in the existing vegetation maps. Likewise, spatial distributions of these classes were depicted in much more detail in the image analysis results than in the existing vegetation maps. It was strongly felt that fine resolution imagery is very useful in mapping invasive and native species. Our efforts are continuing to field-identify the species compositions of image classes and to assess the accuracy of classification results.\nThe present research concerns the study of the effects of the slip condition associated with rarefied air on the aerodynamics of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) while flying at high altitudes. A Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code, STAR-CD \u00ae , was used to investigate the forces and moments that act on the UAV structure while in a rarefied air condition. Simulations were performed with atmospheric properties and flight conditions of UAVs operating at the current techological highest altitude as well as altitudes of future UAV exploration. The effects of the slip condition on the UAV aerodynamics at cruise condition were investigated for an Airbus type wing cross section. After running several simulations at different altitudes the major airfoil aerodynamic parameters, namely the drag (C D ), lift (C L ), and pitch moment (C M ) coefficients, were compared for the slip and no-slip case. It was found that the slip condition caused the lift coefficient to increase, the drag coefficient to decrease, and the moment coefficient to increase. Furthermore, our findings show that the rarefied air significantly affects the aerodynamic of the UAV, and that the slip condition should be considered in future design of UAVs flying at very high altitudes."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Materials and study sites", "text": "Accurate detection or discrimination of invasive species often requires high resolution imagery to spatially resolve small patches of invasive species stands or populations and thus to capture their \"pure\" spectral signatures (Carson et al. 1995).

QuickBird's 2.44 m spatial resolution is the highest resolution commercially available. However, the QuickBird image had significant cloud cover and was acquired at a high solar zenith angle. Hence, it had a large amount of both topographic and cloud shadow.

We first concentrated on the back of M\u0101kaha Valley. This area is of great importance due to the large amount of diverse native communities found there which are rapidly being invaded by alien vegetation. However, the area is also challenging to analyze due to its rugged topography which seems to modify the vegetation's spectral signatures.

The classification results were visually evaluated and refined into the number of classes descriminable by the satellite. The Jeffries-Matusita distances were computed and used as a quantitative measure to support and evaluate the class lumping results (Richards and Jia 1999). Classes with an identifiable physical nature were assigned a class label. The same procedures used for the QuickBird classification were followed for IKONOS analysis.

Figure 2 shows the QuickBird classification of the back of M\u0101kaha Valley. Figure 3 shows the IKONOS classification of the subwatershed. Agreement between the two analyses is high. It should be noted that Clouds and Shadow are spectrally mixed with the Kukui and '\u014chi'a classes in Figure  2. In Figure 3, Clouds contain some spectral confusion with Kukui, '\u014chi'a, and Soil. Field work aided in the general determination of vegetation classes; however, complicated community structures and difficulties in site accessibility were revealed and are proving to be more challenging than initially anticipated. Image analysis indicated a moderate amount of overlap between classes. Part of this is due to shadow and clouds which complicated extraction of classes, especially in the QuickBird image. Solar zenith angle at the time of the image capture is an important factor in the analysis of the topographically rugged area.  \nThe system of differential equations using Pontyagin's Maximum Principle, that describes the orbit transfer, has been computed and implemented into the integrator DOPRI 5.

Preliminary field surveys indicated that the pink Unknown vegetation class is primarily alien-dominated vegetation. Although we continue to field-identify the species compositions of the descriminable classes, it is notable that their spatial representation is more detailed than in existing land use/land cover maps (Figure 4). The 1976 Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis (GIRAS) map depicts two vegetation classes as existing in the M\u0101kaha Valley subwatershed: Shrub and Brush Rangeland and Evergreen Forest Land. This map is based primarily on manual interpretation of aerial photography (EROS 2005). Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) land cover map was produced during 2000-2001 using Landsat ETM imagery (30 m spatial resolution). Four vegetation classes (Evergreen Forest, Grassland, Palustrine Forested Wetland, and Scrub/Shrub) in addition to a Bare Land class are delineated on the map. Although the accuracy assessment of this map was 94.9% with a kappa coefficient of agreement equal to 0.94 (NOAA Coastal Services Center 2001), maps based on the higher resolution images produce finer detail (reword). Although the current IKONOS-and QuickBird-based vegetation maps are useful, more work is desirable in order to refine classification. Initial results of the subwatershed classification indicate that continuing field and image analysis will produce further separation and identification of vegetation classes. Quantitative field work is especially necessary if the vegetation map is to be used to predict the effect of alien communities on M\u0101kaha Valley's hydrological cycle. Other classification methods of the multi-spectral data may increase the utility of the vegetation maps for this purpose. Alternatively, it may be that the available spectral bands are limiting the detailed discrimination of vegetation communities that is needed and hyper-spectral data would be more suitable for analysis. Other work includes the classification of Mt. Ka'ala (Palustrine Forested Wetland in the C-CAP map) which is obscured by clouds in our IKONOS image but not in the QuickBird image. Analysis of this area needs to be performed in order to fully depict vegetation communities in the selected subwatershed. Finally, an accuracy assessment of the final classification results will be determined by comparing image sites with field plots. An error matrix will be produced, from which both overall and class-averaged accuracies will be computed (Nishii and Tanaka 1999)."}, {"section_title": "EFFECTS OF SLIP CONDITION ON THE AERODYNAMICS OF UNINHABITED AERIAL VEHICLES", "text": "Jasen D.

Because of their significance to the nation's security and economy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have been actively engaged in observing, documenting, and assessing these large-scale environmental processes. In this regard, Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer unique new capabilities for earth and environmental exploration including: long endurance flights lasting 24 hours and longer, higher altitudes at subsonic speeds, and flights in environments hazardous to the onboard pilot in traditional aircraft. For example, missions to observe diurnal changes in critical atmospheric, oceanic and land surface processes, or missions to observe key polar or volcanic phenomena. Such missions have been unattainable to traditional aircrafts due to pilot safety concerns. The absence of a pilot in the cockpit allows for nonconventional and more cost effective designs. Current UAVs can carry video surveillance, data extraction equipment, data transmission systems, or other payload up to about 20% of their own weight. NASA's five-year plan for UAVs as a scientific platform states that \"one of the primary issues is reliability.\" Flight plans and navigation systems are based on formulated simulations and/or sensor technology, which are why computations must be made with extreme accuracy and all scenarios must be accounted for. The high altitudes at which UAVs operate have characteristics significantly different from those at ground level. A key aerodynamic factor in high-altitude flight is the slip condition on the surface of the airplane caused by the rarefied air found at high-altitude. In determining the forces acting on an airplane flying at high altitudes, a precise understanding of the effects of the slip velocity conditions on the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airplane is critical to assess the performance of the UAV and to enable the remote controlling and positioning of the UAV. The purpose of the present project is to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to investigate the effects of the slip condition on the overall aerodynamic characteristics of UAVs flying at high altitudes. The current world record holder for the UAV operating at the highest altitude is the Pathfinder Plus (Figure 1). The latter was designed, built and is operated by AeroVironment, Inc of Monrovia California. The Pathfinder Plus was designed for scientific data sampling at altitudes of around 100,000 feet at airspeeds of 15 to 25 mph and is able to endure weeks of continuous airborne missions. All UAV flight conditions, except for the altitude, will be based on specifications similar to that of the Pathfinder Plus. For the altitude, in addition to the current maximum operating condition of the Pathfinder of 100,000 ft, we will also investigate the effects of the rarefied air under a more challenging 200,000 ft altitude. The Computational Fluid Dynamics code that was used for the simulations and analysis is the commercial CFD code STAR-CD \u00ae from CD-adapco\u2122. STAR-CD \u00ae is a finite-volume based code which include several turbulence models, discretization methods, boundary conditions, structured and unstructured meshes and parallel computation capabilities."}, {"section_title": "SLIP MODEL", "text": "The Pathfinder Plus and future UAVs will operate at altitudes exceeding 30 km. At this height, the atmosphere becomes so rarefied that it no longer is in the continuum regime. An important consequence of the latter is that at this altitude the no-slip condition cannot be applied. The present approach considers a slip model based on surface chemistry that is derived from adsorption theory. In the present model, the gas molecules are thought not to reflect elastically but instead are temporarily adsorbed to the surface for a short time then reflected as a function of the adsorption potential. At a macroscopic level, this phenomenon can be modeled as a slip condition at the fluid/body interface. The slip velocity equation is then:  This slip model was implemented in the STAR-CD \u00ae code and a verification and validation phase was undertaken to assess the accuracy of the model as well as of the implementation in the STAR-CD \u00ae code."}, {"section_title": "VERIFICATION & VALIDATION", "text": "The CFD process is comprised of two phases: verification/validation and simulation/analysis. The purpose of the verification phase is to determine if the CFD code is producing correct and accurate. The validation phase seeks to determine the validity of the physical-mathematical model used in the simulation -in the present case the slip condition. The slip model was implemented into STAR-CD \u00ae through the user subroutine bcdefw. Bcdefw was written in FORTRAN code and was verified and validated by comparing its results with reference, experimental data. The test case selected corresponds to the nitrogen flow in a micro-channel investigated by Arkilic (1994). This flow has been selected because of its accuracy and to provide a benchmark for the slip condition that is free from other possible error sources such as turbulence. Figure 2 shows the schematic of the microchannel used in the experiments. Figure 3 shows the comparison between the data obtained from the experiment, the empirical slip model of Errol Arkilic's Thesis, and the results that were obtained from the simulation in STAR-CD \u00ae . It can be seen that the STAR-CD \u00ae results closely resemble the data from the manufactured micro-channels of the experiment as well as the slip model of the Thesis. Therefore, the STAR-CD \u00ae code effectively represents the slip condition that occurs on the UAVs at high altitudes."}, {"section_title": "SIMULATION & ANALYSIS", "text": "Using an Airbus type wing cross (Figure 4), simulations were done for the 2-D model at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 feet, each for the no-slip and slip condition. The cruising velocity was estimated to be at 20 mph (8.94 m/s). At an altitude of 100,000 feet, the atmosphere has a density of 1.77x10 -2 kg/m 3 , a viscosity of 1.48x10 -5 Ns/m 2 , and a chord length of 1.0 m which corresponds with a Reynolds number of approximately 10,000. At 200,000 feet altitude the density is 2.85x10 -4 kg/m 3 , viscosity equal to 1.61x10 -5 Ns/m 2 Figure 3. Plot of the comparison between the experimental data, the slip model in Errol Arkilic's Thesis, and the results from the STAR-CD\u00ae simulations.    corresponding to a Reynolds number of approximately 150. The Reynolds numbers for both altitudes are relatively low and within the laminar flow regime. Figures 5 and 6 show velocity plots of the no-slip and slip case at 100,000 feet altitude. Figure 7 and 8 show the velocity plots for the airfoil at an altitude of 200,000 feet for the no-slip and slip case. All flows have a stagnation point at the leading edge of the airfoil, but the distribution of the velocity is much more symmetrical about the x-axis in the 200,000 foot case than in the 100,000 foot case. Also, the Reynolds number of for the 200,000 foot case is extremely low resulting in the thick boundary layer as seen in Figure 7 and 8. The following four figures are the coefficient of pressure (Cp) plotted over the surface of the airfoil. Cp is plotted on the y-axis and the x-position of the airfoil plotted on the x-axis. Figure 9 and 10 are the Cp plots for the altitude of 100,000 feet for the no-slip and slip conditions. Figure 11 and 12 are the Cp plots for the 200,000 foot altitude for the no-slip and slip cases. In the coefficient of pressure plots, it is easy to see the difference in pressure from the top and bottom surface of the airfoil. This difference is related to the lift that is generated from that particular scenario. The Cp plot for the 200,000 foot case shows much less difference between the top and bottom surface. This could explain the reason why the lift coefficient dropped two orders of magnitude in the transition from the 100,000 to the 200,000 foot height.  Graphs displaying the velocity profile at various points on the airfoil were also plotted. These can be used as a way to visualize how the fluid is evolving as it passes over the surface of the wing. Figure  13 shows the three places where the profiles were collected. Figure 14 displays the three profile points plotted with the slip and no-slip cases at an altitude of 100,000 feet. Figure 15 shows the velocity profile for the no-slip and slip cases at 200,000 feet. They all appear to have the same general trend over the three points. The first profile at the tip of the airfoil has a dramatic slope as the solid wing breaks the atmosphere causing the high velocity gradient. Upon close inspection, the velocity profiles differ between the slip and no-slip case. At the surface, the no-slip scenarios have zero velocity, characterizing the no-slip assumption. In the case of the slip condition, the velocities do not start at zero which is expected because of the implementation of the slip model.      The three coefficients for Drag (C D ), Lift (C L ), and Pitch Moment (C M ), were calculated after running the various simulations. The equations used to find each are shown below: These equations were applied to the results of four simulations producing the coefficients characteristic of the airfoil in that scenario (Shown below in Table 1 The lift coefficient is higher for the slip condition for both altitudes in comparison to the no-slip case. The drag coefficient is greater in the no-slip scenario than in the slip. This is mainly due to the fact that the no-slip condition will cause more friction forces to act against the wing movement where the slip condition allows the wing to pass through the atmosphere with less resistance. This result could, in turn, aid the UAV in fuel efficiency and reduce the power required to maintain its speed. It is also apparent from the values in Table 1 that the slip condition plays a more prominent role at higher altitudes. As expected, the slip condition becomes more important at higher altitudes. The pitch moment coefficient experienced similar behavior increasing with the slip condition with a greater difference at a higher altitude. Also, in the transition from the lower altitude to the higher altitude, the dominating contribution factor changes from pressure to shear."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The author would like to thank the Hawaii NASA Space Grant for the privilege of procuring this project.

The primary function of fibers or reinforcements is to carry load along the length of the fiber to provide strength and stiffness in the longitudinal direction. Reinforcements can be oriented to provide tailored properties in the direction of the loads imparted on the end product. KiON CERASET\u00ae preceramic polymer was used in this research study. The low molecular weight, thermosetting Polyureasilazane combines the processing flexibility of liquids with the high pyrolytic yields previously demonstrated by higher molecular weight thermoplastic precursors. This polymer contains repeat units in which silicon and nitrogen atoms are bonded in an alternating sequence. Once heated to temperatures in excess of 1,000 o C, the polymer converts to Silicon Carbide-containing ceramic materials [6] in presence of Nitrogen gas.

Surfactant agent is a denser, viscous liquid used for proper dispersion of nanoparticles. Sheets of the woven fiber are cut in desired dimensions and are stacked on top of each other as the matrix is impregnated in between and onto the layers. The desired thickness of the test specimen was achieved by using 14 layers of the fabric. The wet lay-up laminate is then vacuum bagged as shown in Figure 1 for curing and consolidation inside an autoclave.  Figure 2 shows the typical curing process used for all of the test samples. For the final step of pyrolysis/reinfiltration cycle, the edges of the laminated composite plates are trimmed and samples of required dimensions (ASTM C 1341-97) are cut using a diamond blade cutter. The cut samples are then pyrolyzed in a high temperature tube furnace in an inert nitrogen gas environment to convert the preceramic polymer into ceramic. The pyrolysis process, see Fig. 3, converts the polymer into ceramic. During this process, micro cracks and voids form throughout the structure due to the processing of the material at high temperature.

Now the question is to find the function ( ) t f that gives us the optimal trajectory. Because the equations are so complicated, we need to supplement our analytical computations with numerical simulations. Currently we use the Runge-Kutta 4(5) method. Figure 2 shows the first test simulations. To better understand the graphs' behavior, we need to run more simulations and conduct some analytical analysis based on those simulations. Note that with the geometric trajectory generation we do not prescribe the final orbit. The results for this project will be used in computing so-called conjugate points because behind these points the trajectory is no longer optimal. The hope is either to develop an analytical method to calculate the position of those points or to show that they do not exist. For the numerical analysis the dense output function is used. This would be an inexpensive way of providing the continuity for an otherwise discontinuous output of points that the Runge-Kutta methods use."}]
