[{"section_title": "Description of genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets employed in the study", "text": "The Murcia study was designed as a new casecontrol GWAS in the Spanish population. In this study, 1,128 individuals were genotyped using Affymetrix NspI 250K chip. A sample of 327 sporadic Alzheimer's 1 Some data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years. For up-to-date information, see www. adni-info.org. The GenADA study included 801 cases meeting the NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria for probable AD, and 776 control subjects without family history of dementia, that were genotyped using Affymetrix 500K GeneChip Array set.\nThe with Illumina Human 610Quad platform. Using family trees provided in the study, we excluded all related controls and kept one case per family. A total of 1,077 cases and 876 unrelated controls were eligible for our study The TGEN GWAS study included 643 LOAD cases and 404 controls from a neuropathological cohort and 197 LOAD cases and 114 controls from a clinical cohort, all genotyped with Affymetrix 500K GeneChip Array set."}]
