To address this, we retrospectively documented the effect of apI in patients in the memory clinic. Methods We reviewed the presenting clinical features, the pre-apI and post-apI investigations, diagnosis and outcomes for the first 100 patients who had apI as part of their routine work-up at the Imperial Memory centre, a tertiary referral clinic in the UK National health service. results apI was primarily used to investigate patients with atypical clinical features (56 cases) or those that were young at onset (42 cases). MRI features of aD did not always predict positive apI (67%), and 6 of 23 patients with MRIs reported as normal were amyloid-peT positive. There were significantly more cases categorised as non-aD dementia post-apI (from 11 to 23). patients investigated when apI was initially available had fewer overall investigations and all patients had significantly fewer investigations in total post-apI.

Clinical diagnosis of AD is usually based on clinical history, examination and ancillary investigations such as structural brain imaging with MRI and neuropsychological testing. Even in the best centres, studies of diagnostic accuracy based on histopathological confirmation can show sensitivity and specificity of about 80% and 55%, respectively. [1] [2] [3] [4] For patients presenting earlier with atypical symptoms at onset, younger age at onset or with multiple pathologies that may cause cognitive impairment, the diagnostic accuracy is even lower, often leading to delays in diagnosis. 5 Cerebral amyloid plaques are one of the pathological hallmarks of AD, and the ability to demonstrate their presence in vivo via amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (API) has led to a considerable body of research over the last decade. However, early amyloid PET tracers had short halflives limiting their clinical application. Now three (18)F ligands, florbetapir (Amyvid, Eli Lilly), florbetaben (NeuraCeq, Piramal) and flutemetamol (Vizamyl, GE Healthcare), have been licensed for clinical use in specific populations and guidelines regarding their use have been proposed. 6 The longer half-life of these fluorinated ligands means that tracers can be readily distributed. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Importantly, (18)F-florbetapir has been proven to be both highly sensitive and specific for AD when compared with autopsy findings. [12] [13] [14] [15] The ability of these imaging techniques to contribute to clinical utility has not yet been widely demonstrated. Evidence from research populations [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] suggests that API offers useful prognostic information on the progression of MCI subjects to convert to AD, can influence treatment decisions with acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors and provides clarity in those with atypical presentations.\nHere, we present a retrospective review of 100 'real-world' patients investigated in a single centre memory clinic who underwent API as part of their diagnostic work-up."}, {"section_title": "MeThods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patient population", "text": "API became available at The Imperial Memory Centre (IMC) in December 2013.

Patients who were classified as MCI-AD due to positive CSF biomarkers with subsequent negative API were then re-classified as MCI.\nFor the purposes of this study, cognitive investigations were classified as any imaging modality to determine cause of cognitive impairment (eg, MRI or CT head, DaT scan or FDG-PET, CSF analysis, neuropsychological assessment and genetic blood tests). For counting the number of investigations, the patient records (electronic and hard copy), electronic radiology system and electronic pathology test records were reviewed individually for each patient.

Patients who were imaged tended to be young with a median age of 66.7 years (range 44.5-88) (table 1). The median duration of cognitive impairment at presentation was 24 months but this was also highly variable among the population (range 0.5-120) (table 1) .\nPatients undergoing API were formed of three main categories: undifferentiated MCI (33 patients with a median age of 69.5 years (range 44.5-80)), young-onset dementia (YOD) (42 patients) and those who were older than 65 years with cognitive impairment which was thought to be due to AD but with atypical clinical features making diagnosis uncertain (25 patients) (table 1).

The vast majority of patients who were scanned (98 out of 100) clearly met appropriate use criteria as set out by the Amyloid Imaging Taskforce (AIT), 6 and no complications were associated with scanning.

Assessing the impact of an imaging technique in changing clinical management is complex, our criteria did not include the significant psychosocial and medical impacts of an exclusion of AD pathology in younger patients and those with milder complaints. Nevertheless, by our criteria, scanning resulted in an active change in clinical management in almost half of cases, most commonly relating to medication commencement or enrolment into clinical trials.\nOne key finding from this study is that patients had significantly fewer cognitive investigations following their (18)F-florbetapir scan than before. This finding of a reduction in diagnostic "}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "The number of pre-apI investigations per patient by apI availability. Overall significantly fewer investigations were performed when apI was initially available (p = 0.017). apI, amyloid-peT imaging.\nCognitive neurology uncertainty and therefore in ongoing investigation is strongly supported by our comparison of the group of patients who were seen at a clinic without access to API with patients seen at our clinic after the introduction of clinical API. This showed that those individuals who presented at our clinic following the introduction of API had fewer investigations in total, and suggests that use of amyloid PET in specific populations can reduce time to diagnosis. The data from our cohort of patients suggest that API could follow structural MRI in dementia investigation and may reduce the number of patients who need formal neuropsychometric assessments, (18)F-FDG PET scans or CSF analysis. Although our clinical observational study was not designed to assess the economic impact of API, further studies could explore the potential relative cost savings of amyloid imaging in terms of reduction of other investigations and reduction in follow-up clinic visits prior to diagnosis.\nThe patients we describe had previously all had MRI scans, and these had been reported by a neuroradiologist. Features consistent with AD were reported in 12 individuals who went on to have negative amyloid PET scans. In this small group of patients, the clinical presentation was often atypical (seven cases) or another diagnostic test was often out of keeping with the diagnosis of AD (five had normal CSF abeta). This does suggest that caution should be employed when using isolated MRI features such as HA as a biomarker for amyloid pathology. However, the majority of patients' scans were reported as non-diagnostic or normal. This is consistent with the characteristics of the patient group as a whole, which fitted the suggested criteria for amyloid PET use. That is, patients with MCI-AD, patients with earlyonset AD and AD patients with atypical presentations are less likely to manifest clear-cut patterns of atrophy consistent with AD than elderly patients with dementia that is more typical of AD. [23] [24] [25] [26] Thirty seven of the patients described here had undergone CSF examination prior to API, and of these, five had more than one CSF examination. Although there is evidence to suggest that CSF amyloid biomarkers are likely to become abnormal before API, 27 this is primarily in the context of preclinical AD, and at present remains more pertinent to the research setting. In our population, the concordance between CSF amyloid biomarkers and API was unexpectedly low compared with research populations; a number of individuals (22) who went on to have positive API had previously had isolated raised tau, low A-beta or normal tau and abeta, such that there was still diagnostic uncertainty following CSF analysis. In some centres and in the research setting, CSF analysis has been repeatedly shown to be reliable and consistent even with different transfer methods, 28 29 but we note that this is not always the case. 26 30 This is also supported by the results of another recent smaller study, where API following CSF analysis was demonstrated to change diagnosis in 7 out of 20 individuals with cognitive impairment. 31 This tallies with our own experience where CSF examination for amyloid status can be associated with sample handling and assay problems, although these have improved considerably over the last year, and are likely to improve further with the advent of new CSF biomarkers, improving standardisation of assay protocols and the implementation of newer assay platforms. 32 In addition, as a non-invasive investigation, API was very acceptable to patients with a rapid turnaround time for results.\nOne difference that we note between our clinical population and major research cohorts, including the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, is the difference in the proportion of patients with MCI who were amyloid PET positive. Of the 31 patients in our group with MCI before florbetapir imaging, only 6 had positive API whereas in the ADNI population, approximately half of the patients with MCI were amyloid PET positive. 16 17 19 21 22 28 33 Although this may be an aberration related to our much smaller sample size, we would suggest that this difference genuinely reflects the population differences between the two cohorts. Our patients were younger than those in the ADNI cohort, and were often individuals who had been referred by other clinicians because of diagnostic uncertainty. Therefore, they are likely to represent a more atypical group of patients with MCI than might be recruited to research cohorts. API also changed diagnosis in 30 of 100 cases which is more than has been described in research populations. 16 17 Overall, our experience suggests that there is a clear role for amyloid PET scanning in the in the work-up of patients with cognitive impairment in the memory clinic independent of research studies. The patients included here were a purely clinical group rather than a research cohort, but we acknowledge that they would not be entirely representative all clinical populations attending for memory assessment in the UK healthcare system. The cost and availability of amyloid PET preclude its use for the majority of patients with AD for now. However, if used in individuals who meet AIT criteria, API reduces the number of further investigations and significantly affects clinical management, in addition to adding to improving diagnostic certainty.\nCorrection notice This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
