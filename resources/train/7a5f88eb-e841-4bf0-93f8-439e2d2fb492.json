Methods: For 912 nonapolipoprotein \u03b54 middle-aged adults and 365 aged adults across the AD spectrum, linear mixed models gauged FH and TOMM40 '523 interactions on memory and global cognition between baseline and up to 10 years later. A cerebrospinal fluid mitochondrial function biomarker was also assessed. Results: For FH negative participants, gene-dose preservation of memory and global cognition was seen for \"very long\" versus \"short\" carriers. For FH positive, an opposite gene-dose decline was seen for very long versus short carriers. Maternal FH was a stronger predictor in aged, but not middle-aged, participants. Similar gene-dose effects were seen for the mitochondrial biomarker aspartate aminotransferase.

Subjects without the \u03b54 allele (non-APOE 34s) are considered at neutral risk but show substantial variability for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), where there is tremendous interest in finding genetic risk factors for non-APOE 34s that strongly predict memory, global decline, and cognitive impairment risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with LOAD [2] , several groups have investigated gene loci that impact mitochondrial bioenergetics, such as translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 kDa (TOMM40).\nTOMM40 shares a strong linkage disequilibrium with APOE on chromosome 19 [3] . TOMM40 constitutes the central channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane, through which mitochondria-specific ribosomal preproteins enter for post-translational modification in the inner matrix [4] . Genome-wide association studies have implicated several TOMM40 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in increased LOAD risk, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy, particularly SNP rs2075650 that has consistently shown such associations [4] [5] [6] [7] . In addition, a TOMM40 variable length deoxythymidine-homopolymer (poly-T) at rs10524523 ('523) within intron 6 has sometimes been shown to associate with LOAD risk. Among non-APOE 34s, the phase-in haplotypes are APOE \u03b53-linked to either a TOMM40 '523 \"short\" (S) or \"very long\" (VL) poly-T length [8] . Some studies find that subjects with the VL allele have worse memory and executive function scores in middle-aged [6] and aged [9] cohorts. To date, several studies have also found that TOMM40 VL in non-APOE 34s or APOE \u03b53/\u03b54s predicts memory deficits or earlier age of AD onset [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, other reports with large samples have found no effect or a benefit of TOMM40 VL on age of onset and memory decline [13] [14] [15] .\nIt may be important to account for other factors that can modulate mitochondrial function, such as AD family history (FH). AD FH is typically defined as maternal or paternal LOAD onset between ages 65 and 80 [16] . Both FH and TOMM40 influence mitochondrial bioenergetic processes needed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. For example, maternal FH (FHM) is related to reduced cytochrome oxidase activity [17] , leading to electron transport chain dysfunction, lower ATP production, and neuronal damage. Like TOMM40, FH can increase AD risk independent of APOE [18] . To link FH and TOMM40 with AD, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis posits that multiple factors determine baseline and age-related decline in mitochondrial function [19] . As neurons in hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe areas have high ATP requirements [16] , FH and TOMM40 might interact to affect mitochondrial dysfunction and contribute to memory and global cognitive decline, as well as cognitive impairment risk.\nOur objective was to explore FH and TOMM40 interactions separately in non-APOE 34 late middle-aged or aged subjects from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) study or Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), respectively, to see if FH or FHM modulated TOMM40 effects in middle-age and along the AD spectrum in old age. The primary outcomes were longitudinal memory decline in both cohorts and global decline in the aged cohort. Previous WRAP and ADNI reports either focused on cross-sectional cognition with fewer subjects [6] or age of onset but not on cognitive or mitochondrial outcomes [13] .\nTo establish that FH and TOMM40 meaningfully interacted to affect mitochondrial processes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of a cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (AST) peptide were gauged. Cytosol AST is an enzyme that facilitates catabolism of glucogenic amino acids through the malate-aspartate shuttle by a final conversion step of aspartate to oxaloacetate, helping to maximize ATP production through glycolysis [20, 21] . AST, also called glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase, differs in CSF levels among AD patients and related dementias [22] , and shows higher concentrations in AD frontal and parietal cortices [23] . APOE 34 subjects were not considered for this report, as their in-phase TOMM40 genotype (\"long\", or L) is different and could confound effects of S and VL genotypes in APOE \u03b53/\u03b54 subjects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Late middle-aged subjects (91.3% Caucasian, nonHispanic) were recruited from the WRAP study [24] .

In each cohort separately (WRAP or ADNI), for a given Zscore memory factor, we tested all main effects and interactions for FH, TOMM40, and Time as predictors in a single model. A similar approach was used for testing global cognition outcomes in ADNI participants. This approach assessed if FH modified TOMM40 genotype associations, and if these effects on memory decline were the same over time or dynamically changed based on FH and genotype. To explore which memory components drove significant findings for the single ADNI memory factor, immediate and delayed RAVLT scores were assessed. Exploratory analyses were also conducted with FHM, due to FHM's influence on mitochondrial function [17] . We controlled for sex, age, and education. A similar mixed model approach was used to predict baseline CSF AST in ADNI. Logistic regression was used in ADNI data to identify if FH and TOMM40 predicted a greater likelihood of being MCI or AD at baseline versus the CN reference group. Importantly, we did not investigate if TOMM40 and FH modified clinical diagnosis effects on memory because of small sample sizes among subgroups stratified by TOMM40, FH, and APOE.\nTo minimize type 1 error, as described elsewhere [25] , Holm-Bonferroni correction was used to maintain a familywise error rate of P , .05. Briefly, for WRAP, familywise adjusted P values were .025 and .05 for testing 1 model between two latent memory factors, and similarly .025 and .05 for ADNI MMSE and CDR-sob. If a TOMM40*FH or TOMM40*FH*Time interaction was not significant, we separately examined two additional models in FH2 and FH1 to tests main effects of TOMM40 and its interaction with Time. This required familywise adjustment of .017, .025, and .050 to yield significance. This approach is more optimal than conventional Bonferroni correction [33] [34] [35] .

Nonetheless, we consistently found that for FH2, VL carriage was associated with lower AD risk, less mitochondrial dysfunction via the CSF biomarker AST, and less memory and global decline over time, whereas the opposite pattern was seen for FH1. Although FH and TOMM40 may affect mitochondrial function, it is not clear if FH is modulating TOMM40 function by epigenetic, environmental, or other factors. It is clear that FHM affects cytochrome oxidase [17] production that impacts AD progression, and that SNPs for several mitochondrial genes contribute to a higher odds ratio for AD [39] in ADNI. Although FH in WRAP and ADNI both modified TOMM40 poly-T effects, FHM exerted modest effects in middle age but more potent associations in the aged cohort. Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to increase with age [37] , where the influence of FHM on mitochondrial bioenergetics may only be present in older subjects evincing damage because of reactive oxygen species.
