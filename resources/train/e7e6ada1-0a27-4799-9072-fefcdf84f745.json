[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "December 2019, local health authorities reported an increasing number of pneumonia cases spreading rapidly across the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province in China. The causative agent of this disease was identified as SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Lu et al., 2020) and although most cases are asymptomatic or only evidence mild symptoms with good recovery rates; a small percentage of the infected patients develop more severe manifestations, such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiple organ failures and multiple cases resulting in death . SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide, leading to a coronavirus pandemic of unprecedented magnitude and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 as an international public health emergency (Lai et al., 2020) . Globally, more than 50 million confirmed cases resulted in over 1.2 million victims as reported by the WHO on 11th of November 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020) . This staggering number is a major challenge to precarious healthcare systems, especially, in developing countries. Under these circumstances, the identification and development of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 drugs is of high priority.\nCoronoviridae forms the largest family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and is classified into four genera (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4) (Nga et al., 2011) . SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are \u03b2-coronaviruses (de Wit et al., 2020) .\nAnalysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed a higher identity to bat SARS-like coronavirus (89.1% nucleotide similarity) .\nThe genomic RNA of coronaviruses is ~30,000 nucleotides in length and contains at least six open reading frames (ORFs) (Hussain et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2020) The first ORF (ORF 1a/b), about twothirds of the genome length, directly translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, so named because there is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b. These polyproteins are processed by a main protease, M pro (also known as 3C-like protease -3CL pro ) and, by viral papain-like proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). These NSPs are involved in the generation of subgenomic RNAs that encode four main structural proteins (envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins) and other accessory proteins (Ramajayam et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2013) . Therefore, these proteases, especially 3CL pro , play vital roles in the replication process of coronaviruses. 3CL pro is a cysteine protease with a three-domain (domains I to III) organization and with a chymotrypsin like fold (Anand et al., 2002) . Active 3CL pro consists of a homodimer containing two protomers and the coronavirus 3CL pro features a noncanonical Cys-His dyad located in the cleft between domains I and II (Anand et al., 2002; Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003) .\nThe functional importance of 3CL pro in the viral life cycle combined with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, indicating that this protease is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs (Pillaiyar et al., 2016) . So far, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the bureaucratic process to approve new drugs is a very time consuming and costly process. Thus, repurposing of existing drug molecules could be a rapid alternative to combat the virus infection. The well described anti-parasitic drugs like chloroquine, quinacrine and suramin revealed anti-viral effects against SARS-Cov-2 in cell cultures da Silva et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Roldan et al., 2020; Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020) . These three compounds have been used as antiprotozoal drugs, being that chloroquine and quinacrine are used against malaria (Hoekenga, 1955; Joy, 1999) and suramin against sleeping sickness, which is caused by trypanosomes (Steverding, 2010) .\nIn the present study, we tested the inhibitory potentials of chloroquine, quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Quinacrine and suramin presented IC50 values < 10 \u00b5M and KD values in a low \u00b5M range; however, chloroquine did not affect the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity. Further experiments identified quinacrine and suramin as competitive and non-competitive inhibitor, respectively. A 1:1 combination of quinacrine and suramin decreased the IC50 value to < 500 nM. Our results indicate that quinacrine and suramin are interesting drug candidates to combat SARS-Cov-2 infections and molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation inferred the amino acid residues responsible for the interaction between the 3C-like protease and the molecules."}, {"section_title": "Cloning, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro", "text": "The codon optimized cDNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (Uniprot entry: P0DTD1) was synthesized and implemented in the ampicillin resistant vector pGEX-6P-3 (BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).

The crude cell extract obtained was centrifuged (7,000 rpm for 90 min at 6 \u00b0C). The supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro _GST was loaded onto a GSH-Sepharose matrix which was previously extensively washed with the lysis buffer and was extensively washed with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with the same buffer plus addition of 10 mM GSH. The eluted fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against PreScission protease cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA).

Separation of the target protein, the GST-tag and the PreScission protease was achieved using GSH-Sepharose. Further, to remove aggregated fraction, size exclusion chromatography was used (Superdex 200 10/300 GL GE Healthcare, USA), the column was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl.

A measurement was conducted following each titration. The quenching of the protease fluorescence, \u0394F (Fmax-F), at 330 nm of each titration point was used for fitting a saturation binding curve using a nonlinear leastsquares fit procedure which has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Johnson and Frasier, 1985) based on equation (3) (Shaikh et al., 2007) :\nwhere, [Q] is the ligand concentration in solution, acting as a quencher, y is the specific binding derived by measuring fluorescence intensity, Bmax is the maximum amount of the protease-ligand complex at saturation of the ligand and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant.

Cluster analysis of the MD simulations demonstrated that cluster #0 showed the best results with representativeness of over 86.1% of the whole simulation time and the selected structure appeared during the simulation around 169 ns (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is a homodimer with the catalytical dyad His41 and Cys145 (Zhang et al., 2020a) . Dimerization of the protease is necessary for catalytic activity; the interaction of each protomer N-terminal Ser1 with\nGlu166 of the other protomer stabilizes the shape of the S1 pocket, which is important for the binding of the substrate (Anand et al., 2002) . Chen et al. 2006 suggested that only one protomer of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro dimer is active (Chen et al., 2006) . Interestingly, after the initial MD simulations of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro dimer ( Supplementary Fig. S6) , one protomer active site collapsed and, the volume of the pocket decreased by around twofold, from 261 to 142 \u00c5 3 compared to the active site of the other protomer. The main difference observed between the two protomers succeeding the MD simulation was the interaction between the C-terminal Gln306 and Ile152 of the same protomer. A hydrogen bond was observed between NE2 of Gln306 and the backbone oxygen of Ile152 (Supplementary Fig. S7) . We assume that this interaction in addition to the already described (Glu166 with Ser1) stabilizes the active site. To conceive the molecular binding modes of the inhibitory molecules, theoretical investigations through docking and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. The interactions between SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro in complex with quinacrine or suramin were analyzed to predict their binding mode. Quinacrine was docked in both protease active sites (as competitive inhibitor) and suramin (as non-competitive inhibitor) in a region with strong positive charges on the protein surface, as suramin is a highly negatively charged molecule (Burch and Ashburn, 1951) . Subsequent MD simulations demonstrated a stable system for a period of 300 ns ( Supplementary Fig. S8 and S9) . The binding assessment of the ligands to the protease was observed using a residue-wise decomposition of the binding energy received from the MD simulations. Table 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the 3CL pro amino acid residues contribution to the binding energy in the active site that interact with quinacrine. The interactions between quinacrine and the protease are stabilized by two hydrogen bonds (H-bond), which are mediated by donor and acceptor atoms of Met165 and Gln189 (Table 4) . His41, Met49, Val186, Arg188 and Gln194 interact with quinacrine by hydrophobic interactions (Table 3 and Fig. 4) . The substrate-binding subsites are highlighted: green S1`; gold S1; red S2 and blue S3. Lys100, Tyr101 and Phe103. Additionally, the ligand is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the residues: Lys97, Lys100, Lys102, Phe103, Val104 and Arg105 (Table 3) . As a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , quinacrine interacts through hydrophobic interaction with His41 of the protease catalytic dyad, blocking the entrance to the active site. On the contrary, suramin is not directly interacting with the active site residues and our results suggested that suramin interact with the protein allosterically changing the catalytic site conformation, thus preventing the substrate entry. An important task is the suitability of the inhibitor to the binding areas so that covalent inhibition occurs (Pettinger et al., 2017) . Therefore, the nucleophilicity of the amino acid residues in the target and electrophilic groups in the drug need to be considered (Way, 2000) . The relative nucleophilicity of the amino acid residues in their neutral states are given in the order of Cys (1) > His (10 \u22122 ) > Met (10 \u22123 ) > Lys, Ser (10 \u22125 ) > Thr and Tyr (10 -6 ) (Way, 2000; Pettinger et al., 2017) . This is one of the reasons why many of the covalent modifiers in drugs are designed to target the thiol group of cysteine (Gan et al., 2009; Leproult et al., 2011) . Quinacrine interact directly with nucleophilic residues in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (e.g. His41 and Met165) which make them highly attractive for covalent interactions. Contrary, suramin interact with Lys and Tyr residues that can also form covalent bonds , but in a less probability compared with Cys, His and"}, {"section_title": "Ligand", "text": "Met.\nTo study in more detail the plasticity of the virus protease in complex with quinacrine and suramin the consequences on the ligand binding areas, the substrate-binding sites (S1, S1\u00b4, S2, S3) and the oxyanion hole after MD simulation of the complexes were analysed. Amino acid residues forming the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro and their subsites were described previously (Supplementary Table S1 ) (Chen et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2020) . Fig. 6 describe the changes occurred on SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro substrate-binding site caused by the interaction of the inhibitors. MD simulations revealed possible mode of interaction of quinacrine with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Thereby, His41, one amino acid residue of the catalytic dyad, interact with quinacrine, this interaction is responsible to block partially the S1` and S3 sites occupying completely the S2 subsite (Fig. 6) . Four residues of the protease S2 subsite interact directly with quinacrine via hydrophobic interactions (His41, Met49, Asp187 and Arg188) and two residues of the S3 subsite form H-bonds with the inhibitor molecule (Met165 and Gln189). In the case of suramin, no single amino acid residue of the S1, S1`, S2 and S3 subsites are in interaction with the ligand, which agrees with the results of the activity assay that describe suramin as non-competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro ."}, {"section_title": "Figure 6", "text": "Fig. 6.

Structural overlay between the single protein and in complex, the active site residues are highlighted. The amino acid residues are shown in sticks. The surface view (zoom) of the substrate-binding area demonstrates the occupied area by the molecules and the conformational changes induced by its binding. Substrate-binding subsites highlighted as green S1`; gold S1; red S2 and blue S3.\nSuramin binds allosterically and the ligand interaction induces conformational changes in the catalytic site (most observable for subsites S1` and S2), thus preventing the entry and the turnover of the substrate (Fig. 7) . Additionally, the volume of the active site pocket decreased considerably after suramin binding, even whether the molecule was docking just in protomer 1, changing the volume of the pocket from 261 to 90 \u00c5 3 (Protomer 1) and to 120 (Protomer 2) (Fig. 7C to E). "}, {"section_title": "Suramin and quinacrine act cooperatively to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro", "text": "Suramin and quinacrine, as described previously, bind in different regions of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro .To conjecture about the effect of both molecules simultaneously, we performed a combined inhibitory assay, whither both molecules were mixed (1:1) and tested against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (Fig. 8) . The inhibition assay was performed with a solution containing both ligands (suramin and quinacrine) with the molar ratio of 1:1. The calculated IC50 value (0.46 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M) demonstrated an increased inhibition capacity of the drugs (Table 5 and supplementary Fig. S11 ). When compared with the single molecules, the combination enhances the inhibitory capacity of the studied drugs for approx. 10 times. Which could be observed by the determined IC50 values. We assume that the conformational changes after suramin interaction with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro induce a structural change in both active sites in the dimer, which could make them more accessible for the interaction with quinacrine (Fig. 7) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, the cooperative inhibition of quinacrine and suramin could lead to a possible alternative to combat COVID-19 infections. Repurposing of clinically developed drugs is a common procedure to combat fast evolving pathogens. Similar studies addressed the use of established drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Boceprevir, Menadione and Disulfiram) (Ma et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020) . (Table 5 ). The 1:1 combination of quinacrine and suramin possess an effective anti-3CL pro activity, demonstrating the potential of repurposing drugs to stop the replication process of SARS-CoV-2. "}]
