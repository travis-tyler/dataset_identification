[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the past decade, exciting opportunities have emerged in studying 3D imaging data thanks to the rapid progress made in 3D image acquisition. There is a crucial need to develop effective 3D shape indexing and classification techniques. Shape space models, which usually measure similarities between two shapes by the deformation between them, may provide a suitable mathematical and computational description for shape analysis (as reviewed in [67] ). In computer vision research, shape space has been well studied for brain atlas estimation [19, 18] , shape analysis [33, 24, 56] , morphometry study [69, 10] , etc. Recently, the Wasserstein space is attracting more attention. The Wasserstein space is the space consisting of all the probability measures on a Riemannian manifold. The Wasserstein distance defines a Riemannian metric for the Wasserstein space and it intrinsically measures the similarities between shapes. The advantages of Wasserstein distance for 3D shape analysis research are: (1) the geodesic distance between space points gives a continuous and refined shape difference measure, which is particularly useful for brain imaging study, where higher accuracy is usually expected; (2) it studies a transport between two probability measures on a canonical image or manifold so it is robust to noise. It holds the potential to quantitatively measure 3D shapes reconstructed from images and provide a theoretical foundation for 3D shape analysis.\nWasserstein distance has been widely studied and applied in image and shape analysis. In [45] , the Wasserstein distance was used to model local shape appearances and shape variances for joint variational object segmentation and shape matching. A linear optimal transportation (LOT) framework was introduced in [61] , where a linearized version of the Wasserstein distance was used to measure the differences between images. Hong, et al. [28] used Wasserstein distance to encode the integral shape invariants computed at multiple scales and to measure the dissimilarities between two shapes. However, these methods only work with 2D images. In [5] , the Wasserstein distance computation was generalized to Riemannian manifolds. Su, et al. [56] computed the Wasserstein distance between genus-0 surfaces, where the spherical conformal domain was used as the canonical space. On the other hand, a major limitation of Wasserstein distance is that its computational cost increases as the sizes of the problems increase. Cuturi, et al. [13] proposed to solve this problem with entropic regularization. In [51] , the algorithm was extended to geometric domains for shape interpolation, surface soft maps, etc. To date, few studies have investigated Wasserstein distance defined on general topological surfaces.\nIn practice, most 3D shapes have complicated topology (high-genus). In brain imaging research, to enforce the alignment of the major anatomic features, one may slice surface open along certain landmark curves [50] . This procedure generates genus-0 surfaces with multiple open boundaries. The current state-of-the-art Wasserstein space research is unable to compute Wasserstein distance on these high-genus surfaces or genus-0 surfaces with multiple open boundaries. In this work, to overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework by integrating hyperbolic Ricci flow [70, 49] , hyperbolic harmonic map [50] , surface tensor-based morphometry (TBM) [14, 12] , and optimal mass transportation (OMT) map [31, 11] . We also extend the computation of the OMT map and the Wasserstein distance to the hyperbolic space, i.e., the Poincar\u00e9 disk. We call the resulting Wasserstein distance the hyperbolic Wasserstein distance.\nIn this paper, we applied the hyperbolic Wasserstein distance to index and compare different 3D shapes. We tested our algorithm on genus-0 surfaces with multiple open boundaries, including human face surfaces with different expressions, longitudinal brain cortical morphology with normal aging, and cortical shape classification between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy control people. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is promising to be a new shape analysis tool.\nOur major contributions can be summarized as follows: 1. Propose a novel algorithm to compute Wasserstein distance between general surfaces with hyperbolic Riemannian metric. 2. Extend the OMT map to hyperbolic Poincar\u00e9 space, which greatly enhance its applicability for general surface analysis. 3. Develop a general framework that may be applicable for other shape space work. Currently, most of shape space work were developed on genus-0 surfaces, e.g. [34, 24] , which cannot be directly applied to high-genus surfaces because of the difficulty in building a canonical space for them. Our framework, which adopts a hyperbolic harmonic map to build diffeomorphic mappings between general surfaces, may be used to generalize other shape space studies to general surfaces as well."}, {"section_title": "Prior Work", "text": "Analysis and understanding of shapes is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision and medical imaging research. Many 3D shape indexing methods have been proposed and extensively applied. The spherical harmonic analysis [21, 55] and its extension, the weighted spherical harmonic representation [12] , use spherical harmonics to match and compare shapes. But these methods require the surfaces to be homotopic to a sphere. The medial description of shapes [42, 54] , which is composed of a set of medial samples (m-reps), is also widely applied. Wang et al. introduced a series of conformal invariants to represent and analyze shapes, which are the coordinates of surfaces in the Teichm\u00fcller space. The conformal invariants were computed with Euclidean Ricci flow [65] or hyperbolic Yamabe flow [64, 64] and no surface registration was required. In brain imaging studies, the volumes and surface areas of cortical or subcortical structures are often used as biomarkers to characterize brain morphometry associated with cognitive diseases [27] .\nThe optimal mass transportation (OMT) problem was first raised by Monge, concerning to find an optimal way to move a pile of soil from one place to another with minimal transportation cost [9] . The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the OMT problem were proved in [31] using linear programming. The Monge-Kantorovich optimization has been widely applied in various fields, including physics, economics, computer science, etc. Specifically, the OMT map provides an important tool for image processing [25, 44] . Recently, the algorithm has been generalized to 3D surfaces for area-preserving mappings [71, 57] and Wasserstein distance computation [56, 58] . However, existing methods only work on genus-0 surfaces, while our algorithm extends the OMT problem to general surfaces with hyperbolic metric.\nKendall [32] pioneered the manifold shape space research. In computational anatomy framework [22] , the space of diffeomorphisms was carefully studied [40, 68] . In [53, 52] , shape space was defined as the space of orbits of the reparameterization group acting on the space of immersions. The reparameterization invariant (RI) metric constructed in [8] used the volume form and the mean curvature of the immersion f , and the metric in [34] used the area multiplication factor of f . Kurtek et al. [35] extended the work in [34] by adding landmark constraints. Jermyn et al. [30] simplified the RI metric computation and Gutman et al. [24] built a Riemannian framework for an intrinsic comparison of the RI metric structure. Lipman and Daubechies [37] introduced a metric for shape comparison based on conformal uniformization and OMT. The metric is invariant under M\u00f6bius transformation. Later, Lipman et al. [38] provided a convergence analysis of the discrete approximation to the arising mass transportation problems. M\u00e9moli [39] presented a modification and expansion of the original Gromov-Hausdorff notion of distance between metric spaces which considers probability measures defined on measurable subsets of metric spaces."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background", "text": "In this section, we briefly introduce the most relevant concepts and theories.

It can be verified that\u1e21 = e 2u g is also a Riemannian metric on S and angles measured by\u1e21 are equal to those mea-sured by g. Then\u1e21 is called a conformal deformation of g and u is the conformal factor. When metric changes, the surface Gaussian curvature K will change accordingly t\u014d\n\u2202y 2 ) is the Laplace-Beltrami operator induced by g. According to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem [15] , the total Gaussian curvature is determined by the surface topology, i.e., S KdA = 2\u03c0\u03c7(S), where \u03c7(S) is the Euler characteristic of S and dA is the surface area element.\nUniformization Theorem Given {S, g}, there exist an infinite number of metrics which are conformal to g. The uniformization theorem states that, among all conformal metrics, there is a unique representative, which induces constant Gaussian curvature everywhere. Furthermore, the constant will be one of {\u22121, 0, 1}. The corresponding metric is called the uniformization metric of S. Thus, we can embed the universal covering space of any closed surface to one of three canonical spaces using its uniformization metric: the sphere S 2 for genus-0 surfaces with positive Euler numbers; the Euclidean plane E 2 for genus-1 surfaces with Euler number zero; and the hyperbolic space H 2 for highgenus surfaces with negative Euler numbers.\nSurface Ricci Flow The uniformization metric of a surface can be computed by the Ricci flow method. The normalized surface Ricci flow is defined as\n, where A(0) is the total area of S at time 0 and K(t) is the Gaussian curvature induced by g(t). It has been proved that if \u03c7(S) < 0, the solution to the normalized Ricci flow equation exists for all t > 0 and converges to a metric with constant Gaussian curvature"}, {"section_title": "2\u03c0\u03c7(s)", "text": "A(0) [26] . Thus, the hyperbolic uniformization metric of a surface, which introduces -1 Gaussian curvature everywhere, can be computed by the Ricci flow.\nHyperbolic Geometry As the hyperbolic space H 2 cannot be realized in R 3 , we use the Poincar\u00e9 disk model to visualize it.

Let p \u2208 S be a base point, two loops through p are homotopic, if one can deform to the other without leaving S. All the homotopic classes of loops starting from p form a simply connected surfaceS. Then the universal covering space of S, {S,\u1e21}, can be isometrically embedded in H 2 . A Fuchsian transformation \u03c6 is a M\u00f6bius transformation that maps a universal covering spaceS to another and preserves the projection \u03c6 \u2022 p = p. All Fuchsian transformations form the Fuchsian group, F uchs(S).\nHarmonic Map Given a surface {S, g}, if the coordinates (x, y) satisfy g = e 2u(x,y) (dx 2 + dy 2 ), where u is the conformal factor, (x, y) are called the isothermal coordinates. Consider a map f : {S 1 , g 1 } \u2192 {S 2 , g 2 }, z and w are the local isothermal coordinates on S 1 and S 2 , respectively. We denote f (z) = w and g 1 \nwhere\nIf f is a critical point of the harmonic energy, then it is called a harmonic map. The necessary condition for f to be a harmonic map is the Euler-Lagrange equation\nThe following theorem [46] shows that harmonic maps with hyperbolic metrics are beneficial for general surface registration study. Theorem 1 (Yau): Suppose f : {S 1 , g 1 } \u2192 {S 2 , g 2 } is a degree one harmonic map, furthermore, the Riemannian metric on S 2 induces negative Gaussian curvature, then for each homotopy class, the harmonic map is unique and diffeomorphic.\nOptimal Mass Transportation Map Given a Riemannian manifold {S, g}, let \u03bc and \u03bd be two probability measures on S with the same total mass, i.e., S \u03bcdx = S \u03bddx, let \u03c6 : S \u2192 S be a diffeomorphic map, then the pull back measure induced by \u03c6 is \u03c6 * \u03bd = det(J)\u03bd \u2022 \u03c6, where J is the Jacobian matrix of \u03c6. If the pull back measure satisfies \u03c6 * \u03bd = \u03bc, then the map \u03c6 is measure preserving. The transportation cost of \u03c6 is defined as\nwhere p is a vertex on S and d g (p, \u03c6(p)) is the geodesic distance between p and its image \u03c6(p) with respect to the metric g. The OMT problem tries to find the measure preserving mapping, which uses minimal transportation cost (Eq. [5] ). Wasserstein Space and Wasserstein Distance Given a Riemannian manifold {S, g}, the Wasserstein space is defined as: Definition 1 (Wasserstein Space): Let P n (S) denote the space of all probability measures \u03bc on S with finite n th moment, where n \u2265 1.
