In this review, evidence to support the hypothesis that A\u03b2 and/or its sequelae are necessary for oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades seen in AD brain will be given."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2(1-42)-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity: Relevance to AD", "text": "The notions that A\u03b2 is central to the pathogenesis of AD and that the AD brain is under significant oxidative stress were united into a comprehensive model for neurodegeneration in AD brain based on A\u03b2-associated free radical oxidative stress [5, 7, 10, 86] . Soluble, aggregated A\u03b2 is hypothesized to intercalate into neuronal membranes. There, by mechanisms that are inhibited by the antioxidant vitamin E and other antioxidants, A\u03b2-induced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation take place [5, 7, 10, 86] . Oxidative modification to key membrane molecules, resulting from reaction of the lipid peroxidation products 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) or 2-propenal (acrolein) with enzymatic, transport, or struc- Fig. 1 .

If these latter systems are oxidatively modified and, consequently, non functional, increased glutamate-induced excitotoxic death to neurons results. tural proteins, changes the structure and function of synaptic membranes, resulting in neuronal or synapse loss [4, 6] . HNE can diffuse from the site of its production [11] , which conceivably could react with and alter neuronal organelles. Nitric oxide synthase can be induced by A\u03b2. The NO that results can react at diffusion controlled rates with superoxide radical leaked from mitochondria, producing peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Peroxynitrite can, in turn, cause oxidative damage of synaptic terminals. A\u03b2 alters Ca 2+ homeostasis with implications for necrotic or apoptotic processes and neuronal death [48] . Further, increased intracellular Ca 2+ following neuronal exposure to A\u03b2 can stimulate phospholipase A2-induced free fatty acid release. Free fatty acids can, in turn, cause tau polymerization [16] or activate prostaglandin pathways [38] . A\u03b2 inhibits the function of several neuronal and glial transmembrane transport systems, including ion-motive ATPases, glutamate transporters, the glucose transporter, GTP-coupled transmembrane signaling proteins, and the polyamine transporter [23, 24, 32, 44, 45, 49, 93, 94] . Deleterious functional consequences result that can injure or kill neurons (reviewed in [7, 10] ). Fibrillar A\u03b2 can bind to receptors for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) to induce oxidative stress ( [91] and see below) and can initiate an oxidative inflammatory response from activated microglia ( [42] and see below).\nApolipoprotein E allele genotype is important in AD [35] . Inheritance of apoE allele 4 (apoE4) confers a greater risk of developing AD than does apoE2 of apoE3. A\u03b2(1-42) interacts with synaptosomes from apoE4 knock-in mice to produce more oxidative stress than such interaction with synaptosomes from apoE2 or apoE3 mice [37] , potentially coupling A\u03b2(1-42)-induced oxidative stress to a known risk factor for developing AD.\nThe principal glutamate transporter, Glt-1, is oxidatively modified by HNE in AD brain, and A\u03b2(1-42) can induce a similar effect [36] . Not only might this oxidative modification of Glt-1 explain the loss of function of this transporter in AD brain [47] , but this result again couples A\u03b2(1-42)-induced oxidative stress to a mechanism of neuronal death, in this case, excitotoxicity. Taken together with the findings that A\u03b2 inhibits glutamine synthetase activity [8] and that GS is oxidized in AD brain [25] , A\u03b2-associated, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, also a source of oxidative stress [34] , may play a role in AD neurodegeneration (Fig. 1) .\nIncreased production and deposition of A\u03b2(1-42) occurs in AD brain [72] . Given that A\u03b2(1-42) induces ROS, RNS, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA modification in neuronal or synaptosomal systems [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 30, [35] [36] [37] 81, 92] , A\u03b2(1-42) may be critically important in the oxidative stress observed in AD brain. Continued investigation of the role of A\u03b2 in oxidative stress in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in AD and animal models relevant to AD and studies to assess endogenous and exogenous antioxidants as therapeutic strategies to block A\u03b2-associated oxidative stress, should provide greater insight into the relationships among A\u03b2(1-42), oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration in AD brain."}, {"section_title": "Advanced glycation endproducts as enhancers of the acute phase responses of glial cells", "text": "The amino groups of proteins react non-enzymatically with reducing sugars, particularly on lysine residues. This posttranslational modification, termed \"nonenzymatic glycosylation\", \"glycation\" or \"Maillard reaction\" leads, via reversible Schiff-base adducts, to the formation of protein bound Amadori products. Through subsequent oxidations and dehydrations, a broad range of heterogeneous fluorescent and brown products with nitrogen-and oxygen-containing heterocycles is formed, the so-called \"Advanced Glycation Endproducts\" (AGEs). These latter reactions are irreversible and cause protease-resistant cross-linking of peptides and proteins, leading to protein deposition and amyloidosis [3] .\nDeposition of AGE-crosslinked insoluble protein aggregates (amyloidosis) is characteristic for many degenerative diseases of the elderly. Such deposits in the periphery are composed of beta-2-microglobulin (in dialysis related amyloidosis) or islet amyloid polypeptide (in Type II diabetes mellitus) [51] . In the brain, AGEs accumulate on \u00df-amyloid plaques, and in microglia and astrocytes in their vicinity [14, 41, 67, 80] . AGEs can create free radicals by chemical degradation and via activation of glial cells: (a) Direct (chemical) radical production: Glycated proteins produce nearly 50-fold more radicals than non-glycated proteins. This process commences with the production of superoxide radicals by the transition metal-catalyzed oxidation of protein-bound Amadori products, followed by the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, and the generation of hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction. (b) Production of superoxide: Interaction of AGEs with cells increases oxidative stress. This might be initiated by binding of AGEs to a cell surface receptor and subsequent diffusion of chemically produced free radicals across the membrane or by a receptor mediated signaling pathway, in which a radical producing enzyme (e.g. NADPH-oxidase) and an AGE specific receptor (RAGE) is involved. (c) Production of nitric oxide: AGEs increase nitric oxide production by induction of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) on the mRNA and protein level. This pathway is also mediated by the \"receptor for advanced glycation endproduct, RAGE\". (d) Up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines: AGE-modified proteins can elicit an acute phase response in microglial cells, generate a \"respiratory burst\" and the secretion of interleukin 1 and 6, TNF-\u03b1 or macrophage colony stimulating factor [57, 68] .\nPharmacological interference with AGE formation or signaling as a novel treatment strategy against AGEinduced oxidative stress in AD: The development of drugs for the treatment of AD remains at a very unsatisfying state. However, pharmacological approaches, which break the vicious cycles of oxidative stress and neurodegenerationoffer new opportunities for the treatment of AD. They include AGE-inhibitors, antioxidants (e.g., thioctic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, betacarotene) and anti-inflammatory substances, which not only scavenge radicals passively but interfere with signal transduction pathways thereby preventing radical production. AGE inhibitors might be able to stop formation of AGE-modified \u00df-amyloid deposits or modify their structure with subsequent loss of binding of AGEs to AGE receptors [56] . Antioxidants scavenge intracellular and extracellular superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide before these radicals damage cell constituents or activate microglia through their action as intracellular second messengers [21, 22, 55, 64] . Anti-inflammatory drugs act similarly, attenuating microglial radical and cytokine production. Positive clinical trials with the AGE-inhibitor tenilsetam [28] , the membrane permeable antioxidant lipoic acid and the anti-inflammatory compound indomethacin support this hypothesis [65] .\nWith our improving understanding of the molecular basis for the clinical symptoms of dementia, particularly positive feedback loops involving oxidative stress, elucidation of the etiologic causes will help to establish an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective treatment able to interrupt this vicious cycle of oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in AD."}, {"section_title": "Inflammatory mediators in Alzheimer's disease", "text": "A large number of epidemiological studies have addressed the possible protective effect of antiinflammatory drug use with regard to AD [50] . The most convincing of these studies -the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging -utilized data collected prospectively, thereby minimizing recall bias issues. Corroborated by related studies, their results indicated a protective effect from the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [82] . Moreover, recent epidemiological evidence further confirmed that longterm use of NSAIDs may protect against AD but not against vascular dementia [87] . Available intervention studies support the beneficial efficacy of NSAIDs in AD. One small controlled trial of the NSAID indomethacin suggested that the drug slowed cognitive deterioration [65] . Recently, a small controlled trial of diclofenac showed similar results (though not statistically significant because of a high drop-out rate) [69] .\nEvidence indicates inflammatory mechanisms are activated in AD. For example, it has been found that amyloid plaques are surrounded by reactive microglia (as well as astrocytes) which have the characteristics of antigen-presenting tissue macrophages, including HLA-DR surface markers. In addition, there is clear evidence of an acute phase response [85] , with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, accompanied by an increase in acute phase proteins such as \u03b11-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and \u03b12 macroglobulin (\u03b12 MAC). Further, there is an active complement system in the AD brain [62] with generation of the lytic membrane attack complex [88] and, presumably, with release of anaphylatoxins. Finally, up-regulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, but not COX-1, in AD neu-rons [60] suggests that inflammatory lipids may also be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [60] . However, it remains uncertain whether the inflammatory mechanisms actually cause damage in AD or are merely present to remove the debris of the neurodegenerative events [1, 61] ."}, {"section_title": "Interleukin-1 and Alzheimer neurodegeneration", "text": "The first evidence of a glia-mediated immune process underlying the progression of Alzheimer-type neuropathological changes was reported in 1989, when it was shown that activated microglia overexpress IL-1, a potent immune response-generating cytokine, in Alzheimer's disease [18] , and shown in cell culture that IL-1 regulates the synthesis of \u03b2APP [17] . At that time, it was suggested that multifarious effectors of glial activation, resulting in overexpression of glial cytokines such as IL-1, could set in motion cascades that would, with the passage of time, become self propagating and result in perpetuation of Alzheimer-type neuropathological changes (Fig. 2) . In support of this, IL-1 and several other glia-derived cytokines, including neuritogenic S100\u03b2, are overexpressed by a profusion of activated microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in Alzheimer brain. These are also overexpressed in fetuses, neonates, infants, children, and adults with Down's syndrome (a condition where the entire array of Alzheimer-type changes accumulates gradually over the course of a few decades) and in head injury (known to increase risk for later development of Alzheimer's disease [53] ). In Alzheimer's disease this overexpression correlates with the genesis and progression of A\u03b2 plaques with regard to their conversion from diffuse non-neuritic plaques to the neuritic plaques diagnostic of Alzheimer's disease [19, 54, 76] . Overexpression of both IL-1 and S100\u03b2 are also directly related to formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease [77] , and increasing the levels of IL-1 in brain induces growth of dystrophic neurites expressing elevated levels of phosphorylated tau and neurofilament protein [74] . In addition to upregulation of S100\u03b2 [75] , ApoE [13] , complement pathways [66] , and iNOS [84] , IL-1 induces synthesis of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) mRNA and increases AChE activity in culture and intact brain [39] . In Alzheimer brain, microglial IL-1 elevation correlates with synthesis of neuronal MAPKp38, a signal transcription factor that in turn upregulates IL-1 and phosphorylates tau at specific sites that are phosphorylated in paired helical filament tau [71, 73] . To explain, at least in part the role of aging in Alzheimer pathogenesis, IL-1 expression increases with age in normal human brain [78] . The discovery of an association between risk for Alzheimer's disease and specific polymorphisms in IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2 genes, polymorphisms that give rise to IL-1 overexpression [15, 20, 58, 63] adds further credence to the idea of a seminal role for IL-1 in Alzheimer pathogenesis. This supporting evidence for a principle role for IL-1 in the genesis and progression of Alzheimer neuropathological changes does not rule out important roles for other events and agents, rather it furnishes a unifying theory as IL-1 sits at the crossroads of so many of the cascades that are important in Alzheimer's disease (Fig. 2) ."}, {"section_title": "The role of inflammation in the clinical", "text": "progression of Alzheimer's disease dementia."}, {"section_title": "Implications for the role of cyclooxygenase", "text": "Prior studies have shown that COX-2, an enzyme involved in inflammatory mechanisms as well as neuronal activities [61] , is up-regulated in the AD brain and may represent a therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory treatments [26] . COX exists in two isoforms, coded by distinct genes on different chromosomes [12, 33, 59] . The two isoforms show about 50% homology and have similar catalytic activity, but are physiologically distinct. COX-2 is inducible in inflammatory cells in response to inflammatory signals such as cytokines and lipopolysaccharide, and is down regulated by glucocorticoids. In contrast, COX-1 expression is generally constitutive. It thus appears that COX-2 mediates in-flammatory activity, while COX-1 has housekeeping functions, including gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation.\nRecent evidence suggests that different indices of classical inflammatory cascades may have distinct associations with different phases of the clinical progression of AD, as reflected in the clinical dementia rating (CDR) [43] . For example, COX-2 (but not COX-1) expression in the neurons of the hippocampal formation, a brain region at risk for AD neurodegeneration, may be a predictor of progression of very early AD before neurodegeneration may occur [27] . Surprisingly, and contrary to COX-2, other classical markers of inflammatory neurodegeneration, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 [43] , HLA-DR immunopositive reactive microglia and complement components gene expression [90] showed increased expression, but only at the latest stages of AD dementia.\nThe evidence showing elevation of COX-2 protein content in neurons of the hippocampal formation early in AD dementia suggests that independent segments of inflammatory cascades may play important and possibly independent roles in separate phases of the disease, and ultimately influencing the progression of AD dementia [27] . Given these findings, anti-inflammatory drugs selected for studies of AD patients at a particular clinical stage should be selected based on their activity against the inflammatory processes most pronounced at that stage; for example, using COX-2 inhibitors in the early phase of AD. Thus, the identification of specific early markers involved in destructive brain inflammation would therefore provide critically important selection criterion, and/or possible covariance, for clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs.\nThe frequency of A\u03b2 plaque deposits in APPswe overexpressing transgenic mice that develop AD pathology [29] is reduced by treatment with ibuprofen, a non selective COX inhibitor [40] . Interestingly, recent studies suggested that non selective COX inhibitors may preferentially decrease the levels of the highly amyloidogenic A\u03b242 peptide (the 42-residue isoform of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide) produced from a variety of cultured cells and that some NSAIDs (sulindac) uses a novel mechanisms independently of COX activity [89] . This is of high interest especially in view of the recent evidence showing that COX-2 may also promote amyloidosis in a mouse model of AD pathology in age dependent manner (Pasinetti, unpublished observation) . For example, in was found that at 24 months, but not 12 and 16 months of age, expression of APPswe / PS1-A246E and human COX-2 in the brain showed a > 2 fold elevation of A\u03b2 (6E10) immunopositive plaques in frontal cortex and hippocampal formation, compared to APPswe / PS1-A246E double-transgenics [90] . Most importantly, Pasinetti and his collaborator found that the number of amyloid deposits in the brain of the APPswe / PS1-A246E / hCOX-2 is also reflected by a commensurate elevation of Congo-red birefringence. Thus, COX-2 expression in the brain (COX-1 ?) may play an important role in AD amyloid pathology independent of classical inflammatory cascades and might be a target of NSAIDs (Fig. 3) ."}, {"section_title": "A future for anti-inflammatory therapies in AD", "text": "In addition to studies of A\u03b2 vaccination therapy [2, 52, 70, 79, 83] major efforts are now under way to determine whether COX inhibitors can help control the destructive progression of AD. Large National Institute of Health (NIH)-supported trials are evaluating whether selective COX-2 inhibitors, or low-dose non-selective NSAIDs, can delay the diagnosis of AD. Industrysponsored trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors currently target individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Additional trials are in the planning stages as new COX inhibitors continue to be developed. Further elucidation of the role of COX in various clinical stages of AD defined by the clinical dementia rating will clearly aid the clinical design of such trials. As discussed above, the elevation of neuronal COX-2 expression during the early phase (mild dementia) of the clinical progression of AD dementia might set favorable conditions for later inflammatory neurodegenerative conditions. This would be consistent with the apparent early upregulation of COX-2 in neurons of the AD brain, prior to an elevation of cytokine (e.g. IL-6, TGF-\u03b21) expression [43] or amyloid deposition in a mouse model of AD neuropathology (Xiang et al., in preparation). The recent evidence indicating that NSAIDs may play an important role in A\u03b2 lowering mechanisms and that COX-2 may promote amyloidosis in the brain [90] provides new important leads in the understanding of the role of NSAIDs in AD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This team of researchers suggest that A\u03b2(1-42)-associated oxidative stress and amyloid pathologyinduced inflammatory cascades may be of critical im- portance in the oxidative stress under which the AD brain exists and to the synapse loss and neuronal death found in AD brain. The precise molecular mechanisms for these phenomena remain yet to be elucidated. However, the influence of lipid peroxidation products, such as hydroxynonenal, on key transport proteins, with consequent inhibition of function, may give insight into molecular mechanisms for neuronal and synapse loss in AD brain. Moreover, given that methionine residue 35 is essential for the oxidative stress and neurotoxic properties of A\u03b2(1-42) [10] , genetic manipulation of the APP gene in transgenic animal models of AD may provide additional insight into the importance of methionine of A\u03b2 in neurodegeneration in AD. The role of exogenous and endogenous antioxidants in modulating the oxidative and neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2 and slowing the progression of AD will be a fruitful area of research. Finally, neuroinflammatory cascades and means to modulate their effects are other future directions of research that may be promising for the treatment and/or prevention of AD. Care to address the correct anti-inflammatory paradigm as a function of disease stage will be required. All these avenues of research are currently underway in one or more of the authors' laboratories."}]
