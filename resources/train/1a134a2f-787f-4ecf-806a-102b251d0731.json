Brain hubs are brain regions that have a large number of both within and between module connections. We argue that weak connections in brain functional networks lead to misclassification of brain regions as hubs. In order to resolve this, we propose a new measure called ambivert degree that considers the node's degree as well as connection weights in order to identify nodes with both high degree and high connection weights as hubs. Using resting-state functional MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project, we show that ambivert degree identifies brain hubs that are not only crucial but also invariable across subjects. We hypothesize that nodal measures based on ambivert degree can be effectively used to classify patients from healthy controls for diseases that are known to have widespread hub disruption. Using patient data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder, we show that the hubs in the patient and healthy groups are very different for both the diseases and deep feedforward neural networks trained on nodal hub features lead to a significantly higher classification accuracy with significantly fewer trainable weights compared to using functional connectivity features. Thus, the ambivert degree improves identification of crucial brain hubs in healthy subjects and can be used as a diagnostic feature to detect neurological diseases characterized by hub disruption."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Evidence from several anatomical, physiological and neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain is composed of functionally diverse systems coordinating distinct inputs that result in cognition and behavior . While functional specialization is a key organization principle in the brain, there is increasing evidence of significant dynamic integration among functional regions in order to perform cognitive tasks as diverse as language perception (Friederici and Gierhan, 2013) and vision (Behrmann and Plaut, 2013) . This integration or \"coming together\" of specialized brain regions depends on information flow between neurons in these regions, which is coordinated by a specific set of regions. These integrative 1 This work was partially supported by AcRF Tier 1 grant RG149/17 of Ministry of Education, Singapore.

Previous studies indicate that human brain connectome incorporates properties that promote functional specialization with a modular structure (for review refer to Sporns and Betzel (2016) ) and efficient communication by virtue of network hubs (for review refer to van den Heuvel and Sporns (2013) ). A recent study found that hubs are differentiated into three classes based on their connectivity to different functional modules (Gordon et al., 2018) and were shown to modulate different tasks. The central role of hubs in information processing makes their identification an important research problem.\nBrain hubs were initially characterized by the nodes having large numbers of connections to other networks, that is, nodes having high nodal degrees (Buckner et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2010; Tomasi and Volkow, 2011) . However, later studies argued that since the brain modules had heterogeneous sizes and nodes had high within-module connections, simply taking the nodal degree would lead to giving undue weightage to nodes from large modules (usually the default mode network) . Therefore, the nodes with high degree in comparison to the nodes in the same module were considered crucial for intra-modular communication and were termed as modular hubs. Conversely, the participation coefficient, a measure that quantifies the extent a node connects to other modules was proposed to detect heteromodal nodes facilitating inter-modular communication known as connector hubs Nicolini et al., 2017; Gordon et al., 2018) . The weighted average of scores derived from the two measures identified nodes with high intra-modular degree and heterogeneous connections often termed as network hubs.\nStudies involving brain functional networks involve network sparsification steps that remove weak brain functional connections that are affected by experimental noise (van den Heuvel and Fornito, 2014) . However, this affects not only the number of weak connections in the network but also the network's underlying modular structure . This can in turn affect the detection of network hubs because (i) disruption of brain modular structure leads to spurious detection of hubs; and (ii) a node may possess a very large number of weak connections and still be classified as a hub whereas a node with fewer but stronger connections may be ignored. In order to account for (i), we use the thresholding scheme proposed by Bordier et al. (Bordier et al., 2017) , which preserves the network's modular structure; and (ii), we propose a new measure called ambivert degree that considers both the nodal degree and the strength of connections. We also consider an extension of the participation coefficient, called gateway coefficient that considers information about the importance of a node's neighbors in their module and the uniqueness of the node's inter-modular connections (Vargas and Wahl, 2014) . Considering both of these measures, we provide a new definition for brain functional hubs and study their importance in processing information in resting state brain functional networks of the 589 subjects from the HCP. By considering the effect of inducing artificial lesions in the brain functional networks, we found that the ambivert degree gives the most crucial modular hubs and instead of a node's intra-modular degree (as previously thought), the ambivert degree combined with participation coefficient gives the most crucial network hubs.\nHubs are known to support brain information processing and alterations in the functional connectivity of hubs have global effect on brain network and function. (Gratton et al., 2012; Fornito et al., 2015) . Previous research has shown that various neurological ailments such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Guillon et al., 2017) , Schizophrenia (Rubinov et al., 2013; Bordier et al., 2018) , and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Itahashi et al., 2014) affect brain functional hubs disproportionately and more than the other brain regions. These disruptions reflected in hub connectivity could be a result of the high information processing at the hub regions, causing high baseline activity and metabolic requirements of hub regions (Liang et al., 2013; Tomasi et al., 2013) leaving the hub neurons vulnerable to metabolic stress or degeration due to high activity (Saxena and Caroni, 2011) . In case of ASD, a developmental disorder characterized by a range of heterogeneous symptoms with varying degrees of severity, multiple resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies have found widespread impairment in intrinsic functional connectivity (for a review, see Hull et al. (2017) ), especially in the hubs (Itahashi et al., 2014) . Similarly, research suggests that highly active heteromodal regions are preferentially affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Buckner et al. (Buckner et al., 2009 ) used node degree centrality to define brain hubs and demonstrated that these hubs of healthy human brains overlap with regions showing higher A\u03b2 deposition in patients with AD. Willem et al. (de Haan et al., 2012) found that excessive neuronal activity that led to degeneration provides a possible explanation for hub vulnerability in AD. The Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) cascade hypothesis suggests that A\u03b2 have a toxic effect on adjacent neurons and synapses, disrupting their normal functioning (Sheline and Raichle, 2013) in AD.\nBased on prior studies, we hypothesized that nodal hub scores can be used to classify AD and ASD subjects from their respective healthy subject cohort. We apply our methods on rs-fMRI data for AD and ASD subjects to demonstrate how brain hubs can aid in diagnosis of brain diseases. We chose these AD and ASD for our analysis because of existing evidences of hub disruptions and availability of large sets of data for deep neural network modeling. We detected brain hubs from the functional scans and found that the brain hubs of AD and ASD patients were different from cognitively normal controls. Using both the nodal hub scores and functional connectivity as input features, we trained neural networks and SVM classifiers, and show that using hub scores gave a significantly higher classification accuracy with a much lower number of trainable weights."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Let G = (\u2126, W ) denote the functional brain network (connectome) where \u2126 denotes the set of brain regions of interest (ROI) or nodes and W = {w ij } is the matrix of edge weights of the network with w i,j denoting the weight between brain ROI i and j, and i, j \u2208 \u2126."}, {"section_title": "Detecting brain functional modules", "text": "While some previous studies detected brain modules and hubs by using subject averaged functional connectivity matrix (Bertolero et al., 2017; Nicolini et al., 2017) , there are multiple studies pointing out varied individual differences in the functional connectome (Gordon et al., 2017) . Therefore, inter-subject differences in functional architecture need to be considered while detecting functional modules (and subsequently network hubs) and combined group results from all the subjects need to be reported (Gordon et al., 2018) . We, therefore, use the Iterative Consensus Spectral Clustering (ICSC) algorithm ) that maximizes the similarity between group-level and subject-level modules, iterativly making them more similar.\nThe ICSC algorithm finds a modularization that groups of brain ROI into modules where connectivity among ROIs within modules are higher than connectivity with other ROIs. The ICSC minimizes the normalizedcut objective function to detect subject-level modularizations W k of subject k. The group-level modularization S is obtained by performing consensus clustering on the subject-level modules (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2012) . The ICSC algorithm then greedily refines the subject-level modularizations such that they are most similar to the group-level modularization by maximizing\nwhere the Adjusted Mutual Information is used to measure similarity between modularizations. The newly obtained subject-level modularizations are used to derive grouplevel modularizations using consensus clustering and so on, till there is no change in the similarity cost function given by (1). Upon obtaining subject-level modularizations from ICSC, modular labels assigned to nodes for each subject were aligned with those at the group-level modularization. We align the subject-level modules, S k , with the group-level modules S by using the Jaccard Index (JI) matching scheme (Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2012) . A module with index b in S k is assigned to a grouplevel module label a if for both the group-level module a, JI(a, b) > JI(a, c) c\u2208S k \\b and subject-level module b, JI(b, a) > JI(b, c) c\u2208S\\b ."}, {"section_title": "Thresholding connections", "text": "While our modularization method considers weighted unthresholded subject-level networks, weak connections that are most influenced by experimental noise (Birn, 2012; van den Heuvel and Fornito, 2014) need to be removed for further analysis. Researchers often select an a priori density for the network and compute a threshold that retains the target density of edges (Gordon et al., 2018; Bertolero et al., 2017; . Analyses over a range of densities have been performed to show the stability of derived topological features over a range of thresholds. However, weak correlations could still contain significant functional information, and therefore it is important to use methods that identify the optimal trade-off between the information gain by the removal of noisy edges and the loss due to removal of potentially useful weak edges. Bordier et al. used synthetic networks with known modular structure and noise similar to brain functional networks and showed that percolation analysis (Gallos et al., 2012) , retains the minimum number of edges to keep the network connected while maximizing information on brain functional networks' modular structure. Also, fixing the same edge density in brain functional networks of subject-groups may lead to inclusion of weak and spurious connections in a subject-group with disrupted functional connectivity and omission of strong connections in another subject-group. The latter becomes especially significant in our case since we perform analysis at the subject-level rather than at a group level. We perform percolation analysis on each subject's functional network to determine the optimal threshold t for weights and assign zero weights for connections with weights less than t."}, {"section_title": "Modular hubs", "text": "The brain regions most critical for information processing within a brain module are known as modular hubs.

These nodes can be thought to be extroverts in social networks, i.e., nodes with a large number of weak ties to other nodes. We, on the other hand, are interested in ambiverts, i.e., nodes that not only connect with a sufficiently large number of nodes but also share meaningful relationships with them. For this purpose, we propose a measure called ambivert degree that identifies high intra-modular degree nodes that are synchronized with multiple nodes in the same module.

Detecting AD and ASD using ambivert degree and participation coefficient of nodes as features Previous studies have shown evidence of hub disruption in several brain diseases including AD Guillon et al. (2017) and ASD Itahashi et al. (2014) .

In order to investigate this, we obtained data of patients suffering from AD and ASD (along with their healthy age matched controls) and used deep neural networks (DNN) to classify patients and healthy subjects by using hub measures of functional nodes as input features.

Artificial lesioning to identify the most crucial modular and network hubs Previous studies assumed that the most crucial modular hubs are nodes with a high intra-modular degree Nicolini et al., 2017) . We tested this assumption since finding nodes that were more crucial to inter-modular communication could also lead to detection 2 www.tensorflow.org of crucial nodes responsible for overall network communication. We computed the intra-modular degree \u03b8 i,S , the ambivert degree \u03b1 i,S , and the betweenness centrality \u03b2 i,S for nodes in all subjects. Following the approach of (Bertolero et al., 2015; Gratton et al., 2016) we classified different percentile of nodes as modular hubs, ranging from top 2.5% to 20% (in steps of 2.5%) and inspected the change in the modular path length l on their removal for a thorough analysis. In order to determine which hubs were the most crucial, we performed Tukey's paired t-test on the path length of the network after removal of the hubs.\nWe performed the above set of experiments on all subjects after performing thresholding using percolation analysis. We found that for all the modules except the attention, motor, and salience modules, removal of nodes with a high ambivert degree led to a significantly higher increase in the modular path length (paired t-test p < 0.05) than removal of nodes with high intra-modular degree or betweenness centrality (refer Figure 2) . After the ambivert degree, the intra-modular degree gave the most crucial modular hubs.\nSince the ambivert degree gives more crucial modular hubs than those detected by intra-modular degree and betweenness centrality, we hypothesize that considering nodes with high ambivert degree, taking into weaker connections into considerations, as modular hub measure would yield more important overall brain network hubs. This hypothesis for each subject's network tested by computing network hub measures and removed the nodes with top 20% scores (in steps of 2.5%) and inspected the change in the network path length l upon their removal.\nTo understand which hub measure gives the most crucial, we first compared the path length of different types of connector hubs with the same modular hubs. For modular hubs detected by different measures, we found that participation coefficient had a similar or larger impact on the path length than different gateway coefficient measures (Supplementary Figure S1) . We, therefore, compared the effect of removal of modular hubs only along with their participation coefficient on the network path length since these represented the most crucial network hubs detected using different modular hub measures (Fig. 3) . We found that the removal of network hubs detected by ambivert degree led to a statistically significant higher increase in network path length than the removal of hubs detected by betweenness centrality (paired t-test p-value < 10 \u22129 ), and intra-modular degree (paired t-test p-value < 10 \u221245 ).\nWe also computed the inter-subject variability of network hubs across subjects, detected by different modular hub measures. For a complete analysis, we determined the hub variability across different percentiles ranging from 80 to 97.5 (with steps of 2.5). On comparison of variability of hubs detected by ambivert degree with betweenness centrality and intra-modular degree, we found that ambivert degree found the hubs that are most invariable across subjects.

For AD, we found that the network hubs were disrupted for regions in the middle and medial temporal gyrus, frontal orbital lobe, and occipital lobe (table 1) whereas for ASD we found that regions in the thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor areas were most affected (table 2).\nNumerous studies have investigated the changes in the brain functional and structural networks caused by AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment Dai et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013; Meszl\u00e9nyi et al., 2017) , specifically the disruption of brain hubs (Buckner et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2014; Mutlu et al., 2017) . The changes in modular structure with cognitive decline and AD has been extensively studied with major alterations being reported in the default mode network, the salience network, and the fronto-parietal control network (Weiler et al., 2014; Brier et al., 2012; Dickerson and Sperling, 2009) . Similarly, alterations in modular structure have been reported for ASD (Padmanabhan et al., 2017; Zielinski et al., 2012) . Therefore, the modular structure of functional networks needs to be considered while detection of hubs, but previous studies investigating disruption of hubs in diseases either used traditional thresholding methods and did not consider preservation of network modular structure or used the global degree as a measure to find network hubs (Buckner et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2014; Mutlu et al., 2017; Itahashi et al., 2014) , thus giving biased results. This warranted a fresh look at the disruption of hubs in the functional networks derived from AD and ASD subjects.\nThe hubs detected for the CN subjects from the disease datatsets are different from the healthy subject group from the HCP dataset. Besides factors like different scanner acquisition protocol, preprocessing, and gender ratio of participants the difference in network hubs between HCP subject cohort and CN subject cohorts (from the ADNI and ABIDE) can be primarily attributed to the difference in the age of the participants (Tomasi and Volkow, 2012; Yang et al., 2016) . The average ages for HCP, ADNI CN, and ABIDE CN participant cohorts are 28.3 years, 76.6 years, and 15.8 years, respectively. On computing hubs of subjects suffering from AD and ASD, we found that the network hubs for the patients were different from those for CN subject-group. Specifically, the hubs in the medial and inferior temporal lobe, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex in the CN subject group were found to be disrupted in the AD subject group. Atrophy in the medial temporal lobe has long been shown to be a biomarker for AD whereas the functional connectivity of the precuneus with the default mode network and posterior cingulate cortex with the ventral attention network is known to be disrupted in AD patients (Klaassens et al., 2017; Yamashita et al., 2019) which validates our findings. Similarly, our results for hub disruptions in ASD subject group were corroborated by multiple previous studies, where disruption in connectivity of the angular gyrus (Zielinski et al., 2012; Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008; Padmanabhan et al., 2017) and precuneus (Zielinski et al., 2012; Itahashi et al., 2014; Padmanabhan et al., 2017) regions participating in the DMN have been studied and alterations of both functional and structural fibers in the anterior cingulum (Itahashi et al., 2014; de Lacy et al., 2017; Ikuta et al., 2014; Jou et al., 2011; Thakkar et al., 2008) have been reported."}, {"section_title": "Classification of patients and healthy controls", "text": "We hypothesize that as there is widespread hub disruption in the patients suffering from AD and ASD, hub measures can be used as features to train deep neural networks to classify patients and healthy controls. We therefore used each node's ambivert degree (z-score) and participation coefficient as features to perform classification with deep neural networks (DNN). The performance was also 2: The changes in path lengths of brain functional modules after artificial lesioning of modular hubs detected by different hub measures. Except the motor, attention and salience modules the removal of hubs detected by the ambivert degree led to significantly greater increase in path than the other modular hubs. The memory retrieval module was excluded from the analysis because it was found in fewer than 50 subjects.\ncompared with a classifier trained on functional connectivity features from each subject's unthresholded connectivity matrix W . Since W is symmetric, we formed a vector of its lower triangular elements, which results in a vector of 34716 functional connectivity features for each subject.\nFor DNN, we empirically set the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, batch size, and learning rate in the experiments. We added dropouts to the hidden layers and imposed early stopping criteria to prevent overfitting. For SVMs, we experimented with a range of parameters (C \u2208 {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10}, \u03b3 \u2208 {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1}) and different kernels. The best hyperparameters were selected by performing a grid search on the average accuracy of different folds obtained from 5fold cross validation.\nThe performance of the 5-layer DNN along with the best SVM model for different kernels are shown in Tables 3 and 4. All samples were included in the test set at least once and the experiment was repeated for 10 random seeds. We observed that the highest accuracy for both AD and ASD were obtained for a 3 hidden layer feedforward DNN using ambivert degree and participation coefficient as features. The SVM models gave a consistently poor classification accuracy. The improvement in classification accuracy by using hub score features in comparison to functional connectivity features was statistically significant for both AD (one tailed t-test, p-value = 0.0048) and ASD (one tailed t-test, p-value = 0.045). We also observed that usage of hub scores (that is, the sum of ambivert degree and participation coefficient) as features led to a significant increase in classification accuracy for ASD in comparison to their individual usage, which means that both measures carry crucial information."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "4.1. Considering brain functional modules while detecting network hubs Multiple studies have shown the modular nature of brain's functional architecture with regions in the same modules having high synchronization with each other and thus high corresponding functional connectivity (Sporns and Betzel, 2016) . It has also been shown that modules in brain functional networks have heterogeneous sizes (Gupta and Rajapakse, 2018; Nicolini and Bifone, 2016) , leading to higher degree for nodes in a large module and vice versa . Therefore, if only global degree of a node is considered to detect hubs, nodes in large modules would be invariably favored , making it imperative to detect hubs at a modular level, considering the inherent brain functional modular structure.\nA weak connection signifies weak correlation between neuronal activity of the brain regions involved, which in turn points to low probability of signaling and communication between neurons in the regions. However, several studies have pointed out the importance of considering weak functional correlations while analyzing brain functional networks (Santarnecchi et al., 2014; Cole et al., 2012; Bassett et al., 2012) . Therefore, weak connections should be given due importance while computing brain functional network topology. In order to account for this, previous studies detecting modular hubs have thresholded the networks such that only a fraction of initial connections in the network are retained. However, thresholding strategies used in previous studies do not consider whether the underlying modular structure in functional networks is preserved. We took several measures to consider the modular architecture and considered the effect of weak connections on detection of hubs: (i) we used the ICSC algorithm which performs modularization on unthresholded networks; (ii) while computing network hub metrics, we used percolation analysis (Gallos et al., 2012) to find the threshold which preserves modular structure in brain functional networks ; and (iii) we proposed a new measure called the ambivert degree that incorporates the average weight per connection information to the node's intra-modular degree.\nUsing the ICSC algorithm, we detected 19 group-level modules that corresponded to well-known functional systems. On performing percolation analysis, we found that The size and color of the node correspond to its inter-subject variability and its functional module, respectively. even the functional networks derived from HCP subjects, which were in a narrow age range (mean 28.3 \u00b1 3.7) and acquired on the same scanner with an average signal-to-noise ratio of 728, have a varied percentage threshold (mean 75.6 \u00b1 10.3). Previous studies studying subject networks (Gordon et al., 2018) did not consider this, since they performed their analysis using the same percentage threshold for all subjects."}, {"section_title": "Using ambivert degree to detect modular and network hubs", "text": "We compare the detection of modular hubs for within module processing by using intra-modular degree, ambivert degree and betweenness centrality. We systematically analyzed the importance of nodes for intra-modular processing and global network processing by performing artificial lesioning where we remove a range of hubs and observe changes in the modular or network path length. We found that ambivert degree gives significantly more crucial modular hubs across different thresholds. At the global network level, we found that hubs detected by combining ambivert degree and participation coefficients are significantly more crucial than network hubs detected by intra-modular degree and betweeness centrality. It is to be noted that the gateway coefficient, an extension of the participation coefficient introduced to detect better connector hubs (Vargas and Wahl, 2014) did not have a significant impact on detecting crucial network hubs. This means that as long as the degree and weight per connection are being considered to derive network hubs, the participation coefficient is sufficient to detect network hubs.\nThe variability in hub locations is a by-product of widespread inter-subject variation prevalent in brain functional architecture. However, since we considered fMRI scans of healthy subjects in a narrow age range from the same scanner, the location of hubs should be relatively stable over subjects. On studying the variability of network hubs over multiple subjects, we found that while the hubs detected by ambivert degree hubs were more invariable than those detected by betweenness centrality significantly and intra-modular degree insignificantly.\nSince many previous studies have reported nodes with high intra-modular degree and participation coefficient as functional brain hubs Nicolini et al., 2017) , it is important to understand the differences in anatomical locations of these hubs and the network hubs characterized by ambivert degree and participation coefficients. We found that regions from the middle frontal gyrus (L) and superior temporal gyrus (R) which were classified as brain hubs using the old scheme are dropped, and instead regions from the cuneus (L), middle occipital gyrus (R) and inferior parietal lobe are added (Supplementary figure S2 ). While newly detected regions are known to be primarily involved in the dorsal and the ventral stream visual processing (Milner and Goodale, 2008) , recent studies have also pointed to the role of the cuneus for internal directed attention activity in the brain during resting state (Benedek et al., 2016 (Benedek et al., , 2018 .

For (a) the subjects suffer from Alzheimer's Disease (AD); and for (b) the subjects suffer from Autism Spectrum Disorder. The regions in red were identified as hubs in the diseased subjects but not in CN subjects whereas the regions in green were identified as hubs in CN subjects but not in the diseased subjects."}, {"section_title": "Brain hubs as diagnostic features for AD and ASD", "text": "We hypothesized that the disruption of hubs in AD and ASD can be used as a potential diagnostic tool for detecting these diseases. Using multiple machine learning models, we found that a 3 hidden layer feedforward DNN using nodal hub measures as features were capable of detecting AD and ASD patients from CN subjects with an accuracy of 81% and 74%, respectively. We also found that combining both the inter-modular and intra-modular hub measures improves the classification accuracy.\nPrevious studies in the area have used functional connectivity measures (Ju et al., 2019; Iidaka, 2015; Wang et al., 2012) or additional graph measures (Khazaee et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013) to perform classification of AD and ASD. The large number of training features not only causes overfitting of the models because of few available training samples but also uses high resources due to the large number of trainable weights . In this study, we employed novel hub features including ambivert degree features for AD and ASD and demonstrated their use as diagnostic features for diseases.

Previous studies did not consider the effect of weak connections and modular structure for detection of functional hubs. Using artificial lesioning, we showed that weak connections in the weighted brain functional networks can lead to the detection of sub-optimal hubs, and the newly proposed measure, ambivert degree, detect hubs that are more crucial for both intra-modular and whole network information processing. We use the ambivert degree to find widespread perturbation in the hubs in AD and ASD patients. We used this property to develop effective classifiers for these diseases and showed that these classifiers perform significantly better than functional connectivity based classifiers, with negligible number of trainable weights in comparison. The affected hubs detected by our methods could be used as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases where hub disruption is a hallmark."}]
