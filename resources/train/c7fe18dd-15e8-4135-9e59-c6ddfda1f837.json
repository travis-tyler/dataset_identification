[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "In contrast to most industrialized countries, where paid maternity leave can extend to more than a year (European Industrial Relations Observatory, 2004), in the United States, almost a third of new mothers who worked during pregnancy return to work within three months of childbirth (Klerman & Leibowitz, 1994) . Although the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 guarantees 12 weeks of leave for eligible parents (both mothers and fathers), only about 46% of the private sector workforce is entitled to FMLA benefits, and the mandated leave is unpaid (Kammerman, 2000 ; Cantor, Waldfogel, Kerwin, Wright, Levin, Rauch et al., 2001). As a result, many families, particularly low-income families, cannot take advantage of this policy. Moreover, changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and other tax policies, and the passage of welfare reform legislation in 1996, explicitly encourage low-income mothers of infants to enter the workforce .\nGiven that public policies in the U.S. do not support long periods of family leave after childbirth, particularly for low-income families, it is critical to understand how length of family leave during the first year after childbirth affects families' health and wellbeing. If employment detracts from the quality and quantity of time parents spend caring for their families and for themselves, returning to work during the first year, particularly after a short leave, may have detrimental effects on the health and wellbeing of both mothers and children. Alternatively, if employment brings psychic benefits to the parent and additional income to the family, mothers and children may benefit through increases in material resources and higher quality of time spent together.\nRecent studies indicate that short maternity leave, and, more generally, full-time maternal employment during the first year of life, detract from children's health, cognitive development, and behavioral outcomes (Baum, 2003; Blau & Grossberg, 1992 (Belsky, 1988) . The mother's health and health behaviors can be important routes, perhaps the most important routes aside from child care arrangements, through which infants are affected by parents' employment decisions.\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the association between family leave length (leave taking by mothers and fathers after childbirth) and behavioral and physical health outcomes among new mothers. Data come from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative sample of 14,000 children born in 2001 and followed until kindergarten entry. We focus on a sample of ECLS-B mothers from the first wave of the survey who had worked during pregnancy and who had returned to work by the time of first follow-up interview, which was conducted about 9 months after childbirth. When examining the effects of paternal leave, we further restrict this sample to mothers who were married at the time of the first follow-up interview. The maternal health outcomes of interest are measures of depression, overall health status, and substance use. We use a standard OLS as well as an instrumental variables approach with county-level employment conditions and state-level maternity leave policies as identifying instruments. The IV approach accounts for the possibility of reverse causality (e.g., post-partum health affecting parental leave decisions) and also for the possibility that employment decisions after childbirth are correlated with unobserved factors that influence maternal health outcomes.\nOur OLS findings indicate that for mothers who worked prior to childbirth and who return to work in the first year, longer maternity leave length is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms as well as improvements in overall health status. The magnitudes of these effects are small, most likely because health outcomes are measured about 9 months after childbirth when many mothers may have started to recover from early health problems. Our findings suggest that doubling total maternal leave length from 9 weeks (the sample average) to 18 weeks (a length more typical of European nations) would reduce maternal depressive symptoms by about 5 percent, would reduce the likelihood of mothers' experiencing severe depression by 1 percent, and would reduce the likelihood of mothers' reporting overall poor/fair health status by 1 percent. We report similar results for the length of paid maternal leave. Among married mothers, we find that having a spouse that did not take any paternal leave after childbirth is associated with higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms. We do not find, however, that length of paternal leave is associated with maternal health, and we find only mixed evidence that family leave length after childbirth affects maternal alcohol use and smoking behaviors."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": "Maternity leave length and maternal and child outcomes"}, {"section_title": "A. Early maternal employment, maternity leave length, and children's outcomes", "text": "There are several distinct literatures on the effects of maternal employment during the first year on child outcomes. One literature, which assesses the effects of working in the first year versus working later or not working, includes two sub-sets -studies based on econometric models that address selection issues, and studies based on psychological models that focus more on process and measurement. Studies from both these literatures generally indicate that working full-time in the first 9 to 12 months of a child's life increases the frequency of child behavior problems as well as detracts from the child's long-term cognitive outcomes, such as school readiness, verbal ability, and test (Han, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "B. Maternal employment after childbirth and maternal health outcomes", "text": "Almost all prior research has focused on the effects of early maternal employment on children's health and wellbeing, and there is much less research on how mothers' own health and health behaviors may be affected as well. In the present study, two of our maternal outcome measures are depression. We focus on depression as a maternal health outcome because of the high prevalence of this condition among new mothers, and because of its important effects on children's health and wellbeing.\nAbout 10-20 percent of mothers of infants develop depression within six months of delivery (Miller, 2002 To the best of our knowledge, in the economics literature the only paper that focuses on maternal employment and maternal health is our own prior work on the effect length of maternity leave on maternal wellbeing, which is based on a sample of mothers who were employed prior to childbirth and who returned to work during the first year (Chatterji & Markowitz, 2005) . Data for this study come from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS). Two measures of depression and a measure of outpatient health visits are used to represent maternal health.\nOrdinary least squares models provide baseline estimates, and instrumental variables models, with state-level maternity leave policies as identifying variables, account for the potential endogeneity of maternity leave length. The findings suggest that longer maternity leave is associated with a reduction in the number or frequency of maternal depressive symptoms. There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence that longer maternity leave also is associated with mother's lower probability of being a likely case of clinical depression, and a lower likelihood of having frequent outpatient visits during the first six months after childbirth. The present study builds on prior work, including our own, in two ways. First, this study is more informative for current policy decisions regarding family leave since it is based on recent data collected post-FMLA (in 2001) while all prior work is based on data collected in the 1980's and early 1990's. Second, unlike prior studies, including our own, we are able to examine several aspects of family leave in this study -the total length of length of maternal leave, the total length of paid maternal leave, and the total length of the father's leave."}, {"section_title": "III. Modeling the Return-to-Work and Maternal Health Relationship", "text": "Models of household production and the production of health (Becker 1965 , Grossman 1972 can be used to conceptually motivate why family leave length may affect maternal health outcomes.\nAlthough we consider the effects of both maternal and paternal leave in the empirical work, in this section, for clarity, we focus on the effects of maternal leave. Consider an employed mother with a newborn infant who derives utility from her own health and the health of her child, subject to her preferences. The mother produces maternal health and child health using market goods, time, and a production technology. The inputs in the maternal and child health production functions may overlap;\nfor example, spending time playing with a child may benefit both maternal health and child health.\nTo choose the optimal amounts of maternal and child health, the mother maximizes utility subject to budget and time constraints, where time is divided between time spent in the labor market, time spent investing in the health and well-being of her child, and time spent investing in her own physical and mental health. The optimal quantities of child health and maternal health chosen by the mother depend on the marginal utilities and the shadow prices of maternal and child health.\nWhile this framework suggests that the mother's return to work is likely to affect the inputs to health, as well as maternal health itself, the direction of these effects is indeterminate. When the mother returns to work, the opportunity cost of her time increases, which in turn increases the shadow prices of both maternal health and child health since time is likely to be an important component of both these prices. The effects of returning to work on maternal health, however, depend on: (1) what the mother chooses to do with increased income from returning to work (in the case of unpaid leave, which is the norm in the US); and (2) how she reallocates the time and market good components in the production of the health commodities when she returns to work.\nTheory suggests that the increase in income that occurs when the mother returns to work would increase the demand for both maternal and child health, thus potentially also increasing positive health behaviors, quality parenting practices, and other inputs. However, holding other factors constant, if child health is more time-intensive to produce relative to maternal health, the mother might substitute market good inputs for time inputs (to the extent possible) to produce a given level of child health when she returns to work. For example, she may substitute child care for her own time with her child. On the other hand, if maternal health is more time-intensive to produce than child health, the mother might substitute away from time-intensive activities and towards market goods that improve her own health.\nTherefore, the net effect of the mother's return to work on maternal health will depend on many factors including: (1) the relative time intensity of child health and maternal health production;\n(2) how readily market goods and time can be substituted for each other in producing maternal and child health; (3) the conditions of leave (e.g., weeks of leave, paid versus unpaid). As a result, the directions of the effects of maternity leave length on maternal health are theoretically ambiguous and must be studied empirically.\nThe study focuses on estimating the maternal health production function, represented by the equation below (Eq.1):\nThis equation is specific to the mother/child pair (i). The dependent variable MH is a measure of maternal health -depression, self-reported overall health or substance use. The main independent variable of interest is W, a measure of family leave length after childbirth (e.g., total weeks of maternity leave). The vector X includes observed maternal factors that may affect maternal health, such as the mother's age, marital status, number of children, and education, and observed childspecific factors that may influence maternal health, such as the child's health endowment. Specific details about the variables included are discussed below. In addition to these measured variables, unobserved, individual-level factors may exist that are associated with both maternal health status and length of leave after childbirth. These unobserved factors are represented by u in Equation 1 , and e is a random disturbance term.\nInitially, we use a standard ordinary least squares (OLS) model to estimate equation 1.\nEstimating equation 1 by OLS, however, can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates if a problem of reverse causality exists (for example, postpartum health affects length of leave) or if unobserved, mother-specific factors exist that influence both maternal health and leave decisions (e.g. u is correlated with W and MH). It is difficult to predict the direction of the bias. If reverse causality is an issue (postpartum health drives leave decisions), some mothers experiencing depressive symptoms and other health problems may return to work later, in an effort to overcome postpartum health problems or in order to retain health insurance and other benefits. 1 Similarly, if unobserved heterogeneity exists, there are plausible reasons to think mothers who return later may have unmeasured traits that are correlated with higher levels of health, such as strong family support, but one can also make an argument that mothers who return later may have unmeasured factors that may be associated with lower levels of health, such as family stress.\nGiven these potential issues, in this paper we estimate OLS models, and then apply IV methods to address the possible bias from unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causation. Angrist we present 2SLS estimates in the paper with Huber/White corrected standard errors to adjust for heteroskedasticity. We also tested IV models using a two-step GMM estimator, which is analogous to 2SLS but uses a weighting matrix that makes it efficient in the presence of heteroskedasticity (e.g. "}, {"section_title": "IV. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Birth Cohort (ECLS-B)", "text": "The ECLS-B is a nationally representative sample of 14,000 children born in 2001 and followed until kindergarten entry. The sample includes over-samples of racial/ethnic minority 1 Although the FMLA mandates that firms continue to provide health insurance during unpaid leave, only about 46% of the private sector workforce is entitled to FMLA benefits children, twins, and low and very low birth weight infants. The data are collected from children, families (both mothers and fathers), teachers and schools, providing unusually rich information on children's development as well as maternal employment, work characteristics, and maternal health outcomes. The parent interviews are conducted with the child's primary caregiver, usually the mother. The interviews are computer-administrated at the child's home by a trained assessor, and are available in both English and Spanish.\nOur main analytic sample is limited to 3,366 adult ECLS-B respondents who: (1) were the biological or adoptive mother of the child; (2) had worked either part-time or full-time during pregnancy; and (3) had returned to work either part-time or full-time by the 9-month interview. The sample includes mothers who had returned to work at some point before the 9-month interview, but\nwere not currently working when the 9-month interview was conducted. In cases of twins, we randomly selected one twin for inclusion in the sample. Observations were dropped if an observation had missing information on any dependent or independent variables used in the study. When examining effects of paternal leave, we limit the main analysis sample to 2,181 mothers who were married at the time of the 9-month ECLS-B interview.\nThe FMLA only applies to parents who return to the same employer after childbirth. From a policy perspective, therefore, it is interesting to test whether our results persist in sample of mothers who return to the same employer after childbirth. Previous research by Klerman and Leibowitz suggests that most mothers who worked full-time during pregnancy continued to work for the same employer after childbirth (Klerman and Leibowitz 1999) . Nevertheless, in sensitivity analyses, we re-estimated all models based on a sample that is restricted to 2,496 mothers who appear to have returned to the same job after childbirth. Although we do not have information regarding whether or not the mother returned to the same employer, this sample excludes two groups of mothers who potentially may be returning to different jobs: (1) mothers who report not taking maternity leave because they quit their jobs during pregnancy (although they retuned to work after childbirth); and (2) mothers who report a maternity leave length that is more than 6 weeks shorter than the child's age in weeks when the mother returned to work. Results based on this sample were qualitatively very similar to those shown in the paper and are not discussed here."}, {"section_title": "B. Dependent Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale", "text": "The Ideally, we would have liked to measure depression at the same point in time for all mothers in relation to when they returned to work. For example, if depression was measured for all the mothers when they been back at work for one month, we could isolate the effect of maternity leave length on maternal health, controlling for the child's age at the time of the interview and how long the mother has been back at work. Unfortunately, this approach is not possible since ECLS-B respondents completed the 9-month survey when their children were between 6 and 22 months old, regardless of when and whether they returned to work.\nAlthough we control for the age of child at the interview date in all models, the length of maternity leave cannot be disentangled from how long the mother has been back at work. By construction, mothers who take longer leaves will have been back at work for shorter periods of time when the interview is conducted compared to mothers who took shorter leaves. For example, consider two employed mothers both interviewed when their children are 7 months old -one mother has taken a 3 month maternity leave, while the other has taken a 6 month maternity leave. If longer leave is associated with better health, the mother with the longer leave may be expected to be in better health, but this mother also has returned to work more recently than the mother who took the 3-month leave, and therefore may be adjusting to employment, which could negatively affect health.\nWe selected a stringent threshold for our depression indicator and for our poor health indicator so that for these two outcomes, this issue is unlikely to affect our findings. Short-term adjustments to employment are unlikely to induce severe depression and large reductions in overall health. This issue remains a limitation of the analysis, however, when we examine the continuous measure of depressive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Self-reported health", "text": "All ECLS-B respondents are asked to report whether their health in general is excellent (1), very good (2), good (3), fair (4), or poor (5).

We also consider a dichotomous indicator that equals one if the mother reports her health in general is fair or poor.

For maternal leave, we consider two measures in alternative specifications: (1) total length of maternity leave in weeks; and (2) weeks of paid leave in weeks. Length of maternity leave in weeks is created based on the question: \"did you take any maternity leave, either paid or unpaid, from your job while you were pregnant or right after your child was born?\" This question includes a probe that specifies that maternity leave is taken from a job to which one expects to return, at least at the time of the leave. Respondents who report taking any maternity leave are then asked \"in total, how many weeks of maternity leave, paid or unpaid, did you take?\" Respondents who took maternity leave were then asked the total number of weeks of paid maternity leave they took. This question specifies that paid leave includes pay received through maternity benefits, sick time, vacation time and other kinds of paid leave.\nRespondents who report that they did not take any maternity leave are asked why and provided with the following possible reasons: (1) not employed during pregnancy; (2) employed but quit before delivery; (3) leave not provided/self-employed; (4) could not afford to take it; and (5) other reason.

Identifying Instrumental Variables", "text": "In this study, following Baum (2003) and our prior work, we use cross-sectional variation in local labor market conditions, local cost of living, and state policies related to maternity leave as identifying instrumental variables. These variables are expected to be correlated with maternal employment decisions after childbirth, but not directly related to maternal health after accounting for individual-level characteristics. To proxy local labor market conditions and local cost of living, we use the following variables: (1) median gross rent in the county; and (2) percent of county residents who are employed outside the county. These variables come from the Area Resource File. In addition, we include an indicator of whether the mother lives in a state that had any kind of family leave policy that pre-dated the FMLA. 4 In most cases, we merged county-level characteristics to child records by the county of residence listed on the child's birth certificate, and state-level characteristics are merged according to the mother's state of residence at the 9-month interview. However, in cases where the county of residence was missing on the birth certificate, or if the state on the birth certificate was not consistent 4 The FMLA does not include provisions for paid leave, and only applies to employees are those who have worked for their current employer for at least 1,250 hours in the past year at a firm with 50 or more employees (Department of Labor, 2007). The ECLS-B does not include information on firm size, but we experimented with county-level indicators of firm size as instruments. These instruments performed poorly empirically, however, so we did not include them in the final models presented in the paper.\nwith the state of residence at the 9-month interview, we used state-level averages of county-level variables according to the state reported at the 9-month interview.\nIV. Results Table 1 displays means and standard deviations for the main sample used in the paper. In terms of mental health, the average CES-D score is 4.86, and 6 percent of the respondents had a CES-D score of at least 15, which is considered to be a severe rate of depressive symptoms that may be indicative of clinical depression. This rate of depression is somewhat lower than the estimated 12-month prevalence rate for major depression for women in the US, which is estimated to be about 11 percent (Marcotte et al. 1999) . The sample appears to be in fairly good physical health overall, with only six percent of the sample report that their overall self-reported health is poor or fair. Smoking and drinking are not very prevalent. Ten percent of the sample report binge drinking at least once in the past month, and 18 percent are current smokers.\nOn average, these employed mothers take 9.43 weeks of maternity leave, and just under 5 weeks of this leave was paid. Mothers are an average of about 29 years old, with a 10 month old child at the time of the interview. The sample is 17 percent African-American, 12 percent Hispanic, and 20 percent are in the other race category. The full sample includes fairly large proportions of low birth-weight infants (12 percent) and very low birth-weight infants (9 percent) because the ECLS-B over-sampled these groups. Eighty four percent of respondents live in an urban area and 5 percent received welfare. Table 2 shows regression results for the full sample, which includes all mothers who worked in the year prior to childbirth. These models focus on the effect of total weeks of maternity leave (both prior to and after childbirth) and paid weeks of leave on maternal mental health. This table shows findings for the two different outcome -depressive symptoms as measured by the log of the CES-D score and an indicator for severe depression. For each outcome, we show OLS followed by IV results.\nThe OLS results indicate that longer maternity leave lengths are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and a lower probability of depression. Both the total length of maternity leave and the weeks of paid leave appear to be beneficial. A ten percent increase in weeks of maternity leave (which translates to just under one additional week) is associated with a 0.4 or 0.5 percent reduction in the CES-D score. For severe depression, the OLS models show that a ten percent increase in weeks of leave reduces the probability of being classified as severely depressed by 0.1 percentage points. The magnitudes of these effects are small, but this is perhaps not surprising,\ngiven that we are measuring maternal health outcomes about 9 months after childbirth. Many mothers who had been experiencing health problems early on may have started to recover by this point, and re-adjust to employment.\nThese OLS associations may not reflect a causal relationship if the length of maternity leave is endogenous. For this reason, we also show the corresponding IV results for each OLS specification. In these models, we use three instruments to predict length of leave: a dummy indicator of whether or not the mother's state of residence had any family leave policy that pre-dated FMLA; median gross rent in county of residence; and percentage of county residents who work outside the county of residence (the first stage regressions are shown in Appendix Table 1 ). The coefficients on the maternity leave variables are negative in all models, but are only statistically significant at conventional levels in the log CES-D score models. Note that in all models the joint F statistic on the instruments is reasonably high, ranging from 7 to 10. The over-identification statistics are not statistically significant indicating the instruments are uncorrelated with the error term and are properly excluded from the second stage equation. But according to the Hausman test, we fail to reject the consistency of OLS in all of the models. Given that the instruments appear trustworthy, endogeneity does not seem to be a critical problem and we will rely on the OLS results to draw conclusions. Table 3 considers the effects of leave length on two measures of overall maternal health. The first panel shows the effects of maternity leave length on the probability of being in fair or poor health. Only the coefficients on total weeks and paid weeks are shown for brevity. The results are strikingly similar to that of Table 2 . The OLS results show that longer weeks are statistically associated with improvements in overall health. For example, columns 1 and 3 show that a ten percent increase in leave length is associated with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in the probability of being in fair or poor health. The corresponding IV models confirm the OLS results in sign and significance. The magnitude, however, is much larger (although still small relative to the mean).\nThe test statistics on the instruments point to their validity, and based on the Hausman test we cannot reject the consistency of the OLS coefficients.\nThe bottom panel in Table 3 considers the categorical version of the question as to the state of the woman's overall health. Ordered probit models are used to analyze the effects of maternity leave length on the probability of being in different categories of health. We are not concerned with the endogeneity of maternity leave length in this model, given the results found for the dichotomized version of the overall health question. The results here confirm the previous results where longer leaves (both total weeks and paid weeks) are associated with higher probabilities of being in excellent health and lower probabilities of being in very good, good, or poor health. Table 4 considers two health-related behaviors, binge drinking and smoking. Here, we consider the effects of leave length on the probability of any binge drinking in the past month and of being a current smoker. These health behaviors are examined because excessive alcohol use and smoking are highly correlated with and may be manifestations of stress and depression. The results consistently show a negative relationship between weeks of leave and drinking or smoking. The effects are small in size, however, and not statistically significant in some cases. As before, the instruments appear to be valid and relevant, and, based on the Hausman test, we would conclude that the OLS estimates are the preferred estimates.\nThe length of paternal leave may be a contributing factor in determining maternal health outcomes. In Table 5 , we restrict the sample to married women in order to evaluate the marginal effects of paternity leave, holding maternity leave constant. Paternity leave is typically short--less than 2 weeks, although 87 percent of fathers take some level of leave. We measure paternity leave first as a dichotomous indicator for whether or not the father took any leave, and second, the log number of weeks taken by the father. Given the previous results showing that OLS models are preferred, only OLS results are shown for these models. These models include all the maternal and family characteristics previous discussed. We also add father's education, age, and occupational prestige score to these models.\nIncluding paternity leave does not change the conclusions regarding the mother's own maternity leave, where longer lengths of maternity leave are associated with improved health outcomes. The presence of a paternity leave of any length appears to have a positive influence above and beyond the mother's own leave when the CES-D score is considered. The length of this leave, however, is not statistically related to higher CES-D scores. The coefficients on paternity leave are also positive in the model for severely depressed, but do not achieve statistical significance at conventional levels. Similarly, paternity leave is not associated with the probability of being in fair or poor health, nor with the probability of being a current smoker. Strangely, the coefficients on no leave by the father are negatively related to binge drinking in the past month, but this association does not persist once the length of paternal leave is considered."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "In 2008, New Jersey became the third state (following California and Washington) to approve paid family leave for up to six weeks to care for a newborn or a seriously ill family member.\nIn the past decade, paid leave bills have been introduced in at least 28 states. States are considering a variety of different options to finance paid family leave, including using general funds from state budgets, giving tax credits to employers who provide paid leave, extending existing temporary disability systems and expanding unemployment insurance programs to families with newborn children (National Partnership for Women and Families 2004). All of these policy initiatives are intended to help families actually take advantage of the FMLA, which currently guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\nTo understand the net impact of these policies, states need information on the benefits of parental leave for families. Previous economic research on maternal employment has focused on understanding how maternal employment after childbirth impacts children's health and development.\nThis study extends this literature by examining the effects of both maternal and paternal leave after childbirth on the health of mothers. The results suggest that longer maternity leave from work, both paid and un-paid, is associated with declines in depressive symptoms, a reduction in the likelihood of severe depression, and an improvement in overall maternal health. The magnitudes of these effects are small since health outcomes are measured about 9 months after childbirth. It is notable, however, that the benefits of longer leave appear to persist well into the first year after childbirth. Notes: The sample size is 3,366.
