[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service acquired aerial photographs for the nearshore waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1999. These images were used to create maps of the region's coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and other important habitats. A primary product of this project is a benthic habitat map. This document describes the specific methods used to create this map. Twenty-six distinct benthic habitat types within nine zones were mapped directly into a geographic information system (GIS) using visual interpretation of orthorectified aerial photographs. To supplement the maps, digital scans of the original aerial photographs, georeferenced mosaics, a GIS mapping tool for use with ArcView, and supporting data sets were also created.

The classification scheme was influenced by many factors including: requests of the management community, existing classification schemes for coastal ecosystems in Puerto Rico (Kruer, 1995;Reid and Kruer, 1998;Lindeman et al.,1998), the Virgin Islands (Conservation Data Center; Beets et al., 1986;Boulon, 1986), other coral reef systems (Holthus and Maragos, 1995;Shepard et al., 1995;Vierros, 1997;Chauvaud et al., 1998;Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Florida Marine Research Institute and NOAA, 1998;Mumby et al.,1998;NOAA et al., 1998), quantitative habitat data for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the minimum mapping unit (MMU-1 acre for visual photointerpretation), and analysis of the spatial and spectral limitations of the scanned aerial photographs. The scheme is hierarchical to allow users to expand or collapse the detail of the resulting map to suit their needs. Furthermore, it is encouraged that additional hierarchical categories be added in the GIS by users with more detailed knowledge or data for specific areas. For example, habitat polygons delineated as continuous seagrass using this scheme could be further categorized by standing crop information (low, medium, or high shoot density) or species composition (Thalassia, Syringodium)."}, {"section_title": "General Description of the Classification Scheme", "text": "The classification scheme defines benthic communities on the basis of two attributes: large geographic \"zones\" which are composed of smaller \"habitats\". Zone refers only to benthic community location and habitat refers only to substrate and/or cover type. Every polygon on the benthic community map will be assigned a habitat within a zone (e.g. sand in the lagoon, or sand on the bank). Zone indicates polygon location and habitat indicates composition of each benthic community delineated. Combinations of habitat and zone that are analogous to traditionally used terminology are noted where appropriate. The description of each zone and habitat includes example images. Both underwater and aerial photographs are included for habitats, whereas only aerial images are included for zones. The zone/habitat approach to the classification scheme was developed by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council; Dr. Ken Lindeman, Environmental Defense; and the NOS Biogeography Team. Nine mutually exclusive zones were identified from land to open water corresponding to typical insular shelf and coral reef geomorphology ( Fig. 1-2). These zones include: land, shoreline/intertidal, lagoon, back reef, reef crest, fore reef, bank/shelf, bank/shelf escarpment, and dredged (since this condition eliminates natural geomorphology). Zone refers only to each benthic community's location and does not address substrate or cover types within. For example, the lagoon zone may include patch reefs, sand, and seagrass beds, however, these are considered structural elements that may or may not occur within the lagoon zone and therefore, are not used to define it. Twenty-six distinct and non-overlapping habitat types were identified that could be mapped by visual photointerpretation. Habitats or features that cover areas smaller than the MMU were not considered. For example, sand halos surrounding patch reefs are too small to be mapped independently. Habitat refers only to each benthic community's substrate and/or cover type and does not address location (e.g. on the shelf or in the lagoon). Habitats are defined in a collapsible hierarchy ranging from four broad classes (submerged vegetation, unconsolidated sediment, coral reef/hard bottom, and other), to more detailed categories (e.g., mangrove, seagrass, algae, individual patch reefs, bedrock, etc.), to patchiness of some specific features (e.g., 50-70 percent cover of seagrass)."}, {"section_title": "______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ 4", "text": "Zones: Habitats: Unconsolidated Sediments (0 percent to less than 10 percent submerged vegetation) Sand Mud Submerged Vegetation Seagrass Continuous Seagrass (90 percent to less than 100 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass (70 percent to less than 90 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass (50 percent to less than 70 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass (30 percent to less than 50 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass (10 percent to less than 30 percent cover)"}, {"section_title": "Macroalgae", "text": "Continuous Macroalgae (90 percent to less than 100 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Macroalgae (50 percent to less than 90 percent cover) Patchy (Discontinuous) Macroalgae (10 percent to less than 50 percent cover) ______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ 10"}, {"section_title": "Unconsolidated Sediment", "text": "Habitats: Unconsolidated Sediment: Unconsolidated sediment with less than 10 percent cover of submerged vegetation.

Before creating a new scheme using the dialogs of the extension, it may be useful to sketch the scheme out on paper to ensure that all fields and categories in the hierarchy are entered properly. There are several advantages to using a scheme with a hierarchical structure including: the detail of habitat categories can be expanded or collapsed to suit user needs, the thematic accuracy of each category/hierarchical level can be determined, and additional categories can be easily added or deleted at any level of the scheme to suit user needs. An example of a scheme framework is provided in Table 2.1 below. To create the new scheme using the extension, select Habitat Digitizer/Change Classification Scheme and in the next dialog box, select Create New Scheme. Type the name of the new classification scheme in the message box and click Okay. The other options in this dialog will be unavailable until a scheme has been either created or loaded. In the \"Add New Field\" dialog, selecting Cancel will end the creation process without creating a scheme.

First, type in the field name for the most general hierarchical level in the new classification scheme (Field 1 in Table 2.1). Field names are limited to 10 characters in length. Select whether the field will be character or numeric and click Add Field. Add additional field names in the order of the classification hierarchy. A fieldname must be entered for every level in the hierarchy.

After all the field names have been entered select Finished to proceed to the next step. Once Finished is selected, no additional fields may be added to the classification scheme. Note that a field named \"UniqueID\" is added automatically after Finished is selected. The extension uses the uniqueID field to identify each possible combination of hierarchical categories with one unique number (see Table 2.1). ArcView uses uniqueIDs to link polygon attributes to the legend. The dialog at left sets the method of assigning uniqueIDs. When setting up a new scheme or altering an existing scheme that has not yet been used to create a theme, the Automatic method should be used. The Automatic method creates a logical numbering sequence for each uniqueID (see Table 2.1). When modifying a scheme that has already been used to create a theme, use the Manual method. If Automatic was used, new uniqueID's would be assigned to the scheme, creating a mis-match between the ID's of the new scheme and those of the polygons attributed using the old scheme."}, {"section_title": "______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ 31", "text": "In the \"Modify Classification Scheme\" dialog, categories and subcategories can be added to a new or existing classification scheme.

Aerial photographs are valuable tools for natural resource managers and researchers since they provide an excellent record of the location and extent of habitats. However, spatial distortions in aerial photos due to such factors as camera angle, lens characteristics, and relief displacement must be accounted for during analysis to prevent incorrect measurements of area, distance, and other spatial parameters. These distortions of scale within an image can be removed through orthorectification. During orthorectification, digital scans of aerial photos are subjected to algorithms that eliminate each source of spatial distortion. The result is a georeferenced digital mosaic of several photographs with uniform scale throughout the mosaic. After an orthorectified mosaic is created, photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate the boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer. Through this process, natural resources managers and researchers are provided with spatially accurate maps of habitats and other features visible in the imagery."}, {"section_title": "Creating the Digital Mosaic", "text": "from USGS 1:24000 Digital Elevation Models or other elevation data sets where clouds or other sources of interference prevented the Socet Set software from automatically making an accurate DTM. Once the terrain models were complete and a draft orthorectified mosaic was produced, a set of independent ground control points was used to measure the quality of each mosaic's rectification and ensure that it met acceptable limits of horizontal spatial accuracy. If the spatial accuracy was not acceptable based on this comparison, additional modifications were made to the DTM, tie-points, etc., until a satisfactory mosaic was created for each island. In general, mosaics were georeferenced such that pixels are positioned within one pixel width of their correct location. Average spatial accuracy of the individual mosaics is reported in Table 3.1. Values reported are an average error for all control points used to measure accuracy of the mosaics. Accuracy is variable within different areas of each mosaic. Features near land (near GCP's) are generally georeferenced with accuracy similar to the values reported in the table while the accuracy of features away from land is generally not as good. Where no land is in the original photographic frame only kinematic GPS and tie points were used to georeference the images. Also, spatial accuracy may be especially poor near clouds over land since this interferes with creation of an accurate DTM. Once all the photos were orthorectified, the best segments of each photo were selected for creation of the final mosaic. Segments of each photo were selected to minimize sun glint, cloud interference, turbidity, etc. in the final mosaic. Where possible, parts of images obscured by sun glint or clouds were replaced with cloud/glint free parts of overlapping images. As a result, most mosaics have few or no clouds or sun glint obscuring bottom features. However, in some cases, clouds, sun glint, or turbid areas could not be replaced with overlapping imagery. In these areas, such obstructions were minimized but could not be eliminated completely. Segments from 309 out of the ~600 original aerial photos were selected to create the final mosaic (Table 3.1). Final mosaics were created in \"geoTIF\" file format (georeferenced image file) with the following projection parameters: North American Datum 83, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 19 for Puerto Rico, and UTM Zone 20 for the U.S.Virgin Islands. These files are available on the \"Benthic Habitats of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands\" CD-ROM and at the NOAA Biogeography Program web site in Mr.SID format. No color balancing was attempted since this alters color and textural signatures in the original imagery and interferes with the photointerpreter's ability to delineate habitats. As a result, mosaics have visible seams between adjacent photos. This provides the photointerpreter with \"true color\" imagery for maximum ability to identify and delineate benthic features. "}, {"section_title": "Digitizing Benthic Habitats", "text": "Individual georeferenced mosaics were loaded into ArcView with the Habitat Digitizer and Image Analysis extensions activated. Each mosaic was then converted into an image analysis file (IMG) that could be easily manipulated using ArcView's Image Analysis extension (e.g., adjust contrast, brightness, and color). The Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) restriction was set to 1 acre in the Habitat Digitizer extension. One acre was selected based on the scale of the photography and the objectives of the mapping project. As a result, some features visible in the imagery such as small isolated patch reefs and sea walls that, while important features, are quite small and beyond the scope of this mapping project. Digitizing scale was set to 1:6000 in the Habitat Digitizer. Experimentation indicated that digitizing at this scale optimizes the tradeoff between positional accuracy of lines and time spent digitizing. In general, line placement conducted while zoomed in at large scales results in excellent line accuracy and detail but can be quite time consuming. Conversely, while zoomed out, lines can be drawn quickly but lack both detail and positional accuracy. To determine the optimum digitizing scale to maximize accuracy and minimize map production time, a 25 acre area composed of a variety of habitat types was mapped at 1:1500, 1:3000, 1:6000, and 1:12000 on-screen scale (scale that the image appears on the computer monitor as indicated by ArcView). Five replicates were conducted at each scale. Each trial was timed so we could evaluate the influence of mapping scale on production time. Resulting maps were evaluated for deviations in polygon detail relative to the map digitized at 1:1500 scale. At 1:1500, individual pixels are clearly discernable allowing highly detailed and accurate maps to be created by closely following the contours of even the most convoluted habitat boundary. Additional increases in zoom do not result in an increase in map detail and accuracy since individual pixels are already visible at 1:1500. Therefore, the map created at 1:1500 scale was used as a reference against which to compare maps digitized at 1:3000, 1:6000, and 1:12000 scale. The results of this experiment indicated that there is no appreciable loss in polygon detail and accuracy by digitizing at 1:6000 while mapping time was dramatically reduced. Therefore all polygons were digitized at this scale except when subtle habitat boundaries were not easily discernable at 1:6000 and zooming out to a more broad scale was required to place boundaries correctly. In this case, digitizing generally took place at a scale of approximately 1:10000. Using the Habitat Digitizer, habitat boundaries were delineated around signatures (e.g., areas with specific color and texture patterns) in the orthorectified mosaic corresponding to habitat types in the classification scheme (Chapter 1). This was often accomplished by first digitizing a large boundary polygon such as the habitats that compose the shoreline and then appending new polygons to the initial polygon or splitting out smaller polygons within. Each new polygon was attributed with the appropriate habitat designation according to the classification scheme. It is believed that the positional accuracy of polygon boundaries is similar to that of the mosaics since delineation is performed directly on the digital imagery. Brightness, contrast, and occasionally color balance of the mosaic were manipulated with Image Analysis to enhance the interpretability of some subtle features and boundaries. This was particularly helpful in deeper water where differences in color and texture between adjacent features tend to be more subtle and boundaries more difficult to detect. Particular caution was used when interpretation was performed from altered images, since results from color and brightness manipulations can sometimes be misleading. The original 1:48000 scale color prints and diapositives were available to the photointerpreter to aid in delineating and attributing polygons. The high quality diapostives were frequently viewed under magnification on a light table to aid in this process. Additional collateral information including previously completed habitat maps, NOS nautical charts, and other descriptive references dealing with benthic and coastal habitats of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was used to assist with image interpretation (Kumpf and Randall, 1961;Rodriguez et al, 1977;Morelock, 1978;Adey, 1979;Goenaga and Cintron, 1979;Beach and Trumbull, 1981;Grove, 1983;Beets et al, 1986;Pilkey et al, 1987;Trias, 1991;Rodriguez et al, 1992;Morelock et al, 1994;Bacle, 1995;Reid and Kruer, 1998;Kruer 1995;Garcia et al, 2000;NOAA et al, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Ground Validation", "text": "Following careful evaluation of the aerial photography, and in some cases creation of a \"first draft\" habitat map through the process outlined above, selected sites were visited in the field for typological validation. This validation included: (1) areas in the aerial photography and mosaic with confusing or difficult to interpret signatures, (2) transects across many representative habitat types occurring in different depths and water conditions, (3) a survey of the Zones, and (4) confirmation of preliminary habitat delineations if a first draft was produced. Navigating to field sites was accomplished in a variety of ways including uploading position coordinates from the mosaic into an onboard GPS and navigating to those waypoints, using an onboard PC connected to GPS allowing navigation using digital nautical charts or the mosaic, and visual navigation using landmarks visible in the diapositives. On most occasions, field activities were conducted with the guidance of local experts. Diapositives, and when available, draft delineations were used in the field to facilitate comparison of signatures in the imagery to actual habitats at each site. Individual sites were visually evaluated by snorkeling and free diving or directly from the boat in shallow, clear water. Habitat transitions were evaluated by swimming transects across habitat types to further guide placement of polygon boundaries. Habitat type(s), zone, approximate depth, position (GPS), image number, and other descriptive information were recorded at each site. Field data for each site was then compiled into a text table with a latitude/longitude field to allow overlay of the field information on the mosaic and habitat polygons (Appendix 2: Ground Truth Points). Where depth and water clarity permitted, the diapositives were used to navigate across multiple bottom features allowing continuous confirmation of habitat types and transitions between each site. Following processing of the field data, polygon boundaries and habitat classifications were created or revised where necessary, and zone attributes were assigned to each polygon using the Habitat Digitizer. This draft of the habitat maps was then reviewed and revised with the guidance of a panel of local experts at peer review sessions in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and over the internet. Review session participants included members of the local research and management community. During these peer review sessions, particular attention was given to polygons labeled as \"unknown\" and areas not visited during ground truth activities. Revisions based on comments from local experts were then completed and final habitat maps were produced. Thematic accuracy was assessed for these final maps (see Chapter 4)."}, {"section_title": "______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ 40", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4: Assessment of Classification Accuracy", "text": "Periodic assessment of thematic accuracy during map production is a critical part of any mapping project. Mapmakers want to know how reliably a given habitat type can be classified, this is called \"producers accuracy\". Map users want to know what percentage of the polygons labeled with a specific habitat type is classified correctly, this is called \"users accuracy\" (Congalton, 1991;Verbyla, 1991). Such periodic assessment is necessary to monitor and maintain acceptable standards of quality following creation of each draft. Most importantly, once final products are produced, the reliability of results must be estimated and reported. Thematic accuracy of the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands habitat maps was evaluated for the three most general habitat categories: unconsolidated sediment, submerged vegetation, and coral reef/hard bottom. Accuracy was estimated at each of two locations within the project area that included the full complement of habitat types, depth ranges, and water conditions representative of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For this reason, the accuracy of maps measured at these two locations is assumed to be representative of map accuracy elsewhere in the project area. This approach, which focused in two small areas, enabled a statistically robust evaluation of thematic accuracy to be conducted without the logistic difficulty of collecting data for accuracy assessment over the entire project area. In addition, since a novel mapping approach was used to enhance production time and provide additional project deliverables, it was necessary to ensure that maps produced using the ArcView Extension had comparable accuracy to maps produced using more routinely used techniques. To accomplish this goal, the thematic accuracy of ArcView maps was compared to the accuracy of maps produced using published and well known photogrammetric techniques."}, {"section_title": "Goals of the accuracy assessment:", "text": "1. Compare the thematic accuracy of maps produced from on-screen digitizing using the ArcView Extension to those produced by digitizing directly from hard copy photos using a stereoplotter. 2. Evaluate the ArcView derived products more thoroughly, including areas with different reef environments/ water conditions representative of sites throughout the project extent."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Thematic Accuracy: On-screen vs. Stereoplotter Digitizing", "text": "Buck Island National Monument, St.Croix and the surrounding ecosystem (approximately 5000 acres) was selected as the site for comparing thematic accuracy resulting from on-screen vs. analytical stereoplotter digitizing due to several factors. First, almost all habitat types in the Puerto Rico/ Virgin Islands project area are present at this site (except mud and mangroves). In addition, there is a long history of research focused on the habitat in and around Buck Island resulting in a variety of historical data with which to compare NOAA map products. Finally, there is excellent logistic support for field activities through the National Park Service and USGS. Maps of this area were created using two techniques; the ArcView Extension and on-screen digitizing process described in Chapter 3, and standard photogrammetric techniques using an analytical stereoplotter to visually interpret benthic features from hard copy photos. Maps derived using the stereoplotter were created by the NOAA Coastal Services Center using Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocols. These protocols include widely accepted and commonly used photogrammetric techniques and instruments (see Dobson et al, 1995 for a complete description of this technique). Under these protocols, habitats were delineated directly from stereo pairs of the hard copy aerial photos that were scanned and used to create the orthorectified mosaics described in Chapter 3. Using the analytical stereoplotter, extremely detailed classification of the hard copy imagery is possible. Since the ArcView digitizing technique used to create maps relied on classification from scans of these photos (less resolution relative to the original hard copy), it was important to determine if there is a difference in thematic accuracy between maps produced using the two techniques given the classification categories and MMU described in Chapter 1. While map production was underway, habitat type at approximately 120 sites was evaluated in the Buck Island test area to compare with habitat delineations derived from each mapping technique. A stratified sampling protocol was used during which sample sites were pre-selected so that overall thematic accuracy of the three major habitat types across the range of depths and water conditions found in the field could be evaluated. First, a grid with an approximatly1 acre cell size (MMU) was overlaid on the georeferenced mosaic of the test area. Next, one third of the grid cells were randomly selected as potential sample sites. The number of potential sample sites was further reduced by eliminating grid cells that contained multiple habitat types. This reduced the possibility of using sites that straddle polygon boundaries. Sites near habitat boundaries were avoided since comparing these locations with mapped polygons could be confounded by spatial accuracy of linework and/or coordinates of ground truth points. National Ocean Service bathymetry data was then overlaid and used to split the remaining cells into \"shallow\" or \"deep\" categories based approximately on the 40-foot isobath to assist with final site selection. This was done to ensure adequate representation of accuracy assessment within two depth strata, since depth is a major factor determining the interpretability of benthic features. Site selection was completed by using visual photointerpretation to select 20 sites for each of the three major habitat types within the two depth strata respectively. This process resulted in a total of 120 preselected sites across the range of depths and habitat types found at the test area. The accuracy assessment dataset was collected in November 1999 for the Buck Island test areaeight months after the aerial photos were obtained. This short time interval minimized the possibility that habitats could have been altered significantly between the time of the aerial photography and collecting the accuracy assessment data. A datasheet was created based on the categories in the habitat classification scheme to facilitate assessment of habitat type at each site in the field. Each preselected site was navigated to using real time DGPS. Data recorded at each site included habitat type, depth, and other descriptive information. Depth was determined using a hand-held depth sounder. Habitat type(s) were recorded within an approximately 5-7 meter radius around each pre-selected site. Habitat type directly at the DGPS coordinates was recorded first followed by any secondary habitat types observed within the 5-7m radius of the DGPS point. In most cases, habitat type was the same for the DGPS point and area around each site since we preselected grid cells encompassing areas of uniform tone and texture in the imagery. Logistics prevented evaluation of each site on the scale of the MMU (1 acre). Therefore, potential classification errors resulting from the difference between the MMU and size of accuracy assessment sites were accounted for in the analysis. For example, map classification was not considered incorrect in cases where an accuracy assessment point was scored as \"sand\" in the 5-7 meter area and the photointerpreter delineated a large, multiple acre polygon as \"patchy seagrass\", \"aggregated patch reefs\", and \"colonized pavement with sand channels\" since each of these classification categories have large areas composed of sand. Logistics prevented reliable data acquisition at 11 of the 120 pre-selected sites. Therefore 109 sites were used for the accuracy assessment ( figure 4.1). Data recorded at each site was overlaid onto the habitat maps and compared against the classification assigned by the photointerpreters. After comparing the map classification to each ground truth site, an error matrix was produced displaying both errors of inclusion and exclusion (tables 4.1-4.2). In addition, overall accuracy, users and producer's accuracy, and Kappa Statistic (measure of map accuracy relative to a map with classifications randomly assigned expressed as a percent) were reported."}, {"section_title": "Results: Thematic Accuracy of On-screen vs. Stereoplotter Digitizing", "text": "Comparison with the ground truth data revealed very similar levels of thematic accuracy between the two maps. Overall accuracy was 93.6 percent (Kappa 0.90) for on-screen digitizing and 87.8 percent (Kappa 0.82) for maps digitized directly from stereo pairs. Maps produced from on-screen digitizing were almost 100 percent accurate for the submerged vegetation and unconsolidated sediment categories but misclassified a small percentage of hardbottom sites as unconsolidated sediment. Similarly, the maps produced using the stereoplotter were 100 percent accurate at classifying submerged vegetation but misclassified a small percentage of hardbottom and unconsolidated sediment sites. These findings suggest that both of these mapping techniques result in acceptable levels of thematic accuracy for maps produced at this scale with this type of classification scheme.  "}, {"section_title": "Methods for Evaluation of Thematic Accuracy for other Reef Morphologies and Water Conditions", "text": "The results from the Buck Island test area indicated that thematic accuracy of maps produced from on-screen digitizing was good given the clear water and reef morphologies that are representative of that area. However, both geomorphology and local water conditions can dramatically influence the ability to accurately and consistently photointerpret habitats. Therefore, the thematic accuracy of the ArcView derived products were further evaluated in another area with different water conditions and reef morphologies than those present at the Buck Island site and more representative of the environment found elsewhere in the project area. The La Parguera, Puerto Rico area was chosen for additional evaluation of thematic accuracy. The variety of water conditions and habitat types at this site are representative of those occurring elsewhere in the Puerto Rico project area. In addition, the long history of research focused on the habitat in and around La Parguera by the University of Puerto Rico, Isla Magueyes Campus resulted in a variety of data with which to compare NOAA map products. Furthermore, the University of Puerto Rico provides excellent logistic support for field activities. Sites of accuracy assessment points were selected and analyzed with the same protocol as described above for the Buck Island test area (table 4.3)."}, {"section_title": "Results: Thematic Accuracy for other Reef Morphologies and Water Conditions", "text": "Accuracy in the Parguera area was estimated using 200 ground truth points (Fig. 4.2) and was determined to be 93.6 percent overall (Kappa 0.93).

A small percentage of submerged vegetation sites were misclassified as coral reef/hardbottom. These values are well within acceptable levels of thematic accuracy and suggest that other areas in the project area with similar water conditions and reef morphologies will be mapped with similar accuracy.
