Novel and established AD loci identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based effect (false discovery rate P =.04) on all analyzed neuroimaging measures.

A study of twins 2 has demonstrated a significant role for genetics in lateonset AD, with heritability estimates of 60% to 80%. Until recently, the only genetic variant consistently shown to influence AD risk and age at onset was APOE (OMIM 107741). 3 New findings from genomewide association studies (GWASs) identified 3 additional loci conferring risk for AD: CLU (OMIM 185430), PICALM (OMIM 603025), and CR1 (OMIM 120620). 4, 5 Other promising loci were also reported in these GWASs but did not achieve P values sufficient for genome-wide significance.\nMultiple neuroimaging measures correlate with AD risk and progression. These measures also appear to have genetic underpinnings, with heritability estimates ranging from 40% to 80%, 6 and have been proposed as surrogate end points in biological research and clinical trials in AD. 7, 8 The demonstration that recently discovered genetic risk factors for AD also influence these neuroimaging traits would provide important confirmation of a role for these genetic variantsandsuggestmechanismsthroughwhich they might be acting.\nWe therefore investigated the genetics of AD-related neuroimaging measures using data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

These findings suggest that sequence variants that modulate AD risk in recent GWASs may act through their influence on neuroimaging measures. Furthermore, our genetic analysis of neuroimaging traits identified BIN1 and CNTN5 as genes of heightened interest for their relationship with AD, prioritizing these targets for further study. Among non-APOE AD loci that have emerged from GWASs, only the CR1 locus was significantly associated with disease status. Failure to extend previous findings for CLU and PICALM is likely because of the limited sample size of the ADNI cohort. Nonetheless, our genetic risk score was associated in a dose-dependent manner with clinical diagnosis and clearly outperformed individual SNP models. This finding is consistent with a biological role for at least some, if not all, of the incorporated loci. Interestingly, the inclusion of previously unvalidated loci at BIN1 and CNTN5 (albeit supported by P \u03fd1\u03eb10 \u22125 in the previous GWASs) did not degrade the performance of the genetic score, further supporting a role for these loci in AD.\nThe genetic risk score quartiles correlated with every examined neuroimaging trait, consistent with the underlying hypothesis that these traits are, at least in part, determined by genome sequence at these loci. This finding offers parallel evidence that the included genes influence biological processes underlying development of AD.\nAmong GWAS-validated loci, APOE, PICALM, and CR1 genotypes influenced neuroimaging measures, whereas CLU did not. The robust effect of APOE was seen across all measures except WML volume, whereas the effect of PICALM was restricted to hippocampal volume and ECT, and the effect of CR1 was restricted to ECT. These findings raise the possibility that the biological effects of these genes may be relatively confined to 1 neuroimaging trait and hence may offer clues to the mechanisms through which particular genetic variants might influence AD risk.\nTwo loci, identified as GWAS-promising in previous AD studies, showed association with neuroimaging measures. CNTN5 variation was associated with WML, ECT, parahippocampal gyrus thickness, and TPT, whereas BIN1 was associated with ECT and TPT. These genes encode proteins involved in neurite growth, 32 presynaptic cytoskeleton structure integrity, 31 and fission of synaptic vesicles. 33 Brain-specific isoforms and expression pat- .

Analyses for SNPs outside the APOE locus were also adjusted for APOE genotypes (number of \u03b52 and \u03b54 copies).\nb Clinical diagnosis defined as cognitively normal controls, mild cognitive impairment not converted to Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment conversion to Alzheimer disease, and Alzheimer disease.\nterns have been reported for BIN 34 and CNTN5. 35 Although our results for these loci can only be considered preliminary, they may help prioritize targets for future genetic studies and GWASs in AD, particularly given their association with neuroimaging correlates of AD and disease status.\nThe crucial limitations of our study arise from its small sample size. Because of restricted power, we were forced to constrain our analysis to SNPs and loci with high prior probabilities of association with AD and imaging traits, based on their status as either validated (APOE, CLU, PICALM, and CR1) or promising (CNTN5 and BIN1) genetic risk factors. Our power also limits the conclusions we can draw about observed differential genetic effects on neuroimaging traits. For example, although the absence of an effect of CR1 on hippocampal volume may reflect important biology, it is also possible that an effect could be detected with increased power. .001\nAbbreviations: FDR, false discovery rate; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism. a SNPs were selected based on results of prior genome-wide association studies 4, 5 with P \u03fd .001.

These genes may act selectively, influencing only 1 or a few established AD-related MRI measures. Future studies are required to replicate and expand these findings."}]
