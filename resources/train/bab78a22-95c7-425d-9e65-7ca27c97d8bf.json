[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the prospects and ethics of using neuroimaging to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is motivated by consideration of the historical roles of science in medicine and society, and considerations specifically contemporary of capabilities in imaging and aging, and the benefits and hope they bring. A general consensus is that combinations of imaging methods will ultimately be most fruitful in predicting disease. Their roll-out into translational practice will not be free of complexity, however, as culture and values differ in terms of what defines benefit and risk, who will benefit and who is at risk, what methods must be in place to assure the maximum safety, comfort, and protection of subjects and patients, and educational and policy needs. Proactive planning for the ethical and societal implications of predicting diseases of the aging brain is critical and will benefit all stakeholdersresearchers, patients and families, health care providers, and policy makers."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The progressive deficits characterizing dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) ultimately destroy judgment and communication abilities. The deficits are particularly difficult to detect in early stages, 1 and true confirmation of this form of neurodegenerative disease is elusive without postmortem histological examination of the brain for neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, and senile plaques. A consequence of the subtlety of these changes is that diagnostic criteria are conservative and diagnosis is delayed until there is significant functional disability (Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV, 1994) . Given the late age of onset of AD and a growing elderly American population, the public health burden of this disease is significant. Estimates of the prevalence of Americans suffering from the condition today vary between 1.5 and 4 million, with projections increasing steadily through 2050. 2, 3 Despite recent therapeutic advances, available treatments at present are aimed primarily at slowing progression of the disease rather than halting it completely or reversing its progression.\nImaging is one among a few tests, such as genetic markers, cerebrospinal fluid, and demographic risk factors that may predict AD. Original genetic studies in the early 1990s, for example, associated one gene that encodes apolipoprotein E with the disease. APOE is a plasma protein that binds and transports cholesterol. 4 The presence of the type 4 allele (estimated to occur in about 25% of the AD population) 5 is widely viewed as a risk factor. However, many individuals affected by AD do not have the allele, and others who do inherit it do not manifest AD. The development of imaging biomarkers and a discussion of accompanying ethical challenges are the focus of the present article."}, {"section_title": "ROLES FOR CURRENT IMAGING CAPABILITIES AND IMAGING BIOMARKERS ON THE HORIZON", "text": "Neuroimaging techniques are poised to transform the process of diagnosis, prediction, and clinical management of AD and related dementias. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis of dementia and investigation of cognitive impairment has been discussed at length by Knopman et al. 6 and Albert et al. 7 (www.alz.org/Research/Papers/Imaging consensus report.pdf). Currently, neuroimaging essentially serves the purpose of excluding alternate potential etiologies for cognitive dysfunction. For the future, there are three particularly important roles that neuroimaging may play: (1) increasing the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing AD; (2) predicting who is likely to develop AD in the nondemented population; and (3) replacing clinical outcome measures in therapeutic trials (i.e., surrogate measures that have no direct relationship to a patient's clinical state but are presumed to substitute for a clinically important measure). With respect to diagnosis, current accuracy is already highly sensitive and specific as compared to the neuropathological standard. In contrast, there is much work needed to predict who will develop AD in the nondemented population. As a surrogate outcome measure in studies evaluating new treatments, neuroimaging has great potential to reduce the length and cost of clinical trials because it can be collected long before current clinical outcome measures are available. The 5-year public-private Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is an example of ongoing validation trial toward this goal 8 (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). Although brain imaging is not currently applied in a clinical context for diagnosing AD except as a means of ruling out other causes of dementia, such as strokes or tumors, it has been widely accepted that benefits would accrue to patients and individuals at risk with improved assessment of brain integrity; structural and functional imaging are likely candidates since they may provide more direct information than inferences based on behavior, genetics, or other systemic indicators, such as CSF metabolites. 9 As described in this volume and elsewhere, early detection of the disease has been a major focus of a variety of neuroimaging techniques, including fMRI, structural MRI, and PET. Recently, these techniques have also been found to be useful in monitoring cognitive and pathological progression of the disease, as well as monitoring response to clinical intervention and treatment. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] "}, {"section_title": "MEETING ETHICAL CHALLENGES", "text": "With each new technique comes the burden of validation against current standards for diagnosis and disease state monitoring. The consensus report on the use of MRI and PET for Clinical Diagnosis of Dementia 7 provides guidelines based on the state-of-the-art and scientific research. This consensus report was developed to extend the current clinical standards as described by the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines 6 for the use of neuroimaging in clinical diagnosis. With each new application of a technique, there are ethical implications that must be addressed. To complement the other articles in this volume, the editorial board invited us to report on our examination of these implications. To do so, we explored them systematically according to five major themes:\n1. overall medical and social consequences of predicting AD using functional neuroimaging, 2. differentiating different clinical subtypes of AD, 3. scanning protocols and modalities, 4. research and clinical ethics issues, and 5. key issues for education, counseling, and communication.\nOur discovery and recommendations follow."}, {"section_title": "Overall Medical and Social Implications of Predicting AD Using Functional Neuroimaging", "text": "As described previously 5 for genetic testing, the potential value of predicting AD must be considered in the context of the meaning of the disease for those affected and those around them. Unintended consequences and counseling further emerged as key areas under this theme."}, {"section_title": "Meaning of Disease", "text": "\u2022 For predictive imaging, the meaning of disease will depend on the specificity of testing tools that are used.\n\u2022 Changing technologies are going to have an impact on the nosology of the disease, for example, how the professional community classify it and assess significance.\n\u2022 The value addition of imaging alone compared to other tools in the context of prediction is not clear-cut. A combination of different technologiesgenetic testing, proteomics, and imaging interacting in different ways--is likely to achieve the best definition and predictions about AD and related diseases.\n\u2022 AD may be increasingly viewed as a syndrome rather than a single disease.\nAdvances in technology may lead to its further differentiation. As technologies become powerful and more predictive, the professional community can anticipate a proliferation of subclassifications of the syndrome.\n\u2022 As presymptomatic testing becomes available, it is likely that people who are actually healthy now and will not manifest the disease for a long period of time will still be included within the classifications. This suggests the acute need for the development and introduction of early and effective interventions.\n\u2022 It is imperative that research is conducted not only on the development of technology but on how it will be best used clinically and integrated with current health care practices."}, {"section_title": "Unintended Social, Economic, and Ethical Consequences", "text": "A number of areas on which predictive imaging will have an impact may face unintended consequences. They are:"}, {"section_title": "Health Insurance", "text": "In the current health care system in the United States:\n\u2022 Requirements by insurers for predictive testing must be articulated and vetted.\n\u2022 Insurers could ask clients directly to take the test or, if there are laws that restrict that, they can ask people to voluntarily take tests or provide results of tests. If clients refuse to do so, insurers may act on that information. This is one strategy available to insurance companies for not violating certain legal restrictions."}, {"section_title": "Stigma", "text": "Because people live in a cognitively centered world, any information that raises questions about cognitive status of an individual may stigmatize that individual:\n\u2022 Predictive imaging may expand the pool of disease to people who are much younger, and therefore expand the pool that is stigmatized.\n\u2022 Both earlier prediction and stigma have the potential to reduce quality of life, including autonomy and the privilege to drive, and other daily functions.\n\u2022 There may be medical discrimination against people at risk, for example, with respect to eligibility for organ transplantation.\nWe recognized that in spite of any stigma, some people will have psychological solace from the biologic information."}, {"section_title": "Health care disparities", "text": "Testing might exacerbate existing disparities, largely through access.\n\u2022 If predictive imaging becomes commercialized, those who cannot afford tests may not be able to get them.\n\u2022 If some interventions have a high impact on behavior--such as the demonstration that physical or cognitive exercise reduces risk--then knowing about that risk might affect behavior. Then those who cannot afford to pay out of pocket for these tests will not have those kinds of incentives."}, {"section_title": "Counseling", "text": "A great deal of expertise will be required of clinical providers who offer predictive imaging services. In this respect, a cohort of specialists may emerge especially since, recalling counseling in the history of genetic testing, guidelines fell away as primary care providers could not possibly keep up with demand.\n\u2022 Before any test is offered clinically for which counseling will be needed, the validity of the test, including psychometric reliability and sensitivity, must be in place. Quality assurance analogous to CLIA laboratory guidelines may be one response to this recommendation. We note that the American Academy of Neurology currently vets tests and identifies those that are ready. Professional institutions have a responsibility to continue to meet and help clarify standard of care in this area.\n\u2022 Since AD has a significant component of heritability and individuals with a first-degree relative and an ApoE4 allele are believed to have a 40% lifetime risk of developing AD, physicians should be aware of the implications for family members who may be present when testing results are disseminated. Physicians who convey test results to patients should be prepared to field questions from family members concerned about their own risk."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Populations for Screening", "text": "Any discussion of the ethical issues at play for screening imaging for AD must take into account two important facts. The first is that treatments for AD currently have limited effectiveness and the disease is fatal. The second is that even the best imaging test will be prone to some degree of false positive and false negative results. The ethical issues pertaining to which clinical populations should be tested will depend largely on whether or not a definitive treatment becomes available. The screening of certain populations and the accompanying ethical issues will vary depending on whether such a treatment is effective at stemming the progression of AD or can actually reverse the pathologic changes and cure patients. Similarly, there will be a separate set of ethical questions if a treatment is developed that can prevent the disease from occurring when given to presymptomatic subjects. With these important caveats in mind we consider four specific scenarios for clinical screening as follows:"}, {"section_title": "Screen All Individuals for AD When They Reach 65 Years of Age", "text": "\u2022 Imaging tests could be added to the panoply of other screening tests (e.g., colonoscopy, mammogram) that are recommended as people grow older. The greatest concern for this scenario is that, even with prevalence rates approaching 10% in this age range, 15 there will be a significant number of false positives. In screening for AD, the benefit of a follow-up confirmatory biopsy or other gold standard procedure does not exist because brain biopsy is too risky. As such the imaging test may be the most definitive measure available and the one on which treatment decisions will be based.\n\u2022 If relatively benign and effective treatments are developed, a relatively larger percentage of false positives in this scenario can be tolerated. However, initial clinical trials of the \u2424-amyloid vaccine, in which 6% of vaccinated patients developed a meningoencephalits, 16 serve to remind us that (potentially) potent therapies are rarely completely benign."}, {"section_title": "Screen Patients Who Already Have Some Mild Cognitive Impairment", "text": "\u2022 The true prevalence of AD in the mild cognitive impairment population will be greater than in a sample of subjects without cognitive complaints. The positive predictive value of the test (the probability that a positive result is a true positive) will increase, giving clinicians greater confidence that a potentially potent but toxic treatment is being given to patients who actually have pathology.\n\u2022 The rate at which cognitive and functional decline is likely to occur may be projected from this population.\n\u2022 A downside to this scenario is that the AD pathology in this cohort of patients is already more advanced and may prove less amenable to treatment."}, {"section_title": "Screen Asymptomatic Individuals with Risk Factors", "text": "The scenario to screen asymptomatic individuals with risk factors, such as family history, ApoE genotype, older age, or some combination of these variables, analyses represents the most typical of the cost-benefit analyses made by physicians considering testing a patient for a particular disease. Many patients and their families in this scenario may find it useful, in terms of planning for the future, to know with some certainty that the cognitive loss they are already suffering is due to AD. At the level of intervention, a physician might encourage or limit treatment, such as with a cholinesterase inhibitor, especially for an AD patient with limited means or multiple other medical conditions that can be treated more effectively. However:\n\u2022 Given the lack of definitive treatment, the clinical value of making a diagnosis of AD is considerably reduced.\n\u2022 Given the relatively slow course of the pathology and the persistent social stigma surrounding AD, there is more potential harm in making the diagnosis of AD in asymptomatic individuals who may not become ill for another 5 to 15 years."}, {"section_title": "Screen Everyone Who Wants a Scan", "text": "A great deal of variability exists among consumers in the desire to be tested. This variability will exist as long as treatments are lacking, but will likely diminish as treatments become available. In light of this, and for this scenario as well as the others described above:\n\u2022 Methods are needed for guaranteeing confidentiality of results.\n\u2022 Guidelines are needed for defining who should have access to results of testing when they are purchased for reasons that are not medically indicated.\n\u2022 Research is needed to assess the impact of results on personal liberty, selfimage, job security, and patient-physician and family relationships.\n\u2022 Currently unregulated methods for direct consumer advertising or direct physician advertising for imaging would benefit from professional selfregulation and guidelines for best practices. 17 We further note that the greater predictive power combined with the growing number of people with AD might be the brick that breaks the back of the current health care system."}, {"section_title": "Scanning Modalities", "text": "Efforts to improve the quality of imaging technologies are ongoing in a variety of domains, notably by increasing the availability of techniques and comfortable, well-validated clinical applications."}, {"section_title": "Patient Comfort", "text": "\u2022 Making techniques maximally comfortable, fast, and efficient is essential to enable patients, who have difficulty tolerating medical procedures, to be evaluated.

PET imaging of radioligands is expensive. If neuroimaging begins to play a larger role in routine clinical standard of care in AD, cost-effectiveness must be demonstrated. 18 Early diagnosis that enables earlier treatment that in turn delays the placement of a patient in a nursing home is one measure of cost reduction."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "\u2022 Increased patient numbers and procedures will justify acquisition operations costs for more medical centers."}, {"section_title": "Validation Studies for Diagnostic/Treatment Decision Making Individual Patients", "text": "\u2022 The majority of current studies of imaging techniques involve comparisons of groups of well-characterized subjects, but clinical decisions must be made for individuals.

These include issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, and privacy. The potential translation of neuroimaging research to clinical care intersects with a broader and significant number of potential ethical, legal, and social issues. In particular, it will yield sensitive personal information that will have to be handled with utmost ethical care. National and international laws and guidelines for research need to be carefully considered in the research design and recruitment phases of research given the current negative risk-benefit trade-off for individual AD volunteers often recruited from the pool of vulnerable volunteers (e.g., mentally disabled persons as alluded to in the Common Rule; Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects; 45 CFR 46).

These worthy goals are challenged by the still relatively immature state of the technology. Past events in the history of neuroscience and clinical medicine have taught us that such challenges must further take into consideration how culture and values differ in terms of what defines benefit and risk, and who will benefit and who is at risk. Methods must be set in place to assure not only maximum safety, comfort, and protection of subjects and patients, but also the educational and policy needs of all stakeholders.\nWe explored many issues here, resolved some, and left others open. Clearly, we also left many completely untouched. Overall, we conclude that as ethical paths are followed right alongside the development of powerful imaging tools, the future will hold ever-greater promise for AD patients and their families."}]
