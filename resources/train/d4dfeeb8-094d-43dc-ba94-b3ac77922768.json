A characteristic of these proteins is their spontaneous conversion from normal functional soluble proteins to pathologic, detergent-insoluble aggregates. These aggregates cause both functional deficits as well as gain-of-function toxicity leading to neurodegeneration [2] . Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposition of detergent-insoluble \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) as senile plaques, as well as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of aggregated tau [3, 4] . Increased deposition of A\u03b2 is thought to precede tangle formation, whereas tau pathology is more closely related to neuronal death and cognitive decline [3] [4] [5] . Converging biomarker evidence indicates that the progression of AD is characterized by an extended preclinical phase in which A\u03b2 pathology accumulates years in advance of cognitive symptoms [6] . This has led to the recognition of an asymptomatic phase of AD (AsymAD), whereby individuals exhibit brain A\u03b2 pathology in the absence of cognitive impairment. Thus, while A\u03b2 is proposed to have a central role in disease initiation [7] , plaque accumulation is not sufficient to incite tau aggregation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Currently the key protein aggregation events that co-occur with A\u03b2 and underlie conversion from AsymAD to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually AD are not well established. Defining these changes may aid in our understanding of the link between A\u03b2 deposition, disease-associated aggregation of tau, and ultimately cognitive decline.\nThe purpose of our study was to map the changes in the aggregated proteome occurring in AsymAD and through the transition to MCI and symptomatic stages of AD. To achieve this goal, we used well characterized postmortem brain tissues derived from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) [8] . The longitudinal design of this study enabled determination of cognitive status associated with the clinical progression of AD proximate to death. Employing label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified and quantified 2,711 detergent-insoluble proteins across the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 35 individual brain tissues from control, AsymAD, MCI and AD cases. This revealed significant enrichment of detergent insoluble A\u03b2 and tau, which correlated with neuropathological measurements of plaque and tangle density, respectively. We also confirmed apolipoprotein E (APOE), U1-70K (SNRNP70) and other core U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) as significantly enriched in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions in AD consistent with previously studies [9, 10] . To examine protein co-aggregation events linked AD pathology pairwise correlation coefficients were also determined for each quantified protein to A\u03b2 and tau, across the 35 individual cases. Notably, 6 of the 10 most correlated proteins to A\u03b2 were U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 snRNPs) even in the asymptomatic phase of AD. Three of these U1 snRNPs (U1A, SmD and U1-70K), also strongly correlated with tau insolubility consistent with their association with tangle pathology in AD [9, 10] . Additional proteins that cross-correlate with both insoluble A\u03b2 and tau included, among others, serum amyloid protein P (APCS) and APOE, which are known to associate with AD pathology in brain. Thus, proteins that cross-correlate with both A\u03b2 and tau identified in this study, including specific U1 snRNPs, may have potential mechanistic roles in linking A\u03b2 plaques to tau tangle pathology during AD progression."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical and neuropathological characteristics of cases", "text": "All brain tissue used in this analysis was derived from the autopsy collection of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).

Thirty-five cases were selected for proteomic analysis and sorted into the following four groups: i) cognitively intact individuals without AD pathology (controls), ii) cognitively intact individuals with AD pathology (AsymAD), iii) symptomatic individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD pathology and iv) symptomatic individuals with severe dementia and AD pathology.

The enrichment strategy for detergent-resistant fractions was performed as previously described [14] . In brief, frozen post-mortem tissue (200 \u00b1 20 mg) was dounce homogenized in 5 ml/g (20% w/v) of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA and 1\u00d7 HALT (Pierce) protease inhibitor cocktail). Following homogenization, sarkosyl (Nlauroylsarcosine) and NaCl were added to final concentrations of 1% (w/v) and 0.5 M, respectively (sarkosyl-buffer). This fraction was defined as the total brain homogenate and was sonicated (Sonic Dismembrator System, Fisher Scientific) with 3 \u00d7 5 sec pulses at 30% amplitude using a microtip probe to shear nucleic acids. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce).

The alkylated samples were separated on a 10% SDS gel and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Each sample lane was cut into five gel bands corresponding to molecular weight ranges to increase the depth of coverage of the proteome. The gel pieces were then digested overnight with trypsin (12.5 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0C. Samples were extracted in a solution of 5% formic acid and 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and following speed-vacuum evaporation an equal amount of each peptide sample was resuspended in loading buffer (0.1% formic acid, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1% acetonitrile). The resulting peptides were loaded onto a 20 cm nano-LC column (internal diameter 100 \u03bcm) packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 \u03bcm beads (Dr. Maisch, GmbH) and eluted over a 1 h reverse phase gradient comprised of 4-80% buffer B (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, 1% acetonitrile in water; Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) generated by a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation). Peptides were ionized with electrospray ionization (2.0 kV) and detected on a hybrid LTQ XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). MS1 spectra (30,000 resolution) were collected in the Orbitrap and data dependent acquisition of MS/MS spectra were obtained in the LTQ by collision induced dissociation (CID). The SageN Sorcerer SEQUEST 3.5 algorithm was used to search and match MS/MS spectra to a complete semi-tryptic human proteome database (NCBI reference sequence revision 54, with 66,652 entries) including pseudo-reversed decoy sequences [18, 19] . Searching parameters included precursor ion mass tolerance (\u00b120 ppm), partial tryptic restriction, fixed mass shift for modification of carbamidomethylated Cys (+57.0215 Da) and dynamic mass shift for oxidized Met (+15.9949). Only b and y ions were considered during the database match. In addition, X corr and \u0394Cn were dynamically increased for groups of peptides organized by a combination of trypticity (fully or partial) and precursor ion charge state to remove false positive hits and decoys until achieving a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 1%. Protein quantification was performed based on the extracted ion current (XIC) measurements of identified peptides as previously reported [15, 20] . Ion intensities for identified peptides were extracted in full-MS survey scans of high-resolution and a ratio of the peak intensities for the peptide precursor ion was calculated using in-house software as previously published [10, 15, 16, 21, 22] . Accurate peptide mass and retention time (RT) was used to derive signal intensity for every peptide across LC-MS/MS runs for each case. For those proteins identified by \u22653 peptides, we averaged the extracted ion intensities for the three most intense tryptic peptides [23] ."}, {"section_title": "Data normalization and statistical and correlation analysis", "text": "Protein signal-to-noise (S/N) values for the 5 control cases analyzed in both SDS-PAGE gels was normalized to minimize variance and leverage technical replicate measurements. Briefly, for every protein, which had S/N measurements averaging \u226520, the log 2 (S/N) average within gel was divided by the log 2 (S/N) average across both gels to arrive at a gelspecific normalization factor. This within-gel normalization factor was considered as a protein-specific multiplier and applied to each measurement for all samples within that particular gel. This resulted in cross-gel normalized protein measurements. The five control replicates and the AsymAD replicate were averaged, respectively, for subsequent statistical analysis. Differentially enriched or depleted proteins in the insoluble proteome of AsymAD, MCI and AD were found by calculating Student's t-test p values (unpaired) and fold change difference (\u00b11.5 fold) for the three pair wise comparisons versus control.

The number of significant proteins increased in tandem with disease status in cross-sectional analysis of AsymAD (n=55), MCI (n=81) and AD (n=176), indicating that global changes in the detergent-insoluble proteome and defects in proteostasis correlate with neuropathological burden and cognitive dysfunction.\nThere was also a strong correlation between detergent-insoluble A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) levels measured by mass spectrometry with CERAD measurements, consistent with the enrichment of aggregated A\u03b2 in AD (p=3.05E-10), MCI (p=0.023) and AsymAD (p=0.024) groups ( Fig. 2A and B ). Measurements of detergent insoluble APP in this study effectively represents the A\u03b2 peptide, as all fully tryptic APP peptides quantified mapped to the A\u03b2 region (residues 597-638) of the full length 695 residue protein. We also observed strong correlation between detergent-insoluble tau (MAPT) levels with Braak score (Fig. 2C) . Tau levels were only significant in AD cases and trended upwards in MCI cases compared to controls consistent with the strong correlation of NFT deposition with cognitive decline (Fig. 2D ) and other studies showing that tau lags behind A\u03b2 as a biomarker [3] . Apolipoprotein E (APOE), Amyloid P Component of Serum (APCS), COL25A1 and several members of the U1 snRNP complex (i.e., U1-70K, U1A and SmD corresponding to gene symbols SNRNP70, SNRPA, SNRPD1, respectively) were also increased in AD compared to control cases, consistent with previous proteomic studies of pooled AD cases from a different cohort [9, 10] (Fig. 3A and Table S2 ).\nTo analyze enrichment of aggregated proteins that participate in the same cellular components, biological processes, or molecular functions, we performed a GO (gene ontology) analysis of only those proteins significantly increased in AD aggregate proteomes versus control (Fig 3A and B) . We observed that many of the proteins increased in the insoluble AD proteome were found associated with cellular component and molecular function categories linked to mitochondria. Aggregation of these proteins is consistent with the loss of mitochondrial function and hypometabolic phenotype observed in living patients with AD [28] . Other targets mapping to \"steroid binding protein\" ontology included 17\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD17B10), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase like 2 (HSDL2) and Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 2 (PGRMC2). Brains of humans with AD and in transgenic AD mice exhibit elevated levels of 17\u03b2-HSD10 [29] , which has been shown to directly bind A\u03b2 [30] . Furthermore, mutations in the 17\u03b2-HSD10 gene results in a progressive infantile neurodegeneration due to mitochondrial dysfunction [31] . This provides a connection between steroid binding and several key proteins in the mitochondrial proteome that were significantly elevated in MCI and AD. Six total proteins including APP (A\u03b2) were found to be significantly altered in AsymAD, MCI and AD (Fig.  3A) . The other five proteins were all decreased in the insoluble fractions, and included syntaxin-binding protein 6 (STXBP6) and ribosome proteins (i.e., RPL12, SBDS, RPLP0, RPL12, RPLP1); the latter group implicates defects in protein translation that occur early and persist into the symptomatic phases of AD [32] . Of note, it is more challenging to interpret the biological significance of proteins found decreased in the AD insoluble proteome. A decrease in protein levels in the insoluble proteome may be due to an array of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms, the latter of which can have a significant impact on the structure, function, and localization of proteins in a cell. Namely, reduced proteins found in AD insoluble fractions as compared to controls are either (i) more effectively degraded, (ii) subject to preferential protein quality control-mediated reductions in their misfolded state(s), or iii) simply expressed at lower levels; whereas, enhanced insoluble protein signals signify (i) co-or post-translational folding (ii) degradation inefficiencies in disease and/or (iii) an overall increase in protein expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that the detergent-insoluble proteome is a biochemical fraction that harbors robust differences between distinct cognitive and pathological states, providing insights into disease-associated disruptions in proteostasis [33] . Significant proteins as well as GO terms for proteins increased and decreased across all three pairwise comparisons (AsymAD, MCI and AD) versus control are provided in Tables S2 and S3 ."}, {"section_title": "Defining proteins that correlate with A\u03b2 and tau levels in the aggregated brain proteome", "text": "A major goal of this study was to define preclinical changes in the AsymAD cases that correlate with detergent insoluble A\u03b2, which could also be linked to tau aggregation in symptomatic phases of AD. To assess this, we first determined the bi-weight mid-correlation (Bicor) coefficient for all 2,711 pairwise protein comparisons with A\u03b2 and Tau, respectively, across all 35 individual cases ( Table 1 and Table S4 ). Bicor is a median based correlation measure and less susceptible to outliers than the Pearson correlation [34] . Remarkably, 6 of the top 10 most correlated proteins to insoluble A\u03b2 included core members of the U1 snRNP complex (i.e., SNRNP70, SNRPA, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPB and SNRPD3). The most significant was U1-70K (SNRNP70) with a Bicor=0.79, and p value=1.01\u00d710 \u22128 . Others include glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB), norrin (NDP), guanine nucleotide binding protein, beta polypeptide 3 (GNB3) and serum amyloid protein P (APCS). It should be noted that mutations in NDP cause Norrie disease an X-linked recessive disorder [35] and NDP was recently found significantly up-regulated in PSEN1 familial AD iPSC-derived neural progenitors, indicating a potential link between NDP and presenilin-1 function [36] .\nAlthough A\u03b2 aggregation is an early event in AD, the deposition of A\u03b2 does not strongly correlate with the presence of tau NFTs [12, 37] . Consistently, insoluble tau was not significantly correlated to insoluble A\u03b2 (bicor=0.3, p=0.07) across all 35 BLSA cases in this study (Table S4 ). By contrast, the most correlated proteins to tau in the insoluble proteome were APOE followed by U1A and another RNA binding protein, SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein (SLIRP). Other proteins that were highly correlated to tau included FK506 binding protein 4 (FKBP4) and serine protease HTRA1 (HTRA1), both of which have been reported to associate with tau pathology in animal models and/or humans, respectively [38, 39] . To prioritize the most correlated proteins to both tau and/or A\u03b2, we generated a cross-correlation network in Cytoscape (Fig 4) [24] . These included SNRPA (U1A) and APCS; the latter directly associates with both A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [40] . Other U1 snRNPs, U1-70K, SmD, NUDT21, were also correlated with both A\u03b2 and Tau aggregation, but to a lesser degree than U1A (Table S4 ). Despite their strong cross-correlation with both insoluble A\u03b2 and tau, U1A, U1-70K and SmD associate exclusively with NFTs and not A\u03b2 plaques in AD brain [9, 27] ."}, {"section_title": "U1 snRNPs aggregate in AsymAD consistent with their strong correlation with insoluble A\u03b2 levels", "text": "The strong correlation with U1 snRNPs and A\u03b2 described above is consistent with the coenrichment of U1-70K, U1A and SmD in individual AsymAD and MCI cases (Fig 5A and  B) . Furthermore, an increase in U1-70K levels was confirmed in certain AsymAD cases by western blot analysis (Fig. 5C ). Although U1-70K associates with NFTs in AD frontal cortex, immunohistochemical studies showed some discordant distributions of U1-70K and tau aggregates in certain brain regions [9] , suggesting that the aggregation of U1-70K could occur independently. To test this possibility, we performed double-labeled immunofluorescence microscopy on AD cortical sections using antibodies against U1-70K and phosphorylated tau (AT8) (Fig. 5D ). U1-70K and phosphorylated tau co-aggregated in cells consistent with previous reports [9] , whereas certain cells displayed cytoplasmic tangle-like structures were either immunoreactive for U1-70K or AT8 antibodies independent of each other. This observation coupled with the label-free proteomics, highlighting U1-70K insolubility in AsymAD and strong correlation to A\u03b2 prior to significant tau deposition ( Fig 5A) , suggests that U1-70K can aggregate in the absence of tau deposition. Additional studies will be needed to resolve the temporal sequence of events and mechanisms linking A\u03b2 and tau with U1-70K aggregation events."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we utilized label free mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to quantify 2,711 detergent-insoluble proteins across the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 35 individuals representing control, AsymAD, MCI and AD cases. As expected, A\u03b2 was significantly increased in AsymAD, MCI and AD cases, which correlated with CERAD, whereas insoluble tau levels correlated with Braak, and significantly increased in symptomatic stages of disease. To examine protein co-aggregation events linked AD pathology pairwise correlation coefficients were also determined for each quantified protein to A\u03b2 and tau, across all cases. Notably, 6 of the 10 most correlated proteins to A\u03b2 were U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 snRNPs). Three of these U1 snRNPs (U1A, SmD and U1-70K), also strongly correlated with tau insolubility consistent with their association with tangle pathology in AD. Additional proteins that cross-correlate with both insoluble A\u03b2 and tau included, among others, serum amyloid protein P (APCS), APOE and complement C3 each with roles in AD pathophysiology [40] [41] [42] . Together this these findings support the utility of label-free proteomics to identify targets in the detergent-insoluble proteome linked to AD neuropathology and clinical progression.\nWe have previously reported an association of cytoplasmic aggregated U1 snRNPs with tau tangles in both sporadic [9, 14] and familial cases of AD [43] , but not in other tauopathies. However, this is the first report of U1 snRNP aggregation in the AsymAD cases, defined by significant A\u03b2 deposition in the absence of significant cortical tau deposition and cognitive impairment. Although the mechanisms underlying the relationship between A\u03b2, Tau, and U1 snRNP aggregation are unknown our proteomic findings are potentially consistent with a model in which detergent-insoluble A\u03b2 levels influence U1 snRNP aggregation in brain, which may precede and possibly influence subsequent tau deposition into insoluble aggregates. Importantly, A\u03b2 is secreted and predominantly aggregates in the extracellular space; whereas tau is intracellular, and is mislocalized from the axonal to the cytoplasmic and dendritic compartments in AD [44] . Prior to nuclear import, U1 snRNP biogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm [45] , potentially bringing U1 snRNP components into contact with Tau and/or under the influence of intracellular signaling events triggered by extracellular A\u03b2. It has recently been recognized that numerous RNA-binding proteins-including many components of the spliceosome-are enriched for prion-like, low complexity (LC) domains that may predispose to fibrillization [46, 47] , including co-aggregation with established neurodegenerative disease proteins such as FUS [48] , hnRNPA1 [49] and even Tau [50] . In our prior work, we discovered evidence for splicing impairment in AD potentially consistent with spliceosomal functional disruption [9] . We also showed that LC domains in U1-70K were important for aggregation [14] suggesting that the aggregation properties of U1 snRNPs in AD are similar to the aforementioned RNA binding proteins in other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in two independent screens performed in Drosophila models, genetic manipulation of selected spliceosome components (including the homolog of SNRPB) modulated Tau-induced neurotoxicity in vivo [51, 52] . Separately, in a RNA-interference screen conducted in Drosophila cell culture, manipulation of multiple orthologs of U1 snRNP components (i.e., SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRNP70 and SNRPB2) influenced A\u03b2 production [53] , suggesting the possibility of reciprocal interactions. Thus, additional investigation is needed to resolve the precise sequence and mechanisms linking A\u03b2 and Tau deposition to U1 snRNP aggregation and the potential connection to neuronal dysfunction and death in AD pathogenesis.\nOther notable proteins that cross-correlated with A\u03b2 and Tau insolubility included those with previously described roles in AD (i.e., APCS, NDP, PLCD3, ANXA5, HTRA1, and complement C3). For example, APCS has a binding site in fibrillar A\u03b2, and has been shown to promote A\u03b2 accumulation via inhibition of its degradation [54] . Another protein that may be derived from either serum or CSF which co-aggregated with both A\u03b2 and tau based on correlation analysis was ANXA5. This protein was decreased specifically in the CSFproducing choroid plexus in early AD stages [55] , but increased in blood serum of AD patients [56] . HTRA1, high-temperature requirement serine protease A1, has been linked to inflammation and increases significantly with marked frailty in aged individuals [57] . Phospholipase C may under normal circumstances play a protective role by releasing membrane-associated A\u03b2 that is more likely to aggregate and promote neuronal loss [58, 59] . Complement C3 in the brain is primarily expressed by microglia [60] , and is essential in the process of microglial-mediated early synaptic loss in AD models [61] . Thus, our strategy of identifying cross-correlated proteins with enhanced aggregation in AD brain is valid for identifying proteins with roles in pathological aggregation of A\u03b2. Moreover, the proteins which cross-correlate with both A\u03b2 and tau such as the proteins pictured in magenta in Fig.  4 are likely to have yet to be determined mechanistic roles in bridging the formation of plaques to the onset of clinical dementia symptoms, which coincides with NFT formation [3] . Modulation of these proteins, and perhaps some of those which correlate exclusively with tau insolubility (turquoise nodes in Fig. 4) , are therefore excellent targets to assess direct associations with A\u03b2 and/or tau in model systems.\nFinally, a special class of proteins involved in proteostasis, chaperones, should be particularly scrutinized in our correlation analysis (Table S2) , where depleted chaperones may also indicate a failure to engage amyloid or tau in attempts at refolding or protein quality control. Within that list, HSPA12A and prefoldins stand out as excellent candidates for mitigation of both A\u03b2 and tau aggregation in normal, healthy age-matched controls. We have also shown previously that co-aggregation can be mediated by post-translational modifications [62] including ubiquitination [63] or cleavage [64, 65] . Thus, further investigation of co-aggregated and depleted proteins involved in post-translational modification may point to other interesting avenues of exploration for AD mechanistic insight. Our results highlight the utility of label-free mass spectrometry proteomics to identify disease-specific protein aggregation event that co-occur in different stages of AD, including AsymAD and MCI. Mechanistic inquiry of these new targets may enhance our understanding of potential pathways linking A\u03b2 to tau aggregation and subsequent cognitive decline in AD."}, {"section_title": "Statement of Significance", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the extracellular deposition of detergentinsoluble \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) as senile plaques and intracellular accumulation of aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles. Strong evidence indicates that A\u03b2 deposition starts years prior to clinical symptoms, which has prompted widespread recognition of an asymptomatic phase of AD (AsymAD). Currently the key protein aggregation events that co-occur with A\u03b2 and tau and associate with conversion from AsymAD to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually symptomatic AD are not well established. To fill this gap in knowledge we employed label-free mass spectrometry proteomics to quantify sarkosylinsoluble proteins across the prefrontal cortex of 35 individual cases representing control, AsymAD, MCI and AD. Pairwise correlation analysis revealed that core members of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) complex were some of the most highly correlated proteins to A\u03b2, even in the asymptomatic stage of disease. Three U1 snRNPs (U1A, SmD and U1-70K) also cross-correlated with insoluble tau, consistent with their association with tangle pathology in AD brain. Our findings support a hypothesis that specific members of the U1 snRNP complex have a potential mechanistic role in linking A\u03b2 plaques to tau tangle pathology during AD progression."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.
