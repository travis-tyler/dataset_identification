Manabe et al. (1970) and Bengtsson et al. (1982) performed low-resolution model experiments in coarse horizontal resolution, which simulated a TC-like low-level disturbance using a GCM. With an increase of spatial resolution, GCMs have realistically resolved the spatial distribution of main TC development regions and pathways as well as their inter-annual changes (Vitart et al., 1997; Bengtsson et al., 2007; LaRow et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Chen and Lin, 2011) . Zhao et al. (2009) tested the 50-km horizontal resolution run to show the realistic secular trend of TC number over the whole TC development basins. They also found that the inter-annual variation of TC number with four-member ensemble simulations was significantly correlated with the observed in WNP and NATL when the model was driven by observed SST.\nOther studies also addressed that a major leading tropical SST mode, ENSO, had the significant impact on the simulated TC variability in inter-annual timescale, for example, the genesis number, intensity, and geographical distribution of TCs over WNP (Chan, 1985; Matsuura et al., 1999; Vitart and Anderson, 2001; Mei et al., 2015; Han et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) and NATL (Wang et al., 2014; Mei et al., 2014) , respectively.\nIn the high-resolution GCM intercomparison studies conducted by the US CLIVAR Hurricane Working Group (http://www.usclivar.org/working-groups/hurricane) (Shaevitz et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Walsh et al., 2015; Han et al., 2016) , Shaevitz et al. (2014) showed that even though a few models were able to reproduce realistic TC activities with high correlation with observations, there was a wide spread in TC intensity and genesis number among the simulations by tested 12 GCMs. Specifically, most of the models exhibited a severe underprediction in TC intensity. The inter-model differences appear to be associated largely with the differences in horizontal resolution and model physics parameterization, but what drives these differences are not clearly understood and remain to be answered in future studies.\nModel resolution has been regarded as one of the critical contributors to improve the simulated frequency of TCs (Walsh et al., 2007; Walsh et al., 2013; Murakami et al., 2015) . Successively increasing the resolution in a GCM shifted the probability distribution function (PDF) distribution of low-level absolute vorticity towards a stronger magnitude, which tended to improve the TC genesis (Strachan et al., 2013) . Overall TC intensity was intensified with more realistic relationship between the maximum 10-m wind speed and the minimum sea level pressure (SLP) in higher resolution experiments with a single model . A 25-km resolution run of the GEOS-5 GCM was able to simulate intensive TCs as strong as 65 m/s in the maximum surface wind speed . The model was further tested in 7 and 14-km resolution to demonstrate the ability to simulate the category 5 TCs based on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale (Saffir, 1977) as well as TC vertical structure with a distinguishable eyewall (Putman and Suarez, 2011) , although such a large computing resource would not be available for routine forecasts in the current state.\nThere have been other studies attempting to improve the TC simulation through adjusting convective parameterization scheme in global models (Slingo et al., 1994; Smith, 2000; Sanderson et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2015) . Several studies controlled the scheme by applying a minimum entrainment threshold for convective plumes (Tokioka et al., 1988; Lee et al., 2003; Held et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008) . Using the threshold, Lim et al. (2015) simulated more realistic spatial feature of TCs and their intensity over NATL for several years at 25-km horizontal resolution. That study found a strong sensitivity of the simulated TCs to the modified convection scheme, where it tended to suppress the parameterized convection and increase ambient atmospheric instability, leading to stronger convection once triggered. The simulation result from Lim et al. (2015) suggests that even at 25-km horizontal resolution, improvement in the TC simulation should not be a direct consequence of the resolution increase. Considering that different GCMs in relatively coarse resolution of 50 km or lower such as in LaRow et al. (2008) and Zhao et al. (2009) simulated realistic inter-annual variation of TC frequency, it is worthy of more in-depth studies how the moist physics parameterizations, specifically the modification of the cumulus convection scheme within model, can influence on the TC simulation as well as on the background state. The model sensitivity runs using a single model will highlight the important role of the convection scheme among the various physics parameterizations implemented in the model and help understand the inter-model differences appearing in the previous GCM intercomparison studies.\nThis study using the GEOS-5 model at 50-km horizontal resolution is basically an extension of Lim et al. (2015) . Using an identical model, the previous study demonstrated substantial improvement in the TC simulation in terms of their development region and pathways in NATL, although the impacts from the modified convection scheme on model background state and the TC simulations remained for a further study. This study examines to what degree the modification in the convection scheme could achieve improvements in the TC simulation, yet preserving realistic time-mean state, based on long-term ensemble model integration that help address the impacts from inter-annually varying SST on the TC variability. The comparison of this study with Lim et al. (2015) helps address if the modification is also positive even at 50-km horizontal resolution, not only in NATL but also in WNP. The study further investigates if there are any negative impacts on the model background state. This study presents here; (a) the impacts driven by the modification of convective parameterization on the time-mean state and subseasonal variability, and (b) the seasonal to inter-annual variability of TC. The GEOS-5 with modified convective parameterization is utilized for five-member ensemble simulations over 12 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) .\nIn section 2, we introduce the GEOS-5 experimental design with the specific parameterization methodology for how to modify the deep convective scheme. In addition, the description of observational data sets and an algorithm used to detecting the simulated TCs are described in the section. Section 3 presents the results from the mean climatology of atmospheric backgrounds, and TC climatology, inter-annual variation and sensitivity to ENSO. Finally, summary and conclusion are given in section 4."}, {"section_title": "| MODEL EXPERIMENT AND DATA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Model experiments", "text": "This study uses the GEOS-5 model developed by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office Molod et al., 2012) . Model experiments are conducted with a version of 50-km horizontal resolution and 72 hybridsigma vertical levels extending to 0.01 hPa. The model is integrated from May 15 to December 1 each year for the entire period of 12 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ) with prescribed weekly SST forcing (Reynolds et al., 2002) from Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature observation data (HadISST; Rayner et al., 2003) .\nThe model is driven with a modified version of the RAS deep convection scheme (Moorthi and Suarez, 1992) . Major modifications from the original version include the selection of convection starting level at the top of the planetary boundary layer. The convective adjustment timescale for the convective plumes increases linearly from 30 min to 12 hr at the increase of the vertical depth of plumes. An important modification is the implementation of the minimum entrainment rate (\u03bb 0 ) threshold for convective plumes, which is defined as \u03bb 0 = \u03b1/D m , where \u03b1 = 0.2 is a fixed parameter and D m is the state-dependent parameter representing the depth of the sub-cloud layer (Tokioka et al., 1988) . Lim et al. (2015) selected D m randomly with a power law probability distribution as\nwhere \u03b2 is an allowable maximum plume radius (Simpson and Wiggert, 1969) , x is a random number between 0 and 1 for each integration time step and n = \u22121/2. Based on the initial observational study, \u03b2 is objectively determined by the spatial resolution of the simulation (Bacmeister and Stephens, 2011) . For the 50-km horizontal resolution run in this study, \u03b2 is set to 500. The specification of \u03bb 0 acts not only as a convection trigger (\u03bb \u2265 \u03bb 0 , \u03bb is the simulated entrainment rate), but also affects the closure assumption where the cloud work function for each plume is multiplied by a factor:\nTo examine the simulation sensitivity to the stochastic limit of the entrainment for convective plumes, we conduct the runs with and without the modification for 12 years research period, which is referred to as \"MOD\" and \"STD,\" respectively. Five ensemble runs for the MOD configuration are produced by using different initial states for atmosphere and land, which are selected randomly from existing long-term simulations. For a comparison, this study also conducts one-member STD experiment with unmodified cumulus scheme. To be discussed in Section 3b, the original version of GEOS-5 (STD) tends to underestimate the TC number significantly. Although the STD run consists of only a single realization the results are not expected to be different significantly from the case of multiple realizations."}, {"section_title": "| Validation data", "text": "Simulated precipitation are validated with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; Huffman et al., 2007) product 3B42 version 7 observation data, which are 3-hourly data in 25-km horizontal resolution.

The thresholds cover the critical values for dynamic and thermodynamic variables characterizing major features of TCs, including relative vorticity at 850 hPa (\u03b6 850 ), wind speed at 10 m (V 10 ) above the surface, and the vertically integrated temperature anomalies (T sum ) for 200, 500, and 700 hPa levels. The algorithm first calculates standard deviations for those variables using 6-hourly data for the entire time and spatial domain and for each basin. Then the algorithm searches the domain by moving a 5 \u00d7 5 box at 6-hr interval data and detects TCs when all three variables at any instant time and location exceed 2 (WNP) and 1.5 (NATL) times of their standard deviation values simultaneously. Besides, the detected TC needs to sustain longer than 2 days. Once any specific TC is detected, then the tracking algorithm reconstructs the entire path by tracking the vorticity centre back and forth when it meets the 850hP vorticity threshold of 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 or higher.

In this study, we adopt the concept of ACE.

Figure 1 compares the June-October mean precipitation patterns averaged for 12 years between the TRMM observation and the two model simulations with the standard deep convection scheme (STD) and the modified scheme (MOD), respectively. Regardless of the differences in convection scheme, both simulations (Figure 1b, c) in general show realistic precipitation patterns. Both simulations also show similar bias patterns, such as stronger Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the central and eastern Pacific and larger rainfall in the Northwest Pacific, and the double ITCZs-like pattern in the Indo-Pacific region with a dry zone in between those two ITCZs. While the mean precipitation simulated in MOD is improved from STD in the northern Indian Ocean, the NATL, and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the simulation is degraded in the Philippine Sea (Figure 1d , e). Overall, the modified convection scheme does not alter the systematic biases in the control simulation.\nAlthough zonal-mean total precipitation also shows no significant change between the two simulations, they exhibit a different ratio of convective and stratiform precipitation ( Figure 2 ). This suggests that the implementation of stochastic limit of entrainment rate tends to suppress deep convection and instead more rainfall is generated by large-scale condensation scheme. Held et al. (2007) and Lee et al. (2008) showed the sensitivity of large-scale stratiform precipitation to the minimum entrainment threshold increase that suppresses deep convection. The simulated ratio of stratiform precipitation to total is changed from 50% in STD to 62% in MOD in the . This is comparable or somewhat larger than the observed value of about 40% estimated by Schumacher and Houze Jr (2003) using TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data, although the separation method is not exactly the same between the observation and the model simulation.\nThe modification in the convection scheme leads to significant changes in the vertical profile of temperature and humidity in the Tropics, thereby changing atmospheric vertical stability. Figure 3a is the zonal-mean vertical profiles of temperature over the , where both simulations show reliable vertical structure as compared with the MERRA reanalysis. STD reveals systematic warm biases in the boundary layer and the upper troposphere, whereas MOD shows overall cold bias through nearly the entire vertical column except near-surface level. MOD tends to reduce the overall moist bias in STD, leading to a more realistic humidity profile ( Figure 3b ). Increasing minimum entrainment threshold in the MOD simulation makes colder and drier than STD-produced atmosphere in the mid-to upper troposphere, likely due to less frequent convective adjustment and less vertical transport of energy and moisture by deep convection scheme. This process can decrease vertical stability in the simulated background state. As shown in Figure 3c , the modified convection scheme decreases the moist static energy (MSE) throughout the vertical column. Large reduction of MSE can effectively increase the convective available potential energy (CAPE) of rising plumes, which can provide a more favourable condition for strong convection once convection is occasionally triggered. The vertical gradient of equivalent potential temperature (\u2212d\u03b8 e / dp) becomes more negative in lower levels and more positive in upper levels, indicating an overall decrease of vertical stability in moist atmosphere ( Figure 3d ). This result is consistent with the result from Lim et al. (2015) where the modified convection scheme was tested at 25-km horizontal resolution. It is also noted that the modified convection scheme tends to simulate more realistic profiles of moisture, MSE, and -d\u03b8 e /dp. Constraining convection scheme by increasing minimum entrainment threshold tends to increase the precipitation variability in an intra-seasonal timescale (e.g., Tokioka et al., 1988; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008) . This aspect is better illustrated in Figure 4 , where we compare the simulated rainfall variance in the Tropics using timelyunfiltered daily precipitation data. The modified convection scheme tends to increase the rainfall variability significantly, while STD tends to underestimate the variance as compared with TRMM (cf., Figure 4a ,c,e). In MOD, the rainfall variability has been increased particularly in the deep convection region including main development regions (MDRs) of TC in WNP and NATL. MDR refers to a region where TCs occur predominantly in WNP (0 -20 N, 115 -165 E) and NATL (10 -20 N, 20 -80 W). As will be discussed in the following sections, the simulated TC frequency has been increased substantially by the modified convection scheme, as well as with the significant increase in the TC intensity from the control simulation (not shown). It is interesting to note that the modification also increases low-frequency precipitation variability on subseasonal timescale of 20-100 days (cf., Figure 4b ,d,f). This is a well-known feature by previous studies (e.g., Tokioka et al., 1988; Lee et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2016) , although the tested models are more or less different from one another. In this timescale, the tropical atmosphere has a pronounced convective variability associated with the eastwards propagating Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which also tends to influence development of TCs and their passages to mid-latitudes. Figure 5 shows the eastwards propagation of MJO in the observation and the simulations, as examined Diff.

The propagation signal is marginal in STD. It is consistent with the previous MJO diagnostic study with climate models (Kim et al., 2009) , in which GEOS-5 control AMIP simulation did not reveal eastwards propagation. The feature is improved significantly in MOD with more realistic temporal evolution of tropical convection, particularly with the eastwards progression of MJO across the Maritime Continent towards the Northwest Pacific. In another study using the same GEOS-5 model with the modified convection scheme , the model was able to reproduce the modulation of TC activity by MJO realistically in the Northwest Pacific. Note that the simulated propagation speed is approximately 10 m/s, somewhat faster than the observed. This faster propagation speed is typical in most atmospheric GCMs driven by observed SST (Waliser et al., 1999; Roundy and Kravitz, 2009) , and it may be associated with a lack of air-sea interaction in the model."}, {"section_title": "| TC climatology", "text": "We next examine the realism of TCs simulated by the GEOS-5 model at 50-km horizontal resolution with the modified convection scheme, in terms of the genesis regions, tracks, and intensity of TCs, and the seasonal variation of the TC number over WNP and NATL, respectively. Simulation improvement by modified convection scheme is also examined by comparing the STD and the MOD runs. Figure 6 shows the spatial distribution of TC genesis locations and tracks over WNP during May 15 to November 30 for the past 12 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . It is noted that MOD tends to improve the simulation of TC genesis number significantly. It produces 18.5 TCs per year on average, which is quite close to the observed value. However, the STD run produces only 11.2 TCs, which is about a half of the observed value. Figure 6b ) and MOD ( Figure 6c ) corresponds well to the observed distribution, although the MDR is shifted to the east. This bias is associated with the deficiency in the simulation of the time-mean climatology of mid-tropospheric vertical motion. The centre of upwards motion tends to be shifted to the east both in STD and MOD compared with the observation (see Figure S1 , Supporting Information). The vertical motion in MOD becomes stronger in the MDR, which is a favourable condition for increasing TC genesis number. Simulated tracks seem to be realistic in both simulations, as they reproduce the main passage across the South China Sea and the east of the Philippines (Figure 6d ,e,f). However, both simulations show the deficiency in the recurving TCs moving northeastwards after turning points. The geographical distribution of TC genesis and track simulated by MOD is broader than the case of STD, which seems to be related with the underestimation of TC number in the STD run with a single member. In NATL, most of observed TCs are developed in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and near the central Atlantic Ocean (Figure 7a ). TC track density shows that the developed TCs are recurved along the western coast of Central America (Figure 7d ). This observed feature is reasonably reproduced by both GEOS-5 experiments. Most of TCs simulated by STD are found over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea (Figure 7b ), and they landfall over the southeastern United States and travel to the northern Mexico (Figure 7e ). On the other hand, many of TCs reproduced by MOD are found over the Caribbean Sea, and near the central Atlantic Ocean (Figure 7c) , and landfalling TCs at the U.S. coast appear to weaken more rapidly than observations, showing relatively the lower track density values over the southeastern U.S. continent ( Figure 7f) . As in the case of WNP, the STD experiment also underestimates the TC genesis number in NATL. The TC genesis number has been increased by the modified convective parameterization (MOD). This result is consistent well with Lim et al. (2015) , where the modified convection scheme leads to a substantial increase in the TC frequency in this model run at 25-km horizontal resolution. It is noted that MOD still underestimates the TC genesis number over the basin, which seems to be related with the overall weak vertical motion simulated by the model over the entire NATL except for the tropical eastern area (see Figure S1 ). In particular, MOD tends to underestimate the TC genesis in the Gulf of Mexico, even smaller than STD, where the weak vertical motion bias becomes worse. On the other hand, TC genesis tends to be overpredicted in MOD over tropical NATL, which corresponds well to the unrealistically strong vertical motion in MOD over this region. Figure 8 compares the PDF of the maximum 10-m wind speed and the minimum SLP, respectively, for individual TC lifetime by the IBTrACS best track data and two different GEOS-5 model experiments. The vertical dashed lines in maximum 10-m wind speed PDF represent regimes of the TC intensity scale (Saffir, 1977) . MOD seems to simulate categories 2 and 3 in WNP whereas the observed PDF is widely spread till category 4, but STD cannot ever simulate category 1 (Figure 8a ). The simulated minimum SLP is underestimated in WNP (Figure 8b ). In NATL, MOD can resolve at most category 3 storms, where there are observed storms as intensive as category 5, even though STD is bounded at category 1 (Figure 8c) . SLP is also systematically underestimated by the GEOS-5 model (Figure 8d ). The TC intensity simulated by a GCM seems to depend on model physics parameterization as well as the horizontal resolution. Another 50-km resolution run by HiRAM (Zhao et al., 2009 ) was able to simulate up to category 3 storms in WNP and NATL.\nIn addition, we explore the relationship between the 10-m maximum wind speed and minimum SLP in Figure 9 . In the observation, the slope in WNP is steeper than NATL, which suggests that the decreasing rate of minimum SLP is larger in WNP at the increase of surface wind speed (Figure 9a,d) . Stronger TCs are observed in NATL than in WNP for the 12-year statistics. The observed maximum wind speed reaches up to 59 m/s in WNP and 82 m/s in NATL, with the minimum SLP of 900 and 882 hPa, respectively. In WNP, MOD shows realistic relationship between minimum SLP and maximum wind speed (Figure 9c ). It can also reproduce realistic maximum wind speed, where minimum SLP reaches as low as 923 hPa and the maximum wind speed as high as 52 m/s, respectively. The MOD run also shows realistic relationship between minimum SLP and maximum wind speed, although the intensity is somewhat underestimated (Figure 9f ). Obviously this is an improvement from STD in WNP (Figure 9b ) and NATL (Figure 9e ), which is made by the modified convection scheme. Lim et al. (2015) conducted a 25-km resolution run with the same model used in this study, which was able to resolve the TCs as intensified as 65 m/s in maximum wind speed in NATL. Putman and Suarez (2011) also addressed much finer horizontal resolution such as in 14-km is required to simulate TCs as strong as in the category 5. Figure 10 compares the monthly variation of TC genesis number of the observation, STD, and MOD. In the observations, the TC genesis is at its maximum phase in August in WNP, while it peaks in September in NATL. MOD reproduces the observed peaks realistically both in August in WNP (Figure 10a ) and in September in NATL (Figure 10b ). The STD run is less realistic as it shows a less pronounced seasonal variation with an erroneous peak in October in WNP, and it also shows unrealistically sharp peak in September in NATL. Due to much smaller detected TCs in STD, it shows much weaker seasonal variation in TC genesis for both basins compared with the observations and MOD."}, {"section_title": "| Inter-annual variation", "text": "In this section, we compare the inter-annual variation of the variables that characterize the basin-wide TC activity. The TC activity is represented by ACE, which can be decomposed into the individual TC intensity, and the duration for all TCs. The duration for all TCs can be further separated into the number TCs and the individual TC lifetime as derived in section 2.4. Figures 11 and 12 show the year-to-year variation of ACE components for the observation and the model simulations in WNP (Figure 11 ) and NATL (Figure 12) , respectively. The figures show that STD has a significant underestimation for most of ACE components due to much smaller TCs simulated by STD. In MOD, the time series correlations have been improved and becomes statistically significant for most statistics in WNP (Table 1) , although the correlation improvement is not notable in NATL. This C5  C4  C3  C1 C2  C5  C4  C3  C1 C2  C5  C4  C3   C1 C2  C5  C4  C3  C1 C2  C5  C4  C3  C1 C2  C5  C4 basin-dependent sensitivity will be discussed later in the next subsection. The correlation coefficient (hereafter correlation coefficients of the detrended time series are given in parenthesis) for year-to-year variation of ACE in WNP is 0.46 (0.63) (Figure 11a ). In this case, only the detrended correlation is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. The correlation with the STD run is not statistically significant even with detrended time series (r = 0.43). On the other hand, the individual TC intensity is underestimated by the model with no significant correlation with the observed (Figure 11b ), as the model has an intrinsic difficulty in reproducing the individual TC intensity as given in Figures 8  and 9 . The inter-annual variability of ACE is mostly explained by that of TC duration (i.e., the total number of TC days). The correlation for the duration is 0.50 (0.67), where only the detrended correlation is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (Figure 11c ). When we separate the duration for all TCs into the number of TC (Figure 11d ) and the individual TC lifetime (Figure 11e ), the correlation for the TC genesis number and the lifetime becomes 0.39 (0.74) and 0.62 (0.58), respectively. This suggests that the duration is more contributed by TC lifetime rather than TC number. The correlation with the TC genesis number is significant only for the case with the detrended time series. Correlation for the TC genesis number over WNP is comparable to the values obtained from other studies, which is around 0.5 by GFDL Atmospheric Model version 2.1 (AM2.1) (Zhao et al., 2009) , ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) (Manganello et al., 2012) , and MRI-AGCM version 3.1 and 3.2 (Murakami et al., 2012) . TC individual lifetime shows significant correlation regardless of trend in the time series, in spite of an overestimation of the lifetime for the entire analysis period. The problem is associated with the eastwards shift of TC genesis location in WNP (c.f. Figure 6c) , which results in the extension of TC travelling time in the ocean. Figure 12 compares the case of NATL. STD and MOD show statistically significant correlations for ACE with r = 0.64 and r = 0.72 for detrended time series, respectively. However, the discrepancy of ACE components between the observation and the model simulations becomes even larger than the case in WNP, in terms of magnitude and the yearto-year variation. While the discrepancy in magnitude between the observed and the simulated TC is mostly due to the underestimation of individual TC intensity in WNP, the simulated ACE magnitude over NATL is much smaller not only due to the underestimated individual intensity but also due to much less TCs in the model simulation. This is the case for both STD and MOD runs, although the underestimation of TC number is particularly notable in STD.\nNote that the individual TC lifetime is overall longer in the simulations over NATL. As shown in Figure 7c , the majority of TCs are generated in the central to eastern equatorial Atlantic in MOD, resulting in longer duration than the observed as they migrate towards the mid-latitudes. The correlation for ACE between the observed and the simulated is 0.63 (0.72), statistically significant at the 95 and 99% confidence level, respectively (Figure 12a) . The correlation for the individual TC intensity is 0.51 (0.61), where only the detrended correlation is statistically significant at the 95% Note. * is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level and ** indicates the confidence level over 99%.\nconfidence level (Figure 12b ). On the other hand, the TC duration and its components show no significant correlation ( Figure 12c) . The model simulation does not reproduce a realistic inter-annual variability for the number TCs (r = 0.38 for the original and detrended time series) and the individual TC lifetime (r = 0.16 for the original and r = 0.02 for the detrended time series), where correlation values of them are statistically not significant (Figure 12d,e) . Based on previous studies, correlation for the TC genesis number over NATL shows a large spread across the models, implying that the TC simulation is quite challenging in this region. Some models such as Florida State University (FSU) AGCM (LaRow et al., 2008) and GFDL AM2.1 (Zhao et al., 2009) show the correlation as good as 0.78 and 0.83, respectively, and other models such as EMCWF-IFS (Manganello et al., 2012) and MRI-AGCM (Murakami et al., 2012) exhibit the values around or below 0.5. The correlation between the observed ACE and individual TC intensity, number of TC, and individual TC lifetime is, respectively, 0.86, 0.89, and 0.90 in WNP (if the correlation value is over 0.57, statistically significant at the 95% confidence level). The GEOS-5 tends to reproduce those observed relationship with the correlation values of 0.63, 0.75, and 0.57, respectively, all significant at the 95% confidence level. In NATL, the observed ACE is significantly related with individual TC intensity (r = 0.71) and number of TC (r = 0.90), but its relationship with the individual TC lifetime is not significant (r = 0.32). The model simulation also shows significant correlations between simulated ACE and individual TC intensity (r = 0.81) and number of TC (r = 0.83) even though the correlation with the individual TC lifetime is high (r = 0.76). The GEOS-5 is able to reproduce the observed relationship between ACE and its components in both of basins. Therefore, the model driven by yearly varying SST boundary condition practically reproduces the inter-annual variation of the basin-wide ACE. However, the simulated correlations between ACE and its individual components are relatively weaker than the observed. This suggests there are still much room to improve the model simulation through improving the horizontal resolution and the physics parameterization. Bister and Emanuel (1998) pointed out the important role of oceanic SST forcing in increasing TC's kinetic energy. As the oceanic SST has a pronounced inter-annual variation due to ENSO, this study examines the TC sensitivity to ENSO, where the latter is represented by the SST anomalies over the Ni\u00f1o3.4 region (5 N-5 S, 170 -120 W) during the TC main development months (JJASO). When the Ni\u00f1o3.4 index becomes larger than 0.7, the year is classified as the El Ni\u00f1o year. The La Ni\u00f1a year is defined when the index is lower than \u22120.7. During the 12 years (1998-2009) of investigation, there were four El Ni\u00f1o years (2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009 ) and four La Ni\u00f1a years (1998, 1999, 2000 , and (2001, 2003, 2005, and 2008 ). The inter-annual variation of SST drives an anomalous Walker circulation, shifting areas of enhanced or suppressed convection and thereby changing the location of TC development and pathway (Kim et al., 2011b; Zhang et al., 2016) . Figure 13 shows the basin-wide difference map of TC pathway and origin between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, for the observation and the model simulation, respectively. Dotted area repersents statistical significance of 10% level from the Monte Carlo resampling test for 10,000 times for TC pathway diffence between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. During El Ni\u00f1o, the observed TCs are developed more in WNP (140 -170 E), specifically to the east of the Philippines compared to La Ni\u00f1a. The pathway anomaly is also significantly positive in that region, along with the Philippine Sea and the East China Sea (Figure 13a ). It also shows significantly negative anomalies in genesis over the Philippine Sea and in pathway over east coast of China. The GEOS-5 simulation tends to reproduce the observed pattern realistically, although the positive anomaly of TC genesis is shifted further east to the central Pacific (140 -180 E) (Figure 13b )."}, {"section_title": "| Sensitivity to ENSO", "text": "The model also shows strong negative anomalies of TC genesis over the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea and TC tracks travelling to those regions. The simulated patterns exhibit more robust sensitivity to the ENSO phase although the negative (positive) anomalous patterns tend to be shifted eastwards (westwards). It also shows negative anomalies in genesis and track in the South China Sea, which is overpredicted and not evident in the observations. Sensitivity of TC activity to ENSO phase is quite opposite in NATL. During El Ni\u00f1o, the low-level convergence in the eastern Pacific leads to descending motion over the equatorial NATL, inhibiting TCs development in the region (Figure 13c ). Large-scale subsidence driven by El Ni\u00f1o also results in the decrease of TC development over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea (100 -75 W). The model basically captures the observed sensitivity of TC activity to ENSO (Figure 13d ). However, the negative genesis anomaly is underestimated in the model over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It is also noteworthy that the model exhibits too strong sensitivity in the negative pathway anomalies in most of NATL. Figure 14 compares the correlation between Ni\u00f1o3.4 index and ACE components for the observation and the GEOS-5 simulation, respectively. In WNP, the observation shows that most of ACE components are significantly associated with the Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST (Figure 14a) . The model also reveals the strong relation between Ni\u00f1o3.4 SST and the ACE. This strong ENSO relationship can be attributed to the duration rather than the individual TC intensity, and the duration is mainly explained by the individual TC lifetime rather than the number of TCs. The weak relationship with the individual TC intensity may be associated with the model deficiency that has a limitation to realistically resolve intense TCs. On the contrary, correlations for NATL region are overall negative, indicating that ACE components are smaller (larger) during El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a), though the correlation values do not appear statistically significant in both the observation and the model (Figure 14b ).\nThe weak relationship between ENSO and the TC activity in NATL seems to be in part related to our relatively short analysis period. Note that the observed sensitivity to ENSO in the TC pathway anomaly in NATL is not as strong as in WNP, showing much less area of statistical significance (cf., Figure 13a ,c). The TC genesis anomaly also shows a less coherent spatial pattern. In our investigation, the negative ENSO relationship with TC activities in NATL becomes weak in recent years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) due to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; see Figure S2 ). The positive AMO is known to provide more favourable conditions for enhanced NATL TC activity such as through decreased vertical wind shear and increased CAPE (Vimont and Kossin, 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Klotzbach, 2011) . Based on the long-term analysis period ), the ENSO variability shows a statistically significant relationship with much suppressed ACE and reduced TC number in NATL (Figure S2b) , suggesting a decadal modulation of TC activity by AMO . The GEOS-5 model exhibits a fundamental limitation in reproducing this observed decadal change ( Figure S3 )."}, {"section_title": "| SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION", "text": "This study has examined the role of deep convective activity modified in the RAS-based convective scheme in modulating TC activity over the WNP and NATL. GEOS-5 AGCM run is carried out at 50-km spatial resolution over 12 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . We vary the minimum entrainment threshold through the stochastic limit to suppress the parameterized deep convection. The minimum entrainment rate (\u03bb 0 ) is defined by \u03bb 0 = \u03b1/D m and dependent of the term D m that represents the sub-cloud layer, which is related to the plume radius. Small D m indicates high \u03bb 0 , equivalent with enhanced entrainment threshold that more severely limits the parameterized convection. It leads to more active grid-scale condensation and stratiform precipitation. The experiment applying the stochastic minimum entrainment threshold, \"MOD,\" shows the increasing convective variability and improving TC simulations without the large change in seasonal mean climates over TC MDR. Total precipitation climatology is not substantially changed even though the process of organizing deep convection is considerably modified. Convective precipitation is suppressed in the Tropics, but resolved-scale stratiform precipitation increases to compensate for reduction in sub-grid-scale convective precipitation. The modified convection scheme acts to decrease the MSE throughout the vertical column and atmospheric vertical stability. Large reduction of MSE increases CAPE of rising plumes, providing more favourable conditions for strong convection once convection is occasionally triggered. Constraining convection scheme by increasing minimum entrainment threshold tends to increase the precipitation variability.\nThe five-member ensemble simulations using the GEOS-5 model with the T convective scheme also achieve significant improvements in the TC simulation. This improvement is mostly attributed to the more realistic simulation of the model basic state such as vertical motion in the mid-troposphere. The modified version of GEOS-5 tends to increase the overall convective variability and the TC number and intensity as well (e.g., maximum surface wind speed and minimum SLP). It can simulate tropical storms categorized up to 3 in both basins, whereas the original version of the model barely simulates the storms in category 1. The ensemble MOD runs reliably capture the TC MDR in WNP (e.g., the South China Sea and the east of the Philippines) and NATL (e.g., the Caribbean Sea, and near the central Atlantic Ocean). The inter-annual variation of basin-wide TC activities is investigated focusing on ACE, duration, intensity, TC numbers, and individual TC lifetime. The result demonstrates that inter-annual variation of the ACE and the duration are reasonably simulated by GEOS-5, which implies that the GCM prescribing year-to-year varying observed SST can significantly resolve the TC features. However, the GEOS-5 model exhibits notable, basindependent discrepancy as well in reproducing the observed inter-annual variation of TC activity and the sensitivity to ENSO. It performs relatively better in WNP with a skill comparable to other GCMs. The model also reproduces the observed sensitivity of spatial feature of TCs and the basinwide observed ACE variability associated with ENSO realistically. On the other hand, it performs poorly in NATL, which seems to be a weakness of this model. Comparing with the results from previous studies, TC simulations over NATL shows a large spread across the models, implying that the TC simulation is quite challenging in this region. This deficiency is insensitive to the simulation period, in which the model is not able to reproduce the observed decadal modulation of the relationship between ENSO and NATL TC activity through AMO.\nThe model simulation in this study with 50-km grid spatial resolution shows a fundamental limitation in resolving realistically the intensive TCs. This problem is common in the TC simulation by GCMs (Shaevitz et al., 2014) . Some of previous studies addressed the problem could be solved by enhancing the spatial resolution or model physics of AGCM (Manganello et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2015) . Putman and Suarez (2011) performed TC simulations with much higher resolution (14 and 7 km) GEOS-5 model, which realistically simulates the intense TC. However, there is a difficulty in performing ultra-high resolution ensemble experiments due to the limited computing resources. Improving convective parameterization is an alternative approach to simulate realistic TC activity with limited horizontal resolution. Lim et al. (2015) showed that modification of convective parameterization improves simulation of intense TCs (up to categories 3 and 4), with little changing the seasonal mean climate, while another model simulation without changing convection scheme resolved only up to category 2 TC. As such, this study addresses the importance of convective parameterization to better resolve the TCs in numerical model and their inter-annual variations through multi-year ensemble member runs. Our results suggest much of the inter-model differences appeared in the previous highresolution GCM intercomparison studies could be attributed to the convection schemes implemented differently across the GCMs. Of course, this seems to be the case for the models run at similar horizontal resolution, but the convection scheme is one of the highest priorities to improve in addition to the resolution increase.\nThis study also highlights that the improvement of the TC simulation can be attained under more realistic representation in the time-mean state and MJO variability. The socalled, \"MJO paradox\" has been a widely recognized problem in the GCM modelling community (Kim et al., 2011b; Yoo et al., 2015) , in which there is a trade-off in improvement between time-mean state and temporal variability such as MJO. The stochastic limit of the minimum entrainment rate of convective plumes tends to improve the overall convective variability not only the intensity of the TC-like disturbances but also the MJO amplitude, even with no significant degradation in the basic state. In this regard, the impact of the stochastic parameterizations is worth more indepth researches."}]
