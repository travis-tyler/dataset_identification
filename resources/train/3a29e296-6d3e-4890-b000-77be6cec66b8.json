We hypothesized that media exposure and self-regulation would show a negative prospective association and subsequent bidirectional inverse associations. Methods: Data from the nationally-representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children when children were aged 2 years (n = 2786) and 4/6 years (n = 3527) were used. Primary caregivers reported children's weekly electronic media exposure. A composite measure of self-regulation was computed from caregiver-, teacher-, and observer-report data. Associations were examined using linear regression and cross-lagged panel models, accounting for covariates. Results: Lower television viewing and total media exposure at 2 years were associated with higher self-regulation at 4 years (both \u03b2 = \u22120.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.03 to \u22120.01). Lower self-regulation at 4 years was also significantly associated with higher television viewing (\u03b2 = \u22120.15; 95% CI, \u22120.21 to \u22120.08), electronic game use (\u03b2 = \u22120.05; 95% CI, \u22120.09 to \u22120.01), and total media exposure (\u03b2 = \u22120.19; 95% CI, \u22120.29 to \u22120.09) at 6 years. However, media exposure at 4 years was not associated with self-regulation at 6 years.

The ubiquity of electronic 81 devices has resulted in high levels of media exposure among young children in the United States 4 82 and internationally. 5 The 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend that 83 electronic media exposure not displace other enriching activities or social interactions, not be used 84 as a chief way to calm children down, and be limited to no more than 1 hour/day for 2 to 5 year-old 85 children. 6 Yet, nationally-representative data from the United States indicate that 2 to 4 year-olds 86 accumulate, on average, almost 2 hours of electronic media use per day. 4 Australian guidelines also 87 recommend that screen time should be limited to no more than 1 hour/day for 2 to 5 year-old 88 children, 7 whereas the most recent national data indicate that 2 to 4 year-olds accumulated, on 89\naverage, approximately 1.5 hours of electronic media use per day in 2011-2012. 8 "}, {"section_title": "90", "text": "Recent guideline changes in the United States reflect concern that using electronic media as 91 a tool to distract children or regulate their behaviors 9 may diminish children's opportunities to 92 develop the internal mechanisms required to calm themselves in the long-term. 10, 11 Furthermore, 93 the transactional associations between media exposure and self-regulation in early childhood 12 -indevelopment of self-regulation -need to be examined. Few studies have investigated associations 96 between media exposure and self-regulation in young children, 13, 14 and none have examined 97 longitudinal reciprocal associations. Understanding these associations could inform approaches to 98 enhance self-regulatory abilities or achieve developmentally-appropriate levels of media exposure. 99\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to examine: i) prospective associations between media 100 exposure at 2 years and self-regulation at 4 and 6 years, and ii) bi-directional associations between 101 media exposure and self-regulation at 4 and 6 years.

Data on children's media use were collected at all three waves, however items to form 112 a self-regulation composite score were collected only at 4 and 6 years. It is noted that the caregiver-113 reported measures of media exposure were completed prior to the widespread uptake of mobile 114 media devices such as electronic tablets. As such, the assessment of media exposure did not include 115 mobile phones and tablets; devices to which young children now have considerable access. 4 "}, {"section_title": "116", "text": "However, recent survey data show that TV programming remains the primary mode of media 117 consumption for young children, whether viewed on large or handheld screens. 4 As such, analysis 118 of these data still has relevance to modern media. The Australian Institute of Family Studies Ethics report the total number of hours that their child spent: i) watching television/DVDs/videos 125 (television viewing), ii) using a computer, and iii) playing electronic games separately for a typical 126 weekday and weekend day. Weekday and weekend values were weighted, summed and averaged to 127 provide daily estimates of time in individual behaviors and total media exposure (sum of television 128 viewing, computer use, and electronic game use). 129\nSelf-Regulation. Children's self-regulation at 4-and 6-years of age was assessed using survey 130 items (Table 1) , which closely paralleled those used by Moffitt et al. 2 , to create a robust, reliable, 131 and strongly predictive self-regulation factor. Constituent items of this factor index the extent to 132 which children can control their thinking and attention (e.g., sees tasks through to the end), 133 behaviour (e.g., restless, overactive, cannot stay still for long), and emotions (e.g., often has temper 134 tantrums). Following the protocols of Moffitt et al., 2 parent-(11 items), teacher-(8 items), and 135 observer-report (1 item) ratings of children's self-regulation were standardized and then averaged to 136 create a single composite score (M ~ 0, SD ~ 0.5), with lower values reflecting more self-regulation 137 problems. Standardization was necessary because items were rated on a scale from 1 to 3, 1-5, or 138 1-6, to indicate frequency or degree of the identified behaviour. The resulting factor maintained 139 comparable significant inter-item correlations and strong internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.82 in the 140 current study) as that reported in Moffitt et al. 2 study (\u03b1 = 0.86). While the current factor was 141 created in a constrained age range, compared to Moffitt et al.'s 2 factor that combined data taken 142 between ages 3 and 11 years, further analysis of the factor presented in this paper indicated that it 7 strongly predicted a wide range of outcomes in adolescence. 16 Specifically, a 1-SD lower self-144 regulation score at 4 or 6 years was related to a ~1.5-2.5 times greater risk of self-farm, suicidal 145 ideation, school truancy, mental health issues, smoking, violent and property offences, and alcohol 146 use in adolescence (14-15y). 16 As such, psychometric reliability and longitudinal predictive validity 147 both support the appropriateness of this factor. Further, the correlation between self-regulation at 148 age 4 and age 6 was high (r = 0.63). 149 150 < insert Table 1 18 The primary caregiver's highest level of education was categorised as 156 \"less than or equal to high school\" or \"tertiary\" education. Because parenting behaviors may 157 influence children's self-regulatory capacities, 17 and hostile parenting contributes to and 158 exacerbates conduct problems in children, 19 primary caregiver education and exposure to hostile parenting (dichotomously coded as \"high 169 exposure\" (top 20% of sample) and \"other\" (remaining 80%)). 22 Because items to form a self-170 regulation composite score were not collected at 2 years, investigation of bi-directional associations 171 at this age were not possible. Bidirectional associations between media exposure and self-regulation 172 at 4 and 6 years were investigated using cross-lagged panel models in Mplus version 7. 23 Cross-173 lagged models are a suitable analytic approach for simultaneously examining bidirectional 174 relationships between variables over time. This is because they test stability paths (e.g., media 175 exposure at 4 years and media exposure at 6 years), concurrent paths (e.g., media exposure at 4 176 years and self-regulation at 4 years), and cross-lagged paths (e.g., media exposure at 4 years and 177\nself-regulation at 6 years; self-regulation at 4 years and media exposure at 6 years). Separate models 178\nwere conducted for total media exposure, television viewing, computer use, and electronic game 179 use. The multiple group function in Mplus was used to test for interactions; that is, whether the 180 cross-lagged associations varied by child sex, primary caregiver education and exposure to hostile 181 parenting, using sequential testing of each cross-lagged path. For example, to examine sex 182 differences, the lagged paths were constrained to be equal for boys and girls (fully constrained 183 model). The model was then retested with one path unconstrained, and the \u03c7 2 difference relative to 184 the fully constrained model was derived. If statistically significant, the unconstrained path differed 185 significantly between boys and girls. Findings and interactions were considered statistically 186 significant at P < 0.05. 187\nFor bi-directional analyses between electronic media exposure and self-regulation at 4 and 6 188 years, a total of 1079 children had missing data for electronic media use at both time points and 189 were excluded from analyses.

This study is the first in 267 children aged 2 to 6 years to simultaneously investigate this topic transactionally, to examine if 268 early media exposure is detrimentally associated with young children's subsequent ability to self-269 regulate, or if children with low self-regulatory ability subsequently spend more time being exposed 270 to media. Although lower media exposure at 2 years was associated with better self-regulation at 4 271 years, and better self-regulation at 4 years was associated with lower media exposure at 6 years, 272 associations were of small magnitude, and media exposure at 4 years was not associated with self-273 regulation at 6 years. 274\nOne previous study among infants also found that early self-regulatory abilities predicted 275 later media exposure, 13 although the effect appeared to be stronger in that study compared to our 276 results. Radesky and colleagues 13 found that 39% of 7450 9-month-olds in the US nationally-277 representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study had moderate/severe regulatory difficulties, and 278 those children were exposed to 9 minutes/day more media at 2 years than children without 279 difficulties.

However, several "}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate if media exposure at 2 or 286 4 years has a detrimental impact on children's subsequent ability to self-regulate. Although there 287 are plausible mechanisms, 10, 27, 28 media exposure at 4 years did not predict self-regulation at 6 288 years. Likewise, although the associations between total media exposure and television viewing at 2 289 years and self-regulation at 4 years were statistically significant, they may not have been clinically 290 or behaviorally meaningful; a large difference in total media exposure or television viewing 291 (60min/day or 80% of 1 SD) was associated with a relatively small difference in self-regulation 292 (<5% of 1 SD). This suggests that other factors during early childhood may be stronger predictors 293 of children's self-regulation than media exposure. For example, in our analyses, lower family 294 income (standardised \u03b2 0.05; 95% CI 0.02, 0.07, P = 0.001), being a boy (standardised \u03b2 0.12; 95% 295 CI 0.09, 0.15, P < 0.001), and being exposed to higher levels of hostile parenting (standardised \u03b2 -296 0.09; 95% CI -0.11, -0.07, P < 0.001) at 4 years -all established predictors of self-regulation 17 -297 were significantly and detrimentally associated with a child's self-regulation at 6 years, whereas 298 media exposure was not. However, LSAC only assessed duration of media exposure, not other 299 aspects of media use linked with child development, such as content quality, 14, 27, 29 use of media to 300 calm child distress, 9 or use at meals or bedtime. 30 This study also used a composite measure of self-301 regulation, while other studies have examined constructs such as social-emotional development 302 (including emotion regulation) 9, 30 or executive functioning (including cognitive regulation). 14, 29 303\nOur results indicated that associations between self-regulation at 4 years and total media 304 exposure, computer use, and electronic game use at 6 years were stronger among children of tertiary 305 educated rather than high school educated caregivers. This is despite the fact that children of high 306 school educated caregivers were exposed to ~30 minutes/day more television and total media at 307 14 contrast to cross-sectional findings indicating that associations between television viewing and 310 school readiness skills, including executive functions, were stronger in children of lower-income 311 than higher-income families. 31 One potential explanation is that households of tertiary educated 312 caregivers may be more likely to have rules to limit media exposure, which contributes to lower 313 overall levels in that group. 32 These limits might be particularly effective among young children 314 with strong self-regulatory capacity who may be able to adhere to them. However, tertiary educated 315 caregivers may still use electronic media as a coping mechanism if their child has self-regulatory 316 difficulties, or such children may demand media more. In contrast, in households of high school 317 educated caregivers, higher amounts of media exposure may be more common for children overall, 318 and not dependent on child behavioral characteristics. 319\nOur study has several strengths, including the large, longitudinal sample, the age range of 2 320 to 6 years spanning a critical period for both self-regulatory development 3 and the establishment of 321 media behaviors, 11 and the analytic approach capable of investigating bi-directional associations. 322\nHowever, participants excluded due to missing data were more likely to have lower family incomes 323 and lower caregiver education than those included in analyses, which may limit the 324 representativeness of our findings. Because children of lower SES families in our sample tended to 325 be exposed to higher levels of electronic media and also displayed poorer self-regulation, it is 326 possible that missing data may have impacted the findings. Further, self-regulation was not assessed 327 using direct child assessment. However, a highly comparable multi-source index has been 328 successfully used as a robust predictor of a range of real-world outcomes in prior research. 2 329\nLikewise, children's electronic media use and exposure to hostile parenting were also parent-330 reported, using instruments with unknown psychometric properties, and thus vulnerable to biases.\npreviously noted, LSAC provided data on the types of media devices that children used and the 334 duration of media they were exposed to, but information on other aspects of children's media use 335 that may potentially influence their self-regulation, such as the media content or the surrounding 336 social context, that may potentially influence children's self-regulatory capabilities, were not 337 available. Furthermore, the LSAC data used in our analyses pre-dated the widespread ownership of 338 mobile electronic devices, which are likely to be more potent than traditional fixed devices, given 339 that they can be readily available to calm a distressed child, potentially negating their need to self-340 regulate, and thus the development of impulse control skills.
