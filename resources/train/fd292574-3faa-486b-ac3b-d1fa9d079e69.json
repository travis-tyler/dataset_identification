Over the last two years, MDL, with Hurricane Sandy Supplemental funding, has enhanced the ETSS model to meet the anticipated requirements of a potential extra-tropical storm surge watch (Liu et al. 2015). The latest such enhancement, implemented in October 2015, enabled ETSS to operationally provide deterministic inundation guidance four times a day based on storm surge and tide in all of its model domains (Liu et al. 2016). Storm surge guidance has various uncertainties associated with it such as (a) atmospheric forcing (wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure), (b) initial water conditions, (c) included physical processes, (d) numerical scheme. While some of these can be reduced by enhancing the storm surge model, others, such as atmospheric forcing, rely on external inputs. Uncertainty in atmospheric forcing is particularly challenging as it is the main source of uncertainty in storm surge based inundation guidance. Ensemble techniques are necessary to produce quantitative estimates of storm surge based inundation risk. The ETSS model run for Hurricane Joaquin (Fig. 1) is good example of how the uncertainty of the model forecast play into the difficulty of storm surge forecast (e.g. atmospheric forcing from wind model GFS). Slight variation in the atmospheric forcing can result in considerable variations in storm surge model results (Fig. 2). \uf0d8 Nest higher resolution overland grids to improve storm surge forecast in Alaska region. \uf0d8 Improve bottom friction scheme in SLOSH codes to allow the use of varying friction in: \uf0d8 water cells dependent on water depth \uf0d8 land cells dependent on land cover type \uf0d8 Explore different methodologies to estimate the probability of storm surge.
