[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), part of the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) officially founded in November 2019, was built based on the BIG Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), with joint efforts and collaborations from two CAS institutions, viz., Institute of Biophysics (IBP) and Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health (SINH) as well as several partners (https://bigd.big. ac.cn/partners). Powered by higher-throughput and lowercost genomics sequencing technologies, large-scale sequencing projects for precision medicine and biodiversity studies have been conducted around the world, leading to large amounts of multi-omics data that are still generated at evergrowing rates and scales. Therefore, CNCB-NGDC is dedicated to advancing life and health sciences by providing open access to a suite of data resources and services in support of global research activities on big data archive, storage, management and public sharing as well as multidisciplinary data-driven research (1-4).\nDuring the past year of 2020, an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 27 million infected cases and 897 000 deaths (as of 9 September 2020). To provide SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and variants publicly available for the global research community (5) , in the past year, CNCB-NGDC has made considerable efforts to build a SARS-CoV-2 information resource (6) by genomic data collection, curation and deep-mining with extensive updates on a daily basis. Additionally, CNCB-NGDC has continued to expand and update other resources through data deposition, integration and curation. In terms of database property, database resources of CNCB-NGDC can be generally grouped into three layers: Data--raw data "}, {"section_title": "B r a i n B a s e G W A S A tl a s E W A S A tl a s", "text": "Ag ing At las Figure 1 .

We will be using this model to expand data sharing to genome sequences of other organisms and other data types. Meanwhile, growth of multi-omics data, particularly in human, is explosive. Consequently, database resources of CNCB-NGDC have been enriched and updated by accepting data submissions from all over the world, performing valueadded curation and annotation and also improving web interfaces and data services.\nOngoing efforts include, but not limited to, optimization of curation models and processes, improvement of web functionalities and database usage statistics, upgrade of infrastructure capability for big data storage and transfer, integration of more datasets from different resources, and continuous development of new resources and tools in aid of data-driven studies. We will also put in more efforts to establish and improve underlying links between our database resources, with the aim to fully realize the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) of different levels of data. In addition, CNCB-NGDC heavily engages in the BHBD Alliance (http://bhbd-alliance.org) in order to accelerate the translation of big data into knowledge discovery by global collaborations in data sharing and mining.
