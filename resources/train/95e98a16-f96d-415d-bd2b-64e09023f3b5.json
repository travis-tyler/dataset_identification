[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Using publicly-available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we investigate the joint association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in previously established linkage regions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and rates of decline in brain structure. In an initial, discovery stage of analysis, we applied a weighted RV test to assess the association between 75,845 SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions and rates of change in structural MRI measurements for 56 brain regions affected by AD, in 632 subjects. After confirming association, we selected refined lists of 1694 and 22 SNPs via a bootstrapenhanced sparse canonical correlation analysis. In a final, validation stage, we confirmed association between the refined list of 1694 SNPs and the imaging phenotypes in an independent data set. Genes corresponding to priority SNPs having the highest contribution in the validation data have previously been implicated or hypothesized to be implicated in AD, including GCLC, IDE, and STAMBP1andFAS. Though the effect sizes of the 1694 SNPs in the priority set are likely small, further investigation within this set may advance understanding of the missing heritability in AD. Our analysis addresses challenges in current imaging-genetics studies such as biased sampling designs and high-dimensional data with low association signal."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing cognitive impairment and memory loss. The estimated heritability of late-onset AD is 60%-80% (Gatz et al., 2006) , and the largest susceptibility allele is the \u03b54 allele of APOE (Corder et al., 1993) , which may play a role in 20% to 25% of AD cases. Numerous studies have identified susceptibility genes which account for some of the missing heritability of AD, with many associated variants having been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (e.g. Bertram et al., 2008; Beecham et al., 2009; Kamboh et al., 2012) . Apart from APOE, the associated variants have mostly had moderate or small effect sizes, suggesting that the remaining heritability of AD may be explained by many additional genetic variants of small effect.\nIdentifying susceptibility variants with small effect sizes in GWAS is challenging since strict multiple testing corrections are required to maintain a reasonable family-wise error rate. This analysis focuses on leveraging information from prior family of studies of AD (Hamshere et al., 2007; Butler et al., 2009) , by looking for association in previously identified linkage regions reported on the Alzgene website (Biomedical Research Forum, 2013) . Linkage regions for AD are genomic regions that tend to be co-inherited with AD in families. By definition, linkage regions include susceptibility genes that are co-transmitted with the disease. The regions currently identified from family studies of AD are large, however, since families contain relatively few transmissions. Further transmissions over multiple generations would provide more fine-grain information about the location of susceptibility genes. Previous studies have fine-mapped a single linkage region through association of AD with genetic variants in densely genotyped or sequenced regions (Scott et al., 2000; Ertekin-Taner, 2003; Z\u00fcchner et al., 2008; Fallin et al., 2010) , or have confirmed linkage to AD in genomic regions identified from GWAS (Anna et al., 2011) . In this report, we aim to fine-map multiple linkage regions for AD through multivariate association of their SNPs to the rates of atrophy in brain regions affected by AD.\nWe analyze data from two phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (Mueller et al., 2005) , ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, which are case-control studies of AD and mild-cognitive impairment. The rates of atrophy in brain regions affected by AD are so-called endophenotypes: observable traits that reflect disease progression. By investigating the joint association between the genomic variants and the neuroimaging endophenotypes, we use the information about disease progression to supervise the selection of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This multivariate approach to analysis stands in contrast to the commonlyused mass-univariate approach (for a review, see Nathoo et al., 2017) , in which separate regressions are fit for each SNP, and the disease outcome is predicted by the minor allele counts. Simultaneous analysis of association is preferred because the reduced residual variation leads to (i) a clearer assessment of the signal from each SNP, (ii) increased power to detect signal, and (iii) a decreased false-positive rate (Hoggart et al., 2008) . We also employ inverse probability weighting to account for the biased sampling design of the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 studies, an aspect of analysis that has not been accounted for in many previous imaging genetics studies (Zhu et al., 2016) .\nMethods that explicitly account for gene structure have been proposed for analyzing the association between multiple imaging phenotypes and SNPs in candidate genes (e.g. Wang et al., 2011; Greenlaw et al., 2017) . However, these methods become computationally intractable when analyzing data with tens of thousands of genotyped variants. To select SNPs associated with disease progression, we instead use sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) to find a sparse linear combination of SNPs having maximal correlation with the imaging endophenotypes. Multiple penalty schemes have been proposed to implement the sparse estimation in SCCA (Parkhomenko et al., 2009; Witten et al., 2009; Lykou and Whittaker, 2010) . We employ an SCCA implementation that estimates the sparse linear combinations by computing sparse approximations to the left singular vectors of the cross-correlation matrix of the SNP data and the neuroimaging endophenotype data (Parkhomenko et al., 2009) . Sparsity is introduced through soft-thresholding of the coefficient estimates (Donoho and Johnstone, 1994) , which has been noted (Chalise and Fridley, 2012) to be similar in implementation to a limiting form of the elastic-net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) . A drawback of 1 -type penalties is that not all SNPs from an LD block of highly-correlated SNPs that are associated with the outcome will be selected into the model (Zou and Hastie, 2005) . We prefer an elastic-net-like penalty over alternative implementations with 1 penalties because it allows selection of all potentially associated SNPs regardless of the linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in the data.\nWe may think of SNP genotypes as a matrix X and imaging phenotypes as a matrix Y measured on the same n subjects. Robert and Escoufier (1976) showed that estimating the maximum correlation between linear combinations of X and Y in canonical correlation analysis is equivalent to estimating the linear combinations having the maximum RV coefficient, a measure of linear association between the multivariate datasets (Escoufier, 1973) . As the squared correlation coefficient between the first canonical variates, the RV coefficient is well-suited for testing linear association in our context. We use a permutation test based on the RV coefficient to assess the association between the initial list of SNPs in X and the phenotypes in Y. A permutation test with the RV coefficient is preferred over a parametric hypothesis test since the permutation null distribution is computed under the same conditions as the observed RV coefficient, resulting in a valid hypothesis test. The outcome of this test is used to determine whether or not to proceed with a second refinement stage that reduces the number of SNPs by applying SCCA.\nTuning parameter selection can be difficult when data has low signal (Nathoo et al., 2016) and selection of the soft-thresholding parameter in SCCA is challenging in our context. Since the number of SNPs exceeds the sample size and many of the SNPs are expected to be unassociated with the phenotypes, large sample correlations can arise by chance (Fan et al., 2011) . Indeed, the prescribed procedure of selecting the penalty parameter with highest predicted correlation across cross-validation test sets (Parkhomenko et al., 2009) results in more than 98% of the SNPs remaining in the model. A prediction criterion for choosing the penalty term may contribute to the lack of variable selection, allowing redundant variables into the model (Leng et al., 2006) . When the same tuning parameter is used for variable selection and shrinkage, redundant variables tend to be selected to compensate for overshrinkage of coefficient estimates and losses in predictive ability (Radchenko and James, 2008) . In our case, there is effectively no variable selection and little insight is gained by allowing for sparsity in the solution. To circumvent the lack of variable selection from SCCA, we fix the tuning parameter to select about 10% of the SNPs (Wu et al., 2009 ) and then use resampling to determine the relative importance of each SNP to the association with neuroimaging endophenotypes. Instead of using the prediction-optimal penalty term, we fixed the soft-thresholding parameter for the SNPs to achieve variable selection based on the rationale that no more than about 7500 SNPs, or approximately 10%, are expected to be associated with the phenotypes. This choice is guided by prior experience in genetic association studies, where the majority of genetic variants have no effect on the phenotypes, or an effect that is indistinguishable from zero (Carbonetto and Stephens, 2012) .\nThe organization of the manuscript is as follows. The Materials and Methods section describes the ADNI data, the data processing procedures, and the methods applied for discovery, refinement, and validation. The Results section presents the results of the analyses. The Discussion section notes challenges and successes of the analysis, including considerations for modelling continuous phenotype data under a case-control sampling design, and provides interpretation of the results. Figure 1 illustrates the data processing steps required to compute the quantities that are analyzed from the raw data: adjusted minor allele counts of SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions for the genomic data, and adjusted predicted rates of change at 56 brain regions of interest (ROIs) from MRIs for the neuroimaging data.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with MCI have a subjective memory concern but no significant cognitive impairment, while patients with early Alzheimer's disease have experienced memory loss. The first phase of ADNI, ADNI-1, aimed to enroll approximately 800 study subjects, aged 55-90, of which 200 were cognitively normal (CN), 200 had mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 400 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (ADNI Procedures Manual, 2006, p. 3) . The CN subjects were roughly agematched to the MCI and AD subjects. Subjects were assigned to a group following inclusion and exclusion criteria based on clinical and cognitive tests. Mild AD subjects had mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores from 20-26 inclusive, clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1.0, and met the National Institute of Figure 1 : Flow chart of the steps to process the raw genomic and neuroimaging data into the analysis and validation datasets. The target quantities, minor allele counts at SNPs in Alzgene linkage regions for the genomic data and predicted rates of change at brain regions of interest for the neuroimaging data, are computed. Then, both sets of targets quantities are adjusted for potentially confounding variables to obtain the data for analysis (ADNI-1) or validation (ADNI-2).\nNeurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. MCI subjects had MMSE scores between 24-30, CDR of 0.5, a memory complaint, and objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (Wechsler, 2009) . Cognitively normal participants were non-depressed, with MMSE scores between 24-30, and did not fit the criteria for the MCI or mild AD groups (ADNI Procedures Manual, 2006, p. 3-4) . The study subjects were enrolled from 50 sites in the US and Canada and were required to commit to at least 2 years of follow up MRI.\nADNI-2 was a subsequent phase of ADNI that involved enrollment of new subject cohorts, as well as continued follow-up of subjects enrolled in earlier phases. ADNI-2 enrolled a new cohort of subjects among which 190 subjects were cognitively normal, 181 subjects had early MCI, 164 subjects had MCI, and 148 subjects had mild AD.\nThe ADNI-1 cohort was used in our initial analysis. To validate the findings of the initial analysis, a subset of the ADNI-2 cohort was used that included new subjects in the same disease categories (CN, MCI and AD) as the subjects in ADNI-1."}, {"section_title": "Imaging data", "text": "The neuroimaging phenotypes analyzed are predicted rates of change in cortical thickness and volumetric measurements in brain regions obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. ADNI subjects had 1.5T MRI scans at either 6 or 12 month intervals during the 2-to 3-year follow-up period of the study and we chose to analyse the longitudinal information on cortical thickness and regional volumes. While other studies have compared the different study groups using imaging information from baseline (Shen et al., 2010; Meda et al., 2012) , the longitudinal information provides insight into the different rates of brain deterioration experienced by people with negligible memory loss compared to those with more acute memory difficulties and Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation", "text": "Segmentation is the process of identifying the locations of anatomical structures within an image.

Cortical thickness (thickness of gray matter) and volumes of the regions of interest become increasingly atrophied as disease progresses, so we expect increased rates of atrophy in participants with more memory concerns (the MCI and AD subjects) compared to the cognitively normal subjects."}, {"section_title": "Predicting rates of change", "text": "Linear mixed effect models, given in Equation 1, were used to predict the rates of change in each brain region of interest (ROI). Brief descriptions of the regions of interest are given in Appendix. A separate mixed model was fit for each ROI, with random effects for subject-specific rates of change and fixed effects for average rates of change within diagnostic subgroups. The response variable Y ijt is a continuous measurement of the cortical thickness or volume of a brain region of interest. In the specification of the model, fixed-effects terms are denoted by \u03b2, while random-effect terms are denoted by \u03b3. The covariates are (i) t, the time of the follow-up visit at which the scan was conducted, with t \u2208 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 months; (ii) MCI, a dummy variable equal to 1 if subject i has mild cognitive impairment, and equal to 0 otherwise; and (iii) AD, a dummy variable equal to 1 if subject i has Alzheimer's disease, and equal to 1 otherwise.

The normality of the predicted, subject-specific, random effects was assessed by examining the Q-Q plots of the predictions at each ROI. The assumption of normality appeared to be reasonable for all ROIs.\nFigure 2 is a heatmap of the predicted rates of change, adjusted for potential confounding variables in the sample, as discussed next. The heatmap illustrates how rates of change are more negative in subjects with more advanced disease, indicating that the thickness of gray matter and the volumes of brain regions of interest are shrinking more. Decreases in cortical thickness are more pronounced for subjects with AD (i.e. their rates of changes are more negative for various cortical thickness measures). Similarly, the ventricles, cavities in the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid, have a more positive rate of change for subjects with more advanced disease. As brain atrophy progresses, these cavities expand."}, {"section_title": "Genomic data", "text": "The ADNI-1 subjects were genotyped with the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and the ADNI-2 subjects were genotyped with the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip, both of which interrogate SNPs.

Best-guess SNP genotypes were imputed in the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 sample using the HapMap3 panel with NCBI build 36/hg18 using IMPUTE2 (Marchini and Howie, 2010) , based on the imputation protocol in the IMPUTE2: 1000 Genomes Imputation Cookbook (Luan et al., 2014) . Haplotypes were phased with SHAPEIT (Delaneau et al., 2013) , and PLINK and SHAPEIT/IMPUTE2 file formats were converted with GTOOL (Freeman, 2007 (Freeman, -2012 . Out of the 503,450 SNPs that passed quality control in the ADNI-1 sample, sporadically missing genotypes were imputed at the 459,517 SNPs that were also in the reference panel. Out of the 574,730 SNPs that passed quality control in the ADNI-2 sample, sporadically missing genotypes were imputed at the 270,074 SNPs that were also on the ADNI-1 chip and in the reference panel. The remaining 189,443 SNPs that were not genotyped in the ADNI-2 sample, but were in both the ADNI-1 sample and the reference panel, were imputed into the sample. The genotyping rate in the imputed data for the ADNI-2 sample was 98.2%, prior to filtering out SNPs with an IMPUTE2 info metric < 0.5. The IMPUTE2 metric measures the reliability of imputed genotypes for a SNP, and takes a value of 1 when there is no genotype uncertainty in the sample. When the metric is <0.5, the sample mean of the posterior variance of imputed genotypes is at least half the variance that would be expected if alleles were sampled at random (Marchini and Howie, 2010) . The quality of the imputation for a SNP is reported based on the IMPUTE2 certainty measure, which is the average posterior probability of the best-guess genotypes in the sample. In the ADNI-1 data, the average certainty was 100% for all SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions. In the ADNI-2 data, the certainties ranged from 69.1% to 100%, but 98.4% of the 31,301 imputed SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions (defined below) had certainties of 90% or more.

Potential confounders in the analysis are population stratification and APOE genotype. Population stratification is the phenomenon of systematic differences in allele frequencies in a subpopulation arising because of differences in ancestry, while the \u03b54 allele of APOE is the largest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al., 1993) . Since true population structure is not observed, we adjust for it in the data using the top ten principal coordinates from multidimensional scaling. The top 10 principal coordinates account for 2.6% of the variability in the genotype data.\nWe also restrict the analysis to the white non-Hispanic subjects and remove multivariate outliers identified in the top two principal coordinates as noted in the Genomic quality control section. We adjust for APOE genotype as a precautionary measure, since it can account for the population stratification in the data, over and above the principal components or principal coordinates (Lucotte et al., 1997) .\nTen principal coordinates for each of the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets were obtained using tendimensional multi-dimensional scaling on the pairwise IBS distance matrix, computed with PLINK from 121,795 and 118,012 approximately uncorrelated SNPs from the SNPs that passed quality control filters. The SNP genotypes used to estimate the principal coordinates were from the complete imputed data. The number of principal coordinate dimensions was chosen to follow a similar protocol for adjustment for population stratification using principal components, in which ten axes of variation are suggested (Price et al., 2006) .\nThe data for analysis were obtained by adjusting the minor allele counts and predicted rates of change of the brain ROIs for the ten principal coordinates, as well as for dummy variables for APOE genotype, using weighted ordinary least squares regression.

SCCA estimates sparse linear combinations aX and bY that have maximal correlation, where a and b are column vectors of length p and q respectively. By operating on the cross-correlation matrix, the distance metric used is Euclidean, which is appropriate since both the columns of X and Y are treated as continuous in the analysis; other distance metrics for the genetic data are possible, however (Chang, 2017) .\nWe initially applied SCCA to identify a sparse set of SNPs associated with the imaging endophenotypes. Ten-fold cross validation was used to select the penalty parameter for the SNPs, \u03bb u , for the SCCA. A search grid for \u03bb u was defined as {0, 10 \u22124 , . . ., 10 \u22121 } with the values in the search grid being incremented by 0.0005. At the i th element in the search grid, \u03bb u, i , the sparse canonical-correlation coefficients, a i, j for the SNPs and b i, j for the endophenotypes, were computed in training set j. The fitted coefficients from the training sets were then used to compute the predicted sample-correlation coefficient in each test set:\nThe SNP penalty parameter \u03bb u was chosen as the element in the search grid that maximized the sum of the predicted sample-correlation coefficients over the ten test sets. Under this cross-validation scheme, variable selection of the SNPs was minimal with more than 98% of the SNPs remaining in the active set. Ruling out fewer than 2% of the SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions is insufficient refinement for our analysis. Instead, we chose to incorporate bootstrap resampling to estimate the relative importance of each SNP in the multivariate association. This approach of \"bootstrap enhancement\" has been applied previously in neuroimaging studies (Bunea et al., 2011) , to guide variable selection with the elastic-net and the lasso. We obtained B = 100,000 bootstrap samples by sampling subjects with replacement within each disease category. The weighted cross-correlation matrix S (W) XY was computed for each bootstrap sample b, and a sparse linear combination of the genomic markers was estimated, using the SCCA penalty parameter \u03bb (\u03b2 1b , \u03b2 2b , . . . , \u03b2 pb ) denotes the coefficient vector of the sparse linear combination of the p SNPs, from bootstrap sample b, then the variable importance probability for SNP k (VIP k ) is defined as the proportion of bootstrap samples in which SNP k (k = 1, . . ., p) has a nonzero coefficient, or is \"selected\":\nII(\u03b2 kb / = 0), where II(A) = 1 if condition A holds and 0 otherwise"}, {"section_title": "Gene-set analysis", "text": "To reduce the initial list of 75,845 SNPs to a shorter list for validation and to gain insight into the biologically related sets of genes associated with cognitive decline, we applied a gene-set analysis, as implemented in GSA-SNP (Nam et al., 2010) . GSA-SNP combines the evidence for SNP-specific associations into gene-level summaries and assesses the pattern of association for genes in a given set, such as a functional pathway, relative to genes outside the set. We used variable exclusion probabilities, VEP = 1 \u2212 VIP, to quantify the SNP-specific evidence of association in lieu of p-values, and the second smallest VEP for SNPs in a gene as the gene-level summary statistic. Our choice of the second smallest was based on the recommendation of Nam et al. (2010) to use the second smallest rather than the smallest p-value as the gene-level summary statistic to protect against the spuriously high association signal that may be introduced by longer genes. The restandardized version of GSA-SNP with the maxmean statistic (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007) was applied, with default gene padding of 20,000 base pairs and Gene Ontology gene sets. We took P = 100 samples under the permutation null hypothesis of no association to serve as the empirical reference distribution for VEPs from ADNI-1.

Figure 5 depicts the contribution of each SNP as a score, normalized to have mean 1 over all the SNPs in the priority set, to the RV statistic.

The resulting gene symbols for annotated SNPs are reported in the Genes column of the table. We used the squared Pearson correlation coefficient, r 2 , to measure the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. Values of r 2 were computed in R with the snpMatrix package (Clayton and Leung, 2007) using the N = 116 cognitively normal subjects in the ADNI-2 data. LD blocks within the priority set are indicated by numbers in the first column of Table 3 , and are defined such that all SNPs within a block have pairwise r 2 greater than 0.7."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of RV statistic", "text": "To further understand the observed association between SNPs in the priority set and endophenotypes in the ADNI-2 validation data, we decomposed the RV test statistic into its SNP-specific components. Details on how the SNP-specific contributions are calculated are described in the Results section. "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this report, we have taken a targeted approach to genetic association mapping of Alzheimer's disease by focusing on SNPs in Alzheimer's disease linkage regions and on imaging endophenotypes for brain regions affected by Alzheimer's disease. We discovered association between SNPs in the linkage regions and the imaging endophenotypes, refined the set of SNPs by selecting those with high variable inclusion probabilities, and validated the refined set in an independent dataset. Here, we discuss our observations about the benefits and pitfalls of applying data-integration methods such as sparse canonical correlation analysis and the RV test in a high-dimensional data setting with low signal. We also discuss potential links between Alzheimer's disease and genes in the priority set that were ranked highly in the validation data. Initially, SCCA was used to find a subset of the SNPs in the linkage regions associated with the endophenotypes, but very little variable selection was achieved. SCCA uses a prediction criterion to identify the optimal soft-thresholding parameters for the sparse canonical variables, but using prediction error to select the penalty term includes irrelevant variables in the active set (Leng et al., 2006) . In addition, the predictionoptimal value of the penalty term does not coincide with model selection consistency (Meinshausen and B\u00fchlmann, 2006) . Instead, we fixed the soft-thresholding parameter for the SNPs to achieve variable selection based on the rationale that no more than 7500 SNPs (approximately 10%) are expected to be associated with the phenotypes. We applied bootstrapped-enhanced SCCA, a procedure analogous to the bootstrappedenhanced elastic net proposed by Bunea et al. (2011) for imaging applications. To obtain a reduced set of SNPs to carry forward for validation, we thresholded the variable inclusion probabilities at 50%, as suggested by these authors, and at 90%. Bootstrapping to aid variable selection has been shown to be consistent in high-dimensional settings under some assumptions (Meinshausen and B\u00fchlmann, 2010) , and can improve recovery of the true model in regularized regression (Bach, 2008) .\nIn a low-signal context, we do not necessarily expect to replicate association of the 22 \"top-hit\" SNPs in the validation data. For a fixed sample size, as the number of unassociated SNPs increases, the probability of a truly associated SNP being within the top-ranked SNPs decreases (Zaykin, 2005) . By contrast, the more liberal threshold of VIP \u2265 50% resulted in a larger, \"priority\" set of 1694 SNPs which could be validated and was substantially refined from the initial list of 75,845.\nThe permutation-based RV test of association proved to be a powerful tool in different phases of the analysis. This nonparametric test was computationally tractable and allowed us to uncover and validate linear association between the two multivariate datasets, one of them very high-dimensional, in an analysis setting with a low signal. Despite the evidence for association, the observed RV coefficient at each of the discovery, refinement and validation stages of the analysis was not large (<0.1), consistent with SNPs having small association effects. The presence of SNPs with small effects is anticipated, as previous studies have found no large genetic effects apart from APOE (Ridge et al., 2013) , for which we have already adjusted.\nThe ADNI studies use a case-control design, in which subjects are sampled conditional on meeting diagnostic criteria for either being cognitively normal, having late MCI, or having AD. Case-control designs do not result in a random sample from the population and they cannot be used to make inference about the population association between SNP genotypes and neuroimaging biomarkers without accounting for the biased sampling. To account for the biased sampling, we have applied inverse probability weighting in our analyses.\nInvestigation of the genes associated with the highest scoring SNPs in the validation data, reported in Table 3 , identified genes previously implicated in AD. On chromosome 6, Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Catalytic Subunit or GCLC, a gene annotation of the SNP rs634364, codes the first, rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is an important antioxidant which plays an integrated role in the regulation of cell life, cell proliferation, and cell death (Pompella et al., 2003) . The brain glutathione system is hypothesized to play a role in the breakdown of proteins in the brain, such as A\u03b2 peptides (Lasierra-Cirujeda et al., 2013) , and abundance of glutathione decreases with age and in some age-related disease (Liu et al., 2004) . On chromosome 10, the complex locus STAMPBL1andFAS is an annotation of rs10887866 and codes a protein which plays a central role in programmed cell death (Choi and Benveniste, 2004) . Through modulation of programmed cell death and neuronal atrophy, FAS may play a role in AD (Erten-Lyons et al., 2010) . Also on chromosome 10, the gene insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) contains rs4646957 and codes the enzyme of the same name. IDE has previously been implicated in the progression Alzheimer's disease as it degrades the A\u03b2 peptides which are the main components in the amyloid plaques on the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (Edland et al., 2003) . Edland et. al. found that three IDE variants were associated with risk of AD in subjects without copies of the \u03b54 APOE risk allele, the allele which constitutes the largest genetic risk of AD.\nGene expression from the UCSC RNA-Seq GTEx track was also explored to determine if any of the genes reported were highly expressed in the brain. On chromosome 10, Zinc Finger Protein 37A (ZNF37A), the gene containing rs7897675, is most highly expressed in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere of the brain, regions related to motor function. Nebulette (NEBL), the gene annotation of rs2148885 and rs11012530, is most highly expressed in the heart, but has next highest gene expression in the brain. In addition, association fine-mapping under a linkage peak identified NEBL as a candidate gene for vitamin D levels in the blood (Aslibekyan et al., 2016) . Low vitamin D blood levels are associated with accelerated decline in cognitive function in older adults (Miller et al., 2015) .\nTen of the top 20 SNPs in Table 3 did not have associated gene annotations in the UCSC genome browser or AceView. For these SNPs, flanking genes were queried with ALFRED (Rajeevan et al., 2011) and the UCSC genome browser, since SNPs may \"tag\" causal variants in nearby genes. Genes were considered to be flanking if they were within 1 Mb of the SNPs in the priority set, though many of the flanking genes reported are much closer to the priority SNPs. On chromosome 3, rs643944 is approximately 22 kb proximal to the flanking gene RAB6B. RAB6B is the brain-specific isoform of RAB6 (Wanschers et al., 2007) , a family of proteins which impair the processing of the amyloid precursor protein involved in the development of AD (Thyrock et al., 2013) . On chromosome 10, DDIT4 is approximately 17.5 kb proximal to rs7088870. DDIT4 produces the REDD1 protein, which enhances stress-dependent neuronal cell death and is involved in dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Maiese, 2014) . Dysregulation of mTOR is a hallmark of a wide variety of brain disorders (Polman et al., 2012) , and inhibition of mTOR is associated with A\u03b2-peptiderelated synaptic dysfunction in AD (Ma et al., 2010) . Another flanking gene to rs7088870 is DNAJB12, which is approximately 39.2 kb proximal to rs7088870, and is involved in protein folding. The process of plaque buildup in AD involves the accumulation of misfolded A\u03b2 proteins, and DNAJB12 is highly expressed throughout the brain (Tebbenkamp and Borchelt, 2010) . Finally, in addition to being the gene annotation of rs7897674, ZNF37A is also 15.4 kb proximal to the SNP rs17588142 on chromosome 10.\nIn summary, this analysis illustrates the application of novel methods for integration of high-dimensional data with low signal. To focus on regions with increased prior probability of containing deleterious variants, the analysis was restricted to SNPs within linkage regions for AD. In practice, the same methodology could be applied to all available data if no linkage regions have previously been identified. However, we recommend restricting analyses to linkage regions whenever possible to leverage information from prior work. The objective was to obtain a refined list of SNPs to propose for further investigation. Naive application of SCCA did not lead to any refinement, potentially due to the data containing many small effects. Instead, we were able to obtain refinement through bootstrapped-enhanced SCCA. Throughout, the analysis benefited from the RV test to assess the evidence of linear association between two multivariate datasets: the high-dimensional genomic data, and the multi-dimensional neuroimaging data. RV tests of SNPs selected based on variable importance probabilities identified a priority set of 1694 SNPs in the ADNI-1 data that was associated with the rates of changes in the brain regions of interest in the ADNI-2 validation set. Our final results are encouraging, in that genes corresponding to SNPs with the highest contributions to the RV coefficient in the validation data have previously been implicated or hypothesized to be implicated in AD, including GCLC, IDE, and STAMBP1andFAS. We hypothesize that the effect sizes of the 1694 SNPs in the priority set are likely small, but further investigation within this set may advance understanding of the missing heritability in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
