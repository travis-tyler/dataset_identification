[{"section_title": "", "text": "In most European and East Asian countries, the average age of farmers exceeds that of workers in other sectors (Pietola, Vare, and Lansink 2003;Otomo and Oedl-Wieser 2009). Owing to the increasing number of elderly farmers, determining how to secure the wellbeing of older famers has become an important policy issue for rural development (Barrientos, Gorman, and Heslop 2003). In Taiwan, the average age of farmers reached 62 in 2005 (Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics 2005). To secure the well-being of self-employed older farmers, the Taiwanese Old Farmers' Pension program (OFP) was introduced in 1995 in Taiwan. This program granted eligible farmers aged 65 or over a monthly pension of TWD 7,000, equivalent to approximately $233. Although this pension program provides lifelong income security for qualified elderly farmers,it comes at a high cost. The annual expenditure of the OFP program in Hung-Hao Chang is an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at the National Taiwan University.

This project was supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant No. NSC99-2410-H-002-063. The views expressed herein are those of the author and do not reflect the policies of the Council of Agriculture and the Directorate-General of Budget,Accounting and Statistics in Taiwan. All remaining errors are the author's. 2007 was TWD 45.7 billion, which accounted for 49% of the overall agricultural budget (Council of Agriculture 2009). A unique feature of the farming sector is that farmers are self-employed and farm businesses are usually transferred within the family. This is referred to as the farm succession of family farms, and it has been documented that the farm succession problem is one of the most important issues that family farms face (Burkart, Panunzi, and Schleifer 2003). The importance of farm succession can be recognized in several ways. First, in many countries of the world, decreasing farm revenue over recent decades has continuously driven young people out of agriculture; it has thus become more difficult to attract young laborers to engage in farm businesses. As a result, the family farm sector relies heavily on intergenerational succession within the household (Pfeffer 1989;Pesquin, Kimhi, and Kislev 1999). Given that farm sector laborers are getting older in many countries, especially in most European and East Asian countries, a better understanding of farm succession would help improve structural adjustment and secure older farmers' well-being (Pietola, Vare, and Lansink 2003;Otomo and Oedl-Wieser 2009). Several studies have also underscored the importance of farm succession from the perspective of financial management within the family farms. For instance, intra-household succession enables family farms to enjoy the benefits of intergenerational risk-sharing when the financial markets are not favorable for older farmers (Kimhi and Lopez 1997). In light of the importance of farm succession, a considerable body of literature has examined the farm succession behavior of family farms. The primary focus of these studies has been on the effect of the socio-demographic characteristics of the famers and family structure regarding the likelihood of the farm family having a succession plan; empirical evidence is provided from the United States (e.g., Kimhi and Lopez 1997;Mishra, El-Osta, and Shaik 2010), Europe (e.g., Pietola, Vare, and Lansink 2003;Glauben et al. 2009), and Asia (Otomo and Oedl-Wieser 2009). Among these studies, however, not much attention has been paid to the link between farm succession and governmental social security programs for the elderly. Exceptions can be found in Pietola, Vare, and Lansink (2003) and Mishra and El-Osta (2008), and these studies offer opposing views of the role of retirement programs on farm succession. Pietola, Vare, and Lansink (2003) looked at the early retirement programs in Finland and found that the availability of a pension program is positively associated with a farm operator's decision to exit farming and transfer the farm business to the younger generation. Based on data of more than 4,000 farm households drawn from the 2001 Agricultural Resource Management Survey in the United States, Mishra and El-Osta (2008) found that parents on family farms are less likely to have a successor when offered retirement income. This article contributes to the limited evidence on the effect of a social security pension program for elderly farmers on family farm succession by examining the old farmers' pension program in Taiwan. The primary objective of this article is to assess the impact that participating in the OFP program has on farm succession. Since the OFP program is not particularly designed for farm succession, we also provide some discussion on the potential mechanism that may link these two outcomes. We argue that the presence of OFP payments has the potential to affect farm succession through its effect on the farm household's resource allocation. Previous studies have provided evidence on how pension programs may affect farmers' labor supply. For instance, Ranchhod (2006) found that cash transfers made by the old age pension program in South Africa have a significant influence on the time allocation of elderly farmers through the income effect of the payment. From the perspective of household technical efficiency, Lovo (2011) found that the Old Age Pension program in South Africa had a positive effect on the efficiency of farm households. Several unique features set this article apart from previous studies on similar topics. First, we use a unique large-scale survey of 160,380 farm households, drawn from the 2005 Agricultural Census Survey in Taiwan. To obtain an objective measurement of the receipt of OFP payment, we merged the Agricultural Census Survey data with a national administrative dataset on Farmer Health Insurance program profiles from 2005 for each principal farm operator. Second, in contrast to most of the existing studies that simply regard participation in governmental social welfare programs as an exogenous factor in relation to farm succession (e.g., Pietola, Vare, and Lansink 2003), we carefully examine the causal effect of program participation on farm succession using a proposed analytical framework that combines the strengths of the regression discontinuity design, the inverse probability weighting method, and the difference-in-difference method. Third, we provide a discussion of the mechanisms that may link the OFP program and farm succession. After controlling for the endogeneity of program participation, we found that the OFP program reduced the likelihood of farm succession. With respect to the potential mechanism, we found evidence that the OFP program affected the labor allocation of the farm operators. In Taiwan, farmers are required to work at least 90 days per year on the farm to be eligible for the Farmer Health Insurance program, and only program participants can receive pensions when they turn 65 (details are introduced in the next section).The presence of the 90-day restriction thus provides an incentive for elderly farmers to work more on the farm and less off the farm to maintain eligibility to receive the pension. Therefore, the increased time of on-farm work of the elderly farmers results in a negative impact on farm succession."}, {"section_title": "Taiwanese Old Farmers' Pension Program", "text": "In Taiwan, a unique welfare system was implemented which combines the Farmer Health Insurance Program (FHI) and the Taiwanese Old Farmers' Pension program (OFP) for the farm population. To remove barriers to at National Taiwan University on July 17, 2013 http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from accessing medical care and improving equity for access to medical resources for rural residents, particularly for farmers, the FHI program was formally enacted in 1989. The FHI is a national social insurance system for agricultural workers aged 15 or older in Taiwan; it provides farmers with a favorable premiumbenefit ratio and a high premium subsidy (the monthly premium paid by the FHI enrollee is only TWD 377, equivalent to approximately $13). The FHI enrollment commenced with a set of rules; these multiple regulations set strict limitations for non-farmers who wish to obtain farmer status. An eligible participant of the FHI program is required to satisfy the following conditions: 1) be at least 15 years old; 2) have worked in agriculture for at least one year; 3) not have full-time employment at any offfarm job;4) work on the farm for at least 90 days in a year; and 5) have at least 0.1 hectares of farmland (Taiwan Bureau of Labor Insurance 2009). These constraints are used to ensure a higher coverage rate of the FHI program for full-time farmers. To enroll in the FHI program, farmers are required to submit their applications to the farmers' association in the county in which each farm is located. 1 When receiving the application, farmers' associations are responsible for checking all eligibility requirements and then making a recommendation to the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan. Among the current enrollees, farmers' associations are also responsible for checking items (3)-(5) of the eligibility rules twice per year to ensure that the current enrollees can continue to enroll in the program. If the enrollees fail to meet any of the requirements, the farmers' association will then make a recommendation to the government to remove these farmers from the program. In most cases where farmers were removed from the program, they either worked less than 90 days on the farm in a year or they sold/transferred their farmland to others. To secure aged farmers' well-being, the OFP program was introduced in Taiwan in 1995 as a supplemental program to the FHI program. All FHI insurants aged 65 or above are eligible to apply for the OFP payments.  applicants of the OFP program will be paid TWD 7,000 per month, or approximately $233. Unlike the old age security systems for farmers in other countries,there is no farmer retirement program in Taiwan, and the OFP program is the only mechanism through which elderly farmers can receive a pension. The OFP system in Taiwan is unique in that the eligible recipients have to be at least 65 and also have to be covered by the FHI program. Therefore, any policy analysis of the social welfare program for the older farms has to consider the FHI and OFP program simultaneously. The eligibility rules for OFP and the FHI program are illustrated in figure 1. If the OFP recipients stop working for the required 90 days on the farm and are removed from the FHI program, they will not only lose their monthly OFP pension, but must also pay a higher premium (TWD 905/month) as nonfarm workers. 2"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The primary dataset used in this study is the 2005 Agricultural Census Survey in Taiwan, conducted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, Republic of China, Taiwan (Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics 2005). Since 1970, all farm households in Taiwan have been interviewed every 5 years. The survey was designed to collect information on farm production practices and farm household activities. Each farm is asked to report on specific aspects of farm production and family characteristics during a face-to-face interview; only one principal farm operator was identified for each farm household, and data on his or her socio-demographic characteristics were collected. As indicated above, all FHI insurants are eligible to receive a monthly pension payment when they turn 65. Although information on farm operators' socio-demographic and farm characteristics are documented in the Agricultural Census Survey, no information on FHI enrollment is recorded. To overcome this drawback, we merged the Agricultural Census Survey with the national administrative FHI profiles of each principal farm operator enrolled in the FHI program in 2005. The FHI health claims profiles are maintained by the Bureau of Labor Insurance of the Council of Labor Affairs in Taiwan; the data were merged under the supervision of the Council of Labor Affairs and the Council of Agriculture by using each participant's name and personal identification number. For each enrollee in the FHI program, information regarding whether he/she ever received OFP payment is also documented. Consistent with the information contained in the Agricultural Census Survey and the FHI profile, a dummy variable was then defined for the FHI program status of each principal farm operator; the value is equal to 1 if he/she was enrolled in the program in 2005, and 0 otherwise. Since only one principal farm operator is identified for each farm household and only this principal operator's personal identification is documented in the Agricultural Census Survey, we can only compile the FHI status of the principal farm operator of each farm from the FHI profile and Agricultural Census Survey of the farm household. Therefore, our merged dataset is based on the farm household level, and only the principal farm operator of each farm can be identified. After deleting a few observations with missing values on certain important socio-demographic characteristics of the principal farm operators, we arrive at a final matched sample of 703,287 farms. For each farm, the principal farm operator's decision to participate in the FHI and the OFP program is identified. Among these farms, only 411,213 (59%) are farms whose operators were enrolled in the FHI program. With respect to the farm succession specification, we relied on the information documented in the Agricultural Census Survey to define farm succession. In this data, family members aged over 15 were instructed to indicate their farm position as operator, successor, or none of the above. Successors may include children or siblings of the farm operator who regard farming as their main job. According to this information, a dummy variable was then defined to indicate if a farm household had at least one family successor working on the farm. Two different measures of farm succession are found in existing studies. Farm successions are observed either ex post or they are based on an ex ante statement about future decisions. For instance, Kimhi (1994) used panel data to define actual farm succession ex post by comparing farm operators' age in different time period data. On the other hand, a more common way is to define farm succession ex ante by asking elderly farmers whether they have any succession plan (e.g. Kimhi and Lopez 1999;Mishra and El-Osta 2008). Our measure of farm succession belongs to an ex ante measure similar to the one used in Mishra and El-Osta (2008). However, our measure is based on the self-identification of the successors, rather than identification by the aged farmer. Information on the on-farm work of the principal farm operator is recorded in the Agricultural Census Survey. Accordingly, a continuous variable is defined for his/her on-farm days in 2005. Regarding the information for off-farm employment, only whether the principal farm operator engaged in off-farm labor market in 2005 was documented, and detailed information of the total working hours was not available. As a result, we specify a dummy variable for the off-farm work of the principal farm operator: the value is 1 for those who worked off-farm in 2005, and 0 otherwise. In accordance with the findings of previous studies on farm succession, some variables reflecting the socio-demographic characteristics of the principal farm operators, farm and family structure, and regional heterogeneity are specified. A dummy variable was used to define the gender of the principal farm operator, and three dummy variables were used to indicate his/her educational attainment at the primary school, junior high school, senior high school, or higher education levels. We also created some variables to control for family structure, including the number of household members aged between 7-17, 18-44, and 45-64. Several dummy variables for different farm types were also included. Finally, it has been documented that the local labor market conditions are significantly associated with farmers' labor allocation (e.g. Ahearn, El-Osta, and Dewbre 2006;Chang and Yen 2010). To determine the effects of the local labor market conditions on the labor supply of farm operators, we collected additional data from other sources. For example, average monthly wage rates from the manufacturing, financial, service, and business sectors in each county are extracted from the Bureau of Economic Analysis employment files and the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census from 2004. These wage variables were then merged with our farm data at the county level. Given that nearly all farms in Taiwan grow crops (approximately 98%), in this study we focus only on crop farms. Since we are interested in family farm succession behavior, we also excluded commercial farms and singleperson family farms. Because the age that FHI insurants are eligible to receive OFP payments is 65, we further limited our sample to farms whose principal farm operator is aged between 60 and 70. 3 Since we do not have precise information on the exact date of birth for each principal farm operator, it is not clear if he/she was eligible to receive OFP payments if he/she turned 65 during the time that the survey was conducted. Therefore, we deleted farms whose primary operator was 65 in 2005. The final sample consists of 160,380 crop farms; detailed definitions and sample statistics of all selected variables are presented in table 1. As presented in table 1, 66% of the principal farm operators participated in the FHI program in 2005. Among FHI insurants, almost half received OFP payments (34% of the full sample). The average rate of farm succession was 8% of the total sample, and the sample means differ by FHI status and operators' age. The highest succession rate was found for farms whose operators are older than 65, and are FHI non-insurants (11%). As expected, FHI insurants also worked more on the farm and less off the farm compared to FHI non-insurants. Considering the farm operators who are older than 65, for instance, the average on-farm days for the FHI insurants and non-insurants were 113.97 and 93.57 days, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Econometric Analysis", "text": "To examine the causal effect of the OFP program on farm succession, several issues have to be addressed. First, the FHI program and the OFP payment are not randomly assigned to farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to control for the self-selection bias for both the FHI and the OFP programs on farm succession. Second, to identify the effect of the OFP program,it will be useful to be clear about which counterfactual group is to be compared with the OFP recipients. As exhibited in figure 1, non-recipients of OFP payments include three groups of farms (regions B, C, and D). A complete picture of the effect of the OFP program on farm succession can be better understood by comparing the OFP recipients to all three OFP non-recipients The analytical framework of this article combines the strengths of the regression discontinuity design, the inverse probability weighting method, and the difference-in-difference method (RD-DiD) to examine the causal effect of the FHI and OFP programs on farm succession. Our empirical analysis is conducted in two steps. In the first step, we estimate a semi-parametric binary choice model for FHI participation and then calculated the predicted probability that each farm operator would participate in the FHI program. The focus of the second-stage analysis was to estimate a farm succession equation using the proposed RD-DiD method. To further correct for the potential endogeneity of FHI participation on farm succession, the inverse of the predicted probability of FHI participation of each farm operator was then used as the appropriate sampling weight for estimating the farm succession equation. We introduce the nature and the details of the econometric model used in each stage analysis below."}, {"section_title": "First-stage Analysis of the FHI Program", "text": "If FHI * i is the unobserved latent variable of the FHI participation decision for the i th farm operator, FHI i is the observed counterpart, X i is a vector of the covariates, \u03b2 is the vector of the associated unknown parameters, and u i is the random error, the binary choice model of FHI participation can be specified as: The probability of the FHI participation decision (Pr(FHI i = 1)) can be shown as: where F(.) is an unknown function that depends on the distribution of the error term. The log-likelihood function for a random sample of n farmers thus takes the following form (Wooldridge 2010): In equation 3, if F(.) is specified as a cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution ( (.)), this forms the commonly used binary probit model. Although the probit model has been commonly used, validating the model relies on the normality assumption. If u i does not follow a normal distribution, the cost of utilizing a parametric probit model is high (Goldberger 1983). To overcome this drawback, we estimate the FHI equation using a more flexible semi-parametric model proposed by Gallant and Nychka (1987). The idea behind the Gallant and Nychka (1987) method is straightforward; instead of directly imposing an assumption of a normal distribution on the error term, the unknown density of the random error term is approximated by the Hermite polynomial expansion method. Following Gallant and Nychka (1987),the unknown probability function F(.) in equation 3can be specified as (De Luca 2008) 4 : We used the user-written Stata command provided by De Luca (2008) to estimate the semi-parametric model. where \u03c6(.) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution and H is the function that guarantees integration of the unknown function, F(.), is equal to 1. From equation 4, it is obvious that the polynomial approximation generalizes the binary probit model by adding several polynomial terms. If the additional parameter of the polynomial order (l) is equal to 0, the probability function F(.) degenerates to the standard normal probability function ( (.)); in this case, it specifies the binary probit model. If we substitute equation 4into equation 3, the consistent estimates of the semi-parametric model can be obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation method. With the consistent estimates of the binary choice model of FHI participation, we then calculate the predicted probability of FHI participation for each farm operator (P(FHI i = 1)). Following the inverse probability weighting method, the sampling weights were then calculated as (see Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao 1994;Funk et al. 2011): The variable W i is used as an appropriate sampling weight variable to correct for selfselection bias, which is due to the FHI participation decision when estimating the farm succession equation in the second-stage analysis (introduced below)."}, {"section_title": "Second-stage Analysis for Farm Succession", "text": "Since the late 1990s, regression discontinuity (RD) applications have increased in popularity. The attractiveness of such designs probably rests on their similarity to a formal randomized experiment, and the consequent perception that the identifying assumptions are relatively weak and plausibly hold in many circumstances compared to other methods of program evaluation (Wooldridge 2010). The RD analysis of the program evaluation is commonly applied to cases of program evaluation where the treatment of the program depends on a threshold for the eligibility criterion. The key condition for an RD analysis to approximate a quasi-experiment is that the positioning of an individual at either side of the threshold is randomly determined in the neighborhood near the threshold. In an RD design, the participation status can depend, either completely or partly, on the value of an observed preprogram characteristic being above or below a specified threshold. Complete participation leads to a sharp RD model, and partial participation leads to a fuzzy RD model. The model description, model identification and RD design estimation can be found in review papers by Imbens and Lemieux (2008),and Lee and Lemieux (2010). Like nearly all welfare programs, the OFP program uses need-based rules to determine eligibility. As presented in figure 1, all of the FHI insurants are eligible to receive pensions when they turn 65. It is straightforward to use these eligibility criteria in an RD analysis because the probability of enrolling in the program changes substantially or discontinuously once individuals pass a program's eligibility threshold (at age 65). To provide a better understanding of our econometric model, we first focus on a simple case when there are only FHI insurants to be considered. We then extend the standard RD model to the proposed RD-DiD model, where both FHI insurants and non-insurants are included."}, {"section_title": "A Standard RD Design for FHI Insurants only", "text": "If we focus solely on the FHI insurants (regions A and B in figure 1), a standard sharp RD design can be directly applied because all of the FHI insurants aged 65 or older are eligible to receive pensions. Under the regularity assumption that the mean value of the farm succession among the OFP non-recipients is conditional on the operator's age (the running variable) being a continuous function around 65, the effect of the OFP payment on farm succession can be defined as: where Y 1i , Y 0i are the dummy variables of farm succession for the operators who receive and do not receive pensions, respectively. The variable FHI i is a binary indicator for FHI enrollment. The Age65 variable indicates the cutoff age of the operator for the OFP payment, and Age65 + , Age65 \u2212 indicates the two sides of the neighborhood around the cutoff. With the selection of an appropriate sample of farms whose operators' ages are close to 65, equation (6) can be estimated using a local linear regression model (Imbens and Lemieux 2008). However, this estimation strategy is not applicable in our case because our measure of the operator's age is in years, not the exact date of birth, due to the confidentiality requirement. Therefore, the running age variable is not a continuous variable, but rather a discrete variable. A discrete running variable means that we cannot compare observations \"close enough\" on both sides of the cutoff point to be able to identify the causal effect. To overcome this drawback, we followed the approach proposed by Lee and Card (2008) to specify a linear probability model, and used a low-order polynomial function to approximate the unknown flexibility function of the running variable (i.e. operator's age). 5 The farm succession equation can then be specified as: where a i indicates the operator's age normalized to be zero around 65 (i.e. a i = Age i \u2212 65); m(a i ) is a polynomial function for a i ; Z i is a vector of the other exogenous determinants that are related to farm succession, and \u03b3 is a vector of the corresponding parameters. In this setup, the coefficient \u03c4 then captures the causal effect of the OFP payment on farm succession (Lee and Card 2008). Consistent estimates of equation 7can be obtained using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method."}, {"section_title": "The RD-DiD Model for All Farm Operators", "text": "Although a sharp RD analysis can be used to examine the causal effect of the OFP program on farm succession, the results are validated only when the sample of the FHI insurants is used. As presented in figure 1, a complete picture of the OFP effect may be better understood by examining the comparison of OFP recipients to OFP non-recipients. Since the FHI non-insurants are not eligible 5 A linear probability model is specified for the farm succession equation. As noted in Lee and Lemieux (2010), identifying the RD analysis does not depend on the distributional assumption of the random error; thus, estimating a binary choice model is not necessary. A linear probability model has been commonly used in the RD analysis when the outcome variable is binary (Lee and Lemieux 2010). at National Taiwan University on July 17, 2013 http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from to receive OFP payment, a difference-indifference model can be applied to the sharp RD design. To further combine the spirit of the DiD method into the sharp RD design, we modified equation 7to the case when both of the FHI insurants and non-insurants are included. Because the running variable is discrete, a parametric specification of the RD-DiD model can be shown as: where the second equality holds because all of the FHI insurants will receive the OFP payment when they reach age 65. Given the specification of equation 8, several effects can be identified. First, the term (\u03c4 1 + \u03b3 2 ) captures the effect of farm succession between farms whose operators are older than 65 and operators younger than 65 among the FHI insurants, all things being equal (i.e. region A minus region B in figure 1). In contrast, the term (\u03b3 2 ) captures the effect on farm succession between farms whose operators are older than 65 and those who are younger than 65 among the FHI non-insurants, all things being equal (i.e. region C minus region D in figure 1). As a result, the net effect (or the so-called DiD effect) can be captured by the parameter \u03c4 1 . The consistent estimates can be obtained using the OLS method. In the standard DiD framework, the control group (i.e. FHI non-insurants) and the treatment group (i.e. FHI insurants) are usually exogenously determined. In our case, however, the decision to participate in the FHI program is voluntary, so the FHI insurants and non-insurants groups are unlikely to be exogenously determined. When both of the FHI insurants and non-insurants are considered, it is necessary to correct for the potential selection bias due to the FHI participation decision. To address this issue, we followed the same spirit of the inverse probability weighting method proposed by Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994) and Wooldridge (2007), who argued that the self-selection bias can be adjusted by using appropriate sampling weights in the model estimation of the outcome equation. 6 In our case, the sampling weights (W i ) calculated by the binary choice model of the FHI equation equation 5were used when estimating the RD-DiD model (equation 8). Equation (8) was estimated using the OLS method and the standard errors of the estimates are calculated using the bootstrapping method with 500 replications. 7"}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results", "text": "The estimated parameters and the marginal effects of the exogenous determinants on FHI participation using the semi-parametric model are presented in table 2. The semi-parametric model fits our data better than the probit model based on two findings. First, two of the estimated parameters of the polynomial terms (U 2 and U 3 ) are statistically significant. 8 Second, the result of the LR test rejects the null hypothesis that the probit model is statistically equal to the semi-parametric model (LR test value = 129.41, p-value < 0.001). 9 As exhibited in table 2, socioeconomic characteristics of the farm operator, family and farm structure, and local economic conditions are significantly correlated with the FHI program participation decision. The results show that an additional year in an operator's age increases the likelihood of FHI participation by 0.5%. The positive effect of operator age on health insurance coverage is consistent with the findings in the United States (Gripp and Ford 1997). A gender difference in the FHI participation decision of the farm operator is also evident. Compared to female operators, male operators have a 10.3% higher propensity to enroll in the FHI program. 6 In a standard treatment effect model with a binary choice equation and an outcome equation, the inverse probability weighting method can be used to deal with the self-selection bias. A binary choice model is estimated in the first stage, and the second-stage analysis estimates the outcome equation with the appropriate sampling weights. The sampling weights are calculated as the inverse of the predicted probability of the binary treatment. Details of this method can be found in Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994), Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder (2003), and Wooldridge (2007). 7 Funk et al. (2011) conducted a simulation analysis to compare the model performance when the inverse probability weighting method is applied. They suggest using the bootstrapped standard errors of the parameters in that the bootstrapped confidence intervals provided nominal coverage across models of different ranges of sample sizes. 8 In the preliminary analysis,we tried various specifications using different polynomial order terms. The estimation results are stable, but a significant multicollinearity problem occurs when the fourthorder (or any higher) term is included. 9 Detailed information of the comparisons between these two models can be found in the online appendix.  129.41 (p-value < 0.001) Notes: 22 dummy variables of the administrative districts are also included in model estimation. * * * , * * , * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. a For model identification purposes, the constant term is fixed using the estimate of the probit model. b H 0 : Probit model is equal to semi-parametric model. The critical value of the test is x 2 0.99 (1) = 6.635. Family condition also matters. Results show that an additional household member aged between 7-17, 18-64, or 45-64 will decrease the propensity of the farm operator to enroll in the FHI program by 6.2%, 1.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. Participation in the FHI program also differs between farm types. Compared to farms producing other crops (the reference group), rice, vegetable, and fruit farms have higher propensities for FHI participation, by 6.3%, 6.6%, and 4.0%, respectively. Our result also points to a positive association between farm size and FHI participation: an additional hectare of farmland increases the probability of FHI participation by 0.3%. Finally, local economic conditions in the labor market are also significantly associated with FHI participation. The results show that the average wage rates of off-farm work are negatively associated with farmers' decision to enroll in the FHI program. For instance, an increase in the off-farm wage in the manufacturing or business sectors (base unit is TWD 10,000/month) will decrease the likelihood of FHI participation by 0.6% and 4.7%, respectively. This result may reflect the fact that higher off-farm wages provide stronger incentives for the farmers to engage in off-farm labor, and farmers who worked more off the farm are more likely to have higher chances to enroll in other non-farm employment-based health insurance programs. Therefore, these farmers are less likely to enroll in the FHI program."}, {"section_title": "An Informal Look at the OFP Program Effect on Farm Succession", "text": "In any RD analysis, perhaps the most intuitive way to examine the program effect is to determine whether there is any jump (or discontinuity) around the threshold of the running variable.

In each panel, we first depicted the average rate of farm succession in each age group of the farm operators, and a quadratic functional form was then used to fit the data.

This shows that farm succession is rather smooth for FHI noninsurants compared to farms whose operators are FHI insurants. This result provides a snapshot of the effect that the OFP program has on farm succession without controlling for other covariates and with no correction for the selfselection bias."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of the Farm Succession", "text": "The estimation results of a linear probability model of the farm succession equation are presented in table 3. In addition to the three key dummy variables that indicate whether a farm operator is older than 65 (Age > 65), which are the FHI status (FHI), and the interaction of these two variables ([age > 65] * FHI), we also control for several variables reflecting the human capital of the farm operator, family and farm structure, local labor market conditions, and regional heterogeneity. Moreover, a third-order polynomial function is used to approximate the flexible function form of the normalized operator's age in the model equation. Sampling weights calculated based on equation (5) are used to correct for the selfselection bias that is due to the FHI program. The results in table 3 show that male operators are less likely to pass their farm business on to the younger generation compared to their female farm operator counterparts. This gender difference in farm succession is in accordance with the findings in previous studies (e.g. Mishra and El-Osta 2008). The farm operator's human capital also plays an important role in farm succession. The results show that,compared to farm operators who finished senior high school or higher education (the reference group), farm operators who finished elementary and junior high school are more likely to pass their farm on to the younger generation, by 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively. This result may reflect the fact that the productivity of less-educated farm operators is lower; therefore, they are less competitive in the farm business. Perhaps this disadvantage leads them to retire earlier and pass the business to the younger generation. Family characteristics are also important for farm succession. The results show that an additional household member Note: 22 dummy variables for administrative districts are also included in the model estimation.

A linear probability model was specified for the farm succession equation. aged 7-17, 18-44, and 45-64 will increase the likelihood of farm succession by 2.2%, 3.2%, and 2.5%, respectively. This may reflect the possibility that a family farm of more household members may have more family laborers working on the farm; the family farm has more options for their family members to be the successors. Finally, in accordance with the finding in Mishra, El-Osta, and Shaik (2010), a positive association between farm size and farm succession is found. Results show that an additional hectare of farmland increases the farm succession rate by 2.8%. Perhaps the most interesting finding regards the effects of the OFP program on farm succession. The results of several different treatment effects that are defined based on the comparison of the OFP recipients to different subgroups of OFP non-recipients are presented at the bottom of table 3. The standard errors of the treatment effects are calculated using the delta method (Rao 1973). The results reveal some interesting findings: regardless of FHI status, the likelihood of farm succession is higher for farm operators who are older than 65 compared to their counterparts who are younger than 65. This result is consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis in that older farm operators are more likely to pass on farm businesses to the younger generation. Moreover, the effect is smaller for FHI insurants. The differences in farm succession between farms whose operators are older than 65 and those with operators younger than 65 are 2.1% and 4.0% for FHI insurants and non-insurants, respectively. Therefore, the net effect (or the DiD effect) of the OFP program on farm succession is \u22121.9%. In our sample, 12,233 farms have a successor. Based on the sample statistics in table 1 and the estimation results in table 3, the effect of the OFP program on farm succession (1.9%) is equivalent to 1,014 farms. That is, all things being equal, the OFP program results in 1,014 fewer farms with a successor. 10 Note: 22 dummy variables for administrative districts are also included in the model estimation.

A linear probability model was specified for the off-farm work equation."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms that Link the OFP Program and Farm Succession", "text": "As mentioned above, discussing the possible mechanisms that link the OFP program and farm succession may be crucial in that the OFP program is not directly designed for farm succession. 11 One possible mechanism is proposed, which is based on the current regulation of the FHI program. As discussed earlier, farmers are required to work on the farm at least 90 days per year to be eligible to participate in the FHI program. In this section, we empirically test whether the OFP payment has any influence on the labor allocation of the farm operator. To empirically test the possible mechanism, we also conducted an analysis to estimate two separate RD-DiD models (i.e., equation 8) using different outcome variables related to the 11 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this observation. farmers' labor allocation. Two outcomes variables were used for the farm operator's time allocation:a continuous variable of the on-farm days of the farm operator, and a dummy variable for whether the farm operator worked off the farm. The estimation results of each equation are presented in table 4. Since we are only interested in the effects of the OFP program on labor allocation, we focus our discussion of the results presented in table 4 on the DiD effects only (see the bottom of table 4). It is evident that the OFP program has a significant effect on the farm operator's time allocation between farm and non-farm work. The OFP program slightly increased the farm operator's time on the farm by 2.785 days. In contrast, the OFP program led to a decrease in the farm operator's likelihood to work off the farm by 5.2%. The findings of the OFP program on labor allocation of the farm operator may reflect the current rule of the FHI program. In particular, an eligible FHI insurant is required to work on the farm at least 90 days per year to be identified as a farmer. This requirement may provide an incentive for FHI insurants older than 65 to spend more time on the farm and less time off the farm. The increased (decreased) effects of the OFP program on on-farm (off-farm) labor then negatively affect the succession plan within the farm family. To have more confidence in the proposed labor mechanism, we conducted an additional analysis that only includes farm operators whose on-farm days are more than 180 days per year (31,053 farms in total). 12 The rationale for this exercise is as follows: if the 90-day eligibility rule of the FHI program plays a part, this restriction should not affect farm operators who work much more than 90 days per year since they are in no danger of falling below the 90-day limit. Focusing on the farm operators who worked more than 180 days on the farm, we estimated the RD-DiD models for farm succession and labor allocation (results are presented in table A5 in the online appendix). The results are encouraging because the net effect of the OFP payments, which is reflected by the coefficient of the variable OFP, is statistically insignificant in both farm succession and the on-farm days equations. These results provide us with more confidence that the 90-day restriction of the FHI program may play a part in explaining the negative effect of the OFP program on farm succession."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This article assesses the extent to which the older farmers' pension program may affect farm succession, using a unique dataset from Taiwan. An analytical framework that combines the strengths of the regression discontinuity design, the inverse probability weighting method, and the difference-in-difference method is applied. Results indicate that the old farmer pension program significantly reduces the likelihood of farm succession. With respect to the possible mechanism, it is evident that the OFP program increased the on-farm time spent by farm operators. These findings are robust with different model specifications. Although it is possible that having a passive income like a pension would likely increase the odds of farm succession because it reduces the extent to which the farmers would rely on farm income in retirement, this is not the case in Taiwan. Given that there is no other retirement program for farmers, the strictly enforced 90-day requirement of the on-farm work in the OFP program provides an incentive for older farmers to continue working on the farm to maintain eligibility. As a result, the OFP program negatively impacts farm succession. In terms of policy relevance, this article points out a tradeoff between the social security program for elderly farmers and family farm succession. On the one hand, a pension payment is paid to older farmers to sustain their well-being. On the other hand, this pension results in an undesired effect on family farm succession. To maintain eligibility to receive a monthly pension, older farmers may choose to continue working on their farms, which subsequently delays the intra-household succession of farm business to the younger family members. Because it is believed that farm productivity decreases with the operator's age (e.g., Tauer and Lordkipanidze 2000), our finding of the positive effect of the OFP program on the on-farm labor of older farmers may also imply a negative effect of the OFP program on farm productivity. Although we have presented some interesting findings, a few caveats remain. Due to data limitations, we cannot comment on the timing of farm succession. Further research on the timing of succession should provide a broader picture of farm succession in the long-run. This issue can be better addressed in a panel data framework. If the panel data become available, the robustness of our findings can be further verified by conducting a similar analysis using the ex post measure of farm succession, as suggested by Kimhi (1994). However, these issues are left to subsequent research efforts."}]
