[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease has caused over one million deaths worldwide 1 . The clinical features of patients affected by COVID-19 have been extensively explored, but the predisposing factors contributing to increased transmission and clinical severity remains unclear. Social and ecological health determinants such as air pollution [2] [3] [4] [5] , have been suggested to increase the risk of infection and exacerbate COVID-19 related illness. In addition, several comorbidities have been shown to increase COVID-19 mortality rates, including cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies 6, 7 . The predominance of these comorbidities in advanced age combined with the increased incidence of mortality in elderly patients indicates that age is a major risk factor for COVID-19 mortality 8 . These observations raise concerns that elderly patients affected by chronic diseases, including neurological manifestations, may be susceptible to increased risk of critical illness from COVID- 19 . In addition to COVID-19, age is one of the major risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) 9 . Moreover, cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies are not only risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, but also for dementia [10] [11] [12] . In fact, new evidences show that pre-existing diagnosis of dementia represents an important risk factor for COVID-19 13 . In one of the largest cohort studies of COVID-19 in Europe, data gathered from 166 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales showed that dementia was amongst the most common comorbidities in the 20,133 patients hospitalised for COVID-19, after adjusting for age and other confounders 14 . Another study showed that patients with dementia and other neurological diseases are at higher risk of COVID-19 in-hospital death 15 . In addition, an analysis of 153 nondemented PD patients, without a history of lung disease, found that 40% of these patients had respiratory difficulties 16 , showing that some sub-groups of PD patients may be at elevated risk of severe complications following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Similarly, the high incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with AD, particularly in the late stages of the disease, might be an important risk factor for COVID-19 infection and mortality 17 . These studies provide compelling evidence that individuals with dementia or neurodegenerative diseases are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality, but it remains unclear if specific subtypes of neurological disorders may differentially affect COVID-19 outcome. Furthermore, it remains unclear which mechanisms underlie this putative association and whether specific types of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with increased COVID-19 infection and mortality.\nA recent review indicates that disease-specific neuropathology may underlie differential vulnerability to COVID-19 infection and mortality among individuals affected by AD or PD 17 . In England and Wales, 25.6% of all COVID-19 deaths registered between March and June 2020 are found in people with dementia, making these the most common pre-existing conditions associated with COVID-19 mortality 18 . However, it remains unclear if patients with PD are at greater risk of COVID-19 adverse outcome compared to the general population 19 . Most studies to date only included data from hospitalised or clinically suspected COVID-19 patients . Because a large proportion of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic 20 , these inclusion criteria likely led to some degree of misclassification, as hospital admission rates for COVID-19 depend on the prevalence of community testing and admission criteria, which vary between countries.\nHere we explored whether individuals with dementia, AD or PD are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality using the UK Biobank. This dataset contains primary health records of more than half a million individuals, including participants that were tested for COVID-19 since the beginning of this pandemic. We found that a pre-existing diagnosis of dementia or AD predicts the largest risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. PD was associated with increased risk of infection but not mortality from COVID-19. Findings from previous studies suggested an important role for dementia in increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 14 . Here we provide the first systematic analysis of the relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases at the individual level. Our results have important implications for disease management and further highlight an important role of disease-specific neuropathology and management in the potential susceptibility to COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "UK Biobank data sources", "text": "The UK Biobank comprises health data from over 500,000 community volunteers aged 40 "}, {"section_title": "Study design and exclusion criteria", "text": "We conducted a cohort study using national primary care electronic health record data linked to inhospital COVID-19 death data (see UK biobank data sources).

During the same period, COVID-19 testing in England was restricted to hospitalized patients with clinical signs of the disease and health care workers. In contrast, all UK Biobank participants included in this study were subjected to COVID-19 testing since the beginning of the pandemic. For our models, we defined a positive outcome as either a positive COVID-19 diagnosis or an in-hospital death in COVID-19 positive cases. Risk factors and covariates used for the present analysis were selected on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. These are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and included dementia, AD, PD, frontotemporal, vascular dementia, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, blood group, age, sex, obesity, respiratory difficulties [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and wheezing], forced expiratory volume (FEV), gray and white matter volume, brain volume, white matter hyperintensity and C-reactive protein levels (CRP). Obesity was defined based on waist-to-hip ratio measurements. Waist-to-hip ratio is determined by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference, meaning that overweight individuals have higher ratios 23 . We grouped smoking status into current, former and never smokers. CRP total levels were normalised according to protein total protein levels, and log-transformed to fit a normal distribution. Other covariates considered as potential upstream risk factors were population density, social deprivation, average household income, education level, housing type, ethnicity, environmental risk at workplace (chemical, diesel, dusty, smoke), travel to work and number of people per household. Deprivation was measured using the Townsend Social Deprivation Index (TSDI) 24 , with higher values indicating higher deprivation, derived from the patient's postcode for a higher degree of precision. Ethnicity was grouped into white or minority ethnicities. The full list of minority groups used for our analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 2 .

For the multivariable model of COVID-19 infection, we omitted FEV, COPD, environmental risk at the workplace, and travel to work due to a large number of individuals having missing data.

The overall cumulative incidence of PD and AD diagnosis among COVID-19 test positive patients in our cohort was 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively (Supplementary Table 5 ). Our results show that a diagnosis of AD was strongly associated with COVID-19 infectivity, with AD patients showing the greatest susceptibility to COVID-19 infectivity compared to individuals without AD (OR 4.15; 97.5% CI 3. 22-5.34 ). We also found that an increase in waist-to-hip ratio (OR 3.08; 97.5% CI 2. 27-4.19) Table 6 ). Given the large number of variables in our models, we simplified our analysis using an iterative stepwise regression approach to select the most suitable predictors of COVID-19 death based on AIC. In terms of neurological diseases, diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (OR 16.36; 97.5% CI 5. 44-49.15 ) and AD (OR 4.17; 97.5% CI 2.87-6.05) were associated with the largest risk of COVID-19 death but not PD or vascular dementia. In our model, pre-existing diagnosis of cancer was negatively associated with COVID-19 death (OR 0.63; 97.5% CI 0.51-0.79) and no significant association was found between diabetes, C-reactive protein levels and ethnicity ( Figure 3B ). We also found that living in socially deprived areas increases the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcome (OR 1.07; 97.5% CI 1.05-1.09), while an increased waist-to-hip ratio (OR 5.83; 97.5% CI 2.18-15.58) or male gender (OR 1.38; 97.5% CI 1.16-1.65) were positively associated with COVID-19 death but this relationship did not reach statistical significance.\nWe next focused on the role of AD on COVID-19-related deaths. We first built a model that only contains participants with a positive AD diagnosis (Supplementary Table 7 ). Using this model, we found that none of the previously mentioned comorbidities were significant. This observation .

Several features of AD may increase the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcome. First, the neuropathology of AD could facilitate COVID-19 complications. Accumulating evidence suggests that amyloid fibrils induce microglial activation and increased activation of the type-1 interferon (IFN) pathway, a crucial component of COVID-19 infection 35 . Current theories propose that the IFN response in AD may synergise with COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection creating the 'perfect storm' of excessive immune responses and thus exacerbating pathology 36 . Supporting the hypothesis of a neurobiological link between AD and COVID-19 mortality, a recent study further demonstrated that protein expression levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 , are upregulated in the brain of AD patients 37 . This suggests that higher ACE2 expression may underscore higher viral load in the brain of AD patents, corroborating a potential link between AD neuropathology and COVID-19 mortality 38 . Finally, the social behaviour of patients with dementia and AD must be considered. Cognitive decline may compromise the ability of individuals with AD to follow the recommendations of public health authorities, increasing the likelihood of contagion and the need for carers 39 . Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) of dementia and AD, such as motor agitation, intrusiveness, or wandering, may further undermine efforts to maintain isolation.\nWe also found that PD is associated with a heightened risk of COVID-19 infectivity but not mortality. This is consistent with a retrospective study conducted in Japan where patients with parkinsonism hospitalised with pneumonia were found to display a lower rate of in-hospital mortality than age-and sex-matched controls 40 . Two recent studies from Italy have reported increased COVID-19 mortality rates among PD patients. One group gathered clinical information on 120 community-dwelling PD patients and reported a mortality rate of 20%, a value significantly higher than the general population 41 . The second study found that PD patients of older age (>78 years) display increased susceptibility to COVID-19 death compared to younger patients 42 . However, both studies used clinically suspected (non-laboratory confirmed) COVID-19 cases, which complicates their interpretation. As noted by the authors, the increased susceptibility to COVID-19 may have resulted in some patients being incorrectly identified as COVID-19 positive, thus leading to misclassification of COVID-19-related deaths. Moreover, the accuracy of prevalence data might further be hampered by the existence of asymptomatic cases and the lack of population screening campaigns in Italy. Our results support a recent case-controlled study, which shows that PD is not associated with any apparent risk of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population 43 .\nAlthough the biological basis for the higher mortality rate in AD compared to PD patients remains to be elucidated, it has recently been suggested that PD neuropathology itself might exercise a neuroprotective effect against COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, which is highly expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of the striatum 44 . However, PD-related neuropathology induces significant degeneration of these neurons, pointing to reduced neuroinvasion in these patients 17 . Secondly, increased neuronal expression of \u03b1 -synuclein following acute West Nile .

The proposed mechanism of action involves disruption of the lysosomal machinery needed for viral replication 47 infection, government guidelines recommend the isolation of these individuals and limited contact with their family members 50 . However, social activities as well as time spent with other people is generally considered to help prevent cognitive decline in the elderly 51 . Therefore, it is plausible that isolation, albeit necessary, may lead to increased stress and cognitive decline among AD patients 52 . In turn, these behavioural difficulties may exacerbate underlying neurological illness contributing to higher rates of hospitalisation and a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality 52 . While these effects are challenging to measure in the midst of a pandemic, large-scale retrospective studies will reveal the full range of implications of current isolation measures on AD and COVID-19. Finally, several potentially relevant comorbidities, such as kidney disease, previous myocardial infarction, and stroke, were not included in data collection. Future studies should validate our results by examining the effect of additional comorbidities as well as other factors that we were unable to examine, including access to personal protective equipment, employment, exposure to environmental hazards and the effect of living in care home facilities.\nIn conclusion, our results support detailed analyses of the biological mechanisms underlying diseasespecific vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 among patients with neurological illness.

An early report 13 this year showed that dementia diagnosis is associated with the largest increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection in a smaller cohort of patients in England aged 65 and older. Dementia has also been found to increase the risk of in-hospital mortality in a large crosssectional analysis of 20,133 patients already hospitalised for COVID-19 in the UK 14 , a finding later replicated by two later studies 15, 33 . However, these studies mostly focussed on hospitalised individuals and did not include data on patients managed in the community settings, such as domestic residences. In addition, in line with government guidelines, testing was limited to individuals with COVID-19 symptoms meaning that their figures do not include the growing number of people who are asymptomatic or are self-isolating at home due to mild symptoms 14 . Using granular data from the UK Biobank, we have developed a more robust analysis pipeline, since all participants in our dataset received COVID-19 testing. Because a large proportion of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic, this screening protocol is more sensitive for the analysis of COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among people diagnosed with neurological diseases.\nOur results indicate that AD patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings expand a recent analysis with a smaller sample size of COVID-19 positive individuals from the UK Biobank.
