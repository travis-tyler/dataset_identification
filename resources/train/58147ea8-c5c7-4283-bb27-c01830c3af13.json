Little information is available on the pattern and determinants of the longitudinal change in PWV with aging. Such information is crucial to elucidating mechanisms underlying arterial stiffness and the design of interventions to retard it. Between 1988 and 2013, we collected 2 to 9 serial measures of PWV in 354 men and 423 women of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who were 21 to 94 years of age and free of clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Rates of PWV increase accelerated with advancing age in men more than women, leading to sex differences in PWV after the age of 50 years. In both sexes, not only systolic blood pressure (SBP) \u2265140 mm Hg but also SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg was associated with steeper rates of PWV increase compared with SBP<120 mm Hg. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent effect of SBP in men with marked acceleration in PWV rate of increase with age at SBP \u2265140 mm Hg compared with SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg. Except for waist circumference in women, no other traditional cardiovascular risk factors predicted longitudinal PWV increase. In conclusion, the steeper longitudinal increase of PWV in men than women led to the sex difference that expanded with advancing age.

Age was expressed as first-age (age at entry), and time (follow-up time), to differentiate cross-sectional differences from longitudinal changes over time. Sex difference was tested by running the model in the pooled data for men and women with sex, sex\u00d7first-age, and sex\u00d7time interaction terms. We fitted models in different age subgroups to identify the age after which sex difference became significant. Models were then run on men and on women, separately. Predicted PWV, using sex-age-specific mean values for SBP and heart rate (HR), and its rate of change per decade were plotted against age in men and in women. Additional models tested for the cross-sectional and longitudinal association with other cardiovascular health-related covariates by including time-covariate interaction terms. Significant interaction terms for variables affecting longitudinal rates of changes in PWV were included in the final model.

Compared with women, men were taller, heavier, had higher BMI, larger WC, and were more likely to have ever smoked. Men also had lower HR and higher PWV, SBP, diastolic blood pressure, and MAP. Men were more likely to be on antihypertensive medications; however, there was no sex difference in the use of antihypertensive medications among hypertensive subjects at baseline or by the end of follow-up. Men had lower HDL-cholesterol and higher triglycerides and glucose. Antihyperlipidemic and anti-diabetes mellitus medication use were similar in both sexes (Table 1) .\nAdjusting for SBP, HR, antihypertensive medication use, and WC, we found no overall difference in PWV between men and women when the full age spectrum was considered (\u03b2=0.12; P=0.298). However, we found significant firstage\u00d7sex (\u03b2=0.25; P<0.0001) and time\u00d7sex (\u03b2=0.27; P=0.04) interactions (Table S2) indicating that sex differences emerged with increasing age with men having steeper increase of PWV with age than women. To follow up on this finding, we fitted age-stratified models and found that, indeed, men compared with women had significantly higher PWV only after the age of 50 years (\u03b2=0.305; P=0.045). To investigate whether sex differences were a result of falsely elevated PWV in men because of more prevalent central, android obesity, we repeated the analysis with PWV calculated using distance estimated as 29% of height at first visit (see Methods in the online-only Data Supplement) and found similar results (Table S3) .\nWhen we fitted separate models for men and women, we found that in both sexes PWV was higher with older age and increased longitudinally within a given individual over time. The first-age 2 and first-age\u00d7time interaction terms were significant in men and in women indicating an accelerating increase in PWV with aging. However, men had a more pronounced acceleration with aging evidenced by a significant first-age 2 \u00d7time interaction ( Table 2) . As expected, SBP, HR, and WC were significantly and independently associated with higher PWV in both men and women, whereas antihypertensive medications were not. To illustrate sex differences in changes in PWV with aging, model-predicted PWV for age-sex-specific mean values for SBP and HR were plotted against age for men and women, separately ( Figure 1A ). Note the accelerating rates of PWV increase per decade in men beyond the fifth decade ( Figure 1B) .\nWe tested for the association of PWV with SBP and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors in additional models (Table 3 ). Higher SBP was associated with higher rate of PWV increase, as evidenced by a significant SBP\u00d7time interaction in both men (\u03b2=0.17; P=0.004) and women (\u03b2=0.13; P=0.0167). Note that in men, there was a cross-sectional independent association between PWV and triglycerides levels, whereas there was a cross-sectional association of HR, WC, and fasting glucose with PWV in women. Interestingly, in women higher WC was associated with a higher rate of PWV increase over time, evidenced by a significant WC\u00d7time interaction term. There was a trend toward an association between nonwhite race and higher PWV that did not reach statistical significance. There was no direct association with other major traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking and LDL.\nWe further dissected into the association between SBP and PWV by stratifying SBP into 3 categories. Interestingly, in both men and women not only SBP\u2265140 mm Hg but also SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg was associated with larger longitudinal increase in PWV compared with SBP<120 mm Hg in a dose-dependent fashion (Table 4) . Furthermore, in men with SBP\u2265140 mm Hg, the magnitude of PWV increase over time accelerated with advancing age as evident by a significant first-age\u00d7time\u00d7SBP category-3 interaction term (Table 4) . Model-predicted PWV and its rate of change per decade were plotted against age for the SBP categories in men and in women (Figure 2A and 2B). Note in Figure 2B that among men, SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg was consistently associated with faster rates of PWV increase over time (0.3-1.7 m/s per decade) compared with that at SBP<120 mm Hg (\u22120.2 to 1.3 m/s per decade). Also, note in Figure 2B that among men with SBP\u2265140 mm Hg is not only associated with higher rate of change over time than the other SBP categories but also that the rate of increase accelerated over time beyond the age of 50 years illustrating the first-age\u00d7time\u00d7SBP category-3 interaction shown in Table 4 . Similarly, in women there was a separation in the trajectories of PWV among the SBP subgroups ( Figure 2C ). It is worth noting that the rates of PWV increase in women with SBP\u2265140 mm Hg were similar to that of SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg and relatively more constant across the age spectrum compared with men."}, {"section_title": "Discussion Principle Findings", "text": "This is the first extended longitudinal study of PWV in the general population of men and women of a broad age spectrum and extensive clinical information available. We report rates of PWV increase per decade for men and women over a broad age range. Knowing the magnitude and patterns of PWV increase over time is crucial to better estimate the duration and sample size of clinical trials aimed at reducing or slowing arterial stiffening. One novel finding of this study is that men compared with women had steeper longitudinal increase in PWV with aging leading to higher PWV beyond the fifth decade. Another novel finding is that elevated SBP, even in the prehypertensive range, is associated with higher rates of PWV increase that persisted after adjusting for antihypertensive medications and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors."}, {"section_title": "Differential Rate of Change in PWV Between Men and Women Leads to Sex Differences", "text": "We observed sex differences in PWV at higher but not younger age resulting from accelerating rates of PWV increase with aging in men compared with slower rates of increase in women.

On the one hand, cross-sectional studies, limited by their design, report controversial results on sex differences in PWV with only 15 of 54 studies assessed in a systemic review showed higher PWV in men. 19 It is not clear why women did not experience acceleration in the rates of PWV increase in the higher decades; however, this might be linked to a similar pattern of sex differences in aortic remodeling 31 with women having slower rates of aortic dilatation, another aging phenomenon that accompanies arterial stiffness."}, {"section_title": "Arterial Stiffness and SBP: A Vicious Cycle?", "text": "The relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure is complex. On the basis of the findings of this longitudinal analysis, we conclude that higher SBP was associated with accelerated rate of PWV increase, and the results of previous reports of higher PWV predicting the longitudinal increase in SBP, 4, 5 the association between blood pressure and arterial stiffness may be best described as feed forward (ie, a vicious cycle). Our current findings of a dose-dependent association of SBP with higher rates of PWV increase in SBP\u2265140 mm Hg compared with 120 to 139 mm Hg and <120 mm Hg provide a rather strong indication of a potential role of higher SBP in accelerated arterial stiffness. Specifically in men, this dose dependence of SBP on PWV and age gives rise to a triple interaction among age, time, and SBP (Table 4 ; Figure 2A and 2B). In other terms, the impact of high SBP (\u2265140 mm Hg) on the rate of PWV increase over time in men increases with each successive decade. In contrast, in Models were adjusted for variables shown, smoking, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, glucose, creatinine, antihypertensive medications, antihyperlipidemic medications, and initial date of visit; results were reported for terms with P<0.1.

The findings of this study are in agreement with a previous 2-wave longitudinal study showing that PWV accelerates at a greater rate in uncontrolled hypertensive patients compared with patients with controlled hypertensive and normotensive subjects. 29 However, the aforementioned study did not address the association between SBP and rate of PWV increase in the prehypertensive range. On the other hand, our findings differ from a recent report from Framingham study where antecedent SBP was not independently associated with PWV measurement at a future visit. 5 However, PWV was measured only 2\u00d7, 7 years apart in the cited study. It is possible that the longer follow-up period and multiple repeated measures of PWV at shorter intervals of 2.5 years on average might have increased the power to detect the effect of SBP on the rate of PWV change with time."}, {"section_title": "Central Obesity in Women Is Associated With Arterial Stiffness", "text": "We observed an association between WC and higher rates of PWV increase in women with higher WC having an additive rather than synergistic effect with SBP. This association between PWV and WC was attenuated but remained significant when PWV was calculated using body height-derived distance (Table S3 ). This indicates that overestimation of distance, and subsequently PWV, using body surface measurement explained a part, but not all of the association of WC with PWV. We had previously found that metabolic syndrome amplifies the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness assessed by other measurements, such as carotid distensibility. 32 We have also found that the cross-sectional association between adiposity and arterial stiffness is stronger in women than in men. 33 A prior report has shown that weight increase is associated with an increase in PWV in healthy subjects. 30 These findings suggest a role for obesity and its metabolic derangements in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness and encourage close examination of this relationship, while introducing another benefit for weight loss beyond its already well-established and impressive benefits."}, {"section_title": "Dissociation of Longitudinal Changes in Arterial Stiffness From Other Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors", "text": "Our longitudinal study results confirm the recently reviewed findings of prior cross-sectional studies 19 that show dissociation or at the maximum minimal association between arterial stiffness and traditional cardiovascular risk factors except for age and SBP. 19 We observed a trend toward higher PWV in nonwhite, mainly black, subjects that is consistent with previous literature. 34 This might provide an explanation of the higher incidence of hypertension in blacks; further studies with larger representation of minorities are needed to evaluate for racial differences in the longitudinal change in PWV. The association we observed with triglycerides and glucose was cross sectional only that make them less likely causative agents. These facts seem to negate a major role of atherosclerosis in arterial stiffness in this healthy population free of clinical atherosclerosis throughout the period of the study. The exclusion of any subject who developed clinical atherosclerosis at enrollment or during follow-up in the recent study reduced the potential effect of plaque burden on the Our study has some limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results. First, the relatively small sample size, especially when categorizing blood pressure subgroups, might limit the use of the absolute values of the rates of PWV change; however, the frequent observations and long followup insured enough power to detect dose-dependent effect of SBP on PWV increase. Second, estimation of PWV using body surface distance might introduce measurement errors and produce overestimation of PWV caused by central obesity. However, adjusting all models to WC should minimize this effect; in addition, using body height-derived distance measurements showed similar findings."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "Age and SBP are the main longitudinal determinants of PWV, and the effect of SBP on PWV trajectories exists even in the prehypertensive range. Arterial stiffness and SBP interact in a vicious cycle; hence, the improvement observed in PWV beyond blood pressure control in pharmacological clinical trials [35] [36] [37] might be interpreted as winding down of this vicious cycle. Our results emphasize the importance of both blood pressure control and the development of novel interventions at the level of central arteries to limit the progress of this detrimental vicious cycle.
