[{"section_title": "", "text": "healthcare workers are advised to be vaccinated every year. But sometimes more dangerous and even deadly forms occur that are likely to lead to epidemics and pandemics (Andrews, 2006) .\nIn late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients were diagnosed with viral pneumonia, now known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Subsequently, a large number of cases of the disease were found to either reside in Wuhan or travel to the city. The researchers were able to obtain the 2019-nCoV genome sequence by performing bronchoalveolar lavage and culture of patients' lungs and by conducting phylogenetic analyzes of the genome and investigating the evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses, they found the origin of 2019-nCoV and its evolutionary history. The 2019-nCoV genomic sequence obtained from the patients showed that 98.99% of their gene sequences matched. The genome also has an 88% similarity to the genome of the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 bat coronavirus genomes that appeared in Zhoushan, China, but with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) coronaviruses, 79% and 50% were similar, respectively. Also by homology modeling, a model for the virus receptor was obtained, which, by comparing homology models, concluded that despite differences in some amino acids, the structure of the domains attached to the receptor at 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was similar. SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is essential for entry into the host cell. The Spike S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The SARS-CoV virus uses the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to bind the host cell, that contains a diversity of respiratory epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and monocytes. Considering the relatively high identity of the RBD in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is crucial to evaluate the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have significant implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. These structures displayed that SARS-CoV RBD contains a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM), and that the RBM binds to the outer surface of ACE2. The ACE2 is the only known human homolog of the key regulator of blood pressure ACE.\nSARS-CoV-2 RBD showed significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the connection and, therefore, binding of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2expressing cells, so inhibiting their infection to host cells. Therefore, ACE2 also serves as the cellular entry site for the SARS-CoV, a main target for pharmacological intervention and improved new monoclonal antibodies that could attach specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.\nSARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies possibly will cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to improve SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection (Tai et al., 2020; Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, & Li, 2020) .\nBats host a reservoir of various zoonotic viruses, including coronaviruses. Regulatory studies and phylogenetic analyzes have shown that there is a high genetic diversity among SARS-like viruses in bats, allowing for the recombination and evolution of new species.\nIt has been shown that the bat virus with 96% nucleotide sequence similarity to human SARS-CoV can use human ACE2 as a receptor. This represents the same state of entry into the cell as human SARS-CoV. For example, bat SL-CoV-WIV1 can grow on human epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells, which is neutralized by human SARS-CoV convalescent sera (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016) . The recent crisis was the outbreak of novel Coronavirus from emerged Wuhan in central China, referred to as 2019-nCoV, has recently caused a pandemic scale of pneumonia in humans and resulted in a huge threat to the global public and a high number of hospitalizations. The damage to the lungs, which leads to fluid leaking from small blood vessels in the lungs. The fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs or alveoli. This makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood. While there's a shortage of information on the type of damage that occurs in the lungs during 2019-nCoV Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020 A glycopeptide antibiotic commonly used to treat a bacterial infection is active against SARS-CoV and is on the list of drugs that are also used to treat COVID-19 (J. . This antibiotic is Chloroquine has recently been shown to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and the hydroxylated form has been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the overdose of this drug is toxic and can cause death (Devaux, Rolain, Colson, & Raoult, 2020; Weniger & World Health Organization, 1979) . M. Wang et al. (2020) reported that the EC50 of Chloroquine against COVID-19 tested on VERO E6 was 1.13 \u03bcM and the EC90 was 6.90 \u03bcM. Chloroquine inhibits SARS-CoV entry, which exerts its inhibitory effect by altering glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor and spike protein. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to decrease inflammatory responses and decrease cytokine storm in vitro. Chloroquine also interferes with proteolytic processing of M protein and modifies virion assembly and budding. Also, chloroquine indirectly act against COVID-19 by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and by activating anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 + T-cells (Devaux et al., 2020) .

Arbidol (Umifenovir) is a broad-spectrum antivirus that works on both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. It is active on viruses such as influenza A and B and is also known to inhibit hepatitis C. This drug can prevent the fusion of the virus with the target membrane and block the entry of the virus into the target cell (Boriskin, Leneva, Pecheur, & Polyak, 2008 )."}, {"section_title": "| Oseltamivir and other NAIs", "text": "Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAIs) used to treat influ- Of recent concern about the use of oseltamivir was the emergence of resistance in 23% of patients with H1N1, which was asso- "}, {"section_title": "| Ribavirin", "text": "Ribavirin is a guanosine nucleoside analog and antiviral compound (Graci & Cameron, 2006; Martinez, 2020) .

IFN\u03b1-2b and ribavirin, when used for MERS-CoV treatment, showed that they were 8-fold and 16-fold reduced in their single-dose regimen, respectively and they further stimulate cytokine release and immune responses, reducing viral replication, modulating host response, and improving clinical outcomes. Studies using ribavirin plus lopinavir/ritonavir on patients with SARS have reduced ARDS and mortality. There was also a significant decrease in ARDS and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV who received corticosteroids with ribavirin, lopinavir/ ritonavir (Chu et al., 2004; Zheng & Wang, 2016 )."}, {"section_title": "| Favipiravir (T-705 or avigan)", "text": "Favipiravir (FPV) a guanosine analog and an oral anti-influenza drug that targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which converts to active phosphoribosylated form in cells and acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor.

The effective dose of favipiravir used is Day 1:\n1,600 mg twice daily, Days 2-5: 600 mg twice daily but its effective dose for treatment of COVID-19, and 600 mg tid with 1,600 mg first loading dosage for no more than 14 days. However, favipiravir is contraindicated in pregnant women due to teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animals and cannot be used in this group of patients (Delang, Abdelnabi, & Neyts, 2018; Shiraki & Daikoku, 2020) .\nA study by Fang et al. (2020) found that favipiravir could play an important role in protecting mice from the fatal infection of wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant-influenza B viruses. Favipiravir has also been used in combination with zanamivir to successfully clear the type B influenza virus in immunocompromised children (Lumby et al., 2020) . In a randomized clinical trial, Chen et al. (2020) showed that in patients with moderate COVID-19 who were untreated with antiviral drugs, favipiravir increased clinical recovery over 7 days and reduced fever, cough, and respiratory problems, it was therefore used as an effective drug in these patients. Another study by Jianjun\nGao on 80 patients with COVID-19 at the Hospital of Shenzhen, China, showed that favipiravir had a stronger antiviral effect than the lopinavir/ritonavir drug combination and reported no adverse effects (Furuta, Komeno, & Nakamura, 2017) .

It has also been shown to inhibit hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus replication in combination with IFN-\u03b1 and cyclosporine A. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) in use with cyclosporine, it is also a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV but has a less inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV. In studies of coronaviruses in the mouse model, it did not affect SARS-CoV, but at standard concentrations at oral doses, it was able to inhibit MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2013; Henry et al., 2006; Markland, McQuaid, Jain, & Kwong, 2000) .\nMPA acts as a synergism with IFN-\u03b21b and thiopurine analogs but it has less protective effect than the combined effect of 6 | lopinavir/ritonavir with IFN-\u03b21b. The use of this compound in bedside coronaviruses was that with the IFN-\u03b21b used in Saudi Arabia to treat MERS-CoV all patients using this drug combination could survive but patients had lower acute physiology and chronic health (Allison & Eugui, 1993) .

Domain S1 in the SARS-CoV spike protein binds the virus to the ACE2 cell receptor present in the host cells. Therefore understanding the association between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and ACE2 can be an effective therapeutic approach (Lin et al., 2018) . ACE2 is a homolog of carboxy peptidase that is best known for cleaving different peptides in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and other substrates, such as apelin (Batlle, Wysocki, & Satchell, 2020) . This enzyme is mostly present in organs such as the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and relatively low level in the lungs and its expression has been reported in Type 2 pneumocytes (Hamming et al., 2004) . The extracellular domain of ACE2 acts as the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor. The new coronavirus also uses membrane-bound ACE2 as the receptor. ACE2\nneutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by combining with the Fc protein of immunoglobulin (Lei et al., 2020) . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV. In this context, the preparation of a soluble and recombinant form of ACE2 protein in humans could be useful as a novel biological treatment to counter or limit the progression of infection caused by coronaviruses that use ACE2 as a receptor (Wrapp et al., 2020 to treat COVID-19, it is clear that the use of these drugs alone will not produce the desired results, and some drugs will cause side effects in certain groups of people. For example, excessive use of chloroquine is toxic and can even be fatal, or the use of favipiravir in pregnant women is not recommended, as it is associated with teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animals or corticosteroids that are immunosuppressive and are not recommended for mild or early ARDS, because early use of corticosteroids can delay the clearance of the virus and increase the risk of death, long-term administration of high doses of corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment has negative effects. Generally, corticosteroids should be avoided unless the patient has symptoms such as moderate or severe ARDS, sepsis or septic shock. MPA also has no effective inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV, so they are not recommended for treatment. Lopinavir is associated with side effects such as digestive adverse effects and hypokalemia that should be considered by physicians. The use of neuraminidase inhibitors is also invalid due to resistance to nCoV-2019 and is not recommended for the treatment of patients.\nHowever, the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis is appropriate because it blocks the entry of the virus and prevents virus replication, and remdesivir has extensive antiviral activity against coronaviruses. Therefore, the appropriate recommendation for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is a combination of existing drugs. IFN\u03b1-2b together with ribavirin, when used for the treatment of MERS-CoV, showed that their effective dose was decreased compared to the single-dose regimen and better-stimulated cytokine release and inflammatory responses, and decreased viral replication, modulated host response, and improved clinical outcomes.\nRibavirin plus lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with SARS-CoV reduces ARDS and mortality, and in patients with SARS-CoV who receive corticosteroids with ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, their ARDS and mortality significantly decreased. Lopinavir also has a stronger antiviral effect than the LPV/r, and the combination of arbidol and LPV/r is more effective than LPV/r. In addition to these drugs, if ACE2 is presented in its soluble form as a suitable recombinant protein, it may be a new factor in counteracting the spread of coronavirus as well as its proliferation in infected individuals. Another possible treatment option could be the use of serums that are obtained from the blood of patients infected with the new coronavirus during their recovery and also targeting the cellular components involved in the host's inflammatory response to the virus is also a good way of targeting viral damage by targeting a cellular protein.\nYOUSEFI ET AL."}]
