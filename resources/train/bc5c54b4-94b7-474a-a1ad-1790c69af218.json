For each centre, the optimal reconstruction parameters were chosen as those maximizing ISR and RC without a noticeable decrease in SNR.

The main project devoted to CATI was to handle the multimodality imaging aspect of a large cohort of subjects included in a research program on Alzheimer's disease (AD). This program, called ME-MENTO, is a longitudinal study aiming at better understanding the natural history of Alzheimer's disease. It has enrolled 2300 subjects with either light cognitive deficits or cognitive complaints that will be followed up for at least 5 years (http://clinicaltrials.-gov/show/NCT01926249).\nThe imaging aspect of the MEMENTO study includes the acquisition of PET cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid distribution, with MRI studies on anatomy, diffusion, and resting state. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of PET quantitative values to the highest possible per site, while reducing, if possible, the variability across centres for the MEMENTO cohort. Phantom data were acquired during a technical visit to the PET centres, prior to patients' participation in the trial. The same phantom data were also acquired during follow-up visits after 18 months. The present study only addresses the data acquired during the site technical set-up.\nSeveral large cohort studies on AD have been launched since the early 2000s. Among them, ADNI-1 was a forward-thinking, imaging-based multicentre clinical trial that involved 50 centres in North America, with the aim of identifying biomarkers of AD. For the PET imaging carried out in this study, the ADNI PET core determined reconstruction parameters for each scanner model and 3D-Hoffman phantoms were acquired with a standard protocol. However, discrepancies between the image characteristics from different PET centres remained high and were accounted for by degrading the spatial resolution to the lowest value among centres [1] .\nOther multicentre studies specifically focusing on AD have been conducted [2, 3] . In contrast to the ADNI trial, no phantom acquisition was performed prior to the study, and no post-filtering was applied to the data. Differences in spatially normalized FDG-PET scans obtained with scanners of different resolutions were minimized by the following measures: (i) restricting the analysis to voxels with intensity 80 % greater than the whole-brain mean, and (ii) excluding voxels from the uppermost 10 slices (i.e., from the top 22.5 mm of the brain) and from the lowermost 5 slices, where significant interscanner effects due to different fields of view have been reported [3] .\nThe most advanced domain for PET image acquisition harmonization across multiple centres is oncological imaging. Guidelines for PET centres involved in clinical trials have been written by a group of experts, under the umbrella of the European society of Nuclear Medicine [4, 5] , or the American College of Radiology Imaging Network [6] . These guidelines are based on quality checks with phantoms reproducing the imaging conditions encountered in the abdomen and the thorax in glucose metabolism studies. In addition to these tomography quality checks, to ensure the highest reproducibility of the measures extracted from the image for patient follow-up, disease evolution, and recovery after treatments, these groups have formulated recommendations for data analysis. Overall, these recommendations enable the cross-comparison of measurements from different centres. According to our knowledge, the latest guidelines for FDG-PET brain imaging were published in 2009 [7] and do not meet our objectives. This paper presents our test protocol and the results obtained for the 22 PET centres involved in the MEMENTO cohort. French PET centres were equipped with systems set up between 2003 and 2012. No brain-dedicated high-resolution system or 2D tomography systems were included. Therefore, we chose to optimize acquisition and reconstruction parameters using phantom experiments prior to patient studies, with the aim of optimizing PET quantitative values to the highest possible per site, while reducing, if possible, the variability across centres. We also checked the impact of this harmonization on signal-to-noise ratios, as well as the exclusion of reconstruction with point-spread-function (PSF) modelling."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Phantom studies", "text": "Two phantom studies were acquired for the qualification process of the 22 centres, the Jaszczak phantom and the Hoffman 3D brain phantom.

Different reconstruction parameters were tested with varying reconstruction algorithms, number of iterations and subsets, reconstruction diameters, matrix sizes, or filters, always including those routinely used in brain studies.

[9] to estimate the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each PET scanner from the three largest hot spheres. The process can be summarized in three main steps:\n1) Calculation of a ratio R mes as follows:\nwhere Max S is the maximum activity measured in the sphere and A S is the actual activity injected in the hot spheres. Each R mes was normalized by the corresponding value of the largest sphere in order to limit the bias introduced by attenuation and scatter corrections.\n2) Computation of a mask of the three spheres at the same position in the scanner field of view as during the acquisition; this mask was then convolved with a threedimensional isotropic Gaussian function with different FWHM values ranging from 4 to 10 mm and a step of 0.1 mm. A theoretical ratio R the was then calculated for each of the three spheres as follows:\nwhere Max S is the maximum value measured in the sphere after convolution and A S is the actual value. 3) The optimal ISR value was selected as the FWHM value that best fitted the experimental values, according to minimization of the normalized sum of squared differences between observed R mes and simulated R the over the three spheres."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Hoffman 3D brain phantom studies", "text": "All reconstructed volumes were co-registered to the highest quality CT scan of the phantom (acquired at centre no. 16) using SPM8.

These algorithms were discarded by CATI to avoid possible additional centre effects, and 3D-OSEM statistical image reconstruction algorithms, or FORE 2D-OSEM when the 3D-OSEM was not available, were selected.

The image reconstruction parameters were chosen at each site as a compromise between maximized RC values, ISR, and SNR. Volumes of interest ratios extracted from Hoffman acquisitions were also compared to confirm the choice of reconstruction parameters for each site. Our approach can be described as follows: 1) Reconstruction matrix was set to obtain pixel spacing inferior to 3 mm 2) The number of total iterations multiplied by the number of subsets was chosen such as the product iterations \u00d7 subsets was superior to 50, and optimized with post-reconstruction smoothing 3) RC and ISF obtained with different combinations of reconstruction parameters were compared first: the parameters giving highest values with acceptable SNR were chosen. 4) Hoffmann images were then quantitatively and visually checked for the best compromise between spatial resolution and noise. 5) The optimized quantitative values for both phantoms obtained at each centre were finally compared to the routine values.\nThe optimized parameters chosen according to the model of scanner are presented in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare routine and optimized values obtained from phantoms' studies.

It involved 22 PET centres with 13 different PET/CT scanner models, most of which were of recent generation. We ensured the reproducibility of phantom measurements by sending the same technologists to the PET centres for scanner set-up.\nWe checked the cross-calibration between the tomograph and the dose calibration device and found a difference of more than 10 % for four centres, which was immediately corrected. The alignment between the CT and PET scanners was also systematically checked and a correction was performed if necessary. Such a correction was needed in four additional centres."}, {"section_title": "Choice of reconstruction parameters", "text": "Harmonization across scanners and centres for multicentre cerebral imaging trials was one of the achievements of a previous study by the ADNI [11] . For that study, which included 50 centres and 17 different PET scanners, the PET centres were asked to acquire two 3D-Hoffman studies with recommended parameters. The ADNI qualitycheck team then checked the phantom images. For the analysis of the pooled images, a post-reconstruction smoothing filter, determined from phantom measurements, was applied to the images. This filter aimed at homogenizing the spatial resolution of the images across centres, and its application translated to a degradation of the resolution to the lowest one encountered [1] .\nIn the present study, we chose to optimize the reconstruction parameters (with a product iterations \u00d7 subsets superior to 50) and the post-reconstruction filter so that the recovery coefficients in the small cold and hot spheres would reach an optimized mean value and present limited dispersion around this optimal value. To this end, we reconstructed the images using a conventional 3D algorithm with a description of the statistics of the recorded data only, although PSF modelling reconstructions were available on the scanners that were of the more recent generations.\nAs expected, the reconstructions with PSF modelling provided recovery coefficients closer to 1 in the two smallest hot and cold spheres than the reconstructions without resolution modelling. However, Gibbs artefacts [12] were detected on the images at the edges of spherical objects. We therefore discarded them to avoid these artefacts and also to limit the discrepancies in RC in images reconstructed with and without resolution modelling across centres. On the other hand, we allowed algorithms with timeof-flight (TOF) modelling in two centres. It is known that state-of-the-art TOF values have an important effect on signal-to-noise ratio of whole body imaging, but that effect is negligible on smaller objects such as brain structures [13] .\nConversely, in images where both spatial resolution and RC were too low, we chose to use more iterations of the algorithm in order to enhance the spatial resolution of the images and to apply a Gaussian (FWHM between 2 and 4 mm) post-reconstruction smoothing filter to the images. The pixel spacing was between 1 and 3 mm in all optimized images."}, {"section_title": "Improving contrast recovery and dispersion of RC values", "text": "With optimized parameters, the RC significantly improved for the cold spheres, but not for the hot spheres, of close diameter. That difference between cold and hot spheres is partly related to the presence of the sphere walls, which are intrinsically cold. These walls affect the quantification to a greater extent in hot spheres than in cold spheres. Such a cold wall is specific to the phantom. One should also note that the optimized RC was higher in the hot spheres than in the cold spheres of similar diameter. The quantification in cold objects is complex, depending not only on spatial resolution but also on scatter correction and spatial sampling [14, 15] , and of the non-negativity constraint of the statistical reconstruction algorithm MLEM without a specific description [16] . We also significantly reduced the variability of RC in four of the six spheres of the Jaszczak phantom. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , this reduction of variability was mostly due to the suppression of outliers by discarding PSF modelling reconstruction algorithms.\nIt should be emphasized that the RC measurements were obtained with in-house software, which was developed with great care to ensure reproducibility and precision. In particular, the VOIs were not drawn directly on the PET images but were automatically segmented on CT images and optimized with knowledge from the phantom specifications."}, {"section_title": "Improving quantification and variability in small brain structures and image uniformity", "text": "We checked the quantification in the striatum of the Hoffman brain phantom and observed an increase in activity concentration measured in the putamen and caudate, when compared to non-optimized images. We also significantly reduced after the optimization the dispersion of values for putamen, caudate, and grey-matter-to-white-matter ratios.\nFinally, the good uniformity of the images across the field of view was confirmed by the ratio of right-to-left activity concentration and anterior-to-posterior activity concentration measured on the Hoffman brain images. Additionally, as expected, the choice of the reconstruction mode parameters had no impact on the ratio of activity concentration in the right-to-left and frontal-to-occipital regions of interest. Those ratios should not be affected by the spatial resolution. However, they are likely affected by low frequency variation resulting from scatter, uniformity, and attenuation corrections. Attempts to take into account these effects before pooling data sets from multiple centres were suggested by Joshi et al. [1] , but the results were not considered as convincing by the authors. In the present work, the compensation for scatter, random coincidences, and attenuation was performed using the manufacturer's latest techniques, with slight differences in the implementation for the different scanner models. The Hoffman phantom also enabled us to verify that the quantification in typical small structures of the brain, such as the caudate, was improved after the reconstruction optimization."}, {"section_title": "Image spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio", "text": "On average, image spatial resolution was slightly improved, despite a marked decrease for the centres equipped with reconstruction algorithms including TOF and PSF modelling. This improvement is likely due to the increase in the number of iterations in the other centres. As expected, this improvement is counterbalanced by a decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio. We checked with Hoffman phantom acquisitions that this reduction did not impact the visual aspect of the images."}, {"section_title": "Variability across centres", "text": "The variability across centres was reduced but not minimized by this work. For that, it would have been necessary to apply post-filtering tailored per site according to ISR. We deliberately chose not to do this in order to preserve the spatial resolution. This latter goal was achieved for the 18 centres without PSF modelling reconstruction.\nIn order to account for the residual variability across centres, we are currently designing a statistical model that takes into account the centre effect (as assessed by the phantom studies). Several other parameters have been shown to influence the variability of the measurements across centres, including injected dose per kilogram, delay between the injection and the scan acquisition, patient positioning, weight, and glycaemia, and these have been extensively discussed by Boellard [17, 18] . We will add to the statistical model these additional acquisition and patient-related parameters (as assessed by an ancillary monocentric study involving 300 subjects), and we will test it on the MEMENTO cohort.\nIf the statistical model happens not to be sufficiently effective, our approach could be updated in a second phase according to the strategy proposed by Lasnon et al. [19] .

The uniformity across the fields of view of the scanners was good.\nWe provided recommendations to each centre for minimizing the influence of other factors such as injected dose and interval post-injection. In addition, centres were qualified after the analysis of the images of a first test patient.
