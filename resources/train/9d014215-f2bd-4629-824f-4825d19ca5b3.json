[{"section_title": "", "text": "Is student enrollment growing or shrinking? What is the trend in teachers' salaries? How do states compare in teacher/student ratios and educational attainment? Is the cost of college continuing to rise? Finding the answers to these and many other questions is more than just a trivial pursuit. Statistics are the directional signs along the road to quality education for all Americans. We must know where we have been, so that we can better understand where we are going. Most Americans have memories of their own formal education and have strong opinions based on those experiences. Personal contact is a powerful learning tool, but no single experience, no matter how powerful, can compare with facts gathered from a broader perspective. Such is the wealth of statistical material collected and released by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). the country, organizes the data in useful forms, and releases the resulting surveys and studies as survey reports, information compendia, and special reports that focus on specific educational topics. NCES also participates in joint research activities with other organizations, including the National Science Foundation and the Bureau of the Census; brings together federal, state, and local education data collectors through cooperative statistics programs; and reports on education in the United States compared with other countries. NCES is a multimedia operation, producing annual and periodical statistical material as printed publications, postings on the Internet, and as CD-ROM data sets."}, {"section_title": "HERE IS HOW WE CAN HELP YOU", "text": "NCES serves a wide variety of data users who ask questions on many issues. Some examples include: Federal, state, and local governments request data concerning school demographic characteristics, pupil/ teacher ratios, and dropout rates. At the federal level, statistics are used for testimony before Congressional committees and for planning in various executive departments. Among the states, NCES statistics and assessment data are used to gauge progress in educational performance. The media use NCES data for education stories on such topics as student performance, school expenditures, and teacher salaries. Education associations use enrollment information to examine racial-ethnic trends, and finance data to check the economic health of institutions. Colleges use institution-level data on enrollment, financial ratios, and graduation ratios to make comparisons with other postsecondary institutions. The general public turns to NCES with individualized questions, such as which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study. Researchers perform secondary analyses using NCES databases. Businesses use education data to conduct market research and to monitor major trends in education. NCES studies cover the entire educational spectrum, providing the facts and figures needed to help policymakers understand the condition of education in the nation today, to give researchers a foundation of data to build upon, and to help teachers and administrators decide the best practices for their schools. The following pages provide brief summaries of NCES studies, including a sampling of the important findings. A more detailed description of NCES and its studies can be found in the publication, Programs and Plans of some type of postsecondary education by 1994. Of those attending postsecondareducation, about 57 percent were at public or private four-year colleges or universities; 36 percent were enrolled in public twoyear colleges; and the remainder (7 percent) attended trade or technical programs of shorter duration."}, {"section_title": "LONGITUDINAL STUDIES", "text": "These statistics and many more on students, professional staff, school finances, and assessment can be found in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Data were collected from students and their parents, teachers, and high school principals, as well as through cognitive tests. NELS will continue surveying the 1988 8th-graders through the year 2000 and can be compared to data from earlier NCES sponsored longitudinal studies. Longitudinal studies, which follow cohorts of students of varying initial ages, provide detailed information on academic growth, high school dropouts, and experiences in postsecondary education and the world of work. These studies are long-term surveys that follow specific classes of students before, during, and after both high school and college. At the end of each study, educational and occupational aspirations are compared against actual What are the popular majors in college? A greater proportion of students selected undergraduate majors in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences in 1994 than in 1983-84. "}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "How do professors spend their time? The majority of faculty work hours are spent teaching students. Faculty members report that 54 percent of their time is spent in the classroom, while the next two largest categories of work are research (17 percent) and administration (13 percent). Faculty report that they would prefer to spend roughly the same amount of time teaching that they currently do, but more time on research. The preferred distribution is 49 percent of the time spent teaching, with 25 percent of the time spent on research, and only 8 percent on administrative activities. Approximately 60 percent of full-time undergraduate students reported that they received some sort of aid in 1992-93. Forty-eight percent received aid in the form of grants, while 34 percent took out loans to finance their educations. Students at private institutions in 1992-93 were more likely to receive aid than their counterparts at public universities and colleges. Fifty-two percent of public full-time undergraduate students reported financial assistance, while almost 70 percent of students at private institutions received aid.\nWhich children are attending early childhood programs? Children from higher income brackets were more likely to attend center-based early childhood programs than those from more moderate income brackets. In 1995, children from families with incomes over $50,000 per year were more likely to attend programs for 2 years or more than children from families with incomes of $50,000 or less. While 72 percent of all first-graders had previously attended center-based early childhood programs, a smaller proportion of Hispanic first-graders (57 percent) had participated in these programs than their white (73 percent) or black (76 percent) counterparts. The Data on Vocational Education (DOVE) project derives data on vocational education from NCES' secondary and postsecondary surveys. The transcript studies, the longitudinal studies, and SASS are the primary sources of vocational data in secondary education. At the postsecondary level, IPEDS, NPSAS, and the longitudinal studies are the primary sources for vocational education data. The project compares vocational education students, teachers, and schools with their non-vocational counterparts. Upcoming reports include a comparison of participation rates in secondary vocational education among 1982, 1987, and 1992 graduates.. A second report will examine the academic advancement of students completing various amounts of vocational and nonvocational courses."}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL POSTSECONDARY STUDENT AID STUDY", "text": "The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) reports on the costs of higher education, distribution of financial aid, and characteristics of aided and non-aided students. Administrative records concerning student financial aid are coupled with student interviews and data from a subsample of parents.
