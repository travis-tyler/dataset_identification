[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The amygdala is composed of multiple nuclei with unique functions and connections in the limbic system and to the rest of the brain. However, standard in vivo neuroimaging tools to automatically delineate the amygdala into its multiple nuclei are still rare. By scanning postmortem specimens at high resolution (100-150 \u00b5m) at 7 T field strength (n = 10), we were able to visualize and label nine amygdala nuclei (anterior amygdaloid, corticoamygdaloid transition area; basal, lateral, accessory basal, central, cortical medial, paralaminar nuclei). We created an atlas from these labels using a recently developed atlas building algorithm based on Bayesian inference. This atlas, which will be released as part of FreeSurfer, can be used to automatically segment nine amygdala nuclei from a standard resolution structural MR image. We applied this atlas to two publicly available datasets (ADNI and ABIDE) with standard resolution T1 data, used individual volumetric data of the amygdala nuclei as the measure and found that our atlas i) discriminates between Alzheimer's disease participants and age-matched control participants with 84% accuracy (AUC=0.915), and ii) discriminates between individuals with autism and age-, sex-and IQ-matched neurotypically developed control participants with 59.5% accuracy (AUC=0.59). For both datasets, the new ex vivo atlas significantly outperformed (all p < .05) estimations of the whole amygdala derived from the segmentation in FreeSurfer 5"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The amygdala is composed of heterogeneous nuclei, defined primarily by their distinct cytoarchitecture, neurotransmitters, and connectivity patterns (Alheid, 2003; Freese and Amaral, 2005 , 2009 Price et al., 1987; Aggleton, 2000; Gloor, 1972 Gloor, , 1978 Gloor, , 1997 McDonald, 1998; LeDoux, 1998 , De Olmos, 2004 De Olmos and Heimer, 1999) . Studies on rodents and non-human primates have advanced our understanding of the functions of the individual nuclei. For example, the lateral (La) and basal (Ba) nuclei are engaged in updating current stimulus value associations, primarily through connections with orbitofrontal regions (Baxter and Murray, 2002) ; the central nucleus (Ce) is believed to mediate behavioral responses to potentially harmful stimuli and fear perception through its connectivity with hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and the brainstem (Kalin et al., 2004; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992) . In humans, the amygdala as a whole is thought to play a key role in emotional and social cognitive processes (e.g. Adolphs et al., 2005 , Kliemann et al. 2012 , Hortensius et al., 2016 , and accordingly, its dysfunction is implicated in psychopathologies, such as mood disorders (Phillips et al., 2003; Siegle et al., 2002) , anxiety disorders (Birbaumer et al., 1998; Rauch et al., 2003) , and developmental disorders (BaronCohen et al., 2000; Dziobek et al., 2010) . Additionally, several post mortem studies have shown that the amygdala is a common site for neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in mild cognitive impairment (Markesbery, 2010 ) and Alzheimer's disease (Yilmazer-Hanke, 1998) as well as Lewy bodies (Kotzbauer et al., 2011 , Fujishiro et al., 2002 .\nHowever, the relationship between the structure and function of the distinct nuclei in humans remain largely unknown, both in health and disease. The small size of the amygdala's nuclei has made it difficult to study this structure noninvasively in the living brain using standard neuroimaging resolution. Previous segmentation studies of the amygdala have used either (i) visual approximation based on a single-subject histological atlas (Etkin et al., 2004; dorsal vs. ventral amygdala Dolan, 2002 dorsal vs. ventral amygdala Dolan, , 2007 ; (ii) manual segmentations based on in vivo neuroimaging; (iii) normalization and application of a probabilistic atlas (Amunts et al., 2005 , Solano-Castiella et al., 2011 ; or (iv) segmentations based on diffusion-weighted imaging. The first two approaches are labor intensive and susceptible to human error. Using the reference space of the MNI single subject, has limited applicability in segmentation for two reasons: first, spatial normalization can lead to inaccuracies due to the fact that the annotations were made on histology, which leads to blurry probability maps; and second, the direct warping of such probability maps to obtain segmentations greatly suffers from registration errors. Additionally, these previous approaches have segmented the amygdala into 2-4 nucleus groups. The use of diffusionweighted imaging to segment the amygdala has been attractive due to the possibility of automation and within-subject segmentation (rather than normalization to a template). Fiber orientations within the amygdala have been used to divide the structure into two subregions, centromedial and basolateral (Solano-Castiella et al., 2010) . However, this method, like others before it, performed analyses on images normalized to a template brain, and were restricted to only two subdivisions. Diffusion connectivity patterns have also been used to delineate each individual's amygdala into four nucleic groups, using nucleus-specific connectivity patterns based on previous animal literature (Saygin et al., 2011; Saygin et al., 2015) . While this method offered more nucleic groups (parcellated into 4 groups), the nuclei were dependent on each individual's connectivity patterns, which may be compromised in some patient populations. Thus, a segmentation method independent of connectivity and with finer detail (i.e. nuclei instead of subregions) offers a better understanding of the individual nuclei of the amygdala.\nWithout an easily accessible technique with which to parcellate the amygdala, it is difficult to elucidate the separate roles of the human amygdala nuclei, as well as the impact of individual differences in nucleus structure and function. Moreover, progress towards mechanistic theories of dysfunction and abnormal development will remain hindered until these structures can be explored in vivo.\nHere, we use ex vivo MRI data from autopsy brains to delineate the amygdala nuclei and build a probabilistic atlas of amygdala anatomy, using a novel algorithm, which will be distributed as part of the FreeSurfer software. Our ex vivo imaging protocol yields images with extremely high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, dramatically higher than is possible in vivo, which allows us to accurately identify more nuclei with a segmentation protocol specifically designed for this study. We define nine amygdala nuclei that are major subdivisions in human and animal histology literature (e.g. De Olmos 2004; De Olmos et al., 1999; Gloor et al., 1997; Brockhaus, 1938; Sims and Williams, 1990; Freese and Amaral, 2009; Whalen and Phelps, 2009; LeDoux 1998) , and whose boundaries are clearly visible in the ex vivo images (see also Methods). This segmentation focuses on the main amygdala nuclei in the medial temporal lobe and not the extended amygdala. Our previous work -the ex vivo hippocampal atlas (Iglesias et al., 2015) -uses a generative modeling framework to directly segment individual subject in vivo MRI data in target space; the resulting segmentation algorithm can be used to analyze standard in vivo MRI scans with varying overall image contrast properties and intensity distributions, while producing sharper and more accurate label posterior probabilities than direct registration to a reference space. Here, we use this approach and extend it to the amygdala. We also apply this atlas to two publicly available datasets with standard resolution T1 data, and evaluate how well the resulting amygdala nucleus segmentation volumes can classify i) individuals with Alzheimer's disease and older adult controls and ii) individuals with autism and age-matched controls."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Autopsy brain samples and ex vivo MRI acquisition", "text": "The dataset of ex vivo scans comprised 10 autopsied brain hemispheres from the Massachusetts General Hospital Autopsy Service (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) and from the Framingham Heart Study and Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bedford, MA).

We use this terminology to ensure that each case represents one hemisphere from a separate individual (not, e.g. 10 hemispheres from 5 individuals).\nFrom each ex vivo sample, a block of tissue surrounding the amygdala (or the complete MTL) was excised and first fixed with 10% formalin and then transferred to periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP). Depending on its size, the block was placed in either a plastic cylindrical centrifuge tube (60 ml, 3 cm diameter) or inside a plastic sealed bag filled with PLP. In the latter case, air was pumped out using a needle and a vacuum pump in order to minimize the number and size of air bubbles in the samples. The tissue block was subsequently scanned in a 7 T Siemens scanner using a 3D FLASH sequence with TR = 60 ms, TE = 30 ms, \u03b1 = 20\u00b0 (Fischl et al., 2009; Augustinack et al., 2013) . Six of the samples were scanned at 0.1 mm isotropic resolution (three with TE = 12.8 ms and TR = 40 ms; and three with TE1 = 10.75 ms, TE2 = 25.5 ms and TR = 45 ms \u03b1 = 35\u00b0), three at 0.1 mm and one at 0.15 mm. Radio frequency coils were used in the acquisition, accommodating variations in sample size: either a 4-turn solenoid coil (28.5 mm inner diameter, 44 mm length), a 4-channel phased-array (a linear array of loop coil elements each with 5 cm coil diameter, 1.5 cm overlap between adjacent elements, 16 cm in length) were used. Despite the fact that different coils were used to scan the different samples, the output images were comparable in quality. The whole procedure received IRB approval before its execution by the Partners Human Research Committee; thus, all tissue was collected in accordance with approved protocols.\nManual segmentation of ex vivo MRI data: anatomical definitions J.C.A., Z.M.S., and D.K. developed the amygdala segmentation protocol based on several histology and morphometry resources (De Olmos, 2004; Gloor et al., 1997; Brockhaus, 1938; Sims and Williams, 1990 ; we also surveyed the monkey amygdala parcellation (Freese and Amaral, 2009) as an additional guide but focused on the human literature as the primary source for our parcellation). The amygdala annotations are described in Table 2 : lateral nucleus, basal nucleus, accessory basal nucleus, central nucleus, medial nucleus, cortical nucleus, anterior amygdaloid area, cortico-amygdaloid transition area, and paralaminar nucleus. In humans, CAT is the equivalent to the periamygdaloid cortex (PAC) in animals, except layer PAC-3 which this protocol considers as part of the cortical nucleus (see below). Although several other nuclei of the amygdala have been described in histologic preparations (e.g. intercalated nuclei or subdivisions of each nuclei), we only labeled nuclei that were visible via ex vivo MRI contrast. Note that the descriptions are not based on histology but mainly on the contrast at the boundary that was visible in the ex vivo MRI data. We describe the manual labeling protocol in detail based on the contrast visible in the ex vivo data.\nThree manual raters (Z.M.S., D.K., and E.B.) then applied the developed protocol to the ten ex vivo cases independently. Each case required several weeks (average 4 weeks) to annotate and varied slightly with image quality (due to human brain tissue variability) and in resulting image contrast. Although the overall image contrast varied across the cases, each case had sufficient image quality to be able to determine the boundary between nuclei and label these nuclei based on this contrast at the boundaries. Due to the high resolution of the scans, the resulting number of slices containing amygdala in coronal orientation was 133 (SD: 28.1) while a standard in vivo T1 (1mm resolution) typically contains~18 slices of amygdala. We used Freeview, a visualization tool implemented in FreeSurfer to perform the manual labeling of the amygdala nuclei. Most MR volumes needed a slight rotation, which align the brain tissue to a coronal view and standardized the orthogonal planes for labeling. In the rare case of bubbles or tissue damage on MR images (2 cases, spreading only a very small portion of all slices), we labeled affected voxels according to i) the nuclei surrounding unaffected tissue as well as ii) the appearance of the nuclei anterior to posteriorly.\nIn general, annotations were made in the coronal view. Axial and sagittal views were used in addition to guide delineation of subregions and these additional views (and the 3D nature of MRI) helped better define the nuclei contrast and borders. Note that the strategy to annotate mainly in coronal view leads to slightly jagged boundaries in the two other views. However, this effect is averaged out during downsampling and construction of the atlas. To maximize the high level of anatomical consistency across raters, J.C.A. served as quality Table 2 Overview of anatomical boundaries and landmarks for the manual labeling protocol."}, {"section_title": "Structure Abbreviation Definition", "text": "Anterior Amygdala Area AAA (yellow)\nThe AAA represents the anterior end of the amygdala. AAA borders CAT anteriorly and laterally and has a concave crescent shape. In its most posterior and lateral position, AAA detaches from the rest of the amygdala and extends until striatal tissue becomes visible. AAA appears as a bright band anteriorly, similar to striatal tissue but AAA is more medial. Cortico-amygdaloid Transition Area CAT (dark blue)\nThe CAT represents the medial border of the amygdala. Laterally CAT borders AAA, AB, Ba, PL and Ce along its anteriorposterior extent. The posterior portion of CAT is inferior to the medial nucleus. CAT's ventral border merges into the hippocampal-amygdala transition area (HATA) posteriorly. Occasionally, the CAT showed poor contrast at its anterior borders. Lateral Nucleus La (blue)\nIn the anterior portion of the amygdala, the La is typically the first nucleus to appear. Scrolling anterior-posterior in the coronal plane, the La transforms from a circular/oval shape into a wedge or triangular shape. The La's medial border remains next to the Ba along the entire amygdala. The anterior La borders AAA, rostrally and laterally. The La continues laterally and dorsally until the posterior end of the amygdala. La is by far the largest nucleus of the amygdala, and reveals excellent contrast in all cases. Basal Nucleus Ba (red)\nThe anterior appearance of the Ba follows its lateral neighboring nuclei (La) and borders La throughout the amygdala. When viewed in coronal plane, Ba is circular anteriorly, then progresses into an L-shape midway, and ends circular. Paralaminar Nucleus PL (turquoise)\nThe PL is a small, light band that is inferior to Ba, lateral to CAT, and ventro-medial to part of the La. PL borders Ba and La and remains until the last few slices while transitioning more medially towards the CAT and AB. Accessory Basal AB (orange)\nFrom anterior to posterior coronal slices, the AB emerges medially from/within the Ba in a circle that transforms into an oval shape. Dorsally, it forms an obtuse angle with Ba. Medially, the AB borders CAT, while its dorsal portion borders Ce in most of our cases.\nThe Me emerges near the optical tract and can be visible along most of the anterior-posterior extent of the amygdala. The Me covers most of the lateral-dorsal boundary of CAT. This nucleus is the most variable in shape, being either elongated and slim or more circular in coronal view. The axial view is useful in verifying the borders of this nucleus. Central Ce (purple)\nThe Ce appears circular and dorsal to AB and is between CAT medially and Ba laterally. For about half the cases, the Ce remains a circular shape, and for the other half of the cases, it becomes progressively more oval. The Ce appears brighter than its surrounding tissue. The axial view is useful in verifying the borders of this nucleus. Cortical Co (off white)\nThe Co emerges as a small circular nucleus, dorsally to CAT. The AB borders Co laterally. Overall, the Co was the smallest nucleus in size and contains the fewest number of slices labeled in our atlas.\nZ.M. Saygin et al.

The objective of the neuroanatomist was to verify that the labeling was true to the MRI contrast to ensure quality labeling and not to influence the labeling itself."}, {"section_title": "Atlas construction", "text": "In this study, we encode the anatomical variability of the amygdala and surrounding tissue into a statistical atlas. Following Van Leemput (2009), the atlas is represented by a tetrahedral mesh that covers the amygdala (and surrounding structures) in a canonical space. Each vertex in the mesh has an associated vector of label probabilities, which contains the relative frequencies with which each neuroanatomical label is observed at each location. These probabilities are estimated at non-vertex locations using barycentric interpolation. The mesh is endowed with a deformation model, which allows it to cover the spectrum of anatomical variability in the population of the training data. This model infinitely penalizes the folding or collapsing of tetrahedra, which effectively preserves the topology of the mesh when deformed (Ashburner et al., 2000) .\nConstructing the atlas requires estimating the label probabilities at each vertex and the topology of the mesh, given a number of training manual segmentations. Here we use a modified version of Van Leemput's algorithm (Iglesias et al., 2015) that enables us to integrate training datasets that are labeled with different protocols, such that we can combine the manual segmentations of the ex vivo data (nuclei of the amygdala) and the in vivo scans (whole amygdala and surrounding structures). These two datasets are complementary: the former informs the atlas on the internal structure of the amygdala, whereas the latter provides information on the outer contour of the amygdala and its surrounding structures.\nThe training process is based on Bayesian inference, i.e., answering the question: \"what was the statistical atlas that most likely generated the manual segmentations?\" The algorithm amounts to a group-wise registration of the manual segmentations using a high-density tetrahedral mesh followed by a mesh simplification process. The simplification uses a Bayesian model selection algorithm that automatically encodes the label uncertainty (blurring) in each region: convoluted areas, which are well represented in the training data are covered by small tetrahedra, while flat areas are covered by larger tetrahedra. Further details of the atlas representation can be found in Van Leemput et al. (2009) and Iglesias et al. (2015) . A coronal section of the atlas with and without the tetrahedral mesh is shown in Fig. 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation of in vivo MRI data", "text": "The segmentation of the data is posed as a Bayesian inference problem within a generative model of MRI images. The model assumes that: (i) the atlas is first warped according to its deformation model; (ii) a segmentation is then sampled from the label probabilities; and (iii) image intensities are sampled at each voxel from a Gaussian distribution whose mean and variance depend on the label (tissue type) of the voxel. Within this model, the estimation of the segmentation is again posed as a Bayesian inference problem: \"Given the atlas and the image intensities, what is the most probable segmentation?\".\nFinding the most like segmentation requires the minimization of a cost function that consists of two terms: a prior that encodes the cost of deforming the atlas and a likelihood term related to the probability of observing the image intensities given the segmentation. The segmentation algorithm minimizes the cost function by alternately optimizing the deformation of the atlas mesh and the Gaussian parameters (means and variances). The fact that these means and variances are estimated directly from the MRI scan to analyze (rather than encoded in the prior) makes the algorithm robust to changes in MRI contrast.

More specifically, we use a leave one out scheme in which, for each subject, we first compute the direction that best separates the two classes using all other subjects, and then evaluate the projection of the subject at hand on that direction to compute a scalar score. Once we have the scores for all the subjects, we carry out two analyses. First, we compute the pvalue of a non-parametric statistical test (Wilcoxon rank sum) comparing the scores of the two groups. And second, we build a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and compute the discrimination accuracy at the optimal point of operation (\"elbow\"), as well as the area under the curve (AUC). In order to statistically compare the performance of two atlases, we use a paired DeLong test (DeLong et al., 1998) that compares the areas under the corresponding ROC curves. This comparison tests whether information derived from the new atlas, either using the sum of all nuclei or using all the nuclei volumes as a multi-dimensional input i.e., simultaneously with LDA will outperform an existing segmentation of the whole amygdala (FreeSurfer segmentation).\nAnalyses of hemisphere, sex and age on nucleus volume We conducted further analyses to test for the influence of age, hemisphere and sex on nuclei volumes in the in vivo test sets (ABIDE and ADNI).

Using all the amygdala nuclei volumes simultaneously from the current study was also highly accurate in discriminating AD vs. controls, with 84.07% accuracy (AUC = 0.9154; p = 2.80 \u00d7 10 \u221244 ) and offered significant improvement in discrimination as compared to (i) using the previous FreeSurfer atlas (DeLong test p = 9.9\u00d710 \u22126 ) and (ii) using the sum of all nucleus volumes from the current atlas (DeLong test p = 1.6 \u00d710 \u22122 ) (see Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "ABIDE dataset", "text": "We also applied the ex vivo segmentation atlas to another public dataset of autism and control participants (ABIDE; Fig. 5 ) and calculated discriminability based on nucleus volume. Neuroimaging differences and effect sizes are notoriously quite small in the ASD literature. We wanted to know i) how well amygdala nucleus volumes would be able to discriminate between ASD and control participants and ii) whether the discrimination performance would be significantly better than using the whole amygdala (the sum of all nuclei volumes derived by the atlas) and better than the whole amygdala volume from the standard FreeSurfer segmentation. Accuracy and AUC were computed in exactly the same way as the ADNI dataset; and note that we did not control for age as a nuisance regressor, given that groups were well matched on this variable. The previous FreeSurfer atlas failed to discriminate between ASD vs. controls (p = 0.16 with 54.05% accuracy and AUC = 0.449; Table 5 ). In contrast, the ex vivo atlas was significantly accurate at discriminating between ASD and controls when using all the nuclei simultaneously (p = .0122), but not when using the sum of all the nuclei volumes (p = 0.078; see Table 5 for accuracy and AUC). Using all nuclei simultaneously yielded 59.46% accuracy and AUC = 0.5902, offering substantial improvement in discrimination as compared to (i) using the whole amygdala volume from FreeSurfer's automatic segmentation (DeLong test p = 1.7x10\n-2 ) NeuroImage 155 (2017) 370-382 and (ii) using the sum of all nucleus volumes from the current atlas (DeLong test p = 9.1x10 -3 ). The difference in AUC between the whole amygdala using FreeSurfer 5.1 or the aggregate volume of the nuclei was not significant (DeLong test p = 0.65). Therefore, despite the lack of contrast in the internal boundaries of the amygdala, the volumes of the nuclei carry additional information that is not present in the volume of the whole amygdala.\nAdditional analyses of hemisphere, sex, and age"}, {"section_title": "Hemispheric differences in nuclei volumes", "text": "The repeated measures ANOVAs (with a between-subject factor of group: ASD or AD vs. CNT, and within-subject factors of hemisphere: left vs. right and nucleus: La, Ba, AB, Ce, Me, Co, CAT, AAA, PL) showed no main effect of hemisphere or interactions of hemisphere with nucleus for both in vivo test datasets (main effect of hemisphere: ABIDE: p > .3, ADNI: p > .06; interactions with hemisphere and nucleus: ABIDE: p > .5, ADNI p > .23).\nAlthough not central to our main question of whether nuclei are influenced by hemispheric differences, here we also report the full ANOVA results for the sake of completeness.

The nuclei were consistent across cases and raters. Manual labeling of these nuclei in ex vivo MRI data served as a basis to construct a statistical atlas of the amygdala at the nucleus level. This amygdala atlas was applied to in vivo MRI data in two publicly available datasets (ADNI and ABIDE). We thus determined whether the atlas could be used to segment the amygdala nuclei in standard resolution T1 data of varying MR contrast. In addition this application showed how well the resulting segmentations could discriminate between Alzheimer's disease participants vs. control participants (ADNI dataset), and individuals with autism and age-matched controls (ABIDE dataset). We plan to incorporate the ex vivo amygdala nuclei atlas as part of the publicly available FreeSurfer software in the next release, thus opening up numerous multimodal applications in typical and atypical populations and allowing researchers to explore the amygdala nuclei's function and structure with greater specificity than previously possible in neuroimaging.\nThe amygdala is an important structure for animal and human cognition and serves as a crucial hub for cortical, subcortical and limbic connections throughout the brain. Extensive research from the animal literature and post-mortem human studies show that the amygdala is composed of several neuronal subpopulations (Freese and Amaral, 2005 , 2009 Alheid, 2003; Price et al., 1987; Aggleton, 2000; Gloor, 1972 Gloor, , 1978 Gloor, , 1997 McDonald, 1998; LeDoux, 1998) , however the precise functions thereof remain yet to be defined in detail in humans.\nCurrently, no in vivo parcellation methods available allow for an automated segmentation of nine amygdala nuclei derived from underlying anatomy and within standard imaging protocols. Previous studies have used in vivo imaging where the resolution did not reveal numerous amygdala nuclei, parcellating the amygdala into 2-4 regions (e.g. Entis et al., 2012; Solano-Castiella et al. 2011) . T1 weighted scans of standard resolution (0.75-1 mm voxel size) do not provide sufficient overall image contrast for the human eye to distinguish the amygdala nuclei. Amygdala segmentation from diffusion weighted imaging data is possible, but again, the nuclei are usually grouped into larger subregions (e.g. basolateral instead of basal and lateral nuclei separately; Saygin et al. 2011; Bach et al. 2011) . Compared with approaches that aim for estimating probability maps in reference spaces (e.g., Amunts et al., 2005; Solano-Castiella et al., 2010 Tyszka et al., 2016) , the presented approach takes individual underlying anatomy into account, thus providing greater spatial sensitivity.\nThe present study offers four main innovations and advantages over previous work: (i) higher (100-150 \u00b5m isotropic) resolution and because of this high resolution (ii) the largest number of amygdala nuclei resolved, labeled, and then modeled in native subject space (nine nuclei), (iii) an atlas based on n=10 cases thus allowing variability to be modeled across cases, and (iv) the use of a recent modeling technique (Iglesias et al. 2015) that enables the inclusion in the atlas of large amounts of readily available in vivo segmentations of the whole amygdala. In particular, the generative nature of this model makes it agnostic to details of the imaging contrast, and hence permits the use of ultra-high-resolution, ex vivo training data. This is in contrast with techniques that require intensity matching between training and test data, which essentially forces the training data to be in vivo and thus of significantly lower resolution and overall image contrast.\nIn conventional probabilistic atlases defined in the space of a template brain, the usual procedure is to register the grayscale template to a test scan, and use the resulting transform to propagate the label probabilities. In contrast, for atlases based on generative models like the one presented here, the registered atlas only represents a prior, which is combined with a subject-specific likelihood model (agnostic to MRI contrast) to produce a posterior distribution that yields the segmentation in that individual's native space. Therefore, the method is adaptive to any MRI contrast, and since the prior and likelihood Z.M. Saygin et al. NeuroImage 155 (2017) 370-382 inform each other's updates, it can generate sharper segmentations based on the posterior rather than the prior alone. The atlas introduced in the current paper is easily applicable to standard anatomical MR data and will be implemented in a future release of the FreeSurfer software. FreeSurfer is an open source and widely used brain data analysis software and we intend that the new atlas will significantly impact future studies in advancing our understanding of amygdala nuclei function in the human brain.\nCompared with approaches that aim for estimating probability maps in reference spaces (e.g., Amunts et al., 2005; Solano-Castiella et al., 2010 , the present approach takes individual underlying anatomy into account, thus providing greater spatial sensitivity. While these previous studies contributed slightly larger sample sizes, the present study harnesses recent advancements in probabilistic modeling (i.e. Bayesian modeling) to take into account individual anatomy in order to parcellate the nuclei of the amygdala. Future work may also quantitatively compare the present atlas to other atlases that segment groups of nuclei (rather than individual nuclei as in the present atlas) in order to decide on the best atlases for different research questions. It is important to note that such comparisons of different atlases will depend heavily on the quality of the registration, which can be greatly compromised by differences in image contrast between the input atlases. When the registration of these template-space atlases is poor, it leads to poor overlap between the subregions segmented by different atlases and in different spaces (i.e. native subject space vs. template/ group space).\nHere, we also show that the new information about amygdala nuclei derived by the atlas can reliably distinguish between pathologic and normal anatomy in two separate populations, with higher accuracy than the volume of the whole amygdala. For the ADNI comparison, we expected gross anatomical differences between the pathological and the control group, given the neuropathology in AD and MCI (Markesbery, 2010; Yilmazer-Hanke, 1998) . In contrast, we expected rather small (if any) differences for the ABIDE group comparison. The exact structural neuropathology of the amygdala is less clear in ASD and there have been heterogeneous findings about the amygdala as a whole structure (e.g. Dziobek et al., 2010; Sparks et al., 2002) . ASD is a very heterogeneous disorder clinically, and thus probably has a heterogeneous and complicated underlying biology. Crucially, the accuracies of group discriminations based on the new atlas outperformed previously available results based on the amygdala as a whole in both the ADNI dataset (p= 9.9\u00d710 \u22126\n) and the ABIDE dataset (p=1.7\u00d710"}, {"section_title": "\u22122", "text": "). Although the accuracy in the ABIDE comparison is not very high overall, using the current atlas still results in a significant improvement of discrimination accuracy. Moreover, the finding that the ASD discrimination is lower in accuracy than the Alzheimer's discrimination is another important aspect of the present analysis. Whereas the ADNI comparison extends previous findings of volumetric differences in the amygdala between AD and age-matched control participants, the findings in ASD show the potential for future research applications: using information about anatomical changes in amygdala nuclei in relation to behavioral characteristics can be more sensitive than the amygdala as one homogenous structure. We anticipate that this new tool will support neuroimaging researchers to find replicable and robust differences between ASD and controls with greater accuracy than possible based on the whole amygdala. We provide these results as an example of one potential application to a clinical population with less clear neuropathology and encourage other researchers to test and extend this finding in different ASD and other psychiatric samples respectively. For example, the estimation and definition of individual amygdala nuclei (or grouped into other meaningful subdivisions e.g. basolateral/centromedial complex) can serve as regions of interest for task-related functional MRI studies; and/or as seed regions for connectivity analyses in task-free fMRI data.\nThe additional exploratory analyses on the influence of hemisphere, sex, and age on nucleus volume in the in vivo datasets emphasizes the importance of careful matching of groups with respect to age and sex when comparing different groups (especially in older adult samples). Previous studies that have segmented the amygdala as a whole are discrepant, with some groups reporting larger right amygdala (e.g. Pedraza et al. 2002; Bernasconi et al., 2003) or no asymmetry (Goncalves-Pereira et al., 2005) . The absence of a hemispheric difference in the two datasets in the present study is informative and has implications for further investigations (e.g., volumes can be averaged), but in light of previous literature, future studies should carefully check for hemispheric differences. Another potential application could be to study volumetric and connectivity changes across development. For example, a recent study revealed that the connectivity of most amygdala subregions (central, basal, and lateral) continued to change between the ages of 5-30 (Saygin et al., 2015) . However, these regions were identified based on a connectivity atlas (Saygin et al., 2011) and the study was limited to coarser subdivisions of the amygdala. The structural (e.g. volume or connectivity) and functional developmental trajectory of the nine nuclei identified here remains to be explored.\nSome limitations of the present study are that we did not label subdivisions of the amygdala nuclei (i.e. the ventral, dorsal, medial, lateral parts of each nucleus) and we did not label the \"extended amygdala\" in the ten cases. The medial and central nuclei are sometimes included as part of the extended amygdala, so perhaps we included part of the extended amygdala; others think such nuclei are part of the basal ganglia because of their inhibitory nature (Heimer and Van Hoesen, 2006; De Olmos and Heimer, 1999; Cassell 1999; Swanson et al., 1998) . It is also worth noting that different groups distinguish the central nucleus' boundaries quite differently; this discrepancy may be due to the two nuclei of the central nucleus (dorsomedial and ventrolateral), which are stained quite differently (described in Gloor (1978) on page 624). Amunts and colleagues included a larger central nucleus parcellation likely to underscore the extended amygdala concept in this region (Amunts et al., 2005) . Here we predominantly label the medial portion of the central nucleus (i.e. dorsomedial), which would agree with many definitions of the central nucleus (Freese and Amaral, 2009 ) rather than the lateral portion of the central nucleus (i.e. ventrolateral), where some myelinated fibers separate it from the main mass of the amygdala. These differences between nucleic definitions among different groups will also be important to consider when directly comparing different atlases. The diversity of the amygdala nuclei with respect to its structure, function and connectivity -has been long debated. Future studies can clarify the roles of the different nuclei as part of the amygdala, ventral pallidum, basal forebrain, or hippocampus."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we visualized nine amygdala nuclei boundaries (anterior amygdaloid area, cortico-amygdaloid transition area, basal, lateral, accessory basal, central, cortical, medial, paralaminar nuclei) using ultra-high-resolution ex vivo imaging.

The amygdala nuclei atlas was applied to two datasets, demonstrating a higher discriminability of Alzheimer's disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder than previously possible with amygdala segmentation methods. This amygdala atlas will provide neuroimaging researchers with the ability to test nucleus' function in vivo with greater spatial specificity in the human brain."}]
