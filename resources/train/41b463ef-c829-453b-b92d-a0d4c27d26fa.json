[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Estimates suggest that while the overall number of high school graduates in the U.S. will not surpass the current peak of 3.4 million within the next 15 years, the proportion of students from underrepresented minority groups will increase dramatically (Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, 2008). Of concern is the evidence that these students are less likely to pursue higher education and in particular, careers in biomedical science (Lee, 1991;Ntiri, 2001;Opp, 2001;Thomas and Thurber, 1999). In 1997, underrepresented minorities accounted for a mere 4.2 percent of the doctoral-level biomedical workforce (Lopatto, 2004;NAS, 2005). As of 2005, the overall representation of minorities in biomedical research was 5.3 percent, despite an average annual increase of 15 percent in the U.S. minority population over the past decade (NRC, 2005). An analysis by Nelson (2007) found that there were very few underrepresented minorities on the faculties of Research I institutions, although the report did not identify the causes behind these small numbers. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and others have stated the importance of diversity in the health and biomedical workforce for health outcomes and biomedical research. The Sullivan Report argues that without increased racial and ethnic diversity in the health professions, the nation may be putting the health of minority populations at risk (Sullivan Commission, 2004). The NIH provides research supplements to promote diversity in health research in order to enhance the quality of education, to increase the recruitment and participation of minority groups in clinical trials, lead to improved patient satisfaction in order to enhance clinical research, and to increase research in areas related to health disparities and minority health (NIH, 2008). The NIH proposal announcement to promote diversity concludes: \"There is no question that the need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's health-related research effort\" (NIH, 2008). The goal of this study is to understand the factors that contribute to diversity (or lack thereof) in the academic biomedical workforce and thereby identify leverage points for policy actions. The majority of the research on educational and career transition experiences in science has focused on women. A National Academies report indicated two major transition points at which women leave science and engineering career paths: first, the transition from high school to college, and then from graduate school to tenure-track faculty positions (NAS, 2007). Although more women than men indicate an expectation to attend and complete college, men are 60 percent more likely to pursue a science or engineering major (Xie and Shauman, 2003). Once in graduate school, women and men have similar rates of degree completion; however women are less likely to make the transition from completion of doctoral degree to faculty appointment, possibly attributable to a lack of mentorship from graduate advisors (Nettles and Millett, 2006) or prestige of the academic institution (Gaughan and Robin, 2006), particularly for minority women (Leggon and Pearson, 1997). Research on underrepresented minorities in science is much less prevalent. As with women, the NSF reports biennially on the numbers of underrepresented minorities in science occupations (NSF, 2009). Like the Nelson report, the NSF study documents the small number of minorities in faculty positions without fully investigating the underlying causes of their underrepresentation. A National Academies workshop on factors affecting the numbers of minority scientists pursuing research careers (Olson and Fagen 2007)identified three outstanding research questions:"}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "What are the probabilities that an individual with a given set of characteristics will make the transition from one career stage to another?"}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "What factors influence career-stage transition decisions, and are these decisions predicted by demographic characteristics? 3. How can these probabilities be changed? Clearly, progress cannot be made in addressing questions (2) and (3) without first examining factors associated with transitions from one career stage to the next. Our study will address research question (1) at all stages of the career path . A select few studies go beyond the numbers in providing explanations for minority underrepresentation in science careers. Brown (2000) provides an analysis similar to this study, documenting the pipeline for all minority scientists through the early 1990s. She attributes much of the under-representation of minorities in academic science to attrition from science and engineering majors, but does not examine whether minority scientists are treated differently on the tenure track than their majority colleagues. Turner, Myers and Creswell (1999) interviewed faculty of color in Midwestern universities, and they attribute low numbers of minorities in academic science to low numbers in the pipeline and a chilly climate in academia. Like Brown, their study only goes through the 1990s. Jackson (2004) echoes these findings. Her survey shows that women and minorities in STEM fields feel less support and perceive the tenure process to be less fair than white male respondents. These qualitative studies do not directly address whether hiring and the tenure process contributes to the underrepresentation of minorities in academic science. We seek to address this shortcoming in our analysis. Several studies have indicated that many students, particularly women and minorities, who enter college with the intent of pursuing a degree in science abandon that goal (NAS, 2007). In many cases, this decision is made not because of a lack of preparation or individual capability, but because of the environment of science departments (Seymour and Hewitt, 1997;Grandy, 1998;Brown, 2000). Undergraduate research programs may play a significant positive role in the decision to pursue doctoral studies in the biomedical sciences (Villarejo et al., 2008), but there is evidence to indicate that graduate research fellowships may deter students from continuing in academic science and engineering careers (Nettles and Millett, 2006;Gaughan and Robins, 2004). It is clear that health outcomes and treatment protocols may differ for men and women as well as by race/ethnicity. To promote research into minority health and health disparities, Congress established the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health in 1990. 1 To the extent that researchers of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds are more likely to investigate the problems associated with their demographic group, racial and ethnic diversity in biomedical science should give rise to improved treatment outcomes (Leggon andMalcom 1994, Leggon 2006). In addition, Schiebinger (2008) and others (see, e.g., Cox, 1993;McLeod et al., 1996;Thomas, 2004) argue that diversity in the workforce has the overall effect of enhancing innovation. In this study we seek to better understand why minority representation in the academic biomedical workforce lags behind that of the general population. In particular, does lack of diversity in academic biomedicine arise because of differences in education and training? Or is it the end-result of differences in hiring and promotion? To address the first question, we determined transition rates by gender, race, and ethnicity between specific education and career stages for seven hypothetical high school graduating cohorts from 1981-1996 by integrating and linking extant data for high school completion; college, graduate, and medical student matriculation and completion; and presence on faculty at American Medical Colleges in the United States. In the second part of the study, we examined gender and racial differences in the academic biomedical career outcomes of obtaining a tenure track job, getting promoted to tenure, and receiving NIH and NSF funding using the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). Our results indicate that women and minorities have increased their participation in biological science majors, however women and minorities face different difficulties on the academic biomedical career path. Women are increasingly completing graduate and medical school, but are less likely to secure tenure track jobs. The loss of all racial minorities except Asians occurs in both college completion and graduate school completion, where low graduation rates underlie low representation all along the academic pathway. Once on the tenure track, we find few demographic differences in the probability of receiving tenure or obtaining research funding from the NIH or NSF. This suggests that the lack of racial/ethnic diversity in academic biomedicine occurs much earlier in the education pipeline-in high school, college and graduate school, as opposed to later in the academic career. This study is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data and methods, Section 3 presents the findings of transition ratios between educational and career milestones, Section 4 presents the findings of the model of faculty outcomes for PhD recipients between 1985 and 1996, and Section 5 discusses the findings in the context of NIH policy."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Education and Career Transitions: Establishing Milestones", "text": "We analyzed proportional representation of demographic groups at specific educational and career milestones.

Between 15 and 30 percent of the biomedical workforce seeking NIH funding have received either a Medical Doctorate or combined Medical and Academic Doctorate degrees. The remainder hold Academic Doctorates in biomedical science. Because of differences in matriculation and completion between medical school students and graduate students, we have conducted the analysis for both PhDs and MDs.

Races and ethnicities were self-identified and in many cases were reported only for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The available data leave the following gaps: \u2022 Inconsistent data on gender and race/ethnicity of all (public, private, and homeschooled) high school completers. \u2022 Sporadic data collection on progression through college and demographic-specific completion rates. \u2022 Limited and poor quality data for postdoctoral researchers, including a complete lack of race/ethnicity data. \u2022 Limited and inconsistent data for faculty at academic institutions, including country of origin and tenure status. Even with these limitations, it was possible to aggregate the existing data sources to examine the demographics of educational and career transitions. Specific data issues are described for each data source: that they received tenure, but for later surveys, tenure year is imputed as the first year a person is observed with tenure in the sample. Given the biennial nature of the survey, years until tenure may be measured with one-year error."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Transitions between Education and Career Milestones", "text": "After collecting aggregate date for each milestone, we grouped data into cohort pools of defined time periods for each milestone and determined if the proportional representation of group members in each cohort changed significantly from one milestone to the next.

These analyses were extended across years to illustrate the demographic trends from one milestone to the next."}, {"section_title": "Determination of Individual-Level Career Outcomes Using the Survey of Doctorate", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Recipients", "text": "After documenting trends in the aggregate data, we investigated gender and racial/ethnic differences in academic career outcomes using the 1985 -2006 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). We selected a longitudinal extract of academic doctorate recipients in the biomedical sciences who received their PhD between the years of 1985 and 1996 and remain in the survey 10 years after the PhD. Individuals are excluded if they are not observed more than once or if they skip more than three surveys. We estimated three career milestones. First, using probit analysis we examined the probability of obtaining a tenure track job within seven years of the PhD. We then restricted the probit analysis to those who have ever held a tenure track job to estimate the probability of the first award of tenure within 10 years of the PhD. Finally, we estimate the probability that an individual received NIH or NSF funding within 10 years of the PhD. Our analyses include both time-varying and non-time varying independent variables. Non-time varying variables include gender, race, whether foreign born, degree field, and aspects of the person's PhD institution. Time-varying independent variables include marital status, children, current and past employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activities, government support, and limited productivity measures (discussed below). These covariates are suggested by previous studies of academic promotion (Ginther and Hayes, 2003;Ginther and Kahn, 2004). Appendix Table 1 includes variable definitions and descriptive statistics for the tenure track and tenure and funding samples. Measures of academic productivity are largely missing from the SDR data, but the SDR does ask questions about publications in the 1983the , 1995the , 2001the surveys. The 1983the question refers to publications between 1980the and 1983the whereas the 1995the , 2001 questions refer to numbers of publications in the previous five years. We use these data to create rough measures of cumulative papers presented and publications per year past PhD. If productivity data are missing for a particular year, average observed productivity is used to impute total productivity -an admittedly rough correction which nevertheless seems preferable to omitting the information altogether.

No change between milestones is indicated by a ratio of 1; an increase compared to the previous milestone will show a ratio greater than 1; and a ratio less than 1 indicates a proportional loss from one milestone to the next.

For those cohorts for which high school race/ethnicity data are available (Cohorts 5-7), Asian students show a substantial proportional increase between high school and college completion; proportional representation falls for Black, American Indian, and Hispanic students; and proportional representation of White students stays relatively constant. These ratios persist across cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Transition 2: Receipt of biological sciences Bachelor's degree to receipt of biological sciences PhD", "text": "For all cohorts considered, men are overrepresented compared to women among PhD recipients. For recent cohorts (Cohorts 6 and 7), this effect is largely due to the fact that many more women than men receive biological sciences bachelor's degrees, despite the gender ratio of college degree holders being closer to 1. The proportion of White students transitioning to PhD completion is close to 1, and more recently Asians students have been transitioning in decreasing proportion with recent years approaching 1. Once again, the proportion of Black, Hispanic and American Indian students decreases significantly from college completion to graduate school completion, exacerbating the gap between these racial/ethnic groups and Whites and Asians. The large fluctuations in representation of members of the Unknowns category at this transition are likely due to differences in data collection between sources used for Bachelor's degrees and PhD degrees. Interestingly the male-to-female ratio of both Black and Hispanic biological sciences bachelor's degree recipients began favoring women more than a decade earlier than for White degree recipients. 8 In addition, the transition to doctoral completion for women in these groups has been more similar to men of their group, in contrast to White women."}, {"section_title": "Transition 3: Receipt of biological sciences PhD to appointment as assistant professor", "text": "The transition ratios presented in Table 3 for the last transition indicate that women are consistently underrepresented among junior faculty. For the four cohorts for which data at the faculty level are available, men are overrepresented among assistant professors by greater than 10 percent compared to the previous milestone of graduate school completion. The overall numbers of both men and women faculty are increasing and the proportion of women faculty is slowly increasing, but the concomitant increase in the proportion of women completing graduate school suggests that more could be done to bring women to parity with men as new faculty. Chi squared analysis suggests that the male-to-female ratio of postdoctoral researchers is nearly representative of the previous milestone, suggesting that the loss occurs at the transition from postdoctoral research to faculty appointment (data not shown). The transition ratios for racial and ethnic groups are difficult to interpret due to the unknown racial/ethnic group of a large number of faculty. In our sample, the proportion of Asian and Black professors increase relative to those receiving academic doctorates, while the proportions of Whites, Native Americans, and Hispanics are not significantly different. A study by Myers and Turner (2004) found that female faculty are less represented than male faculty among Blacks, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, and that foreign-born faculty are more highly represented than U.S.-born faculty among whites and blacks.

The proportion of Asian MD recipients increased significantly while the number of degrees awarded to American Indians remains small. The number and proportion of White MD degree recipients has dropped steadily since 1983. Similar to doctorate recipients, women are a much higher proportion of Black medical degree recipients than men (data not shown).

While the SDR is limited to U.S. PhD recipients, almost 4 out of 5 of the applications received by the NIH for R01 (and equivalent) grants from New Investigators come from PhD holders 10 , most of whom received their PhD in the U.S. In addition to the categories considered above, we examine whether there are differences in career outcomes as the result of nativity.

Tenured faculty are divided into thirds, with one-third being tenured at Liberal Arts institutions, one-third at Research I institutions, and one-third in the remaining categories. Blacks and Native-born individuals have higher tenure rates than the full sample. However, Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Women are more likely to be tenured at Liberal Arts institutions than any other category. In contrast Asians, the Foreign-born, and men are more likely to be tenured at Research I institutions.

Tables 9 and 10 show estimates of the probability that an academic scientist receives NIH and NSF funding after the postdoctorate and within 10 years of the doctorate using the same specifications as in Table 7. 17 Model 1 in Table 9 indicates that women are 6 percent more likely to get NIH funding (p<.10) than men, whereas Blacks are 13 percent less likely. However, the Black coefficient is no longer statistically significant after adding the full set of controls. Women have an even greater advantage in Model 4, being 8 percent more likely than men (p<.05) to receive NIH funding. This result is at odds with a recent report that shows women are disadvantaged in receiving NIH funding (Hosek 2005). 18 This discrepancy may be explained by the different time periods used in the analysis as well as different data sources. Adding the Foreign-born interaction terms in Model 5 shows that native-born Asians are 24 percent more likely to receive NIH funding, but the result is only marginally significant (p<.10).

There are no other statistically significant demographic differences in NSF funding."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Our study examined the probabilities that women and under-represented minorities progress along the biomedical academic career track. We have shown that calculating the percent proportion of members of gender and racial/ethnic groups at specific milestones is a useful methodology to illuminate transitions where representation of a specific group significantly increases or decreases. Analyses of trends at each milestone in the career path of a biomedical scientist suggest that women and minorities are increasingly participating in biological sciences education and research careers. However, a closer look at the data shows that members of gender or racial/ethnic groups are not transitioning between milestones in the same proportion. Significant When we examined academic career outcomes using the SDR, we find some notable, significant demographic differences in the probability of getting a tenure-track job, receiving tenure, and receiving federal research support. After including a full set of demographic, PhD, and family characteristics, women are no different than men in obtaining a tenure track job. In contrast, Blacks and Hispanics are 9 -10 percent more likely to get a tenure track job than Whites. However, Native Americans, Asians, and Foreign-born Blacks are less likely to get jobs on the tenure track. The available data do not explain these differences, but we offer three potential explanations. First, these groups may choose other career paths besides academia and are thus less likely to take tenure track jobs. Second, most tenure track biomedical jobs require lengthy postdoctoral fellowships. These groups may discover that academic science is not a good career match and choose different jobs. Finally, there may be discrimination in the hiring process that works to the disadvantage of Asians and foreign-born Blacks. However, if discrimination were at issue, we would expect it to also appear for native-born Blacks and foreign-born Asians, which is not supported by our results. Next, we turned our attention to demographic differences in the probability of getting tenure. In our initial models women were less likely to get tenure than men, but this result is no longer statistically significant after controlling for employer characteristics and academic productivity. Similar to the tenure track analysis, we find that Blacks are significantly more likely to get tenure than Whites and foreign-born Blacks. Foreign-born scientists are over 20 percent less likely to get tenure after controlling for publications, employer characteristics, and government support. Finally, we find few demographic differences in the probability of getting NIH or NSF funding. Women and Asians are more likely to get NIH funding after controlling for the full set of observable characteristics relative to men and Whites. Foreign-born Asians are significantly less likely to receive NSF funding. No other demographic characteristics are statistically significant in these regressions. We must note that these estimates do not account for the size or type of NIH or NSF funding. Significant demographic differences may exist along these dimensions, but the SDR data do not allow us to investigate this possibility. Taken together, these results suggest different avenues for policy intervention to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce. To increase the representation of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in academic biomedicine, policies should be implemented to promote increased high school and college graduation in the sciences, and to encourage members of these racial/ethnic groups to complete doctoral programs in biomedical science. A recent study by Adelman suggests that the quality of high school curriculum (with high academic intensity) increases the likelihood that Blacks and Hispanics will graduate from college. In particular, those students who take advanced mathematics courses in high school are more likely to graduate from college (Adelman 1999). Likewise, a National Research Council report (NRC 2000) concluded that to promote diversity in the biomedical research workforce it was necessary to intervene early in the educational process: \"The committee urges the agencies to focus their attention on improvements in opportunities for minorities at the secondary school level (or earlier), seeking legislative authority to do so, if necessary.\" Once Blacks and Hispanics obtain tenure track jobs, they progress through their academic careers and receive federal funding for their research. Native Americans and Asians face some difficulty in getting tenure track positions, but do receive tenure at the same rate after controlling for productivity measures. When considering the transition data along with the SDR data on the probability of members of racial/ethnic and gender groups in receiving a tenure track job, it is interesting to note only for women do we see differences. Women are equally likely to receive a tenure track job as men, but as shown by the aggregate data presented above, women are lost in the transition between graduate school and tenure track position. Related research by Ginther and Kahn (2009) finds that women with children are less likely to advance into academic careers beyond the postdoc. Thus, policies designed to help parents transition from the postdoc to faculty appointment would seem to be in order, as recommended recently by the National Academies (NAS 2007), including increased access to childcare; paid parental leave for faculty, postdocs, and graduate students; and mandated tenure clock extension policies.
