According to the situation report of the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 4 June 2020, more than six million cases of COVID19 have been confirmed around the world [1] . On 5 January 2020, the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was provided and so far, several thousands of whole genome sequences have been presented [2] . Investigating these available nucleotide sequences provides an insight into its evolutionary similarity with other viruses as well as novel mutations. Indeed, it can provide valuable knowledge about designing vaccines and providing drugs [3] . For this aim, it is necessary to extract insightful features to describe the nucleotide sequences. In this work, according to the diagram represented in Fig. 1 , several recurrencequantification-based features are extracted from the nucleotide sequences. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a powerful nonlinear method which can propose representative features. This technique successfully aids us to compare biological sequences with different lengths [4, 5] .\nIn this paper, we introduce a new dataset which involves efficient nonlinear features related to genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. For this aim, the nucleotide sequences of 4496 variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus are gathered. The collected genomic sequences are publicly available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). As can be seen in Fig. 1 , each nucleotide sequence is transformed into 2D space by applying chaos game representation. According to this map, all details of the input sequence are preserved. Next, the obtained picture is decomposed into two coordinate series which contain the position of points in the picture. In the next step, recurrence plot (RP) as a powerful technique is used which illustrates recurrent properties in the coordinate series. In the final step, by applying recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), from each extracted coordinate series, 9 features are provided and totally 18 ( ) features will be extracted. The extracted features are described below:\n(1) This measure describes the density of recurrence points in the RP. The second feature (DET) describes the amount of determinism which is gained as the ratio of the number of points constructing diagonal lines to all the recurrence points. DET=\n(2) and are the next features which are the length of the longest diagonal line in RP and the mean of diagonal lines, respectively. ENT is the Shannon information entropy which describes the diversity of diagonal lines. This measure is computed as below:\nIn the above relation, is the minimum length of diagonal lines in the RP. Moreover, is obtained as below:\nThe next feature is laminarity which is computed as below:\nTrapping time (TT) is the next measure which equals the average length of vertical line structures. is the other feature which is the maximum length of the vertical lines in RP. Finally, the last feature is which is the average of the local clustering coefficient.

The result of this map is a picture which reveals the hidden subsequence structures [6] [7] [8] . Let be a given nucleotide sequence. Since it is composed of four kinds of letters (A,T,C, and G), the resulted map is a square [ ] [ ] such that each vertex corresponds to a letter. The first point is located halfway between (0.5, 0.5) as the center of the square and the vertex equals the first letter. Each letter is iteratively mapped to a unique point halfway between the previous point and the vertex matching with . Fig.2 demonstrates the resulting plot for MT503004. It is interesting to note that like current implementations, it is supposed that the input sequence includes four alphabets and the other codes such as R and Y are omitted. Since direct investigation of the obtained plot is a challenging task, according to the coordination of each point i.e. x and y, the CGR plot is decomposed into two coordinate series named CGRX and CGRY. Fig. 3 shows a part of the extracted coordinate series relating to the CGR plot of Fig. 2 .
