[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The main objective of this study is to propose the conceptual framework for the integration of 21 st century skills in biology education in Malaysia. An interdisciplinary approach for Biology, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (BTEM) is suggested to imbibe 21 st century skills into the existing Biology curriculum. Solving complex and interdisciplinary worldwide biology problems will require students to understand what connections exist across disciplines and how to make those connections. BTEM allows students to master biological knowledge and at the same time to be adroit in other sub disciplinary skills. The main teaching and learning strategies that apply in the BTEM subjects are problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning which require the coordination of both knowledge and skills simultaneously. This is intended to enhance the students' abilities to construct their own knowledge through the relevant hands-on and minds-on activities. The essence of engineering is production of design for the inventive problem solving. Integrating advanced information communication technologies such as etools and World Wide Web resources are believed to be able to fulfil the learning style needs of the current 'Net Generation'. Mathematics plays an important role providing computational tools for biology and engineering, especially in analysing data. The expected outcomes of BTEM implementation are the inculcation of 21 st century skills digital literacy, inventive thinking, effective communication, high productivity, spiritual and noble values in Malaysian students."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The National Biotechnology Policy is one of the Malaysia's Government Transform Projects to accelerate the attainment of Vision 2020. The National Biomass Strategies is launched in 2011 to boost Malaysia's ability to be the hub for biotechnology. This policy is believed to be able to provide 70,000 work opportunities and increases the national income up to RM 30 billion in 2020 (Ismail, 2011) . Nevertheless, Malaysia is facing a deficit in high-skilled local workers for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Policy 60 (science): 40 (art) students is reported to be a failure (Mohamad Yusof, 2008) . Data shows that students' inclination towards the science subject is still relatively low. Since 2007 only 29% of secondary and tertiary students enrolled into science streams (Bernama, 2012) . This may stunt the Malaysian government's efforts to improve attainment in STEM fields thus affecting the aim to become a high income country."}, {"section_title": "Biology education in Malaysia:", "text": "The ultimate aim of the Malaysia biology curriculum for upper secondary level is to provide students with the knowledge and skills in science and technology to enable them to solve problems and make decisions in everyday life based on scientific attitudes and noble values. Students who have followed the biology curriculum will gain a strong foundation enabling them to pursue further education in biology at post-secondary level. The curriculum also aims to develop a concerned, dynamic and progressive society with a science and technology culture that values nature and works towards the preservation and conservation of the environment (Ministry of Education Malaysia, 2005) . The students who take biology as their elective pure science subject would take up careers in the field of science and technology and play a leading role in this field for national development (Ministry of Education Malaysia, 2005) .\nThe Biology curriculum in Malaysia is contentand-outcome based and encourages teachers to use fragmented T and L methods (Nordin and Othman, 2008) . Fragmented T and L methods limit the delivery of abstract and complex biological concepts (Othman, 2008) . Many researchers have shown that most of the biology teachers are still applying traditional and outdated methods in teaching biology. Teachers convey biology facts directly to the students and encourage rote memorization of the factual knowledge for examination (Chiel et al., 2010) . Instead of exam-orientated, students should be trained to solve the real world problems in Biology (Hall et al., 2003) .\nT&L methods influence the students' performance in biology (Mahamod and Mustapha, 2007) . Results of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) year 2007 shows that Malaysia students failed to achieve minimum international standard of 500 points for Biology, gaining only 469 points (Thomson and Buckley, 2007) . In 2010 Malaysia joined the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and results shows that Malaysian students gained an average score of 422 points in science (Walker, 2011) . This failure is due to a deficit of higher order thinking skills in the education system as a whole (Ministry of Education Malaysia, 2012) . Evidences shows that the high performance countries in PISAAustralia, Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Switzerland -emphasize both content and 21 st century skills in their school curriculum (Senechal, 2010) . In order to build up the ability to compete at international level the Ministry of Education has started to infuse entrepreneurship, creativity, design and technology elements through the Primary School Standard Curriculum (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Rendah, KSSR) in 2011. The existing Biology curriculum is focused on Thinking Skills and Thinking Strategies (TSTS) to stimulate thoughtful learning. TSTS are higher order thinking skills which involve various critical and creative thinking skills (Ministry of Education Malaysia, 2005) . However the TSTS may not be enough to equip students with living skills to survive in a competitive world and the Biology curriculum in Malaysia should be revised so that relevant 21 st century knowledge and skills are simultaneously developed in students (Siraj, 2008) . The Biology curriculum should be integrated with other disciplines to optimise the acquisition of a rapidly expanding information base (Nordin and Othman, 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "Interdisciplinary approach of BTEM: Interdisciplinary can be defined as a knowledge view and curriculum approach that consciously applies methodology and language from more than one discipline to examine a central theme, issue, problem, topic, or experience (Jacobs, 1989) . One of the typical strategy uses in the interdisciplinary approach ( Fig. 1) is problem-centric, connects knowledge from several disciplines to examine complicated real-life problems (Nikitina, 2006) . Interdisciplinary approach is implemented with the idea that subject-specific learning is neither important nor relevant to young school leavers in the twenty-first century (Hardy et al., 2008) .\nThe 21 st century biology requires interdisciplinary approaches across different disciplines such as engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry and mathematics to deal with the higher level of complex problems, especially in regards to health, food, energy and the environment which are becoming more dependent on other disciplines to collaborate in providing new applications, new methods, new techniques and new tools (National Research Council, 2008; Robinson et al., 2010 ; Wake, 2003 Wake, , 2008 . In the 21 st century \"the New Biologist is not a scientist who knows a little bit about all disciplines but a scientist with deep knowledge in one and a \"working fluency in others.\" (National Research Council, 2009 ). To succeed teaching through this new interdisciplinary perspective requires new approaches, materials and pedagogies (Jungck et al., 2010; National Research Council, 2003 . Solving complex, interdisciplinary problems will require that students go far beyond their biology content knowledge only. They are required to understand what connections exist across disciplines and how to make those connections. Preparing future biologists without offering them the exposure and experience with engineering and technology skills will fail to produce students who are able to perform effectively in an increasingly competitive environment National Research Council, 2003) .\nBTEM is highly relevant to the STEM curriculum. The major element of the STEM curriculum is the incorporation of Problem Based Learning (PBL) and Inquiry Based Learning (IBL). Constructivist theory becomes the backbone that supports both PBL and IBL. Likewise, BTEM is also based on constructivist theory (Sanders, 2009) . The student needs to incorporate their current and prior understanding while discovering new knowledge and should be continuously assimilating and accommodating knowledge, reflecting on it and their experiences (Nuangchalerm, 2009 ). The inquiry process can provide students with opportunities to explore and understand the natural world by the mselves, they become independent critical and creative thinkers.\nThe core of BTEM is Biology but with the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) during T and L processes; these ICT skills include surfing the internet for relevant information, usage of e-tools for communication purposes and application tools provided by the Microsoft office (Ms Words, Ms Power point, Ms Excel etc.).Technology has been immersed as part of the students' life with the integration of ICT in science T and L (Osman et al., 2009) . Rapid advances in information technologies have changed the learning styles of many students of the Net Generation. These students have grown up in a world where technology is (Annetta et al., 2010) . Online social networking and electronic-based resources are increasingly being used to enhance student understanding and interest in biology (Musante, 2008) . ICT also encourages learning in a constructive context (Mikropoulos et al., 2003) . Effective and relevant teaching and learning (T and L) strategies are necessary to fulfil the needs of today's Net Generation because they prefer digital resources to access information, communicate and solve problems (Oblinger and Oblinger, 2005) .\nThe fragmented or separated teaching of Biology and Mathematics has prevented the integration of both disciplines (Bialek and Botstein, 2004) . Developing the connections between Biology and Mathematics is one of the most important ways to shift the paradigms of both established science disciplines. The process of connecting these two disciplines should start as early as possible in the educational process as a preparation to combine both disciplines at graduate and postgraduate levels of study (S\u02c7orgo, 2010) . Incorporation of Mathematics into the Biology curricula is critical for developing quantitative process skills demanded in modern biology (Depelteau et al., 2010; Duncan et al., 2010; Marsteller et al., 2010; Tra and Evans, 2010) . Recent achievements in the integration of modern Biology with technology have created dramatic new opportunities for the application of mathematical processes to facilitate a better understanding of Biology (National Research Council, 2005) . This new generation of biologists will routinely use mathematical models and computational approaches to draw hypotheses, design experiments and analyse results (Robeva and Laubenbacher, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Problem Based Learning (PBL):", "text": "Teaching students to become inventive problem solvers have long been goals of science education. However, methods to promote (Toru, 2008) creative thinking in scientific problem solving have not become widely known or used in the Science education (DeHaan, 2009). The essence of engineering is inventive problem solving (Mastascusa et al., 2011) and the recent Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), which was already well established in the field of engineering, promotes expansion to non-technical fields such as education (Marsh et al., 2004) . For BTEM it is proposed to modify Six-Box Schemes Unified Structured Inventive Thinking (USIT) (Fig. 2) as the inventive problem solving procedures to solve authentic problems. BTEM exposes the students to engineering inventive problem solving skills. Inventive problem solving becomes the major element incorporated within inquiry based learning activities."}, {"section_title": "Inquiry Based Learning (IBL):", "text": "Inquiry is the driver of the complex thinking during the problem solving processes (Barell, 2010) and IBL depends on the students' prior knowledge to construct new knowledge by themselves (Barrow, 2006) . Thus, the student is supposed to function as an autonomous learner and the teacher as a facilitator. The teacher scaffolds the students by frequently reminding them to reflect, collaborate, ask themselves questions and justify their conclusions. Inquiry processes occur through the development of cognitive, meta-cognitive, psychomotor and social skills. When the students carry out experiments they apply different inquiry skills such as asking question, raising a hypothesis, planning an experiment to test the hypothesis, accessing and analysing data, making inferences, drawing conclusions, reporting and writing a research report. Students also apply meta-cognitive skills by engaging in reflective thinking throughout the learning stages. Students acquire psychomotor skills through manipulation of laboratory apparatus and using the computer.\nInquiry processes also promotes collaborative social skills (Zion et al., 2004) .\nThe main assumption is that inquiry skills develop best in the context of well-designed activities that are engaging to the student. BTEM places great emphasizes on self-directed hands-on and minds-on activities to help students construct an understanding of knowledge by themselves. We do not need to teach students particular science content or concepts (Kuhn and Pease, 2008) . There are five essential features of inquiry as follows (National Research Council, 2000):\n\u2022 Learners are engaged by scientifically oriented questions \u2022 Learners give priority to evidence which allows them to develop and evaluate explanations that address scientifically oriented questions \u2022 Learners formulate explanations from evidence to address scientifically oriented questions \u2022 Learners evaluate their explanations in light of alternative explanations, particularly those reflecting scientific understanding \u2022 Learners communicate and justify their proposed explanations."}, {"section_title": "ST CENTURY SKILLS", "text": "There are five major current conceptual frameworks for 21 st century skills-the Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, the North Central Regional Education Laboratory (NCREL) and the Meriti Group, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the National Leadership Council for Liberal Education and America's Promise (Dede, 2010 to the ability to evaluate information across multiple resources critically, to recognize when information is needed, to locate, synthesize and use information effectively and accomplish these functions using technology, communication networks and electronic resources.\n\u2022 Multicultural literacy: Multicultural literacy refers to the ability to understand and respect the similarities and differences in customs, values and beliefs of one's own culture as well as the culture of others.\n\u2022 Global awareness: Global awareness includes the recognition and understanding of interrelationships among international organizations, nation-states, public and private economic entities, socio-cultural groups and individuals globally."}, {"section_title": "Inventive thinking:", "text": "Research findings show that students who are involved in inventive activities are more comfortable solving new and unfamiliar problems (Taylor et al., 2010) .

The 21 st century skills conceptual framework for the Malaysian context is modified based on the framework suggested by NCREL and Meriti Group. It includes digital era literacy, inventive thinking, effective communication, high productivity, spiritual and nobles values. The incorporation of PBL and IBL into the learning experience is the essence of BTEM and its objective to cultivate students' ability to be engaged in scientific inquiry and discover biological contents by themselves. BTEM stresses that engaging in scientific inquiry requires coordination both of knowledge and skill simultaneously. Arguments between the emphasis that should be placed on scientific content and the emphasis placed on scientific practices will be reduced. According to North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group achievement will be enhanced when the students have acquired 21 st century skills successfully (enGauge, 2003) ."}]
