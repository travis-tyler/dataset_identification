Biomarkers for AD, based on non-invasive methods are highly desirable for diagnosis, disease progression, and monitoring therapeutics [2, 3] . A range of neuroimaging techniques provide insight into AD-related neurodegeneration, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional MRI. Neuroimaging techniques can improve early detection and aid in identifying individuals at risk of developing AD. In particular, structural MRI has provided insight into the neuroanatomical profile of pre-clinical and early AD. MRI has demonstrated significant value in the prediction of conversion and disease progression [4] .\nFrom a neuropathological perspective, it has been suggested that the medial temporal lobe is the anatomical site of the first pathological alterations in AD [5, 6] . It has been shown that MRI is useful for detecting atrophy in the medial temporal structures affected early in the neurodegenerative process [4] . Decreased volumes of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are connected to AD and to individuals at risk of developing the disease. It has been shown that atrophy of the medial temporal lobe can predict conversion in subjects in the prodromal stages of the disease, referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4, [7] [8] [9] . Atrophy also correlates with memory impairment. Numerous studies have used baseline and serial MRI measures to predict future cognitive decline but mostly for conversion from MCI to AD [9] [10] [11] [12] , and there is need for assessing these MRI measures as potential markers of disease progression in AD.\nWe have previously reported from the European Union AddNeuroMed multi-center MRI study that structural MRI measures discriminated AD from controls and MCI; and also demonstrated potential for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The aims of the current study were to examine (a) the relationship between baseline hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, and whole brain volume with baseline cognitive measures in (i) AD (ii) MCI, and (iii) age matched non-demented controls (NDC); and (b) to assess the associations of the baseline MRI measures with subsequent cognitive change over one year period. Our hypothesis was that smaller brain structures would be associated with worse baseline cognition and greater cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and clinical assessment", "text": "This study included data from 120 AD, 106 MCI, and 99 NDC participants from the AddNeuroMed study, a European Union funded FP6 program.

Data was collected from six different sites across Europe: University of Kuopio, Finland; University of Perugia, Italy; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece; King's College London, United Kingdom; University of Lodz, Poland; and University of Toulouse, France. Written consent was obtained where the research participant had capacity, and in those cases where dementia compromised capacity, then assent from the patient and written consent from a relative, according to local law and process, was obtained.

The MPRAGE volume was acquired using a custom pulse sequence specifically designed for the ADNI study to ensure compatibility across scanners [28] . Full brain and skull coverage was required and detailed quality control was carried out on all MR images according to the AddNeuroMed quality control procedure [23, 29] ."}, {"section_title": "Regional volume segmentation", "text": "We applied the Freesurfer pipeline (version 4.5.0) to the MRI images to produce regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric measures. Cortical reconstruction and subcortical volumetric segmentation includes removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure [30] , automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep grey matter volumetric structures (including hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, ventricles) [30] [31] [32] , intensity normalization [33] , tessellation of the grey matter white matter boundary, automated topology correction [34, 35] , and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the grey/white and grey/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class [36] [37] [38] . Once the cortical models are complete, registration to a spherical atlas takes place which utilizes individual cortical folding patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects [39] . This is followed by parcellation of the cerebral cortex into units based on gyral and sulcal structure [40, 41] . This segmentation approach has been used for multivariate classification of AD and healthy controls [16, 17, 42, 72] , neuropsychological-image analysis [15, 18] , imaging-genetic analysis [43, 44] , and biomarker discovery [24, 73, 74] . The current study focused on regional brain volumes and cortical thickness measures, specifically hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex (ERC) thickness, and whole brain volume (WBV) which have been proposed to be related to AD and have received high level of attention in the recent literature [4, 7-12, 16, 17] . Volumes from the left and the right hemisphere were averaged together. All volumetric measures from each subject were normalized by the subject's intracranial volume. Cortical thickness measures were not normalized and were used in their raw form [45] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Non-parametric and t-test analyses were used to test for differences in continuous outcomes such as MRI-based measures, cognition, severity measures, age, and education between AD, MCI, and NDC. The chi-square test was used to test for differences in categorical outcomes such as gender and the presence of the APOE 4 allele. Correlation analysis (Spearman non-parametric test) was used for associations between brain region volumes, cognitive scores (MMSE, ADAS-cog), and CDR for illness staging within the groups.\nRates of cognitive decline were determined by change in the cognitive measures (MMSE and ADASCog total scores). These measures were estimated by fitting a random intercept and slope model using xtmixed in STATA 10 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The average baseline cognitive outcome and the average change in the cognitive outcome over the follow-up time were calculated for all the AD patients, MCI, and NDC as a group (fixed effects). Subject-specific intercept and slope terms which reflected deviation from the group average (random effects) were also calculated. Follow-up time was defined as the number of years (days/365.25) passed since the baseline visit, and up to 5 time points (three months apart) was recorded for each patient. Time squared was also used to assess nonlinear cognitive decline.\nAdjustment for age at baseline, education years, gender, cholinesterase inhibitors, center, and APOE genotype was made. Continuous outcomes were centered to their mean to aid interpretation of the model. As the main focus of the study was to study associations for cognitive decline in AD, we did not differentiate MCI into converters and non-converters and used all MCI as a group.\nAn interaction between the MRI-based brain volumes and follow-up time (Entorhinal Cortex \u00d7 TIME, Whole Brain \u00d7 TIME, or Hippocampus \u00d7 TIME) was used to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the rate of cognitive function, i.e., in slopes for different baseline brain volumes. The coefficient of the time variable in this case (TIME) would indicate the association between follow-up time with cognitive decline for average brain volume (since the variables are centered around their mean); the coefficient of the brain volume for each subject (Entorhinal Cortex, Whole Brain, or Hippocampus) would indicate the association of baseline brain volume with baseline cognitive assessment score and the coefficient of the interaction term (MRI brain volume \u00d7 follow-up time) would indicate the effect of brain volume on cognitive decline over time.

Higher baseline ERC thickness was associated with slower cognitive decline measured with MMSE and ADAS-cog.

Within the AD group, (B) baseline ERC and WBV were significantly associated with baseline cognition measured by MMSE and ADAScog and also with stage of dementia as measured by CDR sum of boxes scores. (C) Baseline ERC thickness but not hippocampal volume was associated with longitudinal changes in cognition over one year and could predict the degree of decline slopes as measured by MMSE and ADAS-cog. (D) Baseline WBV was also associated with greater subsequent cognitive decline measured with ADAS-cog, although the association with the MMSE was marginal. The models were controlled for age at baseline, education years, gender, cholinesterase inhibitors, center, and APOE genotype.\nReductions in the hippocampal and entorhinal regions between the AD and NDC in our study were similar to previous studies [4, 46] . The differences in these regions between MCI and NDC were also comparable with a previous study [46] . We found greater reductions in hippocampus compared to ERC regions similar to these studies in both AD and MCI groups. However, the focuses of these studies were on predictors of MCI conversion to AD, and they did not report on the association between the regions and the cognitive measures within the AD group.\nOur findings are in line with previous studies that ERC measures correlate better with baseline cognitive scores than hippocampal volume and that atrophy in ERC predicts cognitive decline better than hippocampal atrophy [7, 11, [47] [48] . Recently in a genome-wide study of atrophy in regions associated with neurodegeneration in AD, we identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a disease-specific effect associated with ERC volume in an intron of the ZNF292 gene (rs1925690) and an intergenic SNP, flanking the ARPP-21 gene, with an overall effect on entorhinal cortical thickness (rs11129640) [41] . Genewide scoring also highlighted PICALM as the most significant gene associated with ERC thickness [49] .\nAlthough we found that hippocampal volume associated with the baseline cognitive measures as previously reported [8, 50, 51] , we found no association between hippocampal volume and subsequent cognitive change, which has also been previously reported by some [52, 53] , but not all authors [54] . Mungas and colleagues previously reported that hippocampal atrophy predicted decline in AD but only in those subjects without lacunes [12] .\nWBV correlated with baseline clinical measures and predicted future cognitive decline, which probably reflects the correspondence between these measures of overall cerebral loss and global cognitive measures in the moderate stages of AD as reported earlier [52, 55] .\nStructures within the temporal lobe have long been associated with AD decline because of their critical role in the formation of long-term memory, one of the first functions to be affected in disease progression [51] . Both ERC and hippocampus are essential parts of the medial temporal lobe system that supports declarative (conscious) memory [56] . AD pathology primarily begins in ERC, followed by immediate progression through subiculum to the hippocampus proper [5] . Pathologically, Braak and Braak demonstrated that the spread of neurofibrillary tangles in postmortem brains appear first in the prealpha transentorhinal neurons and then spread to the ERC proper [5] . Developmental, morphological, functional, and molecular features of layer II neurons in the ERC interact to promote early susceptibility of this cell type to aging and AD [57] . Within the ERC, there is subregional specificity for molecular alterations that may initiate cognitive decline and with a potential to directly contribute to downstream cascades in its primary afferent regions, the hippocampus [57] . Previous clinical studies demonstrated that the rates of cognitive decline accelerated with time in AD [58, 59] , suggesting accelerated neurodegeneration in AD. Both cross-sectional and serial MRI studies on patients with AD have consistently found volume losses in both ERC and hippocampus [48, 51, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Taken together, these findings suggest that AD is associated with progressive atrophy of both ERC and hippocampus, providing potential surrogate markers for this disease. Assuming that degenerative processes proceed at similar rates in the ERC and hippocampus, one might therefore expect to find higher atrophy rates in the structure where neurodegeneration began earlier. Our results substantiate this hypothesis, which is consistent with the view of earlier involvement of AD pathology in the ERC than the hippocampus [65] . Risacher et al., however, have found similar atrophy rates of 4-5% per year in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the ADNI cohort [66] .\nAPOE 4 had no influence on the relation between the ERC, hippocampal, and WBV with cognitive severity or cognitive decline in our study, similar to other reports [67, 68] . We have previously reported that the homozygous 4 carriers had significant volume loss in hippocampus and amygdala in AD [43] . Possibly the influence is not seen due to lack of association of hippocampus volume with cognitive severity or longitudinal cognitive decline in AD. This warrants further evaluation in future longitudinal studies. We found significant correlations between structural MRI measures and baseline MMSE for healthy control subjects in our study, but the small range of MMSE for healthy subjects means that this finding should be viewed with some caution.\nStrengths of the current study include the sample size and our use of automated MRI measures. The study compares cognitive decline for AD, MCI, and NDC subjects using the baseline brain measures as continuous variables and the quartiles for graphical view.\nIn conclusion, subjects with AD had thinner ERC, smaller WBV, and hippocampal volume compared to subjects with MCI and NDC. In addition, with in AD subjects, thinner ERC was associated with lower baseline cognitive scores, higher disease severity, and predicted greater subsequent cognitive decline at one year follow up. MRI is superior in defining disease stage clinically and has been shown to be a slightly better predictor of future clinical decline than cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers [69, 70] . Neuroimaging biomarkers that predict decline would have a great potential for increasing the efficacy of early intervention [71] . By focusing structural analyses on regions known to be first affected in AD, we may better identify those individuals at greatest risk for future memory decline, valuable in determining the course of future care needed by these individuals, requiring more substantial care at an earlier time point."}]
