The first human\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the viral family Coronaviridae, which includes a large number of viruses found in mammals and birds. The first human coronavirus was identified in the 1960s after an outbreak caused a large number of respiratory infections [1, 2] . The number of scientific contributions related to SARS-CoV-2 has increased exponentially after its emergence in southern China in December 2019. Epidemiological investigations and genome sequencing experiments revealed SARS-CoV-2 as the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic [3] . Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, six other human coronaviruses have been reported: \u03b1-coronaviruses 229E and NL63, \u03b2-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Among those six, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to be associated with severe respiratory disease, high rates of acute lung injury, and correspondingly high mortality rates [4] [5] [6] . SARS-CoV-2 is divergent from all known human coronaviruses, including the 2012 MERS-CoV, which is believed to have originated from Saudi Arabia [7] and is associated with a rapid rate of transmission from human to human. Though both fall under the Betacoronavirus lineage-c, analysis of genome sequence, size, and organization reveals that MERS-CoV significantly differs from SARS-CoV [8, 9] .\nThe first infection of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province of China [10, 11] . This led to the COVID-19 outbreak, which began in late December 2019 and continues to this day [12] . As of August 2020, more than 19 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 730,000 deaths have been reported. The global emergence and exponential increase of SARS-CoV-2 cases demands rapid scientific contributions to control and mitigate its impact.\nThe full genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and its structural organization were first reported by the Yongzhen Zhang team in China [13] . The genome is arranged as 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR)replicase complex (orf1ab)-structural proteins (Spike(S)-Envelope(E)-Membrane(M)-Nucleocapsid(N)) -3\u2032-UTR ( Figure 1 ). The sequence was deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank in January 2020 and the annotation was subsequently provided (NC_045512) [14] . A total of 540 complete genome sequences from 20 different countries/territories with annotated information from NCBI were analyzed in the current study to provide plausible insights into the genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 ). The pressing public health issues associated with this illness motivated us to conduct an evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 across different countries/territories, starting from the reference genome reported from China. The evolutionary analysis described herein helps to shed light on the genomic changes across both time and space (e.g., different countries/territories), as well as expanding our understanding of how genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 may relate to the development/efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. To date, there have been several studies that have conducted phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 based on a varying number of genomic sequences [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Phylogenetic analysis of 160 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed three central variants distinguished by random amino acid variations [24] . A four-genome phylogeny from Chile revealed two different viral variants coming from Europe and Asia [25] . The characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the first three genomes from Italy revealed a single amino acid variation in the surface glycoprotein [26] . A report from Europe on the phylogenetic analysis of two SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed the introduction of novel variants describing the initial stages of viral evolution [27] . The Nextstrain database is continuously updating the information on the phylogenetic analysis and genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 with concomitant updates on the evolutionary changes [28] . Phylogenetic frameworks are essential tools to identify virus lineages that contribute to their active spread. Rambaut et al. proposed a rational and dynamic virus nomenclature for naming the expanding phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 [29] . Their method was made tractable by constraining the number and depth of hierarchical lineage labels and focusing on active virus lineages that are spreading to wider locations. This nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding the patterns and determinants of the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the phylogenetics and divergence, in our current study we aimed to derive the impact of the observed evolutionary changes on the protein functionality and therapeutic interventions. The evolutionary analysis of 540 genomes from 20 different countries/territories described here allowed us to detect a greater number of variations, and correspondingly, the potential impact of such variations on the protein sequences and their implications on vaccine development."}, {"section_title": "Genome Sequence Data", "text": "Aiming to derive the genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 across different countries/territories, 540 complete genome sequences with annotated information were retrieved from NCBI-Virus datahub (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/).

The root node started with the isolate from China (LR757997) obtained from the Wuhan outbreak.

The nodes at the end of the circular cladogram represent the isolates with an increasing amount of variation in the genomic structure when compared to the reference genome.\nIn order to understand the ancestry and descendants among the 540 isolates, an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed ( Figure 5 ).

We observed a large number of nucleotide variations throughout the genomic structure, including point mutations and deletions (Figure 7 & File S3 ). In order to analyze these variations, a nucleotide substitution matrix was generated using the Tamura-Nei method [40] . We found that transitions were far more likely than transversions in these data (approximately 67.58% of substitutions vs. 32.42%, respectively). Nevertheless, given that about a third of the substitutions are transversions, this represents a high tendency towards changes that are more likely to affect the resulting protein [49] .

The genomic variations observed in structural genes could serve as useful information for the vaccine development community. The results of this study may also help to address the consequences of genomic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 and its effects on immunogenic response in different patients. The approach we followed to derive the genomic divergence among SARS-CoV-2 genomes establishes several lines of inquiry for the variable immunogenic responses that would be an obstacle for developing a successful vaccine.\nThe rooted circular cladogram explained the root and spread of SARS-CoV-2 starting from China to 20 different countries/territories. This forms the basis to understand the genesis and dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 infection among 20 different countries/territories, which was defined based on the genomic similarities among 540 genomes. The evolution of ancestors and descendants was further evaluated by the unrooted tree that showed five distinct clusters. The USA clusters were observed to be derived from the clusters of all other countries/territories providing a possible evidence of origin from multiple sources. The root bases formed by China isolates are further demonstrating the root of infection, which was already observed in the circular cladogram. The bootstrapping tree showed similar clustering to that of the unrooted phylogram, indicating the reliability of the clustering process. The varying degrees of branch lengths within the clusters of the bootstrap phylogram indicate high rates of genomic divergence.\nGenomic variants, such as indels and substitutions, observed in the multiple sequence alignment of 540 genomes indicate ongoing genetic evolution when compared to the reference genome. The genomic divergence is still continuing as evident from Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/). Such a high frequency of variations in the genome arising in a short period of time could impact the efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. There exists a greater need to understand how genomic changes brought about by indels in the genome could impact the antigenicity through protein sequence and structural changes. Hence, these variations may be considered during development of drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Identification of critical nucleotide changes reflecting as amino acid changes in the proteins would alter the conformation of the proteins that leads to changes in pathogenicity and antigenicity. Such genetic variations would contribute to diverse antigenic properties resulting in variable immunogenic responses in the patients [57, 58] . This would cause an involuntary impact on the rational design of a successful vaccine.\nIn order to ascertain these variations, we have further evaluated the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and provide interpretations based on our analysis and observations. SARS-CoV-2 contains positive single-stranded RNA genomes with at least six open reading frames. The entire genome is grouped into nonstructural and structural regions (Figure 1 ). The nonstructural region represents a long ORF1ab that encodes replicase polyproteins required for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. It contains the nonstructural genes nsp1 to nsp16 that encode proteins such as papain-like proteinase (PL); 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLPro); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); helicase, 3 -to-5 exonuclease; endoRNAse; and 2 -O-ribose methyltransferase, which are required for the biochemical and molecular functions of the virus within the host. Hence, the nonstructural genes serve as attractive targets for antiviral drugs [59] [60] [61] . Further, nsp7 and nsp13 are associated with T-cell immune response [62] . Most of the T-cell epitopes are encoded by structural genes [63] . The structural region encodes four major structural proteins such as S, E, M, and N proteins. These four structural proteins represent ideal targets for the development of universal vaccines as they represent the majority of potential B-and T-cell epitopes [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . These proteins form the protective layer of the virus and are exposed to the host environment at its primary stages of attack. Hence, the induction of immunogenicity in the host primarily depends on these proteins, making them the ideal vaccine candidates. Naturally, variations in the genome can cause changes in amino acids. We have investigated these amino acid changes in the S, E, M, and N proteins (Table S1 ). The identified mutations were further mapped with the previous vaccine reports where potential vaccine candidates were reported in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . A total of 23 mutations in S protein, 1 in E, 2 from M, and 7 from N protein were mapped with the reported vaccine candidates (Table S2 ). The variations, observed in the proteins, disturb the antigenic determinants and could be responsible for the wide variety of immunogenic responses in each patient. Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Maria et al. analyzed 220 genomic sequences and stated that the virus is evolving [64] . European, North American, and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. In addition to the mutations in structural proteins, mutations in the RdRp are significant as the virus mutagenic capability depends on the fidelity of RdRp [64] . Over 100 mutations of S protein were studied for their impact on the infectivity and antigenicity by Qianqian et al., and they found that D614G mutation is more infectious [65] . This mutation is also associated with higher viral loads. D614G was also reported to be consistently increasing at regional levels, indicating its fitness advantage [66] . Surprisingly, the same mutation was observed in 160 genomes among 540 in our current study, and also mapped with the vaccine candidates. Another mutation, V483A from S protein, reported to be markedly resistant to monoclonal antibodies (mABs), was observed among six genomes and mapped with the vaccine candidates. These large numbers of amino acid variations in the structural genes suggest that the genomic variations could present challenges in terms of vaccine and treatment development. Such an increasing genomic divergence poses numerous challenges to the research community to fight against COVID-19. Most of the current research on COVID-19 vaccination is based on the identification and characterization of the virulent proteins such as structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that interfere with innate and adaptive immune response and are also involved in the interactions with macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and dendritic and epithelial cells. Such immunogenic interactions modulate the host response against viruses to combat pathogenesis [43, 67] . The increasing number of mutations causing increase in the genomic divergence would continue to be a challenge in the treatment and vaccine design strategies [58] . The conserved regions of the proteins with no frequency of mutations contribute to stable immunogenicity. Zhang et al. reported that immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein were found to be evolutionarily highly conserved, contributing to potential immunogenicity [68] . Nevertheless, the amino acid variations in SARS-CoV-2 might change the immunogenicity of ID sites, suggesting the careful consideration of epitopes for vaccine design [69] .\nThe findings from the current study highlight the potential impact of genomic variations on protein changes that may stymie the vaccine development process. Information about the possible sites of nucleotide changes and conserved regions of the structural proteins may help other researchers consider specific regions in the proteins that would be avoided as targets for a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [58, 70] . This study also illuminates the important changes for the mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and supports continuing surveillance of mutations to aid with development of a universal vaccine and immunological interventions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Currently, most of the world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a vaccine or targeted treatment is urgently needed. Our current study represents an analysis of 540 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes, collected across 20 different countries/territories. Ongoing genomic divergence was observed among the genomes. In addition, large numbers of nucleotide variations were observed throughout the genome. We analyzed the impact of genomic variations on the structural region of the genome, which is the main target for the development of vaccine candidates. This study suggests these variations be considered in the development of a universal vaccine for COVID-19. We conclude that the continued genomic divergence across successive generations arising due to larger number of nucleotide variations could hinder the development of a universal vaccine. The vaccine research communities could adopt this information to avoid the regions with variations to achieve a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
