[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The immune response is highly active in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identification of genetic risk contributed by immune genes to AD may provide essential insight for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of this neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we performed a genetic screening for AD-related top immune genes identified in Europeans in a Chinese cohort, followed by a multiple-stage study focusing on Complement Factor H (CFH) gene. Effects of the risk SNPs on AD-related neuroimaging endophenotypes were evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging scan, and the effects on AD cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (CSF) and CFH expression changes were measured in aged and AD brain tissues and AD cellular models. Our results showed that the AD-associated top immune genes reported in Europeans (CR1, CD33, CLU, and TREML2) have weak effects in Chinese, whereas CFH showed strong effects. In particular, rs1061170 (P meta = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ) and rs800292 (P meta = 1.3 \u00d7 10\n) showed robust associations with AD, which were confirmed in multiple world-wide sample sets (4317 cases and 16 795 controls). Rs1061170 (P = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 ) and rs800292 (P = 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ) risk-allele carriers have an increased entorhinal thickness in their young age and a higher atrophy rate as the disease progresses. Rs800292 risk-allele carriers have higher CSF tau and A\u03b2 levels and severe cognitive decline. CFH expression level, which was affected by the risk-alleles, was increased in AD brains and cellular models. These comprehensive analyses suggested that CFH is an important immune factor in AD and affects multiple pathological changes in early life and during disease progress."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD, OMIM 104300, 104310) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and leads to a progressive cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly (Alzheimer's Association, 2013; Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010) . The major histological features of the disease include the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) deposition, synaptic dysfunction, and loss of neuronal integrity (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010) . The underlying cause of the disease is unclear in most cases, but numerous genetic alterations have been identified as being associated with Alzheimer's risk (Bertram et al, 2007; Karch and Goate, 2015; Lambert et al, 2013) . Immunerelated genes, especially complement genes such as complement receptor 1 (CR1) and clusterin (CLU; Bertram et al, 2007) , have been identified as the top AD susceptibility genes in European populations or of European origin, and the complement system has been reported to be involved in the initiation and development of AD (Crehan et al, 2012) .\nThe complement regulator, Complement Factor H (CFH, OMIM 134370), has a key role in inhibiting complement activation and inflammation. CFH was recognized as the major genetic risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD; Klein et al, 2005) , which is another age-related neurodegenerative disease and shares similar risk factors and pathological features with AD (Sivak, 2013) . CFH protein was suggested to be a potential top serum biomarker for AD (Hye et al, 2006 (Hye et al, , 2014 Thambisetty et al, 2008) . However, the involvement of CFH in AD is contentious.\nWe performed a genetic screening in a Han Chinese cohort with AD for five immune genes (CR1, CR2, CLU, CD33, and TREML2) that were identified as the top AD susceptibility genes for Europeans (Bertram et al, 2007; Lambert et al, 2013) . After the screening, a multiple-stage genetic association study focusing on the CFH gene was performed. We aimed to answer two key questions: (1) Do genetic variants in these immune genes, especially CFH, confer risk to AD in Han Chinese? and (2) How does CFH function in AD? The involvement of CFH in functional and structural brain changes, as well as AD biomarker (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and A\u03b2 levels) alterations, were explored using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project (Weiner et al, 2010) . Moreover, the effect of AD-related CFH SNPs on morphological changes of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which were recognized as the most and the first affected regions of the brain with AD (Harris et al, 2010; Khan et al, 2014) , respectively, was measured in healthy young adults at genetic risk by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The effects of CFH genotypes and expression changes were analyzed in aged and AD brain tissues and in AD cellular models. Our collective data indicated that CFH is an important AD susceptibility gene and may affect the structure and function of the brain and alter the immune response as the disease progresses."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A two-stage cohort of 2041 Han Chinese with and without AD was analyzed.

In stage 2, we recruited 345 patients (AD2), 337 healthy individuals from the general populations (PC2), and 504 healthy longevity individuals (LC, age 93 \u00b1 2.6 years; as another control) from Southwest China. Most of these AD patients had been analyzed for other risk loci in our recent studies (Bi et al, , 2015 Wang et al, 2014) . In brief, patients were diagnosed following the DSM-IV and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria independently by at least two senior clinicians. The healthy controls were confirmed to have normal cognitive ability. Informed consents conforming to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were obtained from all participants, or the supervisors of patients, after being given a complete description of the study. The institutional review board of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, approved this study.\nTo confirm the results of the two-stage study, we performed jointed comparisons with multiple world-wide sample sets. Additional cohorts from East and Southwest China: 2460 individuals from Shanghai, 1549 individuals from Sichuan Province, and 2751 individuals from Yunnan Province , which were enrolled for other genetic association analyses, were included in this analysis to enlarge the population controls. All of these subjects were collected from the general populations with normal cognitive ability and no history of dementia. Individuals with genotype data of rs800292 and rs1061170 available were included in our jointed comparison. Genetic data from ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/; Weiner et al, 2010) were also retrieved for re-analysis. Subjects with available genotype data from all stages of the ADNI 1/GO/2 were included in our analyses. These samples contain 760 individuals in the ADNI1 cohort (180 probable AD patients, 363 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 214 cognitively normal aging controls) and 430 individuals in the ADNI GO/2 cohort (29 probable AD patients, 275 MCI patients, and 126 cognitively normal aging controls). Because of the limited sample size of probable AD, AD and MCI participants in these two cohorts were pooled as the patients' group.

The brain immune cell glia, the most abundant cells in brain, was previously reported to contribute to half of brain volume changes and would be overactive in neuro-inflammation (DiBattista et al, 2014) . It is thus possible that the increase in entorhinal cortex thickness might be due to a deficit in CFH risk allele carriers to control neuro-inflammation in the brain, as CFH serves an anti-inflammatory component. In addition, it has been reported that increased entorhinal cortex volume during the brain development could indicate a deficit in neural efficiency (DiBattista et al, 2014; Gogtay et al, 2004) . Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the increased entorhinal thickness in young CFH risk allele carriers remained to be elucidated, this result is not unexpected as the entorhinal cortex has an essential role in AD (Khan et al, 2014) . There are further lines of evidence supporting an enhanced entorhinal structure or activity in healthy adults with young age and a higher atrophy rate as the disease progresses for those risk allele carriers. For instance, healthy APOE \u03b54 carriers showed a thicker right entorhinal cortex as compared with the left hemisphere (Donix et al, 2013) and a thinner left entorhinal cortex in APOE \u03b54 carriers than in non-carriers could be identified in children and adolescents (Shaw et al, 2007) . Meanwhile, APOE \u03b54 may lead to an increased activity but greater atrophy in right hemisphere in healthy young subjects (O'Dwyer et al, 2012) . The Alzheimer's risk BDNF genotype (Val/Val of Val66Met) carriers had a thicker entorhinal thickness in early adult life and a higher rate of entorhinal atrophy in elderly (Voineskos et al, 2011) . These observations indicated that young healthy individuals at risk may have altered entorhinal thickness and improved brain activity. It might reflect a compensatory hypothesis (Filippini et al, 2009 ) wherein disease risk individuals appear to require additional effort to achieve comparable performance levels to overcome potential preclinical neural dysfunction.\nIndeed, our data showed that AD-related CFH variant rs800292 not only altered the brain structure (eg, entorhinal cortex) in early life, but also affected the atrophy rate of the entorhinal cortex, CSF tau and A\u03b2 levels, and memory decline as the disease progresses (Figure 2) . These results suggest that CFH is actively involved in the onset and development of AD by promoting structural and functional brain changes. These observations indicated a role of immune genes in neuroimaging alterations in early age."}, {"section_title": "Alteration of CFH Expression is Involved in AD", "text": "Consistent with previous reports that CFH protein has the potential to be a biomarker for AD (Hye et al, 2006 (Hye et al, , 2014 and the above genetic association results, we found that CFH mRNA level in the hippocampus increases with age, suggesting an active role of CFH in the brain aging process (Figure 3) . Moreover, there was a positive correlation between CFH mRNA level and severity of AD (and APP mRNA level) in brain tissues, and this result was consistent with the previous finding of increased CFH protein in the AD brain (Honda et al, 2000; Strohmeyer et al, 2000 Strohmeyer et al, , 2002 . Note that there are some controversies regarding serum CFH level in AD: an increase of CFH level was observed in the serum of AD patients (Hye et al, 2006 (Hye et al, , 2014 ; however, serum CFH level was reported to be significantly downregulated in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (Gezen-Ak et al, 2013). The exact reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. Based on our results, we speculate that higher brain CFH levels may be related to AD development, supported by the observed increase of CFH mRNA levels in our cellular assays in response to A\u03b2 1-42 treatment or with stable overexpression of APP mutant and PSEN1 mutant (Figure 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Implications of CFH in the Pathogenesis of AD", "text": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the risk allele 402H (allele C of rs1061170) interacts less well (compared with 402Y (allele T)) with the binding sites in CFH ligands within the macula, resulting in complement activation and inflammation that may contribute to the accumulation of drusen, thus leading to the initiation and progression of AMD (Clark et al, 2010) . There may be a similar mechanism by which Y402H may contribute to progression of AD. It is now known that A\u03b2 plaques and local inflammation are central to the pathogenesis of AD (Kamer, 2010; Wyss-Coray, 2006) . In addition to the anti-inflammation role, CFH acts as an extracellular matrix component and interacts with a wide selection of ligands (Ferreira et al, 2010) , such as the C-reactive protein (Strang et al, 2012) , heparin (Bergamaschini et al, 2009) , zinc (Suh et al, 2000) , and sialic acid (Patel et al, 2006) . All these ligands may be involved in the accumulation of senile plaque in the AD brain. It has been reported that the risk allele 402H presented a reduced affinity to these ligands (Ormsby et al, 2008) . Hence, patients harboring risk allele 402H might bind less CFH in amyloid plaques, resulting in an impaired regulation of complement activation and local inflammation that may contribute to the accumulation of deposits and neuron loss in the development of AD (Figure 4) . Furthermore, patients harboring the risk allele 402H might have decreased CFH levels in their brains according to our eQTL analysis. With impaired CFH levels and activity, extracellular deposition in the nidus may lead to inappropriate complement activation and thus contribute to the progression of clinical disease (Figure 4) . Plaques in the AD brain, drusen in the eyes of patients with AMD, drusen-like deposits in the kidney of patients with kidney diseases, and even in the arteries of patients with atherosclerosis may also be the result of such processes. Further in vivo experiments using AD animal models are warranted to confirm our speculation.\nIt is worth mentioning that CFH was identified as the most important genetic factor for AMD (Klein et al, 2005) and its SNPs associated with AD were found to be risk SNPs for AMD; are we really bringing these two diseases, which share similar pathological characteristics and environmental risk factors (Keenan et al, 2014; Sivak, 2013) , much closer based on this study? Significant cognitive impairment and subsequent occurrence of AD in AMD patients have been reported (Baker et al, 2009; Kaarniranta et al, 2011; Pham et al, 2006; Sivak, 2013; Woo et al, 2012) , although the conclusion remains controversial (Kaarniranta et al, 2011; Keenan et al, 2014) . The sequential occurrence of brain and retinal damage needs to be clarified. Our current observations added more evidence to the notion that AMD and AD, to some extent, share some common pathological features such as chronic oxidative stress and inflammation, active complement involvement, and intra-and extracellular deposits (Kaarniranta et al, 2011) . These two diseases likely represent two related but distinct parallel amyloidopathies that might benefit from common targeted therapeutic approaches.\nThe presence of the CFH risk alleles in AD and AMD poses an evolutionary paradox during human evolution, as the diseases may have negative effects on fitness, but the risk alleles have not been eliminated by natural selection and persist within global populations. Why the deleterious allele 402H (rs1061170 C) was retained in populations with a relatively high frequency? We performed a positive selection analysis on the CFH region to look for an evolutionary explanation of this phenomenon. Two online tools for detecting positive selection in human genome were used: Haplotter (Voight et al, 2006 ; using the HapMap data) and CMS viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/cmsviewer/, using the 1000 genome data; Supplementary Figure 6 ). Positive selection was observed in a region next to the CFH gene cluster in African and Asian populations, which contains the ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) gene. This gene controls brain development and was reported to have evolved rapidly in human (Zhang, 2003) . However, it is the CFH region itself that showed evidence of positive selection in the European (CEU) population, consistent with the fact that the CEU population also has a higher prevalence of AD and AMD. These observations indicate an evolutionary imprint on this region that may affect AD. The risk allele 402H may provide an advantageous effect against pathogens, which can evade complement attack by recruitment of CFH (Ferreira et al, 2010) . Therefore, it is possible that the derived 402H allele was retained during evolution to limit immune evasion by potential pathogens. Because of this trade-off effect, the retained allele may contribute a deleterious effect on common diseases (such as AMD, AD, uremia, and atherosis), which commonly affect the elderly in our modern world.\nIn summary, our results showed that CFH may contribute to AD development by affecting neuroimaging endophenotypes and biomarkers as well as immune response. Most of all, CFH affects structural change of the entorhinal cortex in early life and atrophy rate during AD progression, indicating a multifaceted role of immune regulators. Population-based longitudinal analyses focusing on neuroimaging (eg, memory task-based functional MRI), biomarker indicators, and AD Braak stage progression in risk allele carriers might provide more support and benefit clinical research and applications. The biological implication of CFH in AD needs further characterization. "}, {"section_title": "FUNDING AND DISCLOSURE", "text": ""}]
