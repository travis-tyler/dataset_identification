We aimed to develop a model trained only by normal brain PET data with an unsupervised manner to identify an abnormality in various disorders as imaging data of the clinical routine. Methods: Using variational autoencoder, a type of unsupervised learning, Abnormality Score was defined as how far a given brain image is from the normal data. The model was applied to FDG PET data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical routine FDG PET data for assessing behavioral abnormality and seizures. Accuracy was measured by the area under curve (AUC) of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. We investigated whether deep learning has additional benefits with experts' visual interpretation to identify abnormal patterns. Findings: The AUC of the ROC curve for differentiating AD was 0.90. The changes in cognitive scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up were significantly correlated with Abnormality Score at baseline. The AUC of the ROC curve for discriminating patients with various disorders from controls was 0.74.

Deep learning-based models have been successfully developed for medical image recognition tasks including diagnosis of dermatologic disorders and diabetic retinopathy [2, 3] . So far, a few deep learning-based models have been applied to the diagnosis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorders [4] [5] [6] [7] . Even though these models have recorded high accuracy for discriminating brain disorders from normal controls, their clinical application has not yet been established due to several reasons. One of the critical limitations in the current deep learning-based diagnostic models is that it can be only applied to data similar to a training set as most models rely on supervised learning, while brain images are clinically acquired for patients with various disorders without any prior grouping and its characterization [8] . For example, a deep learning model trained by a cohort composed of AD patients and controls with supervised manner could hardly be applied to patients with a cognitive decline in general population as it includes other types of dementia as well as AD. Moreover, the deep learning model based on supervised training which has successfully differentiated characteristic groups of patients from normal has limitations when applied to the diagnosis of uncommon ones, because it is difficult to collect sufficient data on rare diseases to train the model [9, 10] .\nWe aimed to develop an unsupervised learning-based model which can be used to identify brain abnormality even in the subjects with unknown heterogeneous distribution. The model trained by 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET of cognitively normal aged subjects was applied to identify abnormal patterns of brain metabolism. We used the data only consisting of brain images of normal subjects for training. The output of the model, defined as Abnormality Score in this study, represents how far a given patient's brain's metabolic pattern is from the distribution of the normal subjects. To show the applicability of this model to various disorders in the clinical setting including relatively uncommon diseases, we applied the model to an independent cohort of patients with heterogeneous brain disorders. As this cohort includes brain disorders showing various brain metabolic patterns which were unheralded and sometimes had no abnormality on visual analysis, we investigated whether the model could capture diverse abnormal metabolic patterns therein. Furthermore, as the model could generate a map representing abnormal patterns, we investigated whether the abnormality pattern map could assist experts' visual interpretation to identify brain abnormalities and their localizations."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A part of the image data of this study was collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (http://adni.loni.usc.edu) database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California San Francisco. ADNI included subjects from over 50 sites across the US and Canada. The main goal of ADNI has been to develop combined biomarkers by investigating whether serial imaging and biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease. For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org. Among FDG PET scans of 393 subjects of normal controls, 353 scans were used for training the model. The remained 40 controls were used as a test set for the model to discriminate abnormal from normal brain.\nAs abnormal brain data, the model was tested in two different cohorts. Firstly, the model was tested for the FDG PET scans of ADNI database. FDG PET scans of Alzheimer's disease (n = 243) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 667) patients were used. As normal subjects, the remaining 40 controls aforementioned were used to evaluate the model. The diagnostic classification was determined by ADNI Clinical Core and used as a ground-truth for further deep learningbased prediction. Brief demographics of ADNI cohorts are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 .\nAs an independent dataset from the training ADNI dataset, FDG brain PET scans of patients routinely obtained in the clinic were retrospectively collected in a single center. FDG PET scans as a baseline workup for evaluating the etiology of seizures and behavioral abnormalities were retrospectively collected. Baseline FDG PET studies of patients who had structural abnormalities including stroke and tumors were excluded. To compare the brain PET scans of these patients, adult normal FDG brain PET scans were also retrospectively collected. The normal brain PET scans were obtained by subjects who underwent health screening and had no history of neurologic disorders (Demographics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2) .

The performance of discriminating abnormal brain patterns from normal controls was evaluated by ROC curves and AUC was calculated.

The inputs of the model were FDG PET data and age of subjects. The key concept lies in the fact that the model reconstructs normal brain images similar to training samples with minimized reconstruction error, while the model shall reconstruct brain images with abnormal patterns far from the distribution of normal brains with high reconstruction error. The model was sufficiently trained to reconstruct PET images of normal aged subjects with a minimized loss (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We defined 'Abnormality Score' using normalized reconstruction error of images defined by the mean value of mean-squared-errors of brain voxels (Fig. 1a) . Abnormality Score of AD patients was significantly higher than normal controls independent of training data (1.93 \u00b1 0.83 vs. 0.99 \u00b1 0.25, p b 1 \u00d7 10"}, {"section_title": "\u221215", "text": ").

As one sample t-test for each brain could identify conventionally the degree of abnormality using a voxelwise statistical distribution of normal controls, maximum t-score of each subject was used as a conventional abnormality score. AUC of the ROC curve estimated by the maximum t-score was 0.78 (95% C.I. 0.71-0.85). A distance between a given brain PET from the reference brain was used as another conventional abnormality score.

The AUCs of conventional abnormality scores were significantly lower than the AUC of Abnormality Score (p b 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 2) . The voxelwise mean-squared-error map drawn for each subject showed variable patterns for AD patients (Fig. 2A) .

These subjects were sampled from the routine cohort of brain FDG PET examinations requested based on various clinical impressions. This cohort consisted of cryptogenic epilepsies of heterogeneous etiology and also included rare disorders such as autoimmune encephalitis (Supplementary Table 2 ). FDG PET images were performed to evaluate the cause of symptoms and localize the abnormalities. Using our model trained by normal subjects of the different cohort (i.e. ADNI cohort), the Abnormality Scores of PET images were calculated for this new cohort. The Abnormality Scores of these patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (U = 93.0, p = 0.01). The AUC of the ROC curve for discriminating symptomatic patients from healthy controls was 0.74 (95% C.I. 0.58-0.87) (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Sensitivity and specificity were 68.8% and 72.7% when a specific Abnormality Score value, 0.92, was used as a threshold. The threshold value of Abnormality Score was defined as the point on the ROC curve with minimal distance from 100% sensitivity and specificity. A conventional one sample t-test using the normal cohort of ADNI as controls could not differentiate symptomatic patients from normal controls. T-scores of patients were not significantly different from those of healthy controls (U = 143.0, p = 0.18) and the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.59, which were not significantly higher than 0.5 (95% C.I. 0.44-0.73) ( Supplementary  Fig. 4) .\nWe compared the deep learning model and visual interpretation by experts for identifying brain metabolic abnormality. According to the visual interpretation performed by experts, 12 of 32 PET scans showed abnormal metabolic patterns, while abnormal patterns could not be visually identified in 20 scans. The Abnormality Score of scans visually abnormal and normal was not significantly different (1.38 \u00b1 1.32 vs. 1.27 \u00b1 0.71, p = n.s) ( Table 1) . Among 32 scans, the Abnormality Score of 21 scans were higher than the threshold 0.92 (Supplementary  Table 3) .\nWe further assessed whether the visual interpretation could be aided by reconstruction error maps. As voxelwise reconstruction errors represented the location of abnormal patterns, the visual interpretation could be aided by them. The visually normal PET scans (n = 20) were visually reassessed with corresponding reconstruction error maps to find abnormal metabolic patterns. We found that the visual analysis was helped by the reconstruction error maps to have identified locally decreased metabolism in 12 PET scans (60%, 12/20) (Table 1 ). In particular, the epileptogenic zones were localized well with abnormal metabolic patterns in neocortical epilepsy patients and in patients with autoimmune encephalitis by the reconstruction error maps (Fig. 4) , which had not been visually identified without the reconstruction maps. Of note, 8 abnormal metabolic patterns further identified by the reconstruction error maps showed localized abnormality which corresponded to clinical symptoms of seizures and final diagnosis of neocortical epilepsies, autoimmune encephalitis and degenerative disorders (Supplementary Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One of the key issues in the clinical application of deep learning is to develop a model that reflect real-world data. Recent deep learning models particularly focusing on the diagnostic classification have resulted in the remarkable accuracy comparable to experts' visual reading [12] . A key drawback of these models was the difficulty in application to patients of the real clinic as some of the disease types and their characteristic patterns of abnormalities would not be included in the recognizable features by the training cohort. A theoretically possible solution is to collect a large dataset which sufficiently covers all types of patients, however, it can result in several practical issues including harmonization, missing data, and class imbalance as well as a huge cost. Our approach adopting the training using only the normal PET data and measuring the degree of abnormality of the PET data of interest could bypass the issues caused by the difference between training datasets and real-world patients [8] . Furthermore, our approach could be an example of a clinically applicable transfer model as it could apply to various types of disorders as a clinical routine.\nThe Abnormality Score could be used as an imaging biomarker by measuring the degree of abnormality. Considering the correlation between the Abnormality Score and the future cognitive score change in MCI patients, it could be used as a predictive marker for cognitive decline. Although this type of prediction was achieved by supervised learning with higher accuracy [5] , the Abnormality Score could not only apply to patients with cognitive decline but various disorders. Since there are various disorders in addition to AD and MCI which show a cognitive problem in the clinical setting, our model has advantages compared with the deep learning models based on supervised learning which show higher accuracy. Furthermore, considering that ). Note that red dots represent MCI-converters and blue dots represent MCI-nonconverters.\nVAE could successfully yield the distribution of variable patterns [11] , we thought that the VAE-based model could represent how far a given brain PET is from the normal distribution of brain PET. This idea has been also adapted to anomaly detection for the time-series data [13, 14] . Our approach could localize the abnormal patterns, which were expected to be an explainable model by combining clinical routine visual interpretation. As MCI patients show a heterogeneous and clinical manifestation of dementia could be variable, unsupervised learning models including our approach might identify the direction of abnormalities and eventually discover subtypes of patients with clustering algorithms. It could be another future work which might be achieved by unsupervised learning on various imaging modalities as well as other biomarkers. The correlation between the future cognitive decline and the Abnormality Score was weak compared with previous models based on supervised learning [5] . It may be a trade-off to the advantage of the generalized application of our model in heterogeneous patients. As a future work, by combining the advantages, unsupervised learning followed by supervised learning as a model transfer may be an effective method for developing deep learning models with high accuracy for specific tasks with relatively small samples [15] .\nAn important application of our model is an identification of abnormality in an unrelated group of diseases acquired in other institution than the original data even including uncommon disorders. Several natural image classification models based on ImageNet challenge were trained by the same number of image data for each label [16] . However, real-world data, especially in medical fields, include patients' images of many mutually unrelated uncommon disorders. It also obviates the trial to collect statistically sufficient data to be fed to the deep learning algorithm. Furthermore, many diagnostic classifications are based on the complicated clinical presentations including disease progression and treatment response as well as pathologic diagnosis, which result in heterogeneous and uncertain ground-truth labels for medical attributes of the patients or patients' status data. This complexity in diagnostic classification and problems of uncommon disorders eventually demands unsupervised learning.\nWe showed the feasibility of the application of the VAE-based model for identifying the abnormality in the independent cohort of heterogeneous patients. Though the patients have the variable final diagnosis, Abnormality Score was significantly higher than controls. Moreover, our VAE-based model could identify abnormal patterns for localization of the metabolic abnormality. This localization is clinically important as it can be used as an assistant for experts' reading and to help the requesting clinicians' further planning of surgery or therapy [17, 18] . In particular, as the noninvasive localization of the epileptic zone was difficult for cryptogenic epilepsy patients, we suggest that our VAE-based model might be a clinically useful tool. Our model can serve as an assistant system for visual interpretation which will enhance the efficiency and reliability of experts' reading.\nAs a proof-of-concept study for a clinically applicable deep learning model, we attempted to develop the general model that covers brain images of heterogeneous conditions which correspond to the realworld clinical setting. To prove the model to be applied to various conditions in the clinical setting, the model should be further investigated in other cohorts recruited in other brain disorders. In terms of the model architecture and deep learning methods, there is a room for further modification. A variant type of generative adversarial networks was used for anomaly detection in a previous study [19] , which resulted in a good performance for identifying abnormal lesions in optical coherence tomography images. Such a method could be a good candidate for application to brain images as well, even though training and optimization of adversarial networks using 3-dimensional brain image data are still difficult. Further modification and technical improvements in the model only using normal brain data may facilitate the clinical application of deep learning models that can solve real-world problems.

Given that it is difficult to collect a sufficiently large brain image dataset that covers all diseases, especially rare diseases, our approach could be appropriate for realworld heterogeneous clinical data from various disorders. Furthermore, we showed that our model could be combined with experts' image interpretation, the current clinical routine, by assisting the identification and localization of abnormal patterns. We expect that our approach, which has extensibility to various diseases and may have synergy with current clinical routine practice, can facilitate the application of deep learning to nuclear medicine."}]
