The purpose of this study was to provide an analysis and evaluation of composite variables in National Education Longitudinal Study 1988 (NELS:88) and School and Staffing Survey (SASS) surveys, in a way that will furnish guidance to NCES staff in the more effective use of survey resources. For example, it is reasonable to suppose that more questions are asked in some NCES surveys than are needed for analysis purposes. The study has provided ways of understanding the contributions made by individual survey items through an appraisal of the contributions they make to composite measures of which they are a part. It has also shown how composite variables may provide more reliable measures of the concepts of interest than do individual survey items, and how they may permit the more effective summarization and communication of survey results. This study uses the term \"composite\" to denote the use of multiple survey items for a single measure. The composite variables that were examined include the following: (1) Self concept and locus of control 2Socioeconomic status (SES) School climate Additional variables designated by NCES and variables found to be of interest during the course of the study were also analyzed. The guiding question in the study analysis was whether a particular variable contributed to or detracted from the efficacy of a composite variable. This question was approached by inquiring about whether to include the variable in the factor analysis. The initial consideration was whether the variable conceptually fit with the other components of the composite. The strategy followed in this study employed several factor analyses followed by calculation of reliability and validity estimates on a given composite variable. While the field costs of surveys have escalated, the computer has made analysis comparatively quick and cheap, making it cost effective to conduct a variety of analyses of survey items and their composites.

In other words, all the composites had a high percentage of their variation attributable to the \"common score\". The validation results indicated that the composites had almost no predictive power.

Analysis", "text": "For the two-factor model both Principal Factor and Maximum Likelihood analyses produced similar results with only a modest proportion of total variance explained (.344) and relatively high RMS (.079 for Principal Factor and .078 for Maximum Likelihood). A number of variables (BYS44I, BYS44J, BYS44L) had high loadings on both factors, suggesting that they were either complex variables or were forced into the two factors thus making their interpretation difficult. The two-factor analysis results indicated that more than two factors should be used in the model. For the three factor model Principal Factor and Maximum Likelihood Factor analyses second and third factors were interchanged; apart from that the results were similar. Both methods gave better fit than the two factor model: proportion of variance explained = .401 and RMS under .05. Each of the variables, except BYS44L, was highly loaded on one factor only, suggesting following grouping of items: It should be pointed out that BYS44A, BYS44D, BYS44E, BYS44H, BYS44K are the five reversed score questions and they always grouped together (in the two-factor and the three-factor solutions), even though they seemed to belong to the different factors. Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis on the two random subsets of the whole sample gave results almost identical to those above, confirming stability of the solution. Reliability of the each composite was estimated by Cronbach's Alpha which can be interpreted as the squared correlation between the specific composite score a person obtains and the score he or she would have obtained if all possible items were used. Cronbach's Alpha for SC2: BYS44A, BYS44D, BYS44E, BYS44H, BYS44I, BYS44J, BYS44L was highest among the self-concept composites. Adding BYS44K to SC1 slightly increased reliability. Even though reliability is increased by adding BYS44I, BYS44J, BYS441 to the self-concept composite, the increase is rather low considering that the composite went from four items to seven items. Dropping BYS44K from LC2 did not make any significant difference in terms of Cronbach's Alpha. However, addition of BYS44M to LC1 significantly improved reliability, thus making LC3: BYS44C, BYS44F, BYS44G, BYS44B, BYS44M a \"better\" composite than LC1 or LC2. The correlations between the composites and math,science and reading scores indicated that composite SC2: BYS44A, BYS44D, BYS44E, BYS44H, BYS44I, BYS44J, BYS44L had much higher predictive power than the two other self-concept composites. It must be pointed out, though, that individually, the component items were much better predictors than self-concept composites: using reading score BYS44L alone had R2=.037 (with full model R2=.064) while SC2 had R2=.017 In case of locus of control composites LC3: BYS44C, BYS44F, BYS44G, BYS44B, BYS44M did a better job than the two other composites: LC3 squared correlations with test scores were the highest. Individual items were better predictors than the composites. Moreover, for each achievement score SC3 and LC3 combined had lower model R2 than BYS44M, BYS44G and BYS44C (BYS44F instead of BYS44C for math score). Again, individual items had higher predictive power than composites. The results suggested that the analysis might have been influenced by the difference in the response to the reversed score items and possible failure by the respondents to recognize the repeated shifts to and from the reversed score questions: The reversed score items always grouped together, thus making the presence of BYS44k in self-concept questionable (it might be only due to the inflated correlation among consistent direction questions). b) BYS44I, BYS44J, BYS44L (which dropped out of self-concept) came directly after reversed score question BYS44H and were split by reverse score question BYS44K. Even though psychometricians have used reversed items to avoid \"response set\", in the minds of the respondents it adds confusion and perhaps these items should be tried out with consistent direction (all positive or negative) or at least arranged in two separate groups. Individual items used in a stepwise regression produced significantly better prediction for the achievement scores than the composites: thus it is suggested that the separate items should be used if predictive power is the most important goal."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This analysis evaluated the SES composite used in NELS in terms of the method of construction, items used in the composite construction, predictive power of the composites (validity) and reliability (for the new composites Household items list was used instead of income: if more than seven household questions were answered they were averaged.

At the same time the correlations between BYSES, SES1 and SES2 and the achievement scores were so close (maximum difference <1.5%) that none of the composites could be deemed the best on the predictive power merit only. One of the more desirable properties of the SES composite is simplicity of calculation. Both SES1 and SES2 do not involve data collection on parents occupation and do not require any recoding and therefore have clear advantages over using BYSES. In addition SES1 and SES2 use available data items more efficiently than BYSES by substituting student items for missing parent items when possible. Another issue that should be addressed is the number of students for whom the composite items are available. The most important items in the composites come from the parents questionnaire. Eight percent of the students did not have any parent questionnaire information available. As a result approximately seven percent of the students had the SES2 composite based on household items only. At the same time the BYSES composite utilized parent occupation information. That explains why the correlation with achievement scores using pairwise deletion is slightly higher for BYSES than for SES2 with a maximum difference of <3.4%. Reliability of SES1 and SES2 composites were essentially the same; consequently SES2 seemed to be the most efficient SES composite. Correlation coefficients in the sample stratified by race showed the correlations for Hispanic and Black students were lower than the correlations for the overall sample. This may indicate that the SES composite for these two groups might be constructed or interpreted separately. In addition, stepwise regressions indicated that the composites BYSES, SES1 and SES2 were almost as good predictors as the individual items.
