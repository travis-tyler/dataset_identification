Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is an established method for biomarkersupported diagnosis of AD and is now widely used [1] ; it is now a valid tool for supporting a diagnosis of not only clinical but also preclinical AD [2] . Until now, a widely used method of quantifying amyloid load has been to estimate uptake in a target cortical region on PET, and using a threshold as a means of interpreting positivity. However, this amyloid PET approach may not properly utilize the full amount of regional information available.\nAccording to pathological A\u03b2 Thal staging [3] , the deposition of A\u03b2 plaques starts in the neocortex (phase 1) and limbic area (phase 2), then extends down into subcortical structures (striatum and amygdala, phase 3), brainstem (phase 4) and cerebellum (phase 5). In pathologic studies, presence of amyloid plaques in the striatum predicts higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage [4] and greater prevalence of dementia and clinicopathological AD [5, 6] . The presence of striatal plaques was also correlated with lower scores on several neuropsychological tests assessing memory [7] .\nUntil now, it was unknown whether amyloid PET uptake [8] might also show the A\u03b2 spreading pattern defined by neuropathology. In particular, previous studies suggest that there are methodological difficulties in using PET to conduct amyloid staging in vivo according to the pathologic amyloid staging criteria. Specifically, increased uptake in the hippocampus corresponding to Thal 2 is hard to detect, because prominent atrophy in AD patients can hinder proper quantification [8] . The brainstem and cerebellum, corresponding to Thal 4 and 5, have also been widely used as reference regions for analyzing target amyloid uptake. Furthermore, compared to cortical regions, subcortical regions corresponding to Thal 3 have a more diffuse form of amyloid plaques [3] which might present differently on in vivo A\u03b2 PET imaging [9] .\nRecently, advances in neuroimaging techniques have enabled the delineation of human subcortical structures from T1-weighted MR images, and this morphometric analysis has been successfully employed in AD [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, surface-based 3D modeling of subcortical structures makes it possible to investigate local atrophy in human subcortical structures, including thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, globus pallidus, and hippocampus [13, 14] . When MR measures like surface-based segmentation of subcortical structures are aligned with amyloid PET images, they can enable the measurement of A\u03b2 deposition more sensitively, which can lead to more accurate analysis of subcortical regional amyloid involvement in vivo.\nIn the present study, we investigated the spreading order of amyloid based on involvement in subcortical structures, and the effects of amyloid spread on clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that amyloid imaging would show increased amyloid uptake first in neocortex, then followed by subcortical structures including amygdala and striatum, following an in vivo staging scheme similar to pathological A\u03b2 Thal phase. We further hypothesized that in vivo amyloid staging based on subcortical involvement would be reflective of not only structural and functional disease progression, measured by hippocampal atrophy and FDG hypometabolism, but also clinical deterioration, measured by MMSE and ADAS-Cog13, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "All data used in the present study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

First, we sorted seven regions (global cortex, putamen, caudate, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus and pallidum) in descending order by the number of participants whose regional Z score values were > 1.5 for each region. In addition, participants were staged by the degree of regional involvement.\nTo assess differences in regional involvement frequency across these regions, we used a bootstrapping method with 1000 resamples in R v3.4.1 (Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Vienna, Austria; www.R-project.org) to derive the estimates of 95% confidence intervals and standard error.

First, we found that amyloid accumulated first in neocortex and then in subcortical structures, suggesting that amyloid has a downward spreading pattern. Second, even among amyloid-positive patients, those with subcortical involvement (stage 2) showed worse cognitive impairment than those without subcortical involvement (stage 1). Finally, patients with subcortical involvement (stage 2) revealed steeper cognitive decline compared to those without subcortical involvement (stage 1). Taken together, our findings suggest that in vivo amyloid imaging enables the staging of amyloid burden in living patients according to subcortical involvement, and that subcortical amyloid predicts worse clinical outcomes. Our first major finding was that amyloid accumulated first in neocortex and then in subcortical structures, suggesting that amyloid has a downward spreading pattern. Previous studies suggest that there are methodological difficulties in using PET to conduct amyloid staging in vivo based on involvement of subcortical regions. However, our finding is in line with recent studies showing that in vivo amyloid staging was possible and that the striatum was the last deposition region [21, 22] . In particular, we found that thalamus and pallidum, which are subcortical structures that are not part of Thal phase 3, were the last spreading regions of amyloid. Our staging strategy based on subcortical amyloid deposition also showed a highly consistent deposition pattern across participants, allowing us to classify 98.8% (750/759) of participants into any of the three successive amyloid stages. Therefore, the PETmeasured amyloid deposition indicated a predictable regional sequence that enabled in vivo staging analogous to established neuropathologic approaches for staging amyloid.\nOur second major finding was that even if patients were amyloid positive, patients with subcortical involvement (stage 2) showed worse cognitive impairment than those without subcortical involvement (stage 1). Specially, we found that AD patients were more commonly included in higher stages while cognitively normal individuals were more common in lower stages. Therefore, consistent with previous pathological studies, we showed that involvement of amyloid plaques both in cortical and subcortical structures is more strongly associated with presence of dementia [5, 23] or cognitive impairment [21] than amyloid in the cortex alone. Our findings suggest that subcortical amyloid deposition and a higher in vivo amyloid stage signify an advanced disease course. This could also be supported by a recent study with Parkinson's disease (PD) patients [24] , which showed that in PD, the combined presence of striatal and cortical amyloid deposition is associated with greater cognitive impairment than cortical amyloidopathy alone.\nOur final major finding was that longitudinal analyses revealed that patients with stage 2 amyloid involvement had steeper cognitive decline and functional and structural deterioration, indexed by FDG PET and hippocampal volumes, than stage 0 and 1 patients. There are several studies predicting faster decline in MCI or AD patients using imaging markers, including measures of amyloid, cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and glucose hypometabolism [25, 26] . There have been recent reports that amyloid-positive people show more rapid cognitive decline [27, 28] . However, little research has been done to determine if fast decline can be predicted based on the distribution of amyloid among amyloid-positive participants. A recent work suggested that striatal involvement of amyloid predicted subsequent cognitive decline [22] . Additionally, we found that patients with subcortical involvement of amyloid had steeper functional and structural brain changes than those without subcortical involvement of amyloid. These results suggest that it is important to investigate subcortical amyloid involvement when interpreting amyloid PET.\nThe reason why subcortical amyloid pathology might be associated with more severe cognitive decline has not been extensively investigated. However, there are several possible hypotheses. In the present study, compared to patients without subcortical involvement (stage 1), patients with subcortical involvement (stage 2) showed more cortical amyloid burden, hypometabolism and hippocampal atrophy. Therefore, our results suggest that subcortical involvement of amyloid might affect cognitive decline through several processes, including greater cortical amyloid burden and functional and structural changes.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, we used a cutoff Z score of 1.5 to determine regional amyloid involvement, which may have affected our results; however, our sensitivity analyses (eTable 4) showed that similar results were obtained regardless of threshold used, thus mitigating this limitation. Second, there were nine unstageable CN and MCI participants who showed subcortical amyloid involvement without cortical amyloid involvement, but this was only 1.2% of the sample. Previous studies of patients with certain presenilin-1 mutations [29] or amyloid precursor protein gene duplication showed predominantly striatal increases in [ 11 C] PIB uptake even in cognitively normal mutation carriers. More research should be done to understand these predominantly striatal patterns of amyloid deposition. Third, we could not include cerebellum among the staging regions because we used cerebellum as a reference region. Hippocampus was also not included in our amyloid staging scheme because hippocampal uptake can be prominently affected by atrophy and hard to detect. Fourth, we used a common regional cutoff value, but future research should investigate possible region-specific cutoffs for amyloid staging. Finally, our percentage of amyloid involvement in subcortical regions in CN participants (13.8%) seems to be higher than those reported by previous studies (7% [21] or 8% [22] ). The percentage of amyloid negative AD (Stage 0; 17.5%) seems to be slightly higher compared to those of previous studies (11% [21] or 12% [22] ). This discrepancy might be related to differences in imaging analysis methods. However, we think that our analyses have an advantage in segmenting subcortical structures [18] . Specifically, the previous studies employed the volume-based segmentation methods, while in this study we applied a surface-based method to delineate the subcortical structures. Even with these limitations, by measuring subcortical amyloid SUVR, we can predict whether or not a patient is at an advanced point in the evolution of disease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In vivo amyloid imaging enables us to stage amyloid burden in living patients according to degree of subcortical involvement, and subcortical involvement predicts worse clinical outcomes.
