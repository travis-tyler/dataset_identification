[{"section_title": "Cross-cohort (or intercohort) comparison and analysis:", "text": "The HSLS:09 base-year survey is not precisely comparable in timing or grade cohort definition to the prior studies, which involved spring data collections for 8th-, 10th-, or 12thgrade students. The HSLS:09 cohort definition is based on a single grade (9th grade) at a single point in time (fall term of 2009), reflecting also requirements that baseyear schools encompass both 9th and 11th grade. Although the high school transcripts capture 4 years of high school coursetaking, because HSLS:09 has no 12th-grade freshening, HSLS:09 high school transcripts cannot be compared to the NELS:88, ELS:2002, and NAEP high school transcript studies, all of which are anchored to high school seniors. Some longitudinal intercohort comparison is possible at a higher level of generality, however-that is, not based on a specific comparison grade-that encompasses modeling the transition from high school to postsecondary education and the workforce, which is the subject of all the secondary longitudinal studies."}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional analysis:", "text": "A cross-sectional design represents events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional survey may measure the cumulative educational attainment (achievements, attitudes, statuses) of students at a particular stage of schooling, such as the beginning of ninth grade. Crosssectional analysis in HSLS:09 can only be conducted for the base year (either at the student level or the school level). In contrast, a longitudinal study (or repeated measurement of the same sample units) measures the change or growth in educational attainments that occurs over a particular period of schooling. (See also Longitudinal or panel study and Cross-cohort comparison and analysis.) Data swapping: Data swapping is defined in the NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2014) as a perturbation disclosure limitation technique that results in a \"confidentiality\" edit. An example of a need for data swapping would be to assume that a data file has two variables which in combination constitute a disclosure risk, for example, sex and age. If a sample case needs disclosure protection, it is paired with another sampled case so that each element of the pair has the same age, but different sexes. The data on these two records are then swapped. After the swapping, anyone thinking they have identified either one of the paired cases gets the data of the other case, so they have not made an accurate match and the data have been protected. (See also Confidentiality protections.) Design effect: The design effect (deff) is a measure of sample efficiency and is the variance of an estimate accounting for the complex nature of a survey design divided by the variance of the estimate that would have occurred if a sample of the same size had been selected using simple random sampling. Historically, the deff was used to adjust a variance estimate calculated with software that could not properly account for the sample design. More recently, the deff calculated for a set of study characteristics is used to compare the sample efficiency across surveys. Sometimes it is more useful to work with standard errors than with variances. The root design effect (deft) expresses the relation between the actual standard error of an estimate and the standard error of the corresponding estimates from a simple random sample. Disability: A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities (Title 42 U.S.C. Section 12102)."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure risk analysis:", "text": "This involves investigation of study data to evaluate and minimize the risk of identification of individual sample units to preserve the confidentiality of the data. HSLS:09 data have been subjected to a disclosure risk analysis to protect confidential information about individual respondents. For a more detailed account of disclosure risk analysis, and of means of altering data (including masking, data perturbation, and data swapping) to prevent disclosure, see the current NCES Statistical Standards document. (See also Confidentiality protections, Data swapping, and Public-use data file.)"}, {"section_title": "Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002)", "text": ": ELS:2002 is the immediate predecessor study to HSLS:09 within the series of NCES Secondary Longitudinal Studies. It began with spring high school sophomores in 2002, with follow-up studies in 2004 (with freshening to create a senior cohort), 2006, and 2012. In addition to interview data, postsecondary education transcripts were collected (and high school transcripts were collected) for the ELS:2002 cohorts. URL: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/."}, {"section_title": "Electronic codebook (ECB):", "text": "The ECB serves as an electronic version of a fully documented survey codebook. It allows the data user to browse through all variables contained on the data files; search variable and value names for keywords related to particular research questions; review the question and item response wording; examine the definitions and logic used to develop composite and classification variables; and export SAS, SPSS, or Stata syntax programs for statistical analysis. The ECB also provides a display of the distribution of counts and percentages for each variable in the dataset. Analysts can use the ECB to select or \"tag\" variables of interest, export codebooks that display the distributions of the tagged variables, and generate program code (including variable and value labels) that can be used with the analyst's own statistical software. The ECB is designed to run in a Windows environment on the user's computer and is available only to users who have obtained a restricted-use license and are approved to receive the ECB for their research purposes. (See also Restricted-use data file.) High School and Beyond (HS&B): HS&B is the second in the series of longitudinal high school cohort studies sponsored by NCES. The HS&B base-year study surveyed sophomore and senior students in 1980. The sophomore cohort was postsecondary institutions that participate in Title IV federal student financial aid programs. IPEDS collects data on institution characteristics, enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid. Item nonresponse: Item nonresponse is defined as a missing response to a particular question item on an instrument when a valid response was expected. For example, a participant did not wish to provide income information and therefore left the question item unanswered (blank). Item nonresponse is generally limited to the set of sample members who have been classified as respondents by providing, for example, responses to key questionnaire items required for analysis. (See also Nonresponse bias analysis and Unit nonresponse.) Locale codes: In earlier NCES secondary longitudinal studies, locale codes have been referred to as metropolitan status or urbanicity codes (for example, urbanicity trichotomized into three values-urban, suburban, or rural). The former codes were metrocentric (that is, based on metropolitan statistical areas). The HSLS:09 locale codes, however, use NCES's new urbancentric codes. The new urbancentric locale codes follow the same logic as the older locale codes, but incorporate an approach that prioritizes population size and proximity to an urbanized area in assigning locale. The highest level (four terms) of the new locale code system was used in HSLS:09 school sampling to create substrata (with geography as superstrata). The four major categories are city (large or mid-size city), suburban (urban fringe of large or mid-size city), town (large or small), and rural (outside or inside a Core-Based Statistical Area). Although HSLS:09 uses only the four major or highest categories, each of the four categories is further subdivided in the NCES geocode scheme (for example, \"town\" comprises three statuses in relation to an urbanized area: fringe, distant, or remote from an urbanized area). Longitudinal or panel study: In a longitudinal design, similar measurements-of the same sample of individuals, institutions, households, or of some other defined unit-are taken at multiple time points. HSLS:09 employs a longitudinal design that follows the same individuals over time and permits the analysis of individual-level change. (See also Cross-sectional analysis.) Microdata (microrecords): These are observations of individual sample members, such as those contained on the HSLS:09 public-use and restricted-use data files. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): NAEP is a crosssectional assessment program that measures achievement at the group level for students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades and provides a time series for measuring trends in academic progress of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. The HSLS:09 assessment differs \u2022 -1 = Item-missing, don't know: Used when a respondent indicated \"Don't know\" as a response. \u2022 -2 = Placeholder record: Used to hold a place for a record with an unknown amount of missing data. For example, if no academic terms are reported, one placeholder record is included in the term file, though the number of terms in which the student was enrolled is unknown. \u2022 -3 = Implied \"No\" or zero: Used when the item was left blank by the respondent, but based on other responses, the missing value is implied to be a \"No\" or a zero. \u2022 -4 = Item missing, unable to determine applicability: Used for a nested item when the associated gate item is left blank. \u2022 -5 = Data suppressed: Used on the student-level and school-level public-use data files to suppress data. \u2022 -6 = Out of range: Used when the value reported by the institution was outside the valid range for that field. \u2022 -7 = Item-missing, not applicable: Used for questions that are not applicable based on information already known from a prior answer or another data source. \u2022 -8 = Unit-missing: Used for all student-level variables when a sample member is a nonrespondent to either PETS or SR. \u2022 -9 = Item-missing, response not provided: Used for questions that are not answered within a survey when the respondent was eligible for the question."}, {"section_title": "Response rate (weighted):", "text": "In general, unit response rates are calculated as the ratio of the weighted number of completed instruments to the weighted number of eligible (in-scope) sample units, using the sample base weight (i.e., the inverse of the selection probability). In multistage samples, such as HSLS:09, overall studentlevel response is the product of both stages (although, for many purposes, the stages are reported separately). Item response rates are calculated as the weighted ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained to the number of respondents who are asked to answer a given item. More detailed information can be found by consulting NCES Standard 1-3 in the NCES Statistical Standard document (Seastrom 2014). Bias analyses conducted when response rates are below targets help to assess any possible limitations to the generalizability of survey estimates. (See also Nonresponse bias analysis.) Restricted-use data file: A restricted-use data file includes individually identifiable information that is confidential and protected by law. The basic strategy for HSLS:09 public-versus restricted-use file construction was to include the variables with limited disclosure treatment on the restricted-use file, and to modify or suppress values for these same variables on the public-use version. Use of the restricted data requires the researcher to obtain a special license from NCES. (See also Public-use data file, Disclosure risk analysis, and Electronic codebook.) Round: A round is a single implementation of the survey within the larger longitudinal survey (e.g., the base year and each successive follow-up are each rounds of data collection). instrument was used to collect data on school and teacher characteristics (including teacher qualifications and experience) and some classroom-level information. Unlike in the NELS:88 and ELS:2002 teacher surveys, no direct teacher ratings or evaluations of specific sampled students were sought, and the names of the sampled students were kept anonymous. Unit nonresponse: Unit nonresponse is the failure of a survey unit (e.g., at the institutional level, a school, or at the individual level, a respondent, such as a student or a teacher) to cooperate or complete a survey instrument. Overall unit nonresponse reflects a combination of unit nonresponse across two or more levels of data collection, where participation at the second stage of data collection is conditional upon participation in the first stage of data collection. In HSLS:09, overall nonresponse is the product of school-level nonresponse and student nonresponse. Total item nonresponse reflects a combination of the overall unit nonresponse and item nonresponse. (See also Item nonresponse and Nonresponse bias.) Variance estimation: Variance estimation is the measure of the variability of a statistic and includes the standard error and error variance. Two procedures for estimating variance of survey statistics in HSLS:09 are the BRR (balanced repeated replication) and Taylor series. BRR (available on both the public-use and restricteduse files) is recommended for HSLS:09 data. (See also Balanced repeated replication and Taylor series linearization.) Weighted estimates: Weighted estimates are survey estimates generated from survey data that have been statistically weighted (multiplied) by factors reflecting the sample design. The general purpose of weighting is to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection into the sample and to adjust for the fact that not all schools or individuals selected into the sample participated. (See also Analytic weights.) White: A White person is one having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. The primary source of race/ethnicity categorization in HSLS:09 was respondent self-identification."}, {"section_title": "Item name Label / Wording Section: Institution Information", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BEARLY", "text": "Later, you will be asked to provide data for your sampled students in the following areas: General Student Information, Enrollment, Budget, and Financial Aid.

One way in which we collect data is through postsecondary-level sample surveys, many of which require that we work with U.S. institutions to collect transcripts and student records for student samples. We will also interview students themselves, who provide much-needed information on their experiences as they begin, leave, and re-enter postsecondary study, transfer between institutions, and complete programs at all levels of institutions. The combination of institution-and student-provided data affords researchers the opportunity to fully characterize the paths taken by today's college students, and provides them an important link between academic experiences, performance, and outcomes. Recognizing that NCES data collection requests add to the workload of institution staff tasked with providing the requested data, and that several of NCES' postsecondary studies require that data be collected from institutions, NCES developed the secure Postsecondary Data Portal (PDP) website. The PDP is now the single location through which institutions will provide data required by any and all NCES postsecondary sample-based data collections. In addition, to the extent possible, studies running through the PDP will be requesting the same types of data for all selected students, further simplifying the data collection process. Institution staff will only need to learn the layout and functionality of one system, instead of having to learn a different system for every study. The user friendly PDP (https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/Portal/) offers institutions several modes for providing data; an institution may choose its preferred method(s). Each data entry module is password-protected, so users will be required to log in before they are allowed access to confidential data and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is in place to encrypt data transmitted over the Internet through the PDP website. NCES has contracted with RTI International (RTI) to carry out the institution data collections for several ongoing postsecondary studies. Your cooperation with RTI is greatly appreciated. Please be on the lookout for a request for data. The request packet will provide further detail and instructions.

The High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is a nationally representative, longitudinal study following a cohort of students who were in ninth grade during the 2009-2010 school year. The study focuses on understanding how high school experiences affect young adults' learning and their education and career choices over time.

The set of sample members fielded for the second follow-up is defined in section 2.4. 3. Deceased sample members were excluded from derivation of all unknown eligibility and nonresponse adjustments but were included in the derivation of every calibration adjustment. 4. The PETS and SR weights are defined at the student-level and generalize to subsets of the HSLS:09 base-year student population as described in section 5.2. 5. The definition for PETS eligibility differs from the definition for SR eligibility as defined in section 5.2 and subsection 5.3.1.2. 6. Within this appendix, any reference to a student having attended a postsecondary institution indicates that the student attended an IPEDS-participating postsecondary institution as of June 20, 2017. 7. Within the section for each weight, the numbers next to the w indicate the stage of weight adjustment. For example, w 4hij in the section E.1 is the weight resulting from the fourth weight adjustment used to construct W5PSTRANS. The unknown eligibility, nonresponse, and calibration weight adjustments are defined in equation form for both the postsecondary transcript weights: W5PSTRANS and W5W1W2W3W4PSTRANS, and both the student records weights: W5PSRECORDS and W5W1W2W3W4PSRECORDS."}, {"section_title": "By what authority does NCES collect this information?", "text": "Congress has authorized (20 U.S.C. \u00a79543) the National Center for Education Statistics ( You or someone on your staff will be able to provide data for your selected students through the secure NCES Postsecondary Data Portal (PDP), located at: https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/portal.

The HSLS:09 sample includes more than 23,000 young adults who first took part in this study as 9th graders in the fall term of 2009. We ask that institution staff provide student record information (e.g., enrollment status, aid package received) for HSLS:09 participants who attended the institution. Data are provided through a web interface over the secure NCES postsecondary data portal website-either by data entry, uploading electronic data files, or a combination of both. The user friendly web interface for data entry and file upload has been developed to minimize the burden on institutional staff in providing student record data."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Data Collection", "text": "HSLS:09 is designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young people as they progress through high school and onto postsecondary education and/or the world of work. The study has collected data on young people in high school from multiple perspectives and follows them on many pathways. Because it draws on respondent survey information as well as administrative records, HSLS:09 is able to provide information on many possible outcomes of secondary education. The HSLS:09 student records collection, which includes financial aid received and enrollment status for each year attended, will provide data for longitudinal analysis of financial aid records. This will allow examination of borrowing and debt trends over time, as well as the effects of those trends on postsecondary persistence and attainment, and decisions about work and family. The Postsecondary Data Portal (PDP) is a website that was created with input from institutions like yours! By taking advantage of the PDP, you can help NCES collect data on students in our sample studies (e.g., NPSAS, BPS, B&B, HSLS). These data provide much-needed information on vital concerns to students, families, policymakers, and the academic community.

The tuition as reported by institutions was the primary source, edited and adjusted for attendance status if necessary. That is, if the school did not report the exact tuition and fee amount charged to the student (R5YTUITFEECHG), the reported budgeted tuition (R5YBUDTUITFEE) was adjusted as needed to match the student's enrollment status (number of months enrolled full-or part-time). If tuition data were not available from institutions, tuition data were taken from the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics data collection corresponding with the student's primary first year and adjusted as needed to match the student's enrollment status (number of months enrolled full-or part-time). For example, if full-time full-year tuition was reported by the institution or in IPEDS, and the student was only enrolled for full-time for half the year, the tuition amount was adjusted down to represent full-time, half-year enrollment. Finally, if tuition amounts were not available from the institution or from IPEDS, the value was imputed using the group mean when grouping records by sector, attendance status, and residency for tuition purposes.
