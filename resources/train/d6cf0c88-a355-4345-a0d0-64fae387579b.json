DTI was\u02c6rst reported by Basser in 1994. 1 Water molecules diffuse freely along nerve\u02c6ber tracts, but di\u0160usion is restricted in other directions. This directional dependence, called anisotropic di\u0160usion, is described mathematically by a tensor, which is often represented as an ellipsoid. The directions of the main axes of the ellipsoid are given by eigenvectors (e 1 , e 2 , e 3 ), and their lengths are represented by the corresponding eigenvalues (l 1 , l 2 , l 3 ) of the di\u0160usion tensor. 2 Di\u0160usion tensor analysis enables reconstruction of nerve\u02c6ber tracts and quanti\u02c6cation of the anisotropy of white matter. Di\u0160usion tensor tractography (DTT) is the assessment of\u02c6ber tracts based on DTI and provides attractive tools for visualizing white matter tracts, such as color mapping and\u02c6ber assignment by continuous tracking. 3 Images of nerve\u02c6bers obtained by DTT show good correspondence with clinical symptoms or histological changes, and white matter areas related to psychiatric diseases, such as the cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, cerebral fornix, and corpus callosum, can be identi\u02c6ed relatively easily using DTT.\nThe 4 parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean di\u0160usivity (MD), radial di\u0160usivity (RD), and axial di\u0160usivity (AD) are quanti\u02c6ed by eigenvalues (l 1 , l 2 , l 3 ). The l 1 value corresponds to AD and decreases when axons are damaged by ischemia or other insults, whereas the average value of l 2 and l 3 corresponds to RD and increases in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis. 4 FA is quanti\u02c6ed by a speci\u02c6c square root of l 1 , l 2 , and l 3 values and re\u2030ects pathological conditions that a\u0160ect the integrity of nerve\u02c6bers.\nDi\u0160usion tensor analysis has been applied to clinical examination and research since the mid-1990s. In 1999, Lim and associates con\u02c6rmed lower anisotropy of white matter by this technique in 10 patients with schizophrenia despite the absence of a de\u02c6cit in white matter volume. 5 There were few reports about di\u0160usion tensor analysis in the 1990s, but the number increased to over a thousand ones in 2010. Thus, di\u0160usion tensor analysis is now well established as an analytical tool for brain imaging.

ROI analysis, used when a study focuses on a particular brain region, allows detailed examination of selected regions with measurement of absolute values and targeting of speci\u02c6c tracts drawn by DTT. However, the placement of ROIs should be guided by clear criteria based on anatomical information to minimize intra-and inter-rater variability. In addition, ROI analysis is time-consuming and requires practice to achieve adequate reliability. 6 VBA is useful for identifying regions with di\u0160erent di\u0160usion parameters among groups when researchers do not have a working hypothesis regarding a speci\u02c6c brain region, even though validation is required for spatial normalization, segmentation, smoothing of kernel size, correction for multiple comparisons, and the extent threshold. In statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), the most widely used VBA package, a subject's di\u0160usion images are registered in a standard space, and the registered data is smoothed for group or correlational analysis. However, VBA is less sensitive than ROI analysis for quanti\u02c6cation because spatial normalization can be imperfect and some residual morphometric di\u0160erences may persist. 7 These di\u0160erences are not seen with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) (Oxford University, Nu\u2039eld Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UK), another software package, that attempts to avoid such problems completely by using a``mean FA skeleton'' to represent the centers of\u02c6bers that are common to all humans. 7 "}, {"section_title": "Di\u0160usion Tensor Imaging in Psychiatric Disorders", "text": "Over the past few decades, the rapid growth of MR imaging research into psychiatric disorders has resulted in the linking of signs and symptoms of various psychiatric diseases with speci\u02c6c structural or functional brain abnormalities, as discussed hereafter for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders."}, {"section_title": "Schizophrenia", "text": "Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with structural abnormalities of the brain that are detectable by MR imaging. Pooled analysis of 15 voxel-based morphometric studies revealed a decrease in the volume of the left superior temporal gyrus and left medial temporal lobe in patients with schizophrenia as well as a reduction in the volume of the right anterior cingulate gyrus in patients with their\u02c6rst episode. 8 In patients with recurrent schizophrenia, a voxel-based morphometric study identi\u02c6ed alterations extending into the left superior temporal gyrus and left medial temporal lobe in addition to bilateral loss of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia, suggesting a progression of the brain abnormalities over time. 9 Moreover, DTI revealed severe white matter disruption in the temporolimbic region, including the cingulum, as well as in the frontotemporal region (uncinate fasciculus), parietotemporal region (arcuate fasciculus), and corpus callosum region. 10 The fornix houses major projections of the hippocampus to and from other brain regions. DTI has detected a signi\u02c6cant reduction of FA in the fornix of the left hemisphere and a signi\u02c6cant increase in the MD of the fornix bilaterally in patients with schizophrenia, suggest-ing a correlation between the disrupted integrity of the fornix and memory organization. 11 In the early stage of the\u02c6rst episode of schizophrenia, MD shows a signi\u02c6cant increase in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left insula, and right anterior cingulate gyrus without any reduction of brain volume or abnormalities of FA, so MD seems to be a useful marker for early schizophrenia. 12 This hypothesis is consistent with the result of another DTI investigation of a large cohort of patients with\u02c6rst-episode schizophrenia, which con\u02c6rmed a reduction of FA in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus alone. 13 Patients with schizophrenia also demonstrate abnormalities of the semantic network, which are identi\u02c6ed by DTI analysis as a decrease of signi\u02c6cant FA in the left inferior frontal white matter and are revealed by functional MR imaging as weaker connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. 14 Furthermore, in a 15-month study of youths (mean age: 17.02\u00b13.37) at high risk for psychosis, TBSSbased ROI analysis revealed a signi\u02c6cant relationship between lower baseline FA values in the medial temporal lobe and inferior longitudinal fasciculus and deterioration of social and role functioning, whereas the normal progressive increase of FA with age was not seen. 15 In a multimodal imaging study of patients with chronic schizophrenia, DTI revealed a signi\u02c6cant reduction of FA in the anterior part of the corpus callosum, DTT analysis detected a signi\u02c6cant di\u0160erence of connectivity between the genu of the corpus callosum and the medial prefrontal cortex, and functional MR imaging showed signi\u02c6cant failure of deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex compared with healthy controls. Thus, the medial prefrontal cortex has been identied as a prominent site of abnormalities in chronic schizophrenia. 16 "}, {"section_title": "Bipolar Disorder", "text": "Pooled analysis of the results of 141 MR imaging studies of structural brain abnormalities has shown increased volumes of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle and decreased cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in patients with bipolar disorder. 17 Volumetric studies have generally revealed regional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, medial temporal cortex, and limbic structures. A common and important change seen in bipolar disorder is a decrease in the volume of the anterior cingulate cortex. 18 Medial temporal structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and striatum, have extensive connections to the prefrontal cortex. Increased volume of the amygdala and striatum and normal hippocampal volume have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder. 19 Another study found enlargement of the striatum in adolescents with bipolar disorder with either their\u02c6rst or multiple episodes. 20 DTI studies employing ROI methods have revealed a signi\u02c6cant decrease of FA in the prefrontal white matter, 21 increased FA in the midline of the genu of the corpus callosum, 22 and an increase of the apparent di\u0160u-sion coe\u2039cient (ADC) in the bilateral orbital frontal white matter 23 of patients with bipolar disorder. These changes suggest the presence of anatomic disconnectivity in the frontal-subcortical circuits. In addition, a DTT study has revealed a signi\u02c6cant increase of reconstructed\u02c6bers in the subgenual cingulate and amygdalo-hippocampal complex of patients with euthymic bipolar disorder relative to controls, suggesting alteration of the white matter pathway between the left subgenual cingulate and the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. 24 The\u02c6rst DT analysis performed by TBSS in subjects with bipolar disorder revealed that an increase of FA in the left uncinate fasciculus and a decrease of FA in the right uncinate fasciculus probably re\u2030ected abnormal right versus left asymmetry with regard to the alignment of\u02c6bers in the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, which might be associated with mood disregulation. 25 A meta-analysis of DTI studies of bipolar disorder identi\u02c6ed 2 clusters of decreased FA in the right brain. The\u02c6rst is located in the right parahippocampal white matter crossed by the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and posterior thalamic radiations. This might be associated with alterations in the identi\u02c6cation of facial emotion. The second cluster of decreased FA is near the right anterior and subgenual cingulate cortex, and this might account for functional abnormalities underlying abnormal emotional processing and altered functional connectivity in bipolar disorder. 26 "}, {"section_title": "Major Depressive Disorder", "text": "Most MR imaging features of bipolar disorder and major depression overlap, so interpretation is di\u2039cult. The prefrontal cortex and anterior limbic structures are important brain areas in relation to altered emotional processing and cognitive disturbances that occur in major depression as well as in bipolar disorder. The majority of volumetric MR studies have revealed loss of gray matter and volume reduction in subregions of the prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus in patients of all ages. 27, 28 Alterations of limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuits underlie the onset of depression in both bipolar disorder and major depression. 29 The decrease of hippocampal volume in patients with major depression is considered to arise from increased apoptosis of glutamatergic neurons, which is caused by hypercortisolemia due to hyperfunction of the hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or adrenal glands. Stresses, such as job loss and marital con\u2030ict, are acquired risk factors that can stimulate the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal axis to induce depression. 30 A DTI study showed that treatment-na\u00e4 \u0192ve young adults with their\u02c6rst episode of major depressive disorder had signi\u02c6cantly lower FA in the white matter of the right middle frontal gyrus and left lateral occipitotemporal gyrus as well as in the subgyral white matter of the right parietal lobe and white matter of the right angular gyrus. 31 This was the\u02c6rst exploration of the white matter of the whole brain by VBA with SPM2 software, and the results suggested that white matter abnormalities are present early in the course of major depressive disorder. 31 A similar study by VBA with the TBSS software package of treatment-na\u00e4 \u0192ve young adult patients (mean age: 20.55\u00b11.86) with their\u02c6rst episode of major depression revealed a decrease of FA in the left anterior limb of the internal capsule, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left posterior cingulate cortex and showed that FA values for the left anterior limb of the internal capsule were negatively correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. 32 Geriatric patients with major depression demonstrate a decrease of FA in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and di\u0160use frontal and temporal regions compared with non-depressed controls. 33 This report is consistent with the results of another study comparing geriatric patients with or without remission of depression. 34 Also, a DTI study of patients with major depression who had attempted suicide found a signi\u02c6cant decrease of FA in the left anterior limb of the internal capsule relative to those patients without suicide attempts and normal subjects, \u00e2 nding which might eventually assist with the development of e\u0160ective strategies for suicide prevention in patients with major depressive disorders. 35 The\u02c6rst study that simultaneously compared cerebral volume and di\u0160usion data between patients with major depression and normal controls by VBA with SPM5 software revealed that compared with controls, the depressed subjects had signi\u02c6cantly smaller volumes of the right parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex as well as higher MD values in the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, prefrontal cortices, left uncus, pons, and cerebellum. 36 In addition, FA in the bilateral prefrontal areas showed a weak negative correlation with the total duration of depression, so these\u02c6ndings suggested that volumetric and di\u0160usional abnormalities occur in distinct tissue compartments of speci\u02c6c brain subregions, especially in the frontal areas, in patients with depression. 36 A recent meta-analysis of DTI studies identi\u02c6ed 4 consistent sites of decreased FA in patients with major depressive disorder-the white matter in the right frontal lobe, the right fusiform gyrus, the left frontal lobe, and the right occipital lobe. Fibertracking studies showed that the main fascicules involved were the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, right posterior thalamic radiation, and interhemispheri\u0109 bers running through the genu and body of the corpus callosum. 37 "}, {"section_title": "Anxiety Disorders", "text": "Anxiety disorders are classi\u02c6ed into 5 main subgroups according to the National Institute of Mental Health: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Volumetric MR imaging studies have revealed a decrease in the volume of the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and hippocampus in patients with anxiety disorders, although these volumes are in\u2030uenced by medication status, disease duration/severity, MR imaging technique, post-processing method, age, and gender. 38 In particular, a decrease in the volume of gray matter in the left cingulate cortex has been found in persons with PTSD as a result of the Tokyo subway sarin terror attack compared with subjects without PTSD, and this reduction of the cingulate gray matter volume is signi\u02c6cantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms. 39 In addition, VBA has revealed an increase of FA in the left anterior cingulum in persons with PTSD after the sarin attack. 40 Another study of workers with PTSD after a coal mining accident found an increase of FA values in the left superior frontal gyrus compared with age-matched healthy controls, whereas GAD was associated with elevation of FA in the right postcentral gyrus relative to control levels, and FA was reduced in the right anterior cingulate gyrus of patients with PTSD compared with patients with GAD. 41 In young adults exposed to parental verbal abuse, analysis with TBSS identi\u02c6ed 3 white matter tract regions with signi\u02c6cantly reduced FA: the left superior temporal gyrus and\u02c6bers from the arcuate fasciculus, the left fusiform gyrus adjacent to the Decreased or increased FA in the cingulum bundle (33, (40) (41) (42) posterior part of the tail of the hippocampus and bers from the cingulum bundle, and the left body of the fornix. 42 In these areas, FA was strongly associated with the average parental verbal abuse scores and level of maternal verbal abuse. 42 Discussion DTI is a sophisticated MR imaging technique increasingly used to evaluate abnormalities of the white matter to make a di\u0160erential diagnosis of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder, all of which feature abnormalities of FA. 2 Table 2 summarizes DTI\u02c6ndings in these diseases. DTI is also used for quantitative evaluation of disease status or severity and to monitor response to treatment. The application of DTI in these areas is likely to expand in the future. However, several factors can produce heterogeneity of MR imaging data that subsequently leads to incorrect results. First, patient characteristics, such as gender, medications, IQ, social status, age at disease onset, family history, comorbidities, and substance abuse, can interfere with meaningful interpretation of results. Second, the severity of psychiatric symptoms is extremely variable, so it is important to identify symptom clusters as rigorously as possible based on symptom severity, duration of illness, and presence of other psychiatric diseases. Third, the magnetic\u02c6eld strength of the MR imaging unit is an important determinant of spatial and contrast resolution. Intensifying the strength of a static magnetic\u02c6eld to improve spatial and contrast resolution leads to spatial distortion and inhomogeneity of signal intensity, so it is important to correct such biases prior to analyzing imaging data. 38 There are 2 methods to correct spatial distortion-the 3-dimensional (3D) measurement of geometric displacement using specially designed phantoms and the 3D calculation of geometric displacement from the spherical harmonics of the gradient, grad_un-warp, 43 which is the method adopted by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\nThere are a few sources of signal intensity inhomogeneity. B 0 inhomogeneity is di\u2039cult to eliminate, even using high order shimming, whereas B 1 inhomogeneity is caused by a heterogeneous dielectric constant in vivo. These issues are di\u2039cult to overcome at the time of acquisition, making it necessary to correct signal intensity inhomogeneity with post-processing. The N3 software package (nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization) is reported to be one of the most robust intensity correction algorithms. 44 Fourth, post-processing is a crucial step that enables manipulation of images and extraction of useful data. Several sophisticated computerized and manual methods are available that involve the use of di\u0160erent thresholds,\u02c6lters, and templates. Therefore, it must be noted that the results obtained with di\u0160erent methods of analysis are not directly comparable. Fifth, group average results have not been validated for individual subjects. 38 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "DTI studies of patients with psychiatric disorders have clearly identi\u02c6ed white matter abnormalities and should become part of the routine clinical assessment of patients with such disorders.
