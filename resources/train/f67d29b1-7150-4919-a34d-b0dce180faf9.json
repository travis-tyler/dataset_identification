Amyloid plaques are composed primarily of aggregated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide, which is deposited in the brain parenchyma, likely decades before clinical symptoms manifest [1] . Although the accumulation of presumably neurotoxic, aggregated A\u03b2 is at the core of the amyloid hypothesis of AD [2] , the specific process by which A\u03b2 may lead to neuronal death remains unclear. Clinical progression has been reported to follow a predictable pattern, with patients transitioning through a preclinical stage, followed by a prodromal stage characterized by biomarker findings indicative of accumulating disease burden and cognitive symptoms not of sufficient severity to impact patient functioning, and eventually reaching the dementia stage.\nPrior to the initiation of the SCarlet RoAD study (NCT01224106; WN25203), researchers in most clinical trials identified patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using clinical criteria, such as an episodic memory deficit or Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score. Heterogeneity of patients with MCI has consistently been identified as a factor hampering the possibility of identifying a clinical benefit [3] . Subsequently, research criteria that included biomarkers of AD pathology were developed in an attempt to more specifically identify patients in the prodromal phase of AD [4, 5] . Because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b2 42 have been found to be low in prodromal AD [6] , CSF testing for low A\u03b2 42 levels was required for inclusion in the SCarlet RoAD study.\nGantenerumab (RO4909832, RG1450) is a human anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to aggregated A\u03b2 and promotes its removal by Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis [7] . In a phase I study of 16 patients with mild to moderate AD, gantenerumab treatment resulted in a rapid reduction in brain amyloid load over the course of 6 months [8] . Gantenerumab intravenous (IV) doses of 60 mg (equivalent to~100 mg subcutaneous [SC] ) and 200 mg (equivalent to~330 mg SC) given every 4 weeks were associated with dosedependent cortical amyloid standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) reduction [8] compared with placebo. At 200 mg IV, apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotypedependent vasogenic edema (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities [ARIA]-E) and amyloid-related imaging abnormality microbleeds (ARIA-H) were detected, suggesting an optimal target dose for the investigation of efficacy above 100 mg but below 330 mg SC. Accordingly, gantenerumab SC doses of 105 mg and 225 mg given every 4 weeks were selected for the SCarlet RoAD study, with APOE \u03b54 homozygous patients randomized to the lower dose or placebo only. SCarlet RoAD was the first phase III study in prodromal AD confirmed by CSF amyloid analysis with a single primary endpoint, the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of gantenerumab (105 and 225 mg) compared with placebo on CDR-SB in prodromal AD over the course of 2 years of treatment.

Patients were queried about new central nervous system symptoms following the identification of an ARIA. Upon new ARIA-E findings, treatment was withheld. MRI was performed approximately every 4-8 weeks until the ARIA-E had resolved or clearly decreased and stabilized, upon which, treatment ensued at half the original dose. If a second ARIA-E occurred, treatment was permanently discontinued.\nTreatment modification and discontinuation due to ARIA-H was based on cumulative numbers of new events over a 12-month period: if more than four events, treatment was discontinued; if more than two (but less than or equal to four), the dose was halved.

An aspect of this analysis was to explore the impact of the observed rate of disease progression in the prodromal AD population. These analyses were limited to 2-year completers. Before the SCarlet RoAD study was unblinded, an AD progression model was built for CDR-SB score using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) [20] . The model distinguishes two population types: \"slow\" progressing and \"fast\" progressing. Further statistical investigations over a large series of potential covariates at baseline determined CDR-SB, FAQ, and hippocampal volume to be the three main factors in predicting progression type and a prognostic \"signature\" was therefore proposed as a method to predict \"fast\" or \"slow\" progression of disease for patients with prodromal AD.\nApplying this algorithm to the SCarlet RoAD 2-year completer population (baseline data), almost two-thirds of the trial population were predicted to be slow progressors (n = 202), and one-third could be designated as fast progressors (n = 108) ( Table 4 ). By design, fast and slow progressors have slightly different mean baseline characteristics, with fast progressors having higher baseline FAQ and CDR-SB and smaller hippocampal volume. Fast progressors also included fewer APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. However, within the fast and slow subgroups, baseline characteristics appeared well balanced between the treatment arms (data not shown). Given the small sample size in the subgroups of this exploratory analysis, it was deemed that median and IQR data would be adequate summary statistics to report results. In the fast progressor subgroup, results suggested a dose-dependent slowing of decline in ADAS-Cog 13, CANTAB, and MMSE, but not in CDR-SB score change, from baseline at 2 years ( Table 4 ). The slow progressor subgroup did not show any difference in decline across treatment groups."}, {"section_title": "Adverse events", "text": "No notable differences were seen in the rate of serious adverse events and death across groups ( Table 5 ).

A preplanned futility analysis was conducted on the primary endpoint (CDR-SB change from baseline) when~50% of the patients had completed 2 years of treatment. No differences were observed in primary or secondary efficacy measures across the placebo and treatment arms, and the futility model predicted a < 6% chance of a positive study, which prompted the sponsor to discontinue dosing. These clinical outcomes in prodromal AD are reminiscent of phase III trials in mild to moderate AD with another antiaggregated A\u03b2 antibody, bapineuzumab, in which investigators explored a limited dose range [21, 22] . Several factors were examined for their contributions to a negative outcome in SCarlet RoAD, including inactive compound, insufficient dosing, short trial duration, insensitive endpoints, and the population studied.\nDespite the lack of a clinical benefit in the overall population, gantenerumab showed evidence of biological "}, {"section_title": "0.18", "text": "Abbreviations: A\u03b2 Amyloid-beta, p-tau Phosphorylated tau, t-tau Total tau activity at the doses tested. Reduction of amyloid load as measured by PET was dose-dependent, indicative of successful target engagement in the brain and a confirmation of gantenerumab's mechanism of action in a larger dataset and in a population at an earlier stage of the disease than in the earlier report [8] . Furthermore, gantenerumab treatment was associated with a dosedependent reduction in CSF biomarkers that are thought to reflect core pathological processes of AD, including hyperphosphorylation of tau (p-tau), and downstream processes of neuronal and axonal degeneration (t-tau) [23] , as well as synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin) [24] . Interestingly, in a subgroup of fast progressors, numerical differences in decline between treatment groups as measured by the ADAS-Cog 13 were observed, suggesting a dose-dependent clinical response. Similar dosedependent trends were observed for MMSE and CANTAB, although not for CDR-SB. In contrast, no such effects were seen in patients predicted to have slow progression.\nIn SCarlet RoAD, gantenerumab doses of 105 and 225 mg SC every 4 weeks had been chosen to minimize the risk of ARIA in this mildly affected prodromal AD population. Dose-and APOE \u03b54 genotype-dependent ARIA were observed, as was injection site erythema. However, most of the ARIA were asymptomatic and rated by the investigators as mild or moderate, and most patients could continue dosing, albeit at a lower (halved) dose, with a low rate of ARIA-E recurrence. It is hypothesized that higher doses of gantenerumab that result in more amyloid load reduction may be more likely to result in clinically meaningful efficacy. Recent phase Ib study results with aducanumab, an antibody with a preclinical profile similar to that of gantenerumab which was tested at higher doses in a similar population to the one enrolled in SCarlet RoAD, showed substantially greater and equally dose-dependent amyloid load reduction as measured by PET but also a higher incidence of ARIA [25] . The reported phase Ib results with aducanumab are suggestive of dose-dependent clinical effects; however, the sample was small.\nThe apparent dose-dependent clinical effect in fast progressors, combined with the biomarker outcomes in this study with gantenerumab, as well as the positive results of the phase Ib trial for aducanumab [25] , suggest that gantenerumab may have been dosed too low to achieve substantial clinical benefit. Achieving higher exposures of gantenerumab while minimizing ARIA rates is expected to be important for a balanced benefit-risk profile. Because ARIA in SCarlet RoAD generally occurred within the first 6 months of dosing, with potentially higher frequency and/or severity at higher doses, it is hypothesized that using titration schemes to achieve high doses may result in substantial brain amyloid reduction that may be clinically beneficial yet minimize both the rate and severity of ARIA events [26] . To test this hypothesis, multiple dose titration regimens are being examined for their ability to minimize ARIA events at higher doses in open-label extensions of the ongoing gantenerumab trials. Whether treatment with an antibody such as gantenerumab at a higher dose provides not only a higher degree of brain amyloid reduction but also a clinical benefit must be demonstrated in randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials.\nIt has been questioned whether it is possible to observe clinically meaningful effects in prodromal AD populations within a 2-year study duration. Although negative phase III trials of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies in mild and moderate AD have been 18 months long [21, 27] , the phase Ib study results with aducanumab mentioned above suggest that clinical effects in an AD population at an earlier stage of the disease can already be identified after 12 months [25] . Therefore, the 2-year study duration in SCarlet RoAD was likely sufficient to show clinically meaningful effects.\nThe sensitivity of endpoints to effectively capture change in prodromal AD may potentially contribute to negative trial outcomes in this population. The primary endpoint in SCarlet RoAD was change in CDR-SB score over 2 years, in alignment with guidance from health authorities [28, 29] and other groups [30] . Recent analysis of the CDR-SB demonstrated test-retest reliability, construct validity to functional change, and sensitivity to decline in AD [31, 32] . SCarlet RoAD was the first global phase III study in prodromal AD using amyloid screening. The decline observed in the placebo group was slightly less (1.60 CDR-SB points over 2 years) than expected on the basis of ADNI data (1.92 CDR-SB points over 2 years) available at the time at which the study was designed. However, in another randomized clinical trial in CSF biomarker-supported prodromal AD, the decline in mean CDR-SB points over 2 years (placebo group) was reported to be 1.65 [33] . Hence, the observed decline in CDR-SB is consistent with another recent clinical trial. Other, older reports [34] had suggested a higher placebo decline, but these were observational studies and had other important differences in terms of study design and patient characteristics. The change from baseline in CDR-SB was consistent with changes Events with an incidence of at least 5% in any treatment group are shown observed in other measures of cognition (ADAS-Cog 13, MMSE) and function (FAQ). The sensitivity of CDR-SB to drug effects has also been suggested by the aducanumab phase Ib study, as mentioned above. Overall, the choice of CDR-SB as the primary endpoint seemed appropriate for the population examined. The observed rate of decline must be carefully considered in any sample size estimation for future studies if the same population is to be enrolled. This report has important limitations. The study was stopped early for futility. All biomarker and clinical signals described resulted from exploratory analyses, some of which were conducted post hoc. Therefore, all analyses presented here, including p values, should be considered as strictly descriptive and hypothesis-generating, but not confirmatory."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, although the SCarlet RoAD study was stopped early for futility, dose-dependent effects observed in exploratory analyses on select clinical and biomarker endpoints suggest that higher dosing with gantenerumab may be necessary to achieve clinical efficacy.
