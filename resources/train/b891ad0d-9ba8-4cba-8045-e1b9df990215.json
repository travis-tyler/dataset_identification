By focusing myopically only on supermarkets in the food environment, the term misses other important sources of food in communities including unhealthy food options, such as fast food vendors. To this end, a recent review of sixteen studies finds that fast food consumption correlates with obesity (Rosencheck, 2008) . Another review of forty articles finds that fast food restaurants are more prevalent in lowincome and ethnic neighbourhoods . Practice mirrors the above flaws in research. For example, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation award winning County Health Rankings & Roadmaps tool includes a variable 'healthy food access', which measures spatial proximity to a supermarket. While subtle, use of 'food deserts' as a healthy food indicator arguably perverts policy-oriented results by overlooking spatial proximity to other healthy food sources as well as economic barriers to access. Because the data for dietrelated health are primarily framed around supermarket access, it is no wonder that the chief policy response lies in publically-funded supermarket financing. Chrisinger (2016) reviewed 126 new supermarket financing initiatives over the past decade, finding that 80 per cent use federal public funding. A broad range of literature has documented that although new supermarkets can help alleviate food insecurity in some contexts (Cummins et al., 2005) , more often than not, new supermarkets alone are insufficient for health behaviour change Wang et al., 2007; Walker et al., 2010; Dubowitz et al., 2015) . Complicating matters, many people do not shop at their closest stores Cannuscio et al., 2014) . The failure of supermarket interventions is compounded by several docuand public agencies have a empted to operationalize the food desert term through mapping and measurement. An example exists with the Food Atlas project of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which de\uf0de nes a food desert as an area without a supermarket within 1 or 10 miles for urban and rural areas respectively (USDA, 2015) . According to the USDA, 23.5 million Americans live in food deserts.\nWe argue that the food desert term is imprecise. First, the research and professional community often casually conflates spatial and other, perhaps more important, factors of access. For example, find that in Seattle and Paris, two cities with different built and food environments, physical proximity to supermarkets was not predictive of obesity, whereas the following factors were: income levels, surrounding property values, and preferences for shopping at lower-cost stores. The focus on geographic proximity to supermarkets also reduces attention to explanatory variables related to power structures, such as race and income, which are rarely considered in models. Indeed, a growing number of studies find socio-economic factors to be significant predictors of health conditions compared to factors measuring built and food environments (Drenowski et al., 2014; . The result is that work on food deserts too often 'bounds health problems within low-income communities ' (Bedore, 2010) , disregards the agency of such communities to generate alternative responses that deserve support, and ignores the policies and actors which shape disparities in food systems and accessibility .\nSecond, the food desert term is far too narrow in its focus on supermarket retail. The term 'desert' often implies a lack of life, though biologists are apt to point out that the desert biome contains thriving ecosystems if you know how to look for them. Emphasis on measuring proximity to supermarkets ignores other sources of food in neighbourhoods and people's resourcefulness.

Countylevel secondary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the USDA Food Environment Atlas and USDA's Economic Research Service 2 provide estimates for the prevalence of diagnosed adult diabetes and obesity. The Rural variable is bivariate and denotes counties that are more urban (1-3) or rural (4-9) in nature, based on urbanization and adjacency to a metro area represented in Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC; Butler and Beale, 1990) . Obesity is measured as the percentage of adults in a county who report BMI >= 30, while diabetes is the percentage of people diagnosed with diabetes in a county. Explanatory variables encompass socio-economic characteristics along with the food and built environment (table 1). Descriptive statistics are reported in  table 1 . Not all explanatory variables tested were used in the regression analysis. For example, we considered childhood poverty and educational levels, but these variables correlate with median household income (MHHI), and they increase multicollinearity in the model. Nationally, about 30 per cent of adults are mented cases where communities resist the use of eminent domain to acquire land and public funds to finance supermarket interventions . New methods of promoting healthy food access are needed. Instead of focusing on supermarkets, we argue that it would be more empowering to engage communities in a conversation about what they are already doing that works, and be open to a wide range of possibilities to scale such ventures. By overlooking residents' other means of sourcing healthy food, policymakers may unintentionally cause further injustices in the local food system or miss an opportunity to augment an already existing low-cost locally-based option, such as healthy street food vending (Brinkley et al., 2013) . We aim to expose such options for health with the research below."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The goal of our research methods are twofold. First, we build from the above literature review from the public health and planning disciplines by conducting a quantitative analysis of diet-related health outcomes in relation to socio-economic indicators and the percentage of the population living in food desert conditions. The multivariate statistical regression analysis is intended to highlight the importance of explicitly considering power dynamics that manifest in the built environment and food systems, and thereby impact individual health. As we suggest in the literature review, we suspect that proximity to a supermarket is not a very powerful indicator of poor diet-related health outcomes, and that socio-economic characteristics are more tightly linked. The analysis emphasizes that areas that are food deserts but have low rates of poverty are just as likely to have positive health outcomes. Second, the regression analysis allowed us to identify outlier case studies. To be er understand why food deserts are not related to poor health outcomes, we interviewed understand why food deserts are not consistently related to poor health outcomes, we interviewed public officials in outlier counties.

The average median household income is $43,144. About 78 per cent of the population identifies as white, with 9 per cent identifying as African American. On average, 3 per cent of the population lacks a car and lives more than 1 mile (1.6 km) from a supermarket. Another 24 per cent of the population lives far away from a supermarket, defined for urban populations as living more than one mile from a supermarket, and for rural areas as more than 10 miles (16 km) from a supermarket. There are on average more convenience stores (0.59) than specialty stores (0.05) and farmers markets (0.05) per 1,000 people in the county. Similarly, there are more full service restaurants (0.79) than fast food restaurants (0.58) or recreational facilities (0.07) per 1,000 people. Thirty-seven per cent of counties are metropolitan counties. We ran a two-level generalized linear mixed effects model with a Gaussian distribution and identity link to test the effect of socio-economic, food, and built environment measures on diabetes and obesity at the county level, accounting for state level clustering using Stata/IC version 13.1 software. The two-level generalized linear mixed effects model was fitted using the step-wise process outlined by Tabachnick et al. (2001) . Model fit diagnostics (deviance, AIC and BIC) were estimated and examined. Multicollinearity was addressed by dropping interaction terms, such as the race variable 'white' (WH). Heteroscedasticity was controlled by employing robust standard errors. We tested the covariance structures available in STATA for the final model. The standard covariance structure was the best suited for our models.

Based on the literature, outlier counties would be those where despite food desert conditions, be er than average health outcomes (obesity and diabetes) are found. These are interesting cases because they disprove the assumption that the presence of a food desert is linked with poor health outcomes. Some researchers hypothesize that rural populations have unique coping mechanisms to deal with this poor geographic access (Smith and Morton, 2009). Such 'uniqueness' to cope has not been evaluated. Using the list function in STATA, we identi\uf0de ed the counties that had a high prevalence of the population in food desert areas and yet displayed low levels of obesity and diabetes, based on the standard deviation from the means in those variables (see table 2 ). The selection process took into account the RUCC yielding seven urban and \uf0de fteen rural cases.

Indeed, diet-related health outcomes are the result of many cumulative decisions at the individual-level. Countylevel data may be too large a scale to pick up due to land-use policies, such as redlining, in which mortgages are denied in certain locations based on skin colour. The legacy of explicitly racist policies has left longterm and on-going disparities across food and built environments . Logically, the quality and quantity of food and built environment features in a county may be mediated by income levels, where higher income communities cultivate more opportunities to support healthy lifestyles. This may explain the impact of recreational facilities. For an additional recreational facility per 1,000 persons there is 4.19 per cent less obesity and 1.08 per cent less diabetes. The descriptive data indicate the availability of recreational facilities to be sparse and highly variable among the counties. The percentage of the population with lack of car access and the rural nature of the county were not predictive. In contrast, the effects of food and built environment variables are less predictive across both diet-related health outcomes. Proximity to a supermarket, while statistically significant, is not practically meaningful given the small coefficient sizes. A percentage increase in the number of people who do not live in close proximity to a supermarket is associated with 0.01 per cent less in obesity and 0.00 per cent decrease in diabetes. While a 1 per cent lower incidence of obesity strongly correlates with two more full service restaurants and one farmers' market per 500 residents, the effects of these food environment variables are insignificant on diabetes outcomes. Instead, fewer convenience stores and more fast food restaurants are associated with lower diabetes incidences. For example, for every additional fast food restaurant per 1,000 people, counties have a 0.65 per cent less diabetes. Every convenience store per 1,000 people correlations with 0.75 per cent more obesity and 0.79 per cent more diabetes (table 3) .\nBecause built environment obstacles, such as car access, were not predictive and food environment predictors were divided, we correct for the model's lack of longitudinal data, omitted variables and sorting effects as populations move. Yet, a larger sample of case studies is needed to further explain and verify quantitative findings. The cases identified tend to be skewed regionally (figure 1). For example, the case selection yields more rural than urban counties because food deserts are more likely to be located in rural areas. According to the USDA, food deserts are distributed among 448 counties in the United States, of which 98 per cent are rural. Despite using an indicator that highlights the lack of supermarkets in rural areas, there is a puzzling over emphasis on urban areas in food desert research and policy responses Walker et al., 2010) . Since rural counties are underrepresented in food systems research the skewness in the case selection is important to ensure rural county considerations are factored in the qualitative analysis. Though this study focuses across urban and rural counties, future research may be needed to drill down to smaller geographic levels.

These results indicate that to provide enduring systemic changes to address disparate health outcomes, policies need to address explicitly economic access and race. In support, the level two intercepts for both models indicate significant between-state variation in median household income. State political structures confer different values which, in turn, affect how resources are directed and distributed among communities.

Thus, the built environment is mediated through social and economic control, a finding supported by the regression models. Second, interviewees attributed better than expected health outcomes to the effects of sporting and physical activity levels over the food environment. Physical labour and outdoor lifestyles were cited as reasons for better-than-expected health outcomes in ten out of the thirteen counties that responded to this question, with the physical environment contributing recreational opportunities in half of the counties. In three counties, interviewees believed that the presence of universities or military bases gave the population a more favourable physical fitness average than it might have otherwise been the case. Also notable is that the state of Colorado is overrepresented amongst the outlier case counties. Colorado has ranked as the fittest state in the union for the past decade according to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has the lowest rates of obesity and adult diabetes and second-lowest rate of hypertension (2016). Interviewees from Colorado counties indicated that the better than expected dietrelated health outcomes could be due to self-selection, as health-motivated residents choose to live near recreational opportunities afforded in the mountains, such as hiking and skiing, or work directly with resort facilities. Due to a lack of health services, many residents with health conditions choose to relocate to lower altitudes, further skewing the place-based health outcomes with residents self-sorting as fitter, younger residents moving in and older, less healthy residents move away to be closer to health services. Respondents believed these factors were more influential than the food environment on positive health outcomes.\nThird, residents living in food deserts use a variety of strategies to access food. Interviewees from all the counties reported understanding food deserts and healthy food access: varied underlying explanatory models for the lack of supermarkets; the overlooked role of sorting; and the wide variety of strategies employed by residents and community leaders in so-called food deserts to access healthy food.\nFirst, interview data suggest that both built environment and socio-economic factors contribute to a lack of supermarkets in the case study counties. In half the counties, existing large lot land uses, such as a military base, prison, state park or university, prohibited supermarkets from locating nearby due to the lack of sufficient open land and low customer densities. Population characteristics were given as explanations for food desert conditions in two-thirds of the counties, with explanations ranging from a lack of purchasing power due to poverty (seven counties), itinerant populations engaged in seasonal work (three counties), inaccurate census data for areas where there are undocumented populations (two counties), and more people per household in multi-generational housing leading to under-estimates of consumer base (one county). Two counties with universities indicated that students do not purchase at supermarkets, but prefer street food, fast food and restaurant venues for the convenience of ready-made food. This sentiment is echoed in a recent Atlantic article titled, 'Why Do Millennials Hate Groceries?' (Thomson, 2016) .\nFurther, these results suggest that a nuanced understanding of the factors leading to a lack of supermarkets is necessary. In some cases, land use and purchasing power rationales ran in tandem with sparsely populated low-income communities unable to support the conventional supermarket business model. In other cases, the built environment and social networks worked to opposite ends. In one largely rural, low-income county, several wealthy residents heavily influence land-use decisions to keep the county rural and historic in character while also supporting a Michelin star restaurant. The wealthier community intentionally prevented large Millennials Hate Groceries?' (Thompson, 2016) . conditions represents a largely overlooked mode of intervening in healthy food policy. Many food banks were heavily embedded in publicly-run programmes. For example, public agencies run the federal food subsistence programmes (Women Infant and Children and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance) while coordinating free breakfasts and lunches through public schools in combination with food banks. In one largely rural, low-income county, several wealthy residents 'single-handedly' finance healthy food options, such as the school lunch and weekend backpack of healthy food programme run through the local food bank.\nThe counties were engaged in a variety of interventions to increase access to healthy food and to enhance healthy eating. Counties reported involvement from public, private, and non-profit agencies across communityled efforts. University extension offered master gardener, 4H, and food preservation courses to help stretch home-grown supplies through the winter months for selfprovisioning. Private companies, like Alison's Pantry and local grocery co-ops, sold bulk meals directly to homes in two Colorado counties. An example of the community-led efforts which combine government, nonprofit and business institutions is exemplified in San Juan County, Colorado, where a local restaurant coordinates with the food pantry run by the Catholic Church and the Area Agency for Aging to run a weekly senior dinner."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This research asks researchers and policymakers to move beyond the narrow focus on supermarket proximity and acknowledge the forces shaping the spatial inequities in healthy, a ordable food access, namely, race and poverty. As the regression model shows, purchasing power a ributes, represented by median household income, more strongly correlate with diet-related outcomes than other factors, including supermarket proximity. bulk shopping at large stores outside the community as the primary mode of food procurement. Residents also used smallerscale, local supermarkets in the county for staple items. Only two of the counties had public transit, and none had formal ridesharing programmes. Several counties used social media networks, like facebook, to solicit ride-sharing and to pick up groceries or medications for community members. Because supermarket shopping is the primary form of obtaining food, many food scholars would say that focus on food deserts and lack of such stores is warranted. Our results, however, point to other highly prevalent food acquisition practices when such convenience is absent. About half the counties had established farmers' markets or roadside farm stands, and all but two had seasonal farm-to-market opportunities. For example, the largely secluded ethno-religious Hutterite farming community comes to the main town in Daniels County, Montana weekly during the growing season to sell produce, baked goods, eggs and milk from the back of their truck. Amish farmers in other parts of the country are similarly engaged in direct marketing practices Brinkley, 2017) . All but one county had some form of road-side vending, with the majority being seasonal, fresh produce trucks that source from local farms or produce terminals and park temporarily for sales. Gardening was a prevalent practice in all but three counties. In locales where growing seasons were short and altitudes prevented vegetable and fruit growing, backyard poultry were popular. One-third of the counties reported hunting and gathering as important methods of supplementing their diets.\nAll but two counties had food banks, with varying degrees of involvement in fresh food purchasing. In comparison, none of the counties reported a food policy council. Food bank management varied: some were run through non-profits, others through churches, public agencies, or combinations of the above. The central role of the food bank in food desert form of obtaining food, many scholars would say that a focus on food deserts and lack of supermarkets is warranted. Our results, As such, anti-poverty measures, such as minimum wage raises, and price support for farmers' markets (Young et al., 2013) are supported models for improving diets for low-income residents. Such policies will support low-income people regardless of how close they live to a supermarket. The case studies emphasize that food deserts di er vastly in their underlying physical, social and policy characteristics, making \uf0de ndings from various studies on food deserts di cult to generalize beyond the need to give communities the chance to innovate as suits their needs.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that future research explicitly considers variables related to power structures in the food system, namely income and race. These variables are all too often left out, and directly effect the research and policy recommendations made. There are many pathways to healthy food access. Where supermarkets are lacking, residents tend to travel long distances and coordinate within their community for bulk buying while relying on local smaller-scale supermarkets for staple items. The commonalities among the counties point to farmto-market, self-provisioning and food banks as strategies for food acquisition. Future research can help examine the potential of such avenues to supplement food budgets, and how such efforts can be supported or scaled-up to impact health outcomes. NOTES 1. We intentionally use the word supermarket, not grocery store for two main reasons. First, it is the term used by the USDA in their de\uf0de nition of food deserts. Second, as part of our argument in the article, the focus on supermarkets, which are larger in oor area and sales volume, can overlook the presence of smaller stores with a variety of ownership models.\n2.
