[{"section_title": "", "text": "Institutions of higher education, the major source of the Nation's scientists and engineers, perform about one-half of the Nation's basic research. Therefore, the level, distribution, and characteristics of Federal academic support are of much interest to officials at Federal, state, and local levels and in nongovernmental sectors. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, requires that the Foundation \" . . . initiate and maintain a program for the determination of the total amount of money for scientific and engineering research, including money allocated for the construction of the facilities wherein such research is conducted, received by each educational institution and appropriate nonprofit organization in the United States, by grant, contract, or other arrangement from agencies of the Federal Government, and to report annually thereon to the President and the Congress.\" To fulfill this requirement, the Foundation has utilized the data collection system originally designed by the Committee on Academic Science and Engineering of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. The Foundation annually collects statistical data from the 15 Federal agencies that account for virtually all v support for science and engineering (S&E) research and development at educational institutions. Data are also collected on these agencies' obligations to nonprofit institutions. Since its inception, this survey system has been the sole source of data on Federal funding to individual institutions for S&E activities and therefore attracts a wide audience. These data provide information that enables users to examine patterns of support for individual institutions over time and to compare such patterns with those of other institutions. Each of the other five academic S&E categories showed increased funding levels in FY 1995, and each, except for \"other S&E activities,\" increased to new highs at rates exceeding inflation. The \"other S&E activities\" category (whose current-dollar record was $992 million in FY 1992) includes all academic S&E activities that cannot meaningfully be assigned to one of the other five categories. Obligations for this category increased by 2 percent in current dollars with the Department of Agriculture (USDA) supplying over two-fifths of the total in FY 1995. FTTG support, up 6 percent in current dollars, rose to $674 million in FY 1995; HHS accounted for the majority of the increase and more than three-fifths of the FTTG total. R&D plant funds grew 56 percent to $335 million, largely from National Science Foundation (NSF) projects funded in the agency's Major Research Equipment and Academic Research Infrastructure accounts. NSF, in FY 1995, supplied nearly two-thirds of all academic R&D plant. Facilities and equipment for instruction increased 7 percent to $53 million, with all of the increase attributable to the Department of Defense (DOD). General support for S&E nearly doubled to $265 million because of more complete reporting from the Agency for International Development (AID). General support for S&E includes activities that provide support for nonspecific or generalized purposes related to scientific research and education.

However, when adjusted for inflation, only NASA and NSF showed increases (9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in constant 1992 dollars). Nearly three-fourths of the NASA increase was for R&D projects and more than three-fifths of the NSF increase was for R&D plant support."}, {"section_title": "UNIVERSITY SHARES", "text": "The leading 100 university S&E recipients in FY 1995 (out of 1,111 institutions, excluding 42 system offices) accounted for 81 percent of the total and 83 percent of academic R&D (each of the leading 100 is a doctorate-granting institution). In FY 1995, less than one-third of all academic institutions receiving Federal S&E obligations granted doctorates, but nearly all (96 percent) academic S&E support was obligated to these leading 100 doctorate-granting institutions. Clearly this is indicative of the preponderance of R&D obligations in Federal S&E support and the concentration of academic R&D activity in these institutions. Johns Hopkins University, including its Applied Physics Laboratory, was the leading university recipient of Federal S&E support in FY 1995 (table 2). Nearly four-fifths of its $729 million total was for R&D programs and most of the remainder was for \"other S&E activities.\" The leading 20 universities, ranked by the amount of Federal academic S&E support they received, accounted for 36 percent of the academic S&E total. Eighteen of the top 20 academic S&E recipients in FY 1995 were among the leading 20 recipients in FY 1994. The new entrants for FY 1995 were the California Institute of Technology (twelfth) and the University of Pittsburgh (nineteenth). Cal Tech, previously ranked thirty-first, received about double its FY 1994 S&E obligation level, primarily as a result of increased NSF R&D and R&D plant support. Cal Tech received $90 million from NSF for R&D plant in FY 1995, resulting primarily from its $85 million Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory project. The University of Pittsburgh was previously ranked twenty-third in academic S&E support.

In FY 1995, 14 states accounted for 68 percent of such support. In each of these states, institutions collectively received over $300 million in academic S&E obligations. These states were located along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and within the East North Central Region (i.e. Great Lakes). Texas remained as the only $300 million-plus recipient outside of those regions. The six states receiving the largest amounts of Federal academic S&E obligations in FY 1994 maintained the same ordinal positions in FY 1995. Academic institutions within those 14 states also accounted for over two-thirds of all federally financed R&D expenditures at doctorategranting institutions and enrolled nearly two-thirds of all graduate S&E students.

This increase follows two successive years of current-dollar reductions. Research institutes, numbering less than one-fourth of all nonprofit organization recipients (which also include voluntary hospitals and other independent institutions such as private foundations and trade associations), received 57 percent of all nonprofit funds. The number of research institutes proportionally has decreased over time, but their proportional share of nonprofit funding continues to be strong. In FY 1985, 10 years earlier, research institutes accounted for 42 percent of all nonprofit recipients and received 69 percent of all nonprofit obligations. Five of the top 10 nonprofit Federal R&D recipients in FY 1995, including the top three nonprofits (Draper Laboratories, the Mitre Corporation, and the Battelle Memorial Institute) were research institutes (table 4).

The treatment of interagency transfers explains much of the difference in the totals. Interagency transfers of funds obligated to an academic or nonprofit institution are reported in the Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions (Federal S&E support survey) by the agency that actually obligates the funds to the receiving institution. In the Federal funds survey, however, obligations are reported by the initiating agency. Each of several agencies utilizes personnel from separate internal offices to respond to the two individual surveys, and each frequently collects data from different sources. Data for the Federal S&E support survey, for example, are generally processed from award files; whereas Federal funds survey data are usually derived from agency budget documents. Respondents from the separate internal offices that participate in the two surveys also frequently differ in their interpretation of the survey questions. The National Institutes of Health, for example, report Biomedical Research Support Grants under \"general support for science and engineering\" in the Federal 5 S&E support survey but under \"research and development\" in the Federal funds survey. Regarding the structure of the surveys themselves, the data presented in this report differ in two main ways from those presented in the report on the Federal funds survey, as follows. 1. The two surveys differ in number of agencies involved. In the Federal S&E support survey, the 15 Federal agencies that obligate virtually all of Federal support to academic R&D collect data on all Federal S&E obligations to institutions of higher education. For the Federal funds survey, data are gathered on budgets for R&D and R&D plant from all 33 Federal agencies that conduct such programs. 2. The scope of information gathered differs. Data collected in the Federal S&E support survey pertain to individual academic institutions. Those collected in the Federal funds survey relate to all types of performers and are detailed as to character of work (basic research, applied research, and development). The fiscal year (FY) 1995 data shown in this report were submitted by the following Federal agencies, listed by the acronyms or abbreviated forms under which data were reported for them:"}, {"section_title": "INFORMATION SOURCES DATA TAPES", "text": "Public-use tapes from the Integrated Academic Science and Engineering Data Base are available for purchase and will normally be shipped within 3 working days from order receipt.

The survey originated in 1965, when the Committee on Academic Science and Engineering (CASE) within the Federal Council for Science and Technology established the CASE data collection system in order to report annually on Federal S&E obligations to academic institutions and associated federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). Since 1968, CASE data, as well as data on nonprofit institutions, have also served as the basis for an annual report to the President and Congress. This survey is designed to collect information from Federal agencies on (1) total S&E program support in thousands of dollars to academic institutions, (2) total S&E support to FFRDCs administered by academic institutions, and (3) research and development (R&D) and R&D plant support to nonprofit institutions and associated FFRDCs. Data are shown for Federal S&E obligations to institutions classified as historically black universities and colleges by type of activity, by agency, and by R&D obligations. The fiscal year (FY) 1995 data in this report were submitted by 15 Federal agencies, covering the period October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995. Data reported by the Agency for International Development, the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were combined, because of space constraints, to constitute the \"other\" category in tables that show funding by agency. In 1995, these five agencies accounted for less than 2 percent of all Federal S&E academic support. In most tables that list data by agency and by individual institution, the \"other\" column includes data from the Department of the Interior in addition to the above five agencies. In 1995, the 15 agencies reported obligations to 1,111 universities and colleges, 42 academic system offices, and 1,177 independent nonprofit institutions. In FY 1995, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (APL) accounted for practically all of Johns Hopkins' $395 million in total funding from the Department of Defense (DoD). Although the precise figures are unknown, perhaps as much as $380 million of the $395 million reported by DOD to Johns Hopkins were obligated for S&E activities at APL. During the FY 1987 survey cycle, DoD determined that some funds reported in prior years as R&D obligations to APL were more appropriately classified as \"other sciences and engineering.\" Data for FYs 1984-86 were revised, but DoD was unable to revise data prior to FY 1984. To better differentiate between that part of the Federal R&D budget that supports \"science and key enabling technologies\" (including for military and nondefense applications) and that which primarily concerns \"testing and evaluation of large technical systems prior to production\" (of mostly defense-related systems), NSF now collects from DoD development dollars in two categories, advanced technology development and major systems development. As a result of trend editing of the Department of Education's (ED's) data each year, a small number of academic institutions' dollar totals are distributed by type of activity (R&D, R&D plant, etc.) on a prorated basis through FY 1992 by NSF because ED could evaluate the data only on a \"total obligations\" basis. During the FY 1987 survey cycle, ED determined that institution coding problems in earlier years caused its database to produce several large funding trend shifts at specific universities. ED has made major software modifications to the automated system from which the Federal S&E data were produced. Therefore, due to a revamped coding structure, there are trend differences among institutions' data from ED beginning in FY 1993. Those trend differences were a major factor in NSF's decision not to publish \"non-S&E\" totals beginning for the FY 1993 report. ED accounted for 91 percent ($5.9 billion) of the total Federal support for \"non-S&E\" ($6.5 billion) for FY 1993. To explain ED's downward academic R&D trend between FY 1993 and FY 1994 (from $95 million to $49 million), that agency stated that academic R&D programs in FY 1994 either were not funded, did not have a science and engineering component, or received reductions in funding. \"R&D plant\" in this report refers to large facilities and fixed equipment. Data on \"research instrumentation\" are not separately identifiable in this report. Research instrumentation funds are for equipment purchased under research project awards from currentfund accounts and are included under totals for research and development. Some agencies not surveyed, such as the Department of Justice, may account for a significant proportion of the total receipts at some institutions, even though those receipts may constitute a small proportion of total academic R&D. Obligations listed for individual institutions reflect direct Federal S&E support so that amounts subcontracted to other institutions are included. Those funds received through subcontract arrangements from prime contractors are excluded. Federal obligations to institutions are presented on the basis of the individual institutions that are components of the system, but obligations awarded directly to the central administration of a system are listed separately. If the final destination of the funds is not known, however, the agencies report them as obligations to a system's administrative office, or \"central system,\" from which the funds are distributed to the system's individual institutions."}, {"section_title": "OTHER SCIENCE RESOURCES STUDIES REPORTS ON FEDERAL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "R&D FUNDING", "text": "In addition to the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development report, the NSF's Division of Science Resources Studies publishes one other report related to Federal R&D funding.

The expenditures data in National Patterns, with the exception of Federal intramural R&D, are based on sample surveys of the performers of R&D. Respondents are asked to report how much they actually spent on R&D during the year and the source of those funds. Data in National Patterns are based on expenditures reported by performers; performers of R&D often expend Federal funds in a different year from the one in which the Federal Government provided authorization, obligations, or outlays."}, {"section_title": "DEFINITIONS", "text": "Obligations are the amounts for orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, regardless of when the funds were appropriated and when future payment of money is required.

A university or college comprises all parts of an academic institution, such as colleges of liberal arts, professional schools, hospitals, schools of agriculture, and agricultural experiment stations, including bureaus, offices, and research centers (excluding FFRDCs), whether located on or off the main campus, and branch campuses controlled directly by the parent institution. The universe of academic institutions that is the foundation of this survey is derived from the higher education institutions' portion of the Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics, and the 1996 Higher Education Directory, published by Higher Education Publications, Inc. Institutions included are those that received Federal S&E support during FY 1995 and possessed a significant degree of academic and administrative autonomy. Institutions within a system (a group of institutions having a collective legal status and generally recognized by a state government, a board of education, or other relevant organization) in which a significant degree of autonomy remains at the individual institution level are presented separately; obligations to branch campuses are included in the totals for their parent institutions. The study excludes all obligations to the service academies and to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School. Independent nonprofit institutions are legal entities other than universities and colleges, are privately organized or chartered to serve the public interest, and are exempt from most forms of Federal taxation. Data presented for nonprofit institutions and for nonprofit-administered FFRDCs are obligations for R&D and R&D plant reported by the 15 participating agencies. Coverage of the nonprofit section in the Federal support survey was expanded beginning in the late 1970s to include all types of nonprofit institutions that receive Federal R&D funds. For NSF purposes the types of institutions are defined as follows:' 1. Research institute. A separately incorporated, independent nonprofit organization operating under the direction of its own controlling body, the primary function of which is the performance of R&D in the sciences and engineering. 2. Voluntary hospital. A member of the American Hospital Association not subject to the control of either Federal, state, or local governments, nor an integral part of any institution of higher education. Hospitals that have been set up by research institutes and that, although providing patient care, function primarily as laboratories for the research institutes are included in the \"Research institute\" category. 3. All other independent nonprofit institutions. (a) Professional or technical society, or academy of science and engineering. A voluntary association of individuals sharing a common interest in the advancement of knowledge, either within a single field or across a broad spectrum of disciplines. The major function of these organizations is to aid and encourage the collection, collation, and dissemination of S&E knowledge for the benefit of their members and the community as a whole. (b) Private foundation. A nongovernmental, nonprofit organization having a principal fund of its own, managed by its own trustees or directors, and established to maintain or to aid social, educational, charitable, religious, or other activities serving the common welfare. Private foundations include operating foundations that allocate the greater proportion of their R&D budgets to intramural performance and philanthropic foundations that allocate most of their funds to grants and contracts for research to be performed extramurally. (c) Science exhibitor. A nonprofit organization whose primary goal is to expand scientific literacy within the community by providing exhibits that display and interpret the latest scientific findings within its field or fields. Included in this category are museums, zoological parks, botanical gardens, and arboretums. (d) Trade association. An organization of business competitors, in a specific industry or business, that is interested primarily in the commercial promotion of products or services. Membership is usually held in the name of a business entity. Activities may fall into one or more of the following areas: business ethics, management practices, standardization, commercial (i.e., statistical) research, publication, promotion, and public relations. (e) Agricultural cooperative. An organization of individuals or business entities that are normally competitors in the production and sale of agricultural products. Activities may include one or more of the following areas: collective marketing or purchasing, research, public relations, and the improvement of the economic condition of the farm population of the United States."}, {"section_title": "CATEGORY OF SUPPORT", "text": "Academic science and engineering includes all obligations for R&D; R&D plant; facilities and equipment for S&E instruction; fellowships, traineeships, and training grants (FTTGs); general support for science and engineering; and other S&E activities.

Fellowships, traineeships, and training grants include graduate programs in support of the development and maintenance of S&E personnel resources. The total amounts pertaining to such awards-(stipends and cost-of-education allowances) are reported on the basis of the institution chosen by the recipient. Excluded are programs that support research and education institutes, seminars, and conferences such as teacher-training activities provided through teacher institutes, short courses, research participation, and in-service seminars; activities aimed at the development of education techniques and materials for use in S&E training; and programs that provide special opportunities for increasing the scientific knowledge and experience of precollege and undergraduate students. These activities are included in \"other science and engineering activities\" (see category 6) if they are S&E oriented. 5. General support for science and engineering includes programs that support nonspecific or generalized purposes related to scientific research and education. Such projects are generally oriented toward academic departments, institutes, or institutions as a whole and embody varying types of supportranging from support provided without any specification of purpose other than that the funds be used for scientific projects to projects in which funds are provided for activities within a specified field of science and engineering without a specific purpose. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Biomedical Research Support Grants and Minority Biomedical Support Grants are examples of these types of programs. 6.

As a result, AID's response to the fiscal year 1995 Federal support survey was produced using an interim reporting system. The significant differences between AID's fiscal year 1995 and prior year data can be attributed to this change in reporting systems. In addition, AID anticipates that future responses to the Federal support survey will differ from the fiscal year 1995 submission, since the interim reporting system will be refined to produce more accurate data. Department of Defense (DoD) research is reported separately from DoD development. Fiscal year 1994 totals for the research and development portions are not comparable to other years; DoD was not able to provide comparable data. DoD states that more than 90 percent of its development reported for universities and colleges is performed at university-administered laboratories that are separate from the academic departments. Furthermore, DoD states that much of its development obligations are for major systems development, that such obligations differ from its obligations for advanced technology development, and    19881989199019911992199319941995 Connecticut   19881989199019911992199319941995 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 Total, all institutions 9,136,277 10,076,017 10,445,417 11,835,370 12,749,593 12,751,061 13,774,695 14,346,042 1 Johns Hopkins University  584,369  604,567  607,259  649,007  660,675  701,118  764,025  729,177  2 U of Washington-Seattle  197,823  222,126  243,031  272,312  280,054  279,854  309,554  339,521  3 MA Inst of Technology  209,213  231,126  242,340  256,603  275,279  278,032  290,265  306,765  4 Stanford University  229,617  265,282  273,428  259,929  270,056  268,673  282,549  298,139  5 University of Michigan  161,627  182,243  193,155  218,167  233,782  233,908  263,243  268,126  Total 1st 30 institutions   4,336,844  4,773,175  4,975,451  5,512,133  5,918,469  5,863,841  6,373,424  6,644,009   31 University of Rochester  101,127  106,183  110,524  122,363  132,965  131,252  125,863  119,975  32 Georgetown University  26,872  26,540  31,928  40,996  39,328  58,418  62, Institution and ranking  1988  1989  1990   1991   1992  1993  1994  1995   51 University of Miami  61,588  63,781  67,130  74,377  75,487  69,919  88,931  86,753  52 Emory University   52,231   48,030  51,169  61,596  68,164  67,482  78,294  84,828  53 NC State U Raleigh  47,126  58,935  58,929  63,505  77,955  71,590  72, Total 1st 100 institutions 7,441,616 8,223,145 8,483,149 9,480,552 10,311,756 10,301,787 11,125,193 11,582,564 SOURCE: National Science Foundation/SRS, Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions, Fiscal Year 1995 36 See explanatory information, if any, and SOURCE at end of table.  19881989199019911992199319941995 Institution and ranking 1988Institution and ranking 1989Institution and ranking 1990Institution and ranking 1991Institution and ranking 1992Institution and ranking 1993Institution and ranking 1994Institution and ranking 1995 Total , all institutions  7,719,237  8,523,952  9,008,083 10,031,252 10, 845,509 10,943,370 11,806,116 12,068 Total 1st 50 institutions 4, 965,524 5,371,598 5,669,459 6,228,668 6,761,038 6,723,346 7,326,037 7,546,496 See explanatory information, if any, and SOURCE at end of table.

As a result, AID's response to the fiscal year 1995 Federal support survey was produced using an interim reporting system. The significant differences between AID's fiscal year 1995 and prior year data can be attributed to this change in reporting systems. In addition, AID anticipates that future responses to the Federal support survey will differ from the fiscal year 1995 submission, since the interim reporting system will be refined to produce more accurate data.
