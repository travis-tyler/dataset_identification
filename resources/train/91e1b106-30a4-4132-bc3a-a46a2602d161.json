We computed individual subject expression values for ADRP and PDCP in 89 patients with PD and correlated summary scores for cognitive functioning with network expression. We also evaluated changes in ADRP and PDCP expression in a separate group of 15 patients with PD scanned serially over a 4year period.\nResults: Analysis revealed a significant AD-related metabolic topography characterized by covarying metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal and temporal association regions. Expression of ADRP, but not PDCP, was elevated in both AD groups and correlated with worse cognitive summary scores. Patients with PD showed slight ADRP expression, due to topographic overlap with the network underlying PD motor-related pattern degeneration, but only their PDCP expression values increased as cognitive function and executive performance declined. Longitudinal data in PD disclosed an analogous dissociation of network expression.\nCognitive dysfunction in PD is associated with a specific brain network that is largely spatially and functionally distinct from that seen in relation to AD.

The postmortem observation of amyloid-b plaques and tau neurofibrilliary tangles, pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD), in individuals with PD and dementia has led to the hypothesis that the cognitive changes in PD are caused by comorbid AD. 3-5 Many patients with PD have substantial cognitive loss without forming plaques and tangles, however, and the severity of neuropsychological deficits in patients with PD with coexisting cortical Lewy body and AD-like pathology correlates only with From the Center for Neurosciences (P.J.M., M.N., W."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "the former. 6 Whether AD contributes to the cognitive deficits in PD thus remains an unsettled question.\nThe fact that neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases is propagated along discrete networks makes such questions amenable to neuroimaging approaches. We and others have used 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET and fMRI to identify diseasespecific networks in PD, AD, Huntington disease, and other conditions. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] We have shown that akinesia-rigidity in PD correlates with the expression of a PD motor-related pattern (PDRP) 10, 11 such that more severe symptoms are reflected in higher PDRP scores; tremor is mediated by a distinct cerebello-thalamocortical network 14 ; and the expression of a distinct PD cognition-related pattern (PDCP), characterized by diminished metabolism in the medial frontal and parietal regions, rises as cognitive function deteriorates. [15] [16] [17] [18] Similarly, in AD, neuropsychological test performance correlates with the expression of an AD-related pattern (ADRP) characterized by covarying reductions in hippocampal, superior temporal, and parieto-occipital resting-state activity. 7 To determine whether patients with PD, with or without cognitive deficits, express ADRP, we compared ADRP and PDCP expression in patients with AD and those with PD. We also analyzed changes in ADRP and PDCP over time in a separate longitudinal cohort of patients with PD. METHODS Participants. Patients with AD. To ensure the most rigorous comparison, we used the same spatial covariance analysis approach we previously used to characterize PDRP 10, 19 to identify and validate a reliable ADRP topography for prospective use. We analyzed metabolic images from 40 patients with AD (23 men and 17 women, mean 6 SD age 75.9 6 5.6 years, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 22.6 6 3.3) and 40 age-matched healthy controls (23 men and 17 women, age 76.0 6 4.7 years) who had been scanned with FDG-PET as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; see table e-1 at Neurology.org for demographic and neuropsychological data).\nUsing a random number generator (http://www.r-project. org/), we assigned the patients with AD and controls to 1 of 2 groups. The first group comprised 20 patients with AD (AD1; 13 men and 7 women, age 76.0 6 6.2 years, MMSE score 23.6 6 2.4) and 20 normal controls (NL1; 10 men and 10 women, age 76.6 6 5.2 years). We used scans from these AD1 and NL1 participants to identify a significant ADRP topography and scans from a second group of 20 patients with AD (AD2; 10 men and 10 women, age 75.8 6 5.2 years, MMSE score 21.6 6 3.8) and 20 normal controls (NL2; 13 men and 7 women, age 75.5 6 4.2 years) for testing. A third group constituting an additional validation set, consisting of 10 additional patients with AD (AD3; 6 men and 4 women, age 74.5 6 5.3 years, MMSE score 23.9 6 4.2) and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers (NL3; 4 men and 6 women, age 73.4 6 4.8 years), were scanned with FDG-PET on the GE Advance tomograph (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (FIMR; Manhasset, NY) as described elsewhere. 19, 20 One of the investigators (M.L.G.) made the diagnosis of AD in the AD3 cohort on the basis of published criteria. 21 Patients with PD. We quantified ADRP expression values and subject scores for the previously characterized PDCP network topography in a cross-sectional sample of 89 patients (61 men and 28 women, age 61.6 6 9.0 years, MMSE score 28.0 6 2.3) who were recruited at the Movement Disorders Center of Northwell Health (Great Neck, NY) and diagnosed according to the UK Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD. 22 These patients had pure parkinsonism without a history of known causative factors (such as encephalitis or neuroleptic treatment and without supranuclear gaze abnormalities or ataxia); patients with Lewy body dementia were excluded. Table e-2 summarizes the demographic and neuropsychological data for these participants.\nWe classified patients with PD as having dementia or not having dementia according to the Dementia Rating Scale 23 : 11 had scores ,127, classifying them as having PD dementia (PDD); the remaining 78 were classified as not having dementia. Using the neuropsychological battery (see e-Methods), we assigned patients with PD without dementia to 3 previously defined cognitive categories: cognitively intact [PD-MCI(2); n 5 18], mild cognitive impairment (MCI) involving a single cognitive domain [PD-MCI(s); n 5 30], and MCI involving multiple cognitive domains [PD-MCI(m); n 5 30]. The neuropsychological testing criteria for MCI in patients with PD are described elsewhere. 2, 18 In addition, we compared the progression of ADRP and PDCP in a previously published longitudinal imaging cohort of 15 patients with PD (11 men and 4 women, age 58.0 6 10.2 years) who were scanned with FDG-PET at baseline (within 2 years of diagnosis) and again 24 and 48 months later. 24 All participants in the cross-sectional and longitudinal PD cohorts underwent FDG-PET at FIMR according to the same protocol used for the AD3 group.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. For the patients with AD and healthy volunteers participating in ADNI protocols, written informed consent was obtained after approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the collaborating institutions. For participants scanned at FIMR, we obtained ethics permission from the Institutional Review Board of Northwell Health and written consent from each participant after a detailed explanation of the procedures.\nImage analysis. FDG-PET scans were preprocessed with SPM5 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, London, UK) running on Matlab 6.0 (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA). Scans were spatially normalized to a standard PET brain template and smoothed with a 3-dimensional gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum 5 10 mm).\nSpatial covariance analysis 10, 19, 20 identified a distinct ADRP topography in the combined AD1 (n 5 20) and NL1 (n 5 20) ADNI derivation sample. (The computational procedures used to identify and validate this pattern are detailed in e-Methods.) We computed ADRP expression values (subject scores) for each member of the ADNI (AD2/NL2, n 5 40) and FIMR (AD3/ NL3, n 5 20; PD, n 5 89) testing samples using an automated algorithm available at http://www.feinsteinneuroscience.org. The resulting measures were z scored with respect to corresponding measures from the NL1 normal reference sample used in pattern identification. We used analogous procedures to quantify PDCP expression in the same scans in each of the testing cases. To accord with previously published results, PDCP expression values were z scored with respect to values from the group of normal controls (NL4; 8 men and 7 women, age 56.7 6 12.3 years) used for reference in prior studies. 18, 25, 26 Network correlates of neuropsychological test performance.\nWe evaluated the relationship between network expression and cognitive performance in the combined ADNI (AD1/AD2) patient cohort and the FIMR PD sample. For the ADNI participants, we used the summary score data for memory and executive functioning provided in the database. 27 Because the ADNI database does not provide a summary score for language function, we constructed a language index score based on the measures that were available for each participant, standardized (z scored) with respect to agecorrected normative values, and averaged individual scores to form a language summary index. We used a similar approach to compute summary scores for memory, executive function, and language in members of the cross-sectional PD sample."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis. We assessed differences in ADRP expression", "text": "between patients with AD and controls separately for the ADNI (AD2/NL2) and FIMR (AD3/NL3) testing sets and for the PD and age-matched normal reference (NL4) groups scanned at FIMR. Subject scores computed in each of the subgroups within this PD sample, PD-MCI(2), PD-MCI(s), PD-MCI (m), and PDD, were separately compared to corresponding control values. Differences in ADRP expression between patients and controls in each testing sample were assessed with Student t tests, and differences in ADRP expression across the PD subgroups were assessed with 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post-hoc Dunnett tests for multiple comparisons. We used identical statistical procedures to assess group differences in PDCP expression in each testing sample. Potential network 3 subgroup interaction effects in the PD data were evaluated with 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA (RMANOVA), with network as the within-subject variable and subgroup as the between-subject variable.\nWe used a similar approach to evaluate the neuropsychological summary scores for the 2 disease groups. We constructed separate 1-way ANOVA models for each cognitive domain to identify differences across the PD subgroups; p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Dunnett correction. Relationships between individual subject ADRP and PDCP expression values and the neuropsychological summary scores were evaluated separately in the AD and PD groups by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlations.\nTo compare changes in ADRP and PDCP expression over time in the longitudinal PD cohort, we analyzed the subject scores using 2-way RMANOVA with network and time as within-subject variables. If a significant network 3 time interaction effect was evident in the data, we used 1-way RMANOVA to assess changes over time in the expression of each network. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and considered significant at p , 0.05 (2-tailed).\nRESULTS ADRP, but not PDCP, expression was consistently elevated in patients with AD. Spatial covariance analysis of metabolic scans from the combined AD1/NL1 derivation sample revealed a distinct ADRP topography characterized by metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal and parietal association regions, along with an increase in activity in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum (figure 1A, top and table). The voxel weights on the pattern, reflecting local contributions to overall network activity, were found to be stable by bootstrap estimation (absolute value of the inverse coefficient of variation range 5 [22.822 to 2.814], p , 0.005, 1,000 iterations). The ADRP was topographically unrelated to the PDCP (r 2 5 0.013, voxel weight correlation, figure 1B, top). It is worth noting that the ADRP exhibited some correlation with the PDRP, although the relationship did not reach significance (r 2 5 0.123, voxel-weight correlation); there are shared regional metabolic reductions involving the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally, which are more salient for ADRP than PDRP 11 (see e-Methods). ADRP subject scores (figure 1A, bottom), which measure pattern expression in individual cases, were consistently elevated in patients with AD relative to their healthy counterparts (p , 0.0003, permutation test).\nFor validation, we used an automated algorithm to quantify ADRP expression in the ADNI (AD2 and NL2) and FIMR (AD3 and NL3) testing sets on a prospective single-scan basis. As in the derivation sample, ADRP subject scores ( figure 1A, bottom) were markedly elevated in patients relative to controls in both AD testing sets (AD2, p , 0.0001; AD3, p , 0.004, Student t tests). In contrast to the ADRP, expression values for the PDCP (figure 1B, bottom) did not differ from normal in the derivation set (p 5 0.74) or in either of the testing sets (AD2, p 5 0.14; AD3, p 5 0.63). There was no discernible correlation between ADRP and PDCP expression values in the AD patient sample (p . 0.34) or between ADRP or PDCP expression and subject age (p . 0.18).\nIn patients with AD, neuropsychological scores correlated with ADRP but not PDCP expression levels. We used the summary score data for memory, language, and executive functioning provided by the ADNI database, 27 which included data from a variety of measures, depending on which tests were administered (e-Methods). Summary scores for each of the 3 cognitive domains correlated with ADRP expression in the combined AD cohorts: the worse the summary score, the more elevated the expression of ADRP (memory: Cognitive impairment in patients with PD correlates with expression of PDCP but not ADRP. As expected, 18 the PD cohort showed PDCP expression (p , 0.0005) that increased as cognitive impairment worsened (F 3,85 5 3.42, p , 0.03, 1-way ANOVA, figure 3A ). Patients with PD also expressed ADRP (p , 0.05, Student t tests), but there was no association with the degree of cognitive impairment (F 3,85 5 1.61, p 5 0.19, 1-way ANOVA). Indeed, ADRP levels were similarly elevated (p , 0.02, Student t test) in all patients with PD ( figure 3B ), including the cognitively intact PD-MCI(2) group, which showed modest elevations in both PDCP and ADRP expression relative to healthy controls (ADRP, p , 0.01; PDCP, p , 0.04, Student t tests); the level of pattern expression in these participants (subject scores z1.0) was similar for the 2 topographies (p 5 0.76 for comparison of ADRP and PDCP subject scores, paired Student t test). In the cognitively impaired PD-MCI(m) and PDD subgroups, PDCP expression was greater than ADRP [PD-MCI(m), p 5 0.001; PDD, p , 0.04, paired Student t tests]. The entire PD data set showed a clear network 3 subgroup interaction (F 3,85 5 3.78, PDCP, but not ADRP, expression levels correlate with neuropsychological measures in patients with PD. We chose the cognitive measures for our PD cohorts to match the ADNI composite measures as closely as possible, and we used a similar approach to compute the analogous summary scores (e-Methods). Consistent with MCI classification, neuropsychological summary figure 3D, left) . There was a weak correlation between PDCP expression and memory impairment (r 5 20.22, p , 0.04) but not with language deficits (r 5 20.09, p 5 0.42, data not shown). ADRP values, in contrast, did not correlate with cognitive performance in any of the 3 domains (p . 0.56, figure 3D, right) . Thus, in patients with AD, individual differences in memory, language, and executive function were reflected in ADRP but not PDCP expression. In patients with PD, in contrast, executive function had a clear relationship with PDCP expression but not with ADRP expression. DISCUSSION In this study, we used the distinct network topographies of AD and PD to investigate whether the cognitive deficits that commonly occur in patients with PD are more likely attributable to PD itself or to comorbidity with AD. Our analyses indicate that, despite overlapping regions of pathology, cognitive dysfunction in PD is largely distinct from that which occurs in AD. This is not to say, however, that some patients with PD may not also have AD. Although most of the 11 patients with PD with the most severe disease (PDD) had ADRP expression levels tightly clustered around the mean, 2 participants showed relatively high ADRP expression that remained elevated even after masking regions of ADRP/PDRP overlap in the parietal association cortex (ADRP: 2.63 and 2.00, subject score 5 0.98 6 0.76 for the remaining 9 PDD cases; ADRP': 1.40 and 1.85, subject score 5 0.29 6 0.86 for the remaining 9 cases). Even more strikingly, the patient with PDD with the highest ADRP' expression was also exceptional in expressing almost normal PDCP levels; this patient most likely has true comorbid AD. It is worth noting that our metabolic network findings complement structural imaging data showing AD-like volumetric changes in the cerebral cortex of patients with PD. 28 The pattern of volume loss seen with structural MRI in patients with AD 29 exhibits some topographic homology with ADRP but not with PDCP; it is possible that Lewy-and Alzheimer-type pathologies affect cognition differently in individuals with PD. 6 From a clinical standpoint, it is important for physicians and patients to recognize that cognitive dysfunction in PD is likely not caused by comorbid AD. Furthermore, the disease specificity of ADRP and PDCP provides a distinct contrast with resting-state networks found in healthy controls such as the default mode network that show progressive attrition in both disease populations. 30 To fully articulate the relationship of the observed imaging changes with the underlying disease process will require multimodal imaging in conjunction with molecular genetic analyses and thorough postmortem assessments. In the meanwhile, having objective imaging biomarkers to differentiate between underlying pathologies will help with prognosis, selection of participants for clinical trials, and choice of treatments when they become available."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Dr. Mattis: study design, data acquisition, statistical analysis, data analysis and interpretation, and drafting and revising of the manuscript for intellectual content.
