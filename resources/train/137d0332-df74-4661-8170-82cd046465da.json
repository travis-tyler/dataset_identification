The progressive nature of this disease has been confirmed by landmark studies, such as the Olmstedt County Study [2] and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [3] . The search for the optimal surgical treatment for large prostate burdens (>80 mL) is unremitting and remains the subject of continued conjecture and debate [4] . Before the advent of endoscopic approaches, simple open prostatectomy (OP) surgery was the prerogative and still is the only option in certain developing countries [5] . Despite a decline in the number of open procedures carried out each year in western countries, it remains a core component of the urologist's therapeutic arsenal [6] .\nHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is an efficient, laser-based, transurethral alternative, which is both minimally invasive and has been cited as 'size independent' [7] . Its application has achieved diffusion across centres worldwide with 10-year outcome data now available. While there has been increased attention towards the efficacy of HoLEP vs its endourological alternatives such as TURP and photo-selective vapourisation of the prostate, formal evaluation of HoLEP compared with simple prostatectomy [OP, laparoscopic simple prostatectomy (LASP), and robotassisted simple prostatectomy (RASP)] remains under reported.\nThe objective of the present study was to systematically review the evidence and compare the efficacy and safety between HoLEP and simple prostatectomy."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "A systematic search was conducted according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) checklist [8] Phrases were combined using Boolean operators ('AND', 'OR') to augment the search.

The commonest Clavien-Dindo Grade I complication in the HoLEP group was dysuria (27.7%) and in the OP group it was transitory urge incontinence (23.2%) ( Table 4 ). In the sub-analysis of complications according to Clavien-Dindo Grade, the only statistically significant difference was seen amongst Grade II complications, where the results of the metaanalysis favoured HoLEP (P = 0.02; WMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.82). For Grade I complications, the results favoured OP; however, this was not statistically significant. For Grade III, IV and V complications, the trend in results favoured HoLEP, but again this superiority was not statistically significant. There was one death in the OP group, with none in the HoLEP group.\nThere were no differences in the total number of complications between the two interventions. This lack of difference in the overall complication rate may be compounded by insufficient power amongst the included studies. Across the studies, the mean rating according to Martin Criteria was 4.3/10 ( Table 5) . Reasons for a low score included poor evidence of risk stratification and poor indication of the method used in the studies. None of the included studies used a grading system to classify the severity of complications. Of note, Salonia et al. [13] did not report on complications at all. None of the studies recorded sexual function as an outcome measure, an important marker of disease burden and a strong determinant for patient choice of intervention. None of the studies included in the present review provided data on re-intervention for symptom recurrence."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that HoLEP and OP possess similar overall efficacy profiles for both objective and subjective disease status outcome measures. The present review shows these improvements persist to at least the 24-month follow-up point. However, in the perioperative period, patients undergoing HoLEP spend significantly fewer hours in hospital and are catheterised for a significantly shorter period."}, {"section_title": "Efficacy and safety", "text": "While OP retrieves greater tissue volumes and carries the advantage of a shorter operative time, it is associated with a significantly greater drop in haemoglobin. Elshal et al. [17] reported that 24.5% of patients had required a blood transfusion after OP in a retrospective analysis of 163 patients at their institution. Such are the haemostatic advantages associated with HoLEP, Tyson et al. [18] determined it to be a safe alternative to TURP for patients on oral anticoagulation therapy.\nThe lower volumes of tissue retrieved by HoLEP may well be confounded by the effects of tissue vapourisation [19] , which has been estimated to equate to an %10% tissue loss. Elkoushy et al. [19] recently published findings from a single-centre large series of 1216 HoLEP procedures conducted between 1998 and 2013, and recorded a re-operation-free probability of 95% at 10 years."}, {"section_title": "Cost efficacy", "text": "With the heavy economic burden of healthcare, the net cost of a surgical procedure is an important consideration. Salonia et al. [13] compared the perioperative costs for OP vs HoLEP ($3556.3 vs $2919.4). Overall, there was a percentage net cost saving of 9.6% in favour of HoLEP. HoLEP may yield financial advantages for an institution over time, especially given the potential use of the holmium: yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser as a lithotripter and cost savings achieved through shorter length of stays. However, the cost burden of the initial set up is high [6] . This, as well as the specialist training required has already proved to be a barrier to the implementation of laser therapies across less developed countries [6] ."}, {"section_title": "Learning curve", "text": "Dialogue continues amongst urologists about the true learning curve associated with HoLEP [20] . Gilling et al. [21] have advised dissemination of formal mentorship programmes, which should incorporate elements of focused preparation, observation in theatre, and formal supervision. These tutored courses are typically only delivered by specialist centres and made possible through financial support from companies marketing HoLEP technology. Lack of such didactic opportunities has led to many surgeons adopting a self-taught method for HoLEP, which is thought to be one of the principle reasons the learning curve has been reported by many as protracted. Vincent et al. [22] have proposed that mentorship initiatives can allow the HoLEP technique to be learnt safely after 10 cases."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations of the review", "text": "The main limitation of the present review was the small number of included studies. However, these were all RCTs and each with a low overall risk of bias. A further limitation is the time at which these studies were performed, which was as early as 2002. Given HoLEP was still evolving at this time and associated with a steeper learning curve compared with now, the recorded HoLEP outcomes are likely to be limited accordingly. For example, advances in morcellation technique(s) have resulted in shorter operative times. Such technology was not available for Kuntz et al. [14] at the beginning of their study; therefore the enucleated adenoma was resected using traditional techniques. Unfortunately, Kuntz et al. do not state after how many cases the morcellator was introduced. This represents the major technical difference across the studies. Moreover, information on technical points is limited across the three studies. Each study referenced the surgical technique for HoLEP described by Gilling et al. [23, 24] ; however, the authors of the respective studies have provided little additional information thereafter. Only Naspro et al. [12] commented that they adopted the traditional transvesical approach for OP, the other two studies did not mention any details on it at all. A recent matched pair analysis of 92 HoLEP and 91 transvesical OP procedures, published by Elshal et al. [25] has confirmed many of the advantages of HoLEP identified by these early randomised studies. The authors reported a median hospital stay of 2 days in the HoLEP group vs 9 days in the OP group (P < 0.001).\nNo studies were identified, which compared HoLEP with minimally invasive simple prostatectomy (LASP/ RASP). Although clinical equipoise persists for OP and HoLEP, randomisation of open vs minimally invasive therapies is difficult to justify and is likely the principal reason the number of RCTs identified in this review was low. For the same reasons, it is likely to remain this way in the future. Whether the urology community settles with this or goes on to carry out formal randomisation of RASP or LASP vs OP for large prostate burdens remains to be determined. The method itself of true blunt enucleation performed during HoLEP is comparable to that of OP using finger enucleation. However, it carries the advantages of augmented visual control of bleeding allowing for fewer complications and overall shorter hospital stay.\nThe present review was strengthened through its systematic approach and using methodology based on Cochrane review standards. Indeed, we think this is the first systematic review to compare simple OP and HoLEP.\nFurther randomised studies are warranted to fully determine the optimal surgical intervention for large prostate burdens. These should be conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and standardised grading of complications [26] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "OP and HoLEP are both effective and durable surgical interventions for the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH. Given the clinically relevant advantages associated with HoLEP, such as shorter catheterisation time and hospital stay, the ascendance of this viable laser therapy is likely to continue amongst the urology community. Nonetheless, over a century in clinical practice, OP remains a valuable intervention in the urologist's armamentarium. However, with growing economic pressures and the evolution of minimally invasive therapies, its presence will potentially fade."}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of interest", "text": "None declared."}, {"section_title": "Source of funding", "text": "None."}]
