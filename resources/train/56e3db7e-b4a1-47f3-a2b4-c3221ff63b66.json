[{"section_title": "", "text": "Containment strategies and clinical management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients during the current pandemic depend on reliable diagnostic PCR assays for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we compare 11 different RT-PCR test systems used in seven diagnostic laboratories in Germany in March 2020. While most assays performed well, we identified detection problems in a commonly used assay that may have resulted in false-negative test results during the first weeks of the pandemic.\nStrategies to limit the severe pandemic and to manage coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients strongly depend on readily available, accurate and reliable RT-PCR assays to detect the genome of the causative agent acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in biosamples. The first full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was made publicly available in early January 2020 [1] and, soon after, various RT-PCR assays were reported by academic laboratories, public health agencies and diagnostics companies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Their overall performance and relative sensitivity are largely unclear.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the inter-laboratory and inter-method sensitivity of different RT-PCR assays by providing a blinded, frozen dilution series of a nucleic acid extract of a highly positive biosample to seven different diagnostic laboratories in Germany in March 2020."}, {"section_title": "Sample preparation and study design", "text": "Nucleic acids were pooled from multiple extractions of one SARS-CoV-2-positive stool sample using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). This stool sample was from a 5-year-old child with COVID-19 [7] and was chosen because of high initial PCR signals and sufficient sample availability to generate large quantities of eluate for further distribution. Of note, no PCR inhibition was observed for detection of the spiked-in extraction RNA control (QuantiNova IC Probe Assays Red 650, Qiagen). A 1:10 dilution series was prepared and aliquots were labelled in a blinded fashion to be shipped on dry ice to participating laboratories in March 2020. Participants were instructed to perform the diagnostic assays used at their centre for SARS-CoV-2 detection in quadruplicate using 5 \u00b5L of the aliquot per reaction. All results were reported back to the initiating laboratory (Laboratory 1) before the results were unblinded. The details of all these PCR-based assays are summarised in Table 1. In parallel, samples were quantified using the One-\nStep RT-digital droplet (dd)PCR Advanced Kit for Probes (BioRad, Feldkirchen, Germany) on the BioRad QX200 platform. Primer and probe sequences were used for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N) as published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] "}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Digital droplet PCR quantification of the distributed dilution series of nucleic acid eluate of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical material, Germany, March 2020 The undiluted sample showed between 4,325 and 5,015 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction using 5 \u00b5L of eluate for the CDC N1, N2, N3 and Charit\u00e9 E protocols, but only 850 and 1,951 RNA copies for the Charit\u00e9 N and P primer/probe combinations ( Figure  1A) , respectively, indicating a lower sensitivity of the latter. The 1:10 dilution series displayed good linearity down to a calculated concentration of 0.4 RNA copies per reaction at the 10 \u22124 dilution for both the CDC N1 and N2 primer/probe combinations ( Figure 1B )."}, {"section_title": "Multicentre and multi-assay comparison", "text": "Result interpretations from the seven participating laboratories are summarised in Figure 2 displaying the number of replicates scored positive by the respective laboratory for each method and dilution. Most methods reliably detected the sample at the 10 \u22123 dilution, which is equivalent to ca 5 RNA copies for the CDC N1, N2, N3 and Charit\u00e9 E reactions based on the absolute quantification by ddPCR. Of note, the Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay gave negative results for all four replicates in the E gene at the 10 \u22123 dilution, while reporting positive results for N and RdRp (Laboratory 1). According to the manufacturer's instructions at the time of analysis, this would have been interpreted as an inconclusive result. Of note, the RdRp primer/probe did not show any positive result at the 10 \u22124 dilution."}, {"section_title": "Sequence analysis of primer pairs", "text": "Driven by false-negative results for samples with low PCR-positivity using the original Charit\u00e9 RdRp reaction (see below and others [8, 9] ), we compared the primer/ probe sequences with currently available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. When compared with all genomes available on GISAID (9,184 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on 15 April 2020, Supplement), the regions used for amplification in the CDC and Charit\u00e9 protocol are highly conserved: Only 1.55%, 0.45% and 2.4% of genome sequences contain any kind of mismatch within the primer/ probe regions of the CDC N1, N2 and N3 protocols, respectively, and 0.25%, 0.29% and 0.67% in the primer/probe regions of the Charit\u00e9 E, RdRp and N pro tocols, respectively.\nThe Charit\u00e9 RdRp reverse primer contains an ambiguity base at position 15,519 that does not match the reference sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1/2019), with an S (i.e. G or C) instead of T for the reverse complement (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The other ambiguity base at 15,528 showing Y (i.e. C or T) should be changed to T because the currently circulating viruses have a T at this position and no polymorphisms were detected in any of the 9,184 sequences submitted to date (accession date: 15 April 2020). Based on computation using Primer Express v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Dreieich, Germany) annealing temperatures were predicted to be 64 \u00b0C for the RdRp forward and 51 \u00b0C for the RdRp reverse primer of the Charit\u00e9 protocol. This temperature difference may result in reduced PCR efficiency. To address this issue, modified RdRp primers were synthesised as shown in Supplementary Figure  S1 and tested in comparison with the original primers."}, {"section_title": "Differential detection of respiratory samples with low PCR positivity", "text": "Testing the dilution series with these modified RdRp primers (see above and Supplementary Figure S1 ) yielded positive results for two additional dilution steps (10 -3 and 10 -4 ) compared with the original Charit\u00e9 RdRp primers ( Figure 1 ). To further compare the sensitivity of these modified RdRp primers with the original version of the Charit\u00e9 RdRp primers and the Charit\u00e9 E and the CDC N1 reaction, we retested 28 eluates of clinical respiratory specimens from the diagnostic unit at Laboratory 1 that had shown crossing point (Cp) values > 35 in the initial CDC N1 reaction. Using the original version of the confirmatory Charit\u00e9 RdRp primers, 16 of 28 samples tested negative, but 11 of these showed positive results using the modified primers ( Figure 3) . Overall, the detection by the Charit\u00e9 E, modified Charit\u00e9 RdRp, and CDC N1 reactions were robust. Notably, six and seven of these 28 respiratory samples scored negative or at the limit of detection (Cp = 40) in the Charit\u00e9 E and modified Charit\u00e9 RdRp reactions, while only one sample came up negative in retesting in the CDC N1 reaction (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, chi-squared-test comparing Charit\u00e9 E and modified RdRp to CDC N1, respectively). Of note, in a routine clinical setting, the CDC N1 reaction also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nucleic acid extracts from 37 of 83 sera (45%) from COVID-19 patients in intensive care units, with a positive correlation of their Cp values with those of the corresponding respiratory material (Spearman Rank correlation co-efficient r=0.4285, p (two-tailed) < 0.0001 (data not shown))."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The majority of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 examined in this study detected ca 5 RNA copies per reaction, reflecting a high sensitivity and their suitability for screening purposes world-wide. A reduced sensitivity was noted for the original Charit\u00e9 RdRp gene confirmatory protocol, which may have impacted the confirmation of some COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. The protocol needs to be amended to improve the sensitivity of the RdRp reaction. The CDC N1 primer/probe set was sensitive and robust for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nucleic acid extracts from respiratory material, stool and serum from COVID-19 patients."}]
