[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: Early hospital readmission is a common and costly problem in the Medicare population. In 2009, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services began mandating hospital reporting of disease-specific readmission rates. We sought to determine the rate and predictors of readmission after colectomy for cancer, as well as the association between readmission and mortality. Methods: Medicare beneficiaries who underwent colectomy for stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma from 1992 to 2002 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of early readmission and 1-year mortality. Odds ratios were adjusted for multiple factors, including measures of comorbidity, socioeconomic status, and disease severity. Results: Of 42,348 patients who were discharged, 4662 (11.0%) were readmitted within 30 days. The most common causes of rehospitalization were ileus/obstruction and infection. Significant predictors of readmission included male gender, comorbidity, emergent admission, prolonged hospital stay, blood transfusion, ostomy, and discharge to nursing home. Readmission was inversely associated with hospital procedure volume, but not surgeon volume. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the predicted probability of 1-year mortality was 16% for readmitted patients, compared with 7% for those not readmitted. This difference in mortality was significant for all stages of cancer. Conclusions: Early readmission after colectomy for cancer is common and due in part to modifiable factors. There is a remarkable association between readmission and 1-year mortality. Early readmission is therefore an impor-tant quality-of-care indicator for colon cancer surgery. These findings may facilitate the development of targeted interventions that will decrease readmissions and improve patient outcomes.\nE arly hospital readmissions are common and costly. In the Medicare population, almost 20% of hospital stays are followed by readmission within 30 days. Unplanned rehospitalizations led to an estimated $17.4 billion in Medicare expenditures in 2004. 1 Some early readmissions are due to factors such as patient frailty or progression of disease, but others are the result of poor quality care and are preventable. 2 While investigators have reported populationbased readmission rates for older adults with a variety of diagnoses, 1,3-5 the rate and causes of readmission after surgery for colon cancer, a common malignancy in the Medicare population, are unknown. The current study addresses this gap in the literature. Using population-level data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we determined the rate of early readmission after colectomy for colon adenocarcinoma and identified patient-, disease-, and treatment-related risk factors for readmission. We also examined the relationship between early readmission and 1-year mortality. An understanding of the frequency, causes, and consequences of rehospitalization may facilitate the development of interventions, which will decrease readmissions, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing health care expenditures."}, {"section_title": "Patients", "text": "All Medicare-enrolled patients aged 66 years and older diagnosed with primary colon adenocarcinoma in a SEER area from 1992 to 2002 were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Included patients had a diagnosis of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III colon (SEER cancer site codes 18.0 -18.9, and 19.9) adenocarcinoma (SEER histology codes 8140 -47, 8210 -11, 8220 -21, 8260 -63, 8480 -81, and 8490). Patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (histology code 8470) were excluded because the natural history of this disease, which occurs in the appendix and is associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei, is different than other histologic subtypes of colon adenocarcinoma. 8 We also excluded patients with rectal cancer because the surgical treatment of rectal cancer (eg, abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy) is different from that of colon cancer, is often more technically challenging, and may be associated with a higher rate of complications. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in parts A and B of fee-for-service Medicare for the 12 months preceding cancer diagnosis to ascertain comorbidity and for an additional 2 months after surgical discharge or until death to enable capture of early readmissions. Patients enrolled in health maintenance organizations were excluded. We included patients who underwent primary tumor resection, corresponding to International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure 45 .7X (partial excision of large intestine) and 45 .8X (total intra-abdominal colectomy). We excluded patients if they did not undergo tumor resection within 6 months of diagnosis. Patients were also excluded if they were diagnosed with another malignancy 1 year before or after the date of colon cancer diagnosis, or if their first diagnosis of colon cancer was made after death (ie, on autopsy)."}, {"section_title": "Outcome Variable", "text": "The primary outcome measure was 30-day readmission. We used the 30-day interval because most preventable readmissions have been found to occur within 1 month of discharge. 2, 9, 10 Readmission to any acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge after colon cancer resection was designated as a 30-day readmission. Hospital-to-hospital transfers were not considered readmissions. Readmissions to psychiatric hospitals and rehabilitation facilities were also excluded. Readmission diagnoses were classified using Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classifications Software.\nA secondary outcome measure, mortality within 1 year of surgical discharge, was created based on dates of death recorded in the Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File (PEDSF) according to Social Security Administration data. Patients who died during the initial surgical hospital stay were excluded from the denominator in calculations of readmission rate and 1-year mortality rate."}, {"section_title": "Predictor Variables", "text": "Information on date of birth, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity were obtained from the SEER database.

We also recorded the number of hospitalizations for each individual in the year prior to cancer diagnosis.\nIn addition to the patient-related variables described above, we measured a variety of disease-related variables. SEER data provided American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and tumor grade.

Due to the inability of SEER-Medicare data to identify minor complications, 12 we used the approach described by Morris et al, in which only those complications that resulted in reoperation or other procedural intervention were recorded. 13 Average annual procedure volume was determined using ICD-9 procedure codes for hospitals and CPT codes for surgeons, using the method previously described by Schrag et al. 14 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "We determined the overall frequency of 30-day readmissions after colectomy for colon cancer.

The adjusted OR of 1-year mortality for readmitted versus non-readmitted patients was 2.44 (95% CI, 2.25-2.65). The magnitude of this association was comparable to the difference in 1-year mortality between patients with stage III and stage I disease (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 2.26 -2.76) and patients older than 85 versus those aged between 66 and 70 years (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.36 -3.08).

Interestingly, a majority of the variables that predicted early readmission were also significant predictors of 1-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant difference in probability of 1-year survival between readmitted and non-readmitted patients for all cancer stages (Fig. 2) . After adjustment for potential confounders, the predicted probabilities of 1-year mortality were also significantly different between readmitted and non-readmitted patients ( Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Until recently, hospitals have had little financial incentive to minimize readmissions as Medicare pays for all hospitalizations based on the diagnosis, regardless of whether the admission is an initial hospital stay or a readmission. 15 However, recent policy developments indicate that this culture is changing. In 2007, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission proposed mandatory reporting of risk-adjusted readmission rates, with eventual penalties for hospitals with high rates. 15 In 2009, CMS began requiring hospitals to report 30-day readmission rates for patients with several medical conditions. 16 These increased reporting requirements may reflect the recognition that readmissions not only lead to increased health care utilization and expenditures, but are also often preventable. Because rehospitalization has clear links to health care costs and modifiable processes of inpatient care, health services researchers, policy makers, and payers have increasingly used readmission as a quality-of-care measure. 2, 17, 18 Information on predictors of readmission is needed for the development of interventions that will decrease readmissions and improve patient outcomes.\nColon cancer is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. A total of 148,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States. 19 Surgical resection performed in the in-patient hospital setting is the standard of care for localized disease. Despite the high incidence of colon cancer and the frequency of surgical treatment, the rate and predictors of readmission after colon cancer surgery have not previously been systematically studied using population-level data. Previous studies have consisted of single-institution retrospective case series. In these reports, which have often combined patients with benign and malignant diseases, readmission rates range widely from 0% to 27%. 5,20 -36 Only one previous study, by Goodney et al, was based on population-level data. 5 In the current study, we used the SEER-Medicare linked database to determine the rate, causes, and consequences of readmission after colectomy for cancer. We found that 11.0% of pa- tients-almost 1 in 9 -were readmitted within 1 month of discharge. Most readmissions occurred within the first 10 days after discharge. The most common readmission diagnoses were ileus/ obstruction and other gastrointestinal complications, surgical site infection, pneumonia and other respiratory complications, bleeding and anemia, and sepsis. After adjusting for other factors, significant predictors of 30-day readmission included male gender, Asian race, hospitalization in the prior year, comorbidity, emergent admission, low hospital procedure volume, prolonged length of hospital stay, perioperative blood transfusion, associated ostomy, postoperative complication requiring an additional procedure, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility. Furthermore, we found a striking association between 30-day readmission and 1-year mortality, comparable to other well-established predictors of mortality, such as old age and advanced cancer stage. Many of the variables that predicted readmission were also significantly associated with 1-year mortality. The SEER-Medicare database has several advantages for the study of readmission. It contains information on a wide array of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors. Results based on national-level SEER-Medicare data may be more generalizable to the population at large compared with findings from studies conducted at specialized academic medical centers. Importantly, SEER-Medicare allows the tracking of patients from one hospital to another. Therefore, we were able to detect readmissions to any hospital, not only readmissions to the hospital where the original surgery was performed. We found that over 13% of readmissions were to another hospital. Single-institution retrospective studies are likely to underestimate the rate of readmission. CMS and other payers should be cognizant of this risk of underestimation before implementing programs based on self-report by hospitals or providers. The rate of rehospitalization in our study population was almost identical to the readmission rate of 11.1% calculated by Goodney et al for patients with colon cancer treated with colectomy in their analysis of national Medicare data from 1994 to 1999. 5 Higher population-based readmission rates have been reported for coronary artery bypass surgery and other complex cancer operations such as pneumonectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection. 5, 37 In the year 2000, approximately 96,300 colon cancer resections were performed in the United States, and by 2020 this figure is predicted to increase to 141,100 operations. 38 Clearly, a readmission rate of almost 1 in 9 for patients undergoing this common procedure represents a significant problem from a clinical, public health, and health policy perspective.\nWe found that most readmissions after hospitalization for colon cancer surgery occurred on the day after discharge and shortly thereafter. The median day of readmission was postdischarge day 9. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown the hospital readmissions cluster shortly after discharge and then decline in frequency. 2, 23, 32 Readmissions that occur soon after surgical discharge are likely to be related to surgical complications, poor discharge planning, or other modifiable factors.\nOur study included an analysis of the reasons for readmission. The most common causes of readmission were ileus/obstruction and other gastrointestinal complications, surgical site infection, pneumonia and other respiratory complications, bleeding and anemia, and sepsis. These clinical entities are all potentially preventable complications of surgical care. Similarly, an analysis of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in New York found that 85% of readmissions were directly related to potentially preventable surgical complications. 37 Our findings regarding the timing and causes of rehospitalization support the use of 30-day readmission as a quality-ofsurgical-care indicator.\nIn their study on early readmissions in the Medicare program, Jencks et al concluded that over 70% of readmissions after surgical discharges were due to \"medical conditions.\" 1 However, in patients who underwent \"major bowel surgery,\" they reported the most frequent reasons for rehospitalization were \"GI problems\" (15.9%), postoperative infection (6.4%), \"nutrition-related or metabolic issues\" (5.6%), and gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction (4.3%). Rather than medical conditions, we would characterize these readmission diagnoses as potentially preventable surgical complications, which is consistent with our findings regarding the causes of readmission after colectomy for cancer.\nWhile numerous investigators have estimated the readmission rate after colorectal surgery, relatively few have identified the predictors of readmission. In a prospective, multicenter study of 1421 patients undergoing colorectal surgery in France, Guinier et al identified 5 statistically significant predictors of readmission: surgical field contamination, long operative duration, need for an additional surgical procedure, low hemoglobin, and lack of air leak testing of the bowel anastomosis. 31 Kiran et al at the Cleveland Clinic conducted a retrospective study to identify predictors of 30-day readmission after colorectal surgery for benign and malignant diseases. They found 2 variables that were significantly associated with readmission: longer hospital stay and use of corticosteroids. 32 In contrast to the French multicenter study, low discharge hemoglobin level was not a significant predictor of readmission. Another single-institution study by a group in Allentown, Pennsylvania, did not yield any significant predictors of rehospitalization after elective colorectal surgery, leading them to conclude, \"readmissions after colorectal surgery cannot be predicted.\" 22 However, this study was limited by a relatively small sample size (n \u03ed 249).\nTo our knowledge, the current study is the first to identify predictors of early readmission after colon cancer surgery in a population-based sample. Our multivariate analysis identified several significant predictors of readmission after colon cancer resection in this cohort of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 and older. The odds of readmission were higher for males than females. Gonzalez et al, in a prospective cohort study, also reported a significantly higher risk of readmission in men versus women treated for colorectal cancer in Spain. 39 Similarly, in a study of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent surgical treatment of colorectal cancer, Morris et al found an elevated relative risk of postoperative complications requiring procedural intervention in males compared with females. 13 We adjusted for postoperative complication in our multivariate model, yet the increased odds of readmission for males persisted.\nBlack-white racial disparities in risk factors, screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes such as mortality have been extensively documented for colon cancer patients. 40 -45 Previous studies have also reported the higher rates of readmission for African-Americans with stroke, diabetes mellitus, and asthma. 46 After adjustment for socioeconomic and clinical factors, we did not observe a significant difference in odds of readmission for black versus white patients after colectomy. Interestingly, compared with white patients, Asian patients had higher odds of readmission, but lower odds of 1-year mortality.\nOther significant predictors of readmission included hospitalization in the year prior to surgery, higher comorbidity score, emergent admission, in-hospital complication, blood transfusion, and prolonged length of stay. Short duration of surgical hospital stay was not associated with increased readmission. However, we did observe a statistically significant trend of increased readmissions in later years. Our study period precedes the widespread implementation of \"fast track\" colorectal surgery protocols, and relatively few patients in our sample were discharged after hospital stays of 4 days or less. Future analyses should examine the impact of fast track protocols and laparoscopic surgery on the national early readmission rate after colectomy for cancer.\nWe found that low hospital procedure volume, but not low surgeon procedure volume, was associated with increased readmission as well as increased 1-year mortality. Similarly, in their study of outcomes after primary colon cancer surgery, Schrag et al concluded that hospital volume exerted a stronger effect than surgeon volume. 14 Goodney et al also studied the association between hospital volume and readmission after colectomy for cancer in a Medicare population. They concluded that the association between hospital volume and readmission, while statistically significant, was not clinically meaningful. 5 In our study, the difference in readmission rates in low compared with high volume hospitals (12% for the lowest volume tertile vs. 10% for the highest volume tertile) was small but clinically significant.\nAn important finding of our study is that readmission was associated with increased 1-year mortality. A similar association between readmission and increased mortality has been reported for patients with lung cancer treated with pulmonary resection. 47 Conversely, readmitted patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at Johns Hopkins actually had improved survival compared with patients who were not readmitted. 48 In our study, the majority of factors that predicted readmission also predicted mortality. The observation that 1-year mortality is higher for readmitted versus non-readmitted colon cancer surgery patients further supports the validity of readmission as a quality-of-care indicator.\nOur study has several limitations. Because our study is limited to the Medicare population, the results may not apply to colon cancer patients younger than 65 years of age. However, the risk of colon cancer is known to increase with age, and the average age of diagnosis for patients with nonhereditary colon cancer is over 65 years. 49 Also, because our study is based on claims data, we were unable to analyze clinical variables often used to assess \"readiness for discharge,\" such as patient symptoms, vital signs, laboratory values, bowel function, diet tolerance, and activity level. Claims data are also not well suited for the study of variables related to surgical technique, for example hand-sewn versus stapled bowel anastomosis. Finally, other than marital status, our analysis did not include measures of social support, another factor that may influence the risk of readmission after surgery. It is likely that some of these factors which we did not measure are also important risk factors for early readmission after colectomy for cancer. Unmeasured factors may also be responsible in part for the observed association between readmission and 1-year mortality.\nDespite these limitations, this study has important implications. We have demonstrated that readmission after colon cancer surgery is common, readmissions cluster in the days immediately following discharge, and most causes of readmission are potentially preventable. This is the first study based on population-level data to identify multiple predictors of early readmission after colon cancer resection. While some significant predictors such as gender are not modifiable, others are related to structures and processes of care, such as hospital volume and blood transfusion. Importantly, our results show that early readmission is significantly associated with increased 1-year mortality. Interestingly, many of the same variables that predicted readmission also predicted 1-year mortality. We conclude that readmission is an important quality-of-care measure for colon cancer surgery. An understanding of the rate and predictors of readmission is a crucial first step in the process of developing targeted interventions that will reduce readmissions, decrease expenditures, and improve patient outcomes."}]
