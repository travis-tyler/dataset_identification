It is usually implicitly assumed that these OQSs are uniform, in the sense that the psychological proximity between all the pairs of consecutive terms of the OQS is perceived as identical.\nSome OQSs with an odd number of linguistic terms are devised as uniform by fixing a neutral central linguistic term and arranging the other terms around it symmetrically (e.g. the 5-term OQS {'very bad', 'bad', 'regular', 'good', 'very good'}). However, not all OQSs with an odd number of linguistic terms are necessarily uniform 1 .\nOQSs with an even number of linguistic terms do not have a neutral central linguistic term. Consequently, it is easier to find non-uniform OQSs in even cases than in odd ones. For instance, the 4-term OQS {'reject', 'major revision', 'minor revision', 'accept'} used by some scientific journals in evaluating papers can be understood as non-uniform (see Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [11, 2.4] for empirical evidence). Another example of an OQS with an even number of linguistic terms is provided by Balinski and Laraki [1] when they introduce the Majority Judgment voting system. These authors consider the 6-term OQS {'to reject', 'poor', 'acceptable', 'good', 'very good', 'excellent'} for evaluating candidates in political elections. Again, it is not clear that this scale is uniform.\nThere are numerous contributions in the literature that deal with nonuniform OQSs that follow fuzzy techniques involving cardinal approaches (see Herrera-Viedma and L\u00f3pez-Herrera [17] , Herrera et al. [16] , among others).\nOther authors tackle non-uniform OQSs by means of ordinal ranges avoiding either cardinal or ordinal measurements of the proximities between linguistic terms (see Franceschini et al. [9] ).\nTo deal with non-uniform OQSs in a purely ordinal way via psychological proximities between linguistic terms of OQSs, Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [11] introduce the notion of ordinal proximity measure. This new ap-1 Question HS140 in the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey conducted by Eurostat uses the 3-term OQS {'a heavy burden', 'somewhat a burden', 'not burden at all'} for asking individuals about the financial burden of total housing cost. In this OQS the central term is not neutral, so it is not clear that the scale is uniform.\nproach has some similarities with difference measurement within classical measurement theory (see Krantz et al. [18, chapter 4] and Roberts [26, section 3.3] ), and with non-metric multidimensional scaling, where only the ranks of the psychological distances or proximities are known (see Bennett and Hays [2] , Shepard [27] , Coombs [4] , Kruskal and Wish [19] , Cox and Cox [5] and Borg and Groenen [3, chapter 9] , among others).\nGiven an OQS, the behavior of some ordinal proximity measures is better than others. This is why in this paper we introduce metrizable ordinal proximity measures. They behave as if the ordinal comparisons between the terms of an OQS were managed through a linear metric on the OQS 2 .\nFor instance, taking into account the above mentioned OQS {'reject', 'major revision', 'minor revision', 'accept'}, saying that 'minor revision' is closer to 'accept' than to 'major revision' is equivalent to saying that the numerical distance between 'minor revision' and 'accept' is shorter than the numerical distance between 'minor revision' and 'major revision', whatever the corresponding linear metric that generates the ordinal proximity measure 3 .\nDeciding whether a given OQS is uniform or not, and in the latter case determining what the ordinal proximities are between the terms of the scale is an important issue for constructing metrizable ordinal proximity measures.\nThis problem can be solved by a well-informed expert. However, sometimes the corresponding metrizable ordinal proximity measure is not easy to construct.\nIn this paper we present an algorithm which generates a metrizable ordinal proximity measure by means of appropriate sequences of questions about the proximities between the terms of the scale.\nIf a group of experts is asked about these proximities, they may have different opinions and different metrizable ordinal proximity measures may therefore emerge. In these situations, it is advisable to find a collective metrizable ordinal proximity measure that represents individual opinions as faithfully as possible.\nTherefore, an appropriate aggregation procedure is needed. This aggregation problem is not trivial, and different procedures can generate different outcomes 2 A linear metric on an OQS is a metric satisfying the requirement that the distance between two terms must be the sum of the distance between the first term and any intermediate term between the two given terms and the distance between that intermediate term and the second given term.\n3 Notice that this approach is similar to classical preference modeling of weak orders, where one alternative is preferred to another if and only if the utility of the first alternative is greater than the utility of the second, whatever the corresponding numerical utility function that represents the weak order may be."}, {"section_title": "and even inconsistencies.", "text": "To avoid these problems, we propose some solutions in this paper in the setting of judgment aggregation theory (see Dietrich and List [6] , List [22] , Mongin [24] and Grossi and Pigozzi [15] , among others). In particular, we have devised a weighted-metric-based procedure that provides the metrizable ordinal proximity measure that minimizes the sum of distances (square distances) between itself and the metrizable ordinal proximity measures of the experts. This procedure solves the aforementioned problems. It is illustrated with two real case studies.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces, analyzes and generates metrizable ordinal proximity measures.

In particular, for g = 4, following the algorithm included in Figure 4 , the corresponding metrizable OPMs are easily generated once between two and four questions have been answered. 7 As shown in the examples provided in Subsection 3.4, such a matrix cannot exist if condition (4) is not satisfied.\nmetric D w has been fixed, we find\ni.e., the solution of\nIf this set contains more than one metrizable OPM, a tie-breaking procedure needs to be applied.

In such cases, a tie-breaking procedure needs to be applied. As in Subsection 4.2, one possibility is to set a sequence of weighting functions and apply them lexicographically.\nExample 1. Table 3 shows the matrices associated with the OPMs of the 76 participants in the survey shown in Subsection 3.4 after the algorithm included in Figure 4 for g = 4 has been applied. If we consider D w for the weighting functions appearing in Remark 9, power weights for \u03b1 = 1, i.e., w(1) = 1, w(2) = is the metrizable OPM with associated matrix A 332 , just the same as the one obtained when absolute majority and closed qualified majorities are applied in Subsection 3.4.\nRemark 10. The sums appearing in 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 can be changed for an aggregation function F (for instance an OWA operator, such as the median or a trimmed mean, a quasiarithmetic mean, etc.). Thus, (8) and (9) become\nand arg respectively. For instance, in Example 1 if the power weighting function for \u03b1 = 1, i.e., w(1) = 1, w(2) = Example 2. In this example we apply the proposed procedure to a 4-term OQS used in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This study evaluates the home, community, school, and student factors associated with student achievement in mathematics and science at fourth and eighth grade levels in more than 60 countries. To that end, data is collected through questionnaires completed by students, parents, teachers, and school principals. The TIMSS has been conducted every four years since 1995. The latest data available is from TIMSS 2015 (see [28] ). In this example, a 4-term OQS used in TIMSS 2015 to assess some school problems (arriving late at school, vandalism, cheating, classroom disturbances, etc.) is considered. The linguistic terms of the scale appear in Table 4 As in Example 1, we carried out an on-line survey as to the proximities between the terms of the scale. A total of 19 Spanish school principals who participated in TIMSS 2015 contributed to this survey.\nThe algorithm included in Figure 4 for g = 4 is applied and the matrices associated with the OPMs of the 19 participants are then shown in Table 5 Considering D w for the same weighting functions as in Example 1, the metrizable OPM obtained using the median and the mean is the matrix A 332 ."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "Given an OQS, determining whether the scale is uniform or not (and if not what the ordinal proximities between the linguistic terms of the scale are) is an important issue. Our proposal is to ask some experts their opinions about these ordinal proximities and aggregate these opinions to obtain a metrizable OPM on the OQS. This is not a trivial problem, since inconsistencies could appear (see Section 3).\nWe propose various procedures for generating a metrizable OPM from the opinions of the experts, paying special attention to OQSs with three or four terms. Once this problem is solved, the OPM obtained can be used in different decision-making and classification problems in which agents show their opinions about a set of alternatives through an OQS equipped with a metrizable OPM: Measuring consensus in a group of agents on a subset of alternatives, and consensus-based clustering procedures, as in Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [11] ; consensus-reaching processes, as in Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [13] ;\nimplementing an appropriate voting system, such as the one introduced and analyzed in Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [14] ; etc.\nAs shown in Subsection 2.3, for g = 3, answering a single question is sufficient to assign the corresponding metrizable OPM; for g = 4, the number of questions should be between 2 and 4 (see As further research, the present analyses could be extended to the framework of intervals of linguistic terms, when agents are allowed to assign several consecutive terms of the OQS, if they hesitate (see Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n [12] and Garc\u00eda-Lapresta and Gonz\u00e1lez del Pozo [10] ).
