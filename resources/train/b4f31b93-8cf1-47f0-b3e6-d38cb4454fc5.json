[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Inflammation is becoming increasingly recognized as an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. As a part of the innate immune system, the complement cascade enhances the body's ability to destroy and remove pathogens and has recently been shown to influence Alzheimer's associated amyloid and tau pathology. However, little is known in humans about the effects of the complement system and genetic modifiers of AD risk like the \u03b54 allele of apolioprotein E (APOE \u03b54) on AD pathobiology. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels from 267 individuals clinically diagnosed as cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. Using linear models, we assessed the relationship between APOE \u03b54 genotype, CSF Complement 3 (C3), CSF amyloid-\u03b2 (amyloid) and CSF hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). We found a significant interaction between APOE \u03b54 and CSF C3 on both CSF amyloid and CSF ptau. We also found that CSF C3 is only associated with CSF ptau after accounting for CSF amyloid. Our results support a conceptual model of the AD pathogenic cascade where a synergistic relationship between the complement cascade (C3) and APOE \u03b54 results in elevated Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and in turn, amyloid further regulates the effect of the complement cascade on downstream tau pathology."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Converging experimental and human biomarker evidence suggests that the immune system plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology. In rodent models of AD, neuroinflammatory signals have been shown to correlate with amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) deposits as well as cognitive symptoms [23] . Observational studies in humans have shown that neuroinflammation, particularly the innate immune system, contributes to and drives AD pathogenesis [14] . Genetic studies in humans have identified a relationship between inflammatory and immune-associated genes and increased risk for AD [18] and have suggested that immune-mediated genes may contribute to Alzheimer's pathogenesis [32] .\nImportantly, several studies have demonstrated that the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein (APOE \u03b54), the most common genetic risk factor for AD, has an important role in immune and inflammatory processes underlying Alzheimer's neurodegeneration [6, 29] . Further, a recent study of epigenomic signals in mice and humans has implicated regulatory changes in immune response genes and immuneregulatory genes in AD [13] .\nRecent work suggests an association between inflammatory pathways, amyloid, and tau pathology. In mouse models, Complement C1q has been shown to be necessary for amyloid-\u03b2 associated synaptotoxicity [15] . Using microarray data from amyloid and tau transgenic mice, immune gene expression has been shown to be tightly associated with amyloid plaques rather than neurofibrillary tangles suggesting that amyloid dysmetabolism mediates the influence of the immune system on tau pathology [19] . Although several studies have examined the association between inflammation and AD neurodegeneration in humans, it is still unknown whether APOE \u03b54 influences the relationship between inflammation (specifically the complement cascade) and amyloid and tau pathology.\nHere, we investigated the relationship between APOE \u03b54 and the complement system on amyloid and tau pathology in AD. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of the immune protein Complement 3 (C3) as well as amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (amyloid) and ptau 181p (ptau), which are sensitive in vivo markers of clinical diagnosis, decline, and pathology in AD [8, 9, 24] . Low CSF amyloid levels are associated with increased amyloid plaques in the brain while high CSF ptau levels are associated with increased ptau tangles in the brain [4, 9] . Low CSF C3 has been associated with worsening cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [28] and improves diagnostic accuracy when used alongside CSF amyloid and tau [16] . We hypothesized that a statistical interaction between APOE \u03b54 and CSF C3 levels would be associated with low CSF amyloid (suggesting increased intracranial amyloid plaques) and elevated CSF ptau (suggesting increased intracranial ptau tangles). Further, building on prior work [15, 19] , in a mediation analysis, we hypothesized that CSF amyloid would 'mediate' the effect of CSF C3 on CSF ptau."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant description", "text": "This study utilized samples from cognitively normal older adults (HC; n = 71), individuals diagnosed with amnestic MCI (n = 110), and probable AD (n = 56) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which has been used in previously published studies [10, 11] . Clinical severity of symptoms in the MCI and AD groupings was measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) [22] and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) [12] . Diagnostic groupings were assigned using the clinical judgment of each site's clinicians along with cutoffs based on neuropsychological tests [33] .

This method utilizes monoclonal antibodies specific for amyloid \u03b2 1-42 and ptau 181p that are chemically bonded to color-coded beads along with analyte-specific detector antibodies. Baseline CSF C3 levels were measured using a separate multiplex immunoassay panel (Luminex technology), developed by Rules Based Medicine (Myriad RBM; Austin, Texas).

Briefly, C3 levels were measured using the Myriad RBM Human Discovery-MAP panel, which measures CSF protein levels for a range of metabolic, lipid, inflammatory, and other ADrelevant indicators. Myriad RBM used a Luminex 100 instrument for the measurements and analyzed the resulting data using proprietary software. The ADNI staff checked the distributions of analytes in this panel for normality by using Box-Cox analyses, and when appropriate log 10 transformed the data to achieve an approximately normal distribution. APOE genotype was previously generated by ADNI using DNA extracted by Cogenics (now Beckman Coulter Inc.; Pasadena, California) from a 3 mL aliquot of EDTA blood.

Model A proposes that amyloid mediates the effect of CSF C3 on CSF ptau. Model B proposes that an interaction between CSF C3 and CSF amyloid alters CSF ptau levels.\nFull regression results from Models A and B (shown in Fig. 3 ) are provided in Table 2 . We first tested Model A. We found that CSF C3 did not predict CSF ptau in the baseline model (p = 0.35). When CSF amyloid levels were added to the baseline model as a mediating variable, CSF C3 was significantly associated with CSF ptau (p = 0.04). Next we assessed Model B. In contrast to Model A, we found that there was no statistical interaction between CSF C3 and CSF amyloid on CSF ptau (p = 0.41)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Among individuals with elevated intracranial C3 and increased APOE \u03b54 dosage, we found clinical evidence of elevated intracranial amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. We also found statistical evidence that amyloid mediates the effect of C3 on ptau pathology. Considered together, our results support a conceptual model of the AD pathogenic cascade where a synergistic relationship between the complement cascade (C3) and APOE \u03b54 results in elevated Alzheimer's associated pathology and in turn, amyloid further regulates the effect of the complement cascade on ptau pathology (Fig. 4) . These results suggest that a combination of inflammatory and pathologic biomarkers may help elucidate the neurodegenerative process underlying clinical AD.\nBuilding on prior genetic evidence implicating a relationship between APOE and immune dysfunction, we found signs of elevated Alzheimer's pathology in the presence of both APOE \u03b54 and elevated complement activation indicating that genetic propensity and inflammation may act synergistically to accelerate amyloid and tau pathology. In the presence of the statistical interaction, we found no effect of C3 on ptau suggesting that APOE may play an important role in influencing the relationship between inflammation and tau pathology. Interestingly, even with the interaction term in place, we found a significant effect of C3 on amyloid indicating that the complement cascade could influence amyloid pathology via both APOE-dependent and APOE-independent mechanisms. Additional experimental work will be required to delineate the precise mechanistic relationship between complement activation, APOE, amyloid and tau pathology.\nBuilding on empirical research from prior studies [15, 19] , our mediation analyses suggest that amyloid may influence the relationship between C3 and ptau. These results support the hypothesis that amyloid dysmetabolism regulates downstream pathological processes via [15] and other work has shown that amyloid can incite an inflammatory response [27] and specifically activate the complement cascade [1] . Taken together, our findings draw attention to the role of C3 in combination with amyloid and APOE as a potential regulator of downstream pathology. Our findings suggest that a pro-inflammatory environmental milieu alters AD pathology in conjunction with genotype. This work further illustrates that inflammatory biomarkers along with genetic information may predict Fig. 1 CSF amyloid versus CSF C3 by APOE \u03b54 dosage. CSF amyloid levels are plotted against CSF C3 levels by APOE \u03b54 dosage. C3 levels are quality controlled and transformed as described in [26] . Non-carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele (blue) have the highest level of amyloid in CSF, reflecting lower levels of amyloid pathology in the brain, and display a positive slope. Carriers of one copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele (green) have intermediate levels of amyloid and display an approximately flat slope. Carriers of two copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele (red) have the lowest levels of CSF amyloid, suggesting the highest levels of amyloid pathology in the brain, and display a negative slope.

CSF ptau levels are plotted against CSF C3 levels by APOE \u03b54 dosage. C3 levels are quality controlled and transformed as described in [26] . Non-carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele (blue) have the lowest levels of ptau and display a slightly negative slope. Carriers of one copy of the APOE \u03b54 allele (green) have intermediate levels of ptau and display a modestly positive slope. Carriers of two copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele (red) have the highest levels of ptau and display a strongly positive slope. The plotted points are partial residuals with 95 % confidence bands provided in shading increased risk for AD [32] and other neurodegenerative disorders with genetic and immune components [21] . Clinically, this is important because it suggests that modifying specific components of the innate immune system or their downstream signaling pathways may serve as a target, which could ameliorate AD pathology. In addition to amyloid and tau metabolism and clearance, these results, in combination with prior studies [2, 17, 25, 30] , underscore the importance of targeting inflammatory (specifically the complement cascade) processes for AD prevention.\nOur study benefits from its use of a well-established, thoroughly characterized cohort of AD, MCI and cognitively normal healthy controls. In addition, our study benefits from using CSF, which is a biologically proximate measure of disease status and progression [3, 4] . A limitation of our study is its observational nature, which prevents us from determining a causative relationship. We cannot determine whether C3 causes, results from, or merely correlates with amyloid deposition. The specific biological mechanisms by which C3 and APOE \u03b54 influence ptau and amyloid remain to be determined. Fig. 3 Two possible models for the relationship between C3, amyloid, and ptau.

Finally, our study highlights the need for future longitudinal studies that can directly test the causal effects suggested by our correlative analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we found a statistical interaction between elevated C3 and APOE \u03b54 dosage on biomarkers indicative of elevated amyloid and tau pathology.

Our findings underscore the importance of APOE \u03b54 in regulating the putative effects of C3 on both amyloid and ptau.
