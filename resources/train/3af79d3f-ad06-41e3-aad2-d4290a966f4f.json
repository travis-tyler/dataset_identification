[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report, part of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, provides information about the three-year persistence and degree attainment of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96, with a primary focus on students who started at less-than-4-year institutions. The report finds that many of the differences in the enrollment experiences of beginning students at private for-profit and public less-than-4-year institutions reflect differences in the type of program. Eighty percent of students in private institutions began in vocational certificate programs, while about 80 percent of students in public institutions began in associate degree programs, which take longer to complete. Nevertheless, attainment rates for both vocational certificates and associate degrees were much higher for students who began in private institutions. Compared with students in the public sector, those in private institutions were more likely to focus on gaining job skills; had degree goals specific to the programs offered at the first institution attended andwere less likely to intend to transfer to a four-year college; were more likely to attend full time; and completed their certificate or associate"}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Of the roughly 3 million students who first enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-96, about 40 percent began in 4-year institutions (usually in bachelor's degree programs), but the majority began at less-than-4-year institutions, including one-half at 2-year institutions and about 10 percent at less-than-2-year institutions (figure A). Less-than-2-year institutions offer only vocational certificate programs that can be completed anywhere from a few months to just under two years. Two-year institutions offer both certificates and associate's degrees that require two to three years of full-time enrollment. The students who started at these less-than-4-year institutions in 1995-96 could have completed a certificate or associate's degree program by 1998, while those in 4-year bachelor's degree programs would normally just be completing their junior year of college. The subject of this report is the persistence and degree attainment after three years of the students who began postsecondary education in 1995-96, with a focus on those who started in less-than-4- Figure APercentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students according to level of institution first attended and among those in less-than-4-year institutions, the percentage distribution according to institution control First institution attended Control of less-than-2-year institutions Private, for-profit 7Private, not-for-profit (2) Control of 2-year institutions year institutions. Attainment means that the student completed a program and earned a degree, defined broadly as including certificates. Persistence refers to all those who continued to be enrolled until they completed a program, and therefore includes those who attained a degree. Students who transferred from their original institution and continued to be enrolled or completed a program elsewhere have also persisted. Figure B displays information about the persistence and attainment three years after students first enrolled in 1995-96. Each institution sector is shown separately. Among those who started in 4-year institutions, 18 percent had left postsecondary education without a degree, about three-fourths were still enrolled without a degree, and a small percentage had attained a degree (mostly certificates and associate's). That is, about 80 percent had persisted, but not necessarily at the institution where they first started) Among those who started at 2-year and at less-than-2-year institutions, about 40 percent had left postsecondary education within three years. The majority of those who started at less-than-2-year institutions had attained a certificate or degree (58 percent), compared with 18 percent of those who started at 2-year institutions. As shown in figure A above, most of the beginning students who enrolled in the 2-year sector (91 percent) attended public institutions, usually community colleges. Most of those in the less-than-2-year sector (80 percent) attended private, for-profit institutions (also known as proprietary or private career schools). The community colleges have a broad range of missions, from job training to offering lower division courses for students who want to transfer to 4-year institutions. The private, for-profit institutions generally only offer programs that prepare students for specific occupations. The rest of the essay will focus on the lessthan-4-year institutions, comparing the students who started at public with those who started at private, for-profit institutions in terms of their degree programs, goals, and enrollment patterns. The analysis differentiates between students in certificate and associate's degree programs and further separates students in associate's degree programs into applied and liberal arts fields. One of the main questions addressed is why students who begin at less-than-4-year public institutions have lower rates of attainment than those who begin at private, for-profit institutions.2"}, {"section_title": "Programs, Degree Goals, and Purpose", "text": "In order to make a meaningful comparison between students who begin their postsecondary education at less-than-4-year public and private, for-profit institutions, it is important to examine 2The analysis excludes about 2 percent of the students who are in less-than-4-year private, not-for-profit institutions (primarily junior colleges). Executive Sum/nary the types of programs in which students enroll and further why they have enrolled. Figure C illustrates how students in less-than-4-year public and private, for-profit institutions were distributed with respect to both their program and field of study and their reported degree goals. Private, for-profit institutions primarily offer short-term programs leading to vocational certificates. Accordingly, four-fifths of these students were enrolled in certificate programs, primarily in cosmetology, health assistance, secretarial, and mechanical trades. The remaining one-fifth were enrolled in applied associate's degree programs such as business, allied health technicians, and engineering technology. Students beginning in public 2-year institutions, on the other hand, were more likely to be enrolled in associate's degree programs than in vocational certificate programs. About 40 percent were in applied associate's degree programs, and another 40 percent were either liberal arts majors or had not declared a major. 3 An examination of beginning students' degree goals at the institution where they start clarifies their actual intentions with respect to their current enrollment. Unlike most private, for-profit institutions, one of the missions of public 2-year institutions is to provide a means for students working toward a bachelor's degree to complete their lower division requirements and transfer to a 4-year institution. Students who transfer are not required to have earned an associate's degree, but if they successfully transfer, they have achieved their goal for that institution. Students in public institutions primarily reported goals of earning an associate's degree (47 percent) or transferring to a 4-year college without a degree (24 percent). By contrast, students in private, for-profit institutions indicated goals of obtaining a vocational certificate (65 percent) or an associate's degree (18 percent), while few indicated any transfer intentions (2 percent). In both the public and the private, for-profit sectors, approximately the same percentage reported having no degree goal (15 and 16 percent, respectively). That is, they were probably enrolled to advance their occupational skills or for their own personal enrichment. When students in less-than-4-year institutions were asked to report their primary reason for enrolling (separate from their degree goals), twothirds of those in private, for-profit institutions indicated that they wanted to gain job skills, compared with one-quarter of those in public institutions. Correspondingly, about one-third of students in public less-than-4-year institutions reported plans to transfer to a 4-year college, compared with only 2 percent of those in private, for-profit institutions. Taking into account both students' degree goals and their primary purpose for enrolling, it is apparent that those enrolled in the private, forprofit sector would be able to fulfill their intentions of earning a certificate or an associate's degree and, in the process, enhance their job skills all in the same institution. Students in the public sector, on the other hand, had less of an immediate occupational focus and often planned to transfer to a 4-year college without earning an associate's degree."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Attainment of Students at Less-Than-4-Year Institutions", "text": "A major difference between certificate and associate's degree programs is the time it takes to vi 1 0 Executive Summary complete them. A vocational certificate program is often completed in about one year, while associate's degrees take at least two years to complete. Most of the beginning students at private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions were enrolled in short-term certificate programs (80 percent), while most of those in public institutions were enrolled in longer term associate's degree programs (81 percent). Not only were the beginning students in the private, for-profit institutions primarily enrolled in shorter programs, but most of them (about threefourths) were full-time students during their entire enrollment. At the public institutions, about onehalf of the beginning students started their enrollment full time, but just one-third continued to attend full time as long as they were enrolled. Moreover, about one-fourth of those in the public institutions were always enrolled part time, compared with about one-tenth in the private, forprofit institutions. Full-time students are obviously able to progress through a program more quickly than part-time students. Since most of the students starting in the private, for-profit sector were in shorter programs and attended full time as long as they were enrolled, it might be expected that they would have higher rates of degree attainment after three years than those who started at the public less-than-4-year institutions, where most of the students were in longer programs and less likely to attend full time. Comparing the students in the two sectors who began in vocational certificate programs and those who began in associate's degree programs controls for the effect of the difference in the length of these programs on attainment rates. The percentages displayed in figure D differentiate students who were still enrolled at the same institution from those who transferred and are limited to those who attained a degree at the first institution attended. Figure D--Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who began in private, for-profit and in public less-than-4-year institutions, by enrollment status and attainment at the first institution attended after three years The differences in attainment rates at public and private, for-profit institutions are still evident within certificate and associate's degree programs. About one-half (54 percent) of those who began in certificate programs at private, for-profit institutions attained a certificate at the first institution attended, compared with 30 percent of those who began at public institutions. The percentage of beginning students in associate's degree programs who attained associate's degrees at the first institution was also higher at the private, for-profit institutions than at the public institutions (35 percent compared with 7 percent). There was no difference between sectors in the percentage of those in associate's degree programs who left postsecondary education from the first institution without a degree (34 percent). However, as might be expected from the difference in degree goals examined earlier, the percentage of those in associate's degree programs who left the first institution attended to transfer elsewhere was higher at the public than at the private, for-profit institutions (23 percent compared with 9 percent). The difference in the attainment rates of beginning students in the two sectors appears to be related to the much higher percentage of full-time students in the private, for-profit institutions. In addition, the higher degree attainment rates at the for-profit institutions may be related to their term structure. Many for-profit institutions offer programs that allow continuous enrollment without regular term structures or summer vacations. This is reflected in the time it took students to attain degrees or certificates. Those full-time students who completed certificates at private, for-profit institutions finished in an average of 12 months, while those who completed certificates at public institutions required an average of 16 months. Similarly, those who completed an associate's degree at public institutions took an average of 25 months, 3 months longer than those who received an associate's degree at private, for-profit institutions by 1998."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Many of the differences in the enrollment experiences of beginning students at private, forprofit and at public less-than-4-year institutions reflect the differences in the type of program in which they were enrolled. Eighty percent of the students in the private, for-profit institutions began in vocational certificate programs, while about eighty percent of the students in the public institutions began in associate's degree programs, which take longer to complete. Nevertheless, the attainment rates for both vocational certificates and associate's degrees were much higher for students who began in private, for-profit institutions. There were also distinct differences in degree goals, reasons for enrolling, and attendance patterns between students in the two sectors that contribute to explaining some of the attainment differences. Compared with students in the public sector, those in private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions: were more likely to focus on gaining job skills; had degree goals specific to the programs offered at the first institution attended and were less likely to have intentions of transferring to a 4-year college; were more likely to attend full time for the duration of their enrollment; and completed their certificates or associate's degree programs in a shorter time. viii Foreword This report provides a description of the data collected in the first follow-up of the 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98). The study is based on a sample of students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 and were initially interviewed in 1996 as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96). These first-time beginning students were interviewed again in mid-1998, about three years after they had started their postsecondary education. A major purpose of the BPS studies is to provide information about the persistence of beginning students in postsecondary education and their attainment of any certificates or degrees at different types of institutions. Because most students who began in 1995-96 would not have been enrolled long enough to complete a bachelor's degree at the time of the follow-up survey in 1998, the essay of the report focuses on the persistence and attainment of students enrolled in programs leading to associate's degrees and vocational certificates at less-than-4-year institutions. In particular, the analysis compares the outcomes of students in public institutions with those in private, for-profit institutions three years after they first enrolled. The essay is followed by a compendium of supplemental tables detailing persistence and attainment by various types of institutions. It also contains summary findings and tables about the characteristics of beginning students, with a particular emphasis on employment. The estimates presented in the report (mostly percentages) were produced using the NCES Data Analysis System (DAS) for the BPS:96/98 survey. The DAS is a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables. The DAS produces design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences shown in the tables. For more information regarding the DAS, readers should consult appendix B of this report. BEST COPY AVAILABLE ix 13 viewed the report and offered many helpful suggestions.

"Introduction", "text": "In 1995-96, approximately 3 million students began their postsecondary education for the first time. A sample of these first-time beginning students was chosen to be interviewed in 1996 as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96), and then interviewed again three years later during mid-1998 in the first follow-up of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98).i A complete description of these beginning students during their first year in postsecondary education is available in another report.2 The current report provides a descriptive summary of their educational experience after three years, with a special emphasis on their persistence in postsecondary education and their attainment of any degrees or certificates. About two-fifths of the students beginning in 1995-96 enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities, while three-fifths enrolled in less-than-4-year institutions that did not offer a bachelor's degree. (figure 1). One-half of all beginning students attended 2-year institutions and about 9 percent attended less-than-2-year institutions. Almost all beginning students in the 2-year sector attended public institutions (91 percent), which are usually called community colleges. Most of those in the less-than-2-year sector (80 percent) attended private, for-profit institutions, which are also known as private career or proprietary schools. Less-than-4-year institutions offer vocational certificate programs and associate's degree programs in the liberal arts and in applied fields. The certificate programs are relatively short and can usually be completed in about one year of full-time enrollment, while the associate's degree programs require two to three years. Therefore, the students who began at less-than-4-year institutions in 1995-96 could have completed their programs by the time of the first follow-up survey in 1998, while those who started in bachelor's degree programs at 4-year institutions would normally just be completing their junior year of college. Figure 1Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students according to level of institution first attended and among those in less-than-4-year institutions, the percentage distribution according to institution control Control of 2-year institutions Introduction years. Student persistence is a broader concept. It refers to those students who have continued anywhere in postsecondary education, including those who had transferred out of their original institution. Three-year persistence rates include the percentage of beginners who had attained a degree at any institution in three years and those who were still enrolled at any postsecondary institution.\nThe rest of this essay focuses on the patterns of persistence and attainment of those students who began at less-than-4-year institutions in 1995-96, and some of the employment outcomes of both those who completed a program within three years and those who did not. The emphasis is on the differences between students who began their postsecondary education in certificate and associate's degree programs, examining the characteristics of students at public and at private, for-profit institutions separately.3 One of the issues examined is why beginning students at public institutions have lower rates of attainment than those beginning in private, for-profit institutions. This report expands and refines the analysis of a previous study of the five-year persistence of students who began postsecondary education in 1989-90 (BPS:90/94).4 That study examined persistence and attainment rates after five years, with a focus on the differences by the level of the institution at which the students began. The previous analysis showed that those who began at less-than-2-year institutions were more likely to be older and nontraditional than those who began at 2-year institutions. Although nontraditional students generally had a greater risk of not persisting, those who began at less-than-2-year institutions had higher rates of attainment than those who began at 2-year institutions. In the essay and in the supplemental tables of this report, the data are aggregated to focus more on the difference between students in public and in private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. There is also an emphasis on the type of degree program, degree goals, and primary purpose for enrolling as indicated by the students in the interviews for the BPS:96/98 survey. Although certificates of completion and diplomas in vocational programs may not meet the strict definition of \"degrees,\" in this report the terms \"degrees,\" \"degree programs,\" and \"degree goals\" are used as generic terms that include any type of postsecondary course of study and any type of credential that certifies the completion of a postsecondary education program. 3Students at private, not-for-profit institutions (primarily junior colleges) represented about 2 percent of the beginning student enrollments at less-than-4-year institutions and will not be analyzed separately. They are included in the essay table totals, however, and are shown separately in the supplemental tables. 4L. Berkner, S. Cuccarro-Alamin, and A. McCormick, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: Five Years Later, With an Essay on Postsecondary Persistence and Attainment (NCES 96-155) (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). The length of time that is normally required to complete a program at a postsecondary institution is related to the level of the degrees offered there and the type of the program in which the student is enrolled. Less-than-2-year institutions only offer vocational certificate programs that can often be completed in about one year. Two-year institutions (primarily community colleges) usually offer both short-term certificate programs and associate's degree programs that generally require at least two years of full-time enrollment. Four-year institutions mainly offer bachelor's degree programs that can be completed in four years, but some also offer certificate and associate's degree programs that can be completed in less time. The actual length of time that students take to complete any program also depends on whether they are enrolled as full-time students or whether they progress more slowly because they are enrolled part time. Most of the freshmen in bachelor's degree programs at 4-year colleges and universities were enrolled full time when they began, and the majority of them continued to be enrolled full time for three years.5 The majority (about three-fourths) of beginners in vocational certificate programs at less-than-2-year institutions were also full-time students during their entire program.\u00b0 At the 2-year institutions, however, beginners were less likely to be enrolled full time. At the community colleges, for example, about one-half of the beginners were enrolled full time during their first term, and about one-third continued to attend full time as long as they were enrolled.? The students who began postsecondary education in 1995-96 could have attained certificates and associate's degrees by the spring of 1998, but most would not have been enrolled long enough to complete a bachelor's degree program. Those who did complete a program and received a certificate or degree as well as those who were still enrolled in 1998 persisted in postsecondary education. If they completed the program at the institution where they first started or if they continued to be enrolled there without having attained a credential, they were retained by the institution. 5Ninety percent began as full-time students in 1995-96, and 75 percent were always enrolled full time while they persisted. See U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, First Follow-up (BPS: 96/98), Data Analysis System. 6Table 6 below. 7Table 6 below. The small proportion of 2-year students at private, for-profit institutions was predominantly full time, however. The difference between persistence and retention is in the way transfers are regarded. Retention represents the institutional perspective. Students who transfer to other institutions before completing a degree are usually considered not to have been retained at the original institution. Persistence represents the student perspective. Persistence in postsecondary education does not depend on remaining at any particular institution, as long as the student continues to be enrolled somewhere. Institutions usually do not know whether students who do not return have transferred elsewhere. When institutional \"dropout rates\" are reported, they usually include those students who have left to transfer elsewhere but have in fact continued to persist in postsecondary education at a different institution. The retention rates reported by institutions will therefore understate the actual rates of student persistence and attainment in postsecondary education as a whole."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Retention", "text": "The three-year enrollment experience at the first institution attended by the students beginning at 4-year, 2-year, and less-than-2-year institutions in 1995-96 is shown in figure 2. The percentages shown in the figure provide the basis for determining the average retention rates at those types of institutions. Institutional retention rates are usually measured as the sum of those beginning students who have attained a degree at the institution and those who are still enrolled there. Those who are not retained may either have transferred to another institution or left postsecondary education entirely. At the 4-year institutions, the retention rate of beginning students after three years was 67 percent (64 percent were still enrolled there, and 3 percent had attained degrees there). That is, within three years, about one-third of the freshmen who began at 4-year colleges and universities in 1995-96 had left the institution where they had started before completing a degree. This does not mean that one-third of the students had \"dropped out\" of higher education, however. As also shown in figure 2, those beginning students who left a 4-year institution during the first three years were more likely to transfer to another institution (20 percent) than to leave postsecondary education and not re-enroll anywhere else (13 percent).8 At the less-than-2-year institutions, the retention rate was 61 percent: 54 percent of the students had earned a certificate at their original institution, and just 7 percent were still enrolled there after three years. In part, this relatively high rate of attainment in three years or less reflects the short duration of the certificate programs offered at these institutions and the high percentage of students enrolled full time. At the 2-year institutions, which offer both short certificate and 8Eventually, about one-fourth of the transfers from 4-year institutions also left postsecondary education without a degree from another institution, so that the total of those who began at 4-year institutions and left postsecondary education without a degree after three years rose.from 13 percent to the 18 percent shown in figure 3."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Figure 2Retention of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students at the first institution attended after three years, by level of first institution attended longer associate's degree programs and where students were more likely to be enrolled part time, a smaller proportion of the beginning students (45 percent) were retained: 15 percent had earned a degree at the institution where they had started, and another 30 percent were still enrolled there without a degree. At both less-than-2-year and at 2-year institutions, about one-third of the beginners left postsecondary education entirely within three years (32 percent and 35 percent, respectively). The percentage of students who left and then transferred elsewhere was higher at the 2-year institutions, however (20 percent compared with 8 percent). One of the basic functions of 2-year institutions, especially the community colleges, is to provide lower division courses for those who want to transfer to 4-year institutions. Since it is not necessary to earn an associate's degree in order to transfer, it can be argued that institutional retention rates at 2-year institutions should also include those students whose enrollment has allowed them to transfer to a 4-year institution without an associate's degree. Included in the 20 percent who had transferred (anywhere) from the first 2-year institution without completing a degree were 12 percent who transferred to 4-year institutions. 9 If these students were included, the average three-year retention rate at 2-year institutions could be interpreted as 57 percent (15 percent attained, 30 percent still enrolled, and 12 percent transferred to 4-year institutions)."}, {"section_title": "Student Persistence", "text": "Students' persistence is measured in terms of their enrollment experience in postsecondary education as a whole. Students who continue to be enrolled or have earned a degree have persisted, whether or not they stayed at the original institution where they started. During the first three years, about one-fifth of the students beginning in 2-year or in 4-year institutions left the institution where they started before completing a degree, but continued their education by transferring somewhere else.'\u00b0 The rates at which students actually persist in postsecondary education are therefore underestimated when only institutional retention rates are reported, without considering transfers. In the rest of this essay, the focus will be on beginning students' persistence and attainment anywhere in postsecondary education during the three years after they first enrolled. The total three-year persistence and attainment rates (anywhere) of the students who began postsecondary education in 1995-96 are shown by the level of the institution first attended in figure 3. The percentage of students who had earned a degree anywhere within three years also reflects the length of the programs offered at the institutions where they began. By 1998, more than one-half (58 percent) of those who began at less-than-2-year institutions had attained a credential (nearly all certificates); at 2-year institutions, 18 percent had attained either certificates or . associate's degrees; and at 4-year institutions, 4 percent had attained some type of credential, including 1 percent who had attained a bachelor's degree within three years.11 The three-year persistence rates, which are the sum of the percentage of students who had attained a degree and of the percentage still enrolled anywhere in postsecondary education, are also shown in figure 4. After three years, about 80 percent of the freshmen who started at 4-year colleges and universities in 1995-96 were either still enrolled somewhere in postsecondary education or had earned a credential. Among those who began either at 2-year institutions (primarily community colleges) or at less-than-2-year institutions (primarily private, for-profit), roughly 60 percent had persisted.  NOTE: Detaiols may not sum to 100 due to rounding. Because of a small difference in the number of missing values at less-than-2-year institutions, the 6 percent still enrolled is slightly lower than in figure 2.

Figure 4 also shows the percentage of beginning students who left postsecondary education without a degree during or after each academic year. Among beginning students at 4-year institutions, 7 percent left postsecondary education before their second year, and another 7 percent left before their third year. After three years, a total of about one-fifth (18 percent) of the 1995-96 freshmen at 4-year institutions had left postsecondary education without completing any degree program anywhere.12 At both 2-year and at less-than-2-year institutions, about one-fourth (24 and 26 percent, respectively) of the beginning Students left postsecondary education before their second year, and after three years, a total of about 40 percent had left postsecondary education without completing any program.13"}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education", "text": "I2The difference between this 18 percent and the 13 percent who left postsecondary education from the first institution (figure 2) represents transfer students from the first institution who eventually left postsecondary education without a degree from another institution.

They usually attend full time, although many have part-time jobs while they are enrolled. By contrast, nontraditional beginners are usually older and have often delayed entry into postsecondary education. They may have children, are usually self-supporting, and often enroll as part-time students while holding a full-time job.14 14L. Horn, Nontraditional Undergraduates: Trends in Enrollment from 1986 to 1992 and Persistence and Attainment Among 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students (NCES 97-578) (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). The same characteristics that are associated with nontraditional students have also been identified as factors that are related to lower rates of persistence in postsecondary education. In particular, there are seven characteristics of students that increase the risk of their leaving postsecondary education before they complete a program. These \"risk factors\" are not having a regular high school diploma, delaying postsecondary enrollment by more than one year after high school, enrolling as a part-time student, working full time while enrolled, and beginning as a financially independent (self-supporting) student, as a student with children, or as a single parent's The number of risk factors is also directly related to the age at which the student first enrolled in postsecondary education. For example, among those who started at age 18, about twothirds (67 percent) had no risk factors, while among those who first enrolled in their late 20s (24-29), about two-thirds (68 percent) had four or more (table 1). The proportion of students with several persistence risk factors varied by the type of institution at which they began, reflecting the age distribution of the student body. At 4-year institutions, about 20 percent of the beginners. were over age 18, compared with about one-half at 2year institutions and about 80 percent at less-than-2-year institutions.16 At 4-year institutions, just 10 percent of the beginning students had two or more characteristics associated with the risk of not persisting (6 percent with two or three factors and 4 percent with four or more), compared with one-half of those entering 2-year institutions and about three-fourths of those starting vocational certificate programs in less-than-2-year institutions (table 1). In general, the likelihood of leaving postsecondary education without completing a program is directly related to the number of these risk factors that are part of a student's characteristics.\" For example, among all 1995-96 first-time beginning students with none of these risk factors, 16 percent left postsecondary education without a degree after three years, compared with one-third (32 percent) of those with one risk factor and one-half (49 percent) of those with two or three of these risk factors (table 2). High-risk, nontraditional students are more likely to persist and complete short-term certificate programs than longer degree programs. Although the likelihood of leaving postsecondary education without a degree increased with the number of risk factors present, table 2 also shows that in total the likelihood of having attained a certificate increased with the number of risk factors. This reflects the fact that nontraditional, high-risk beginning students are concentrated in short-term vocational certificate programs, which are primarily offered at less-than-4-year 15Ibid.

In the telephone interviews for the BPS:96/98 survey, students beginning at less-than-4-year institutions were asked the following series of questions to address the issues of program, first degree goals, and primary purpose: Program: What type of degree or certificate program are/were you enrolled in at the first institution attended? Respondents either named a program, or said they were not in any degree program. First degree goal: What is the highest degree that you expect to receive at the first institution attended? Respondents either named a degree or said that they were not planning to get a degree there and often said they were planning to transfer without a degree. Purpose: What was your primary reason for enrolling at the first institution attended? The responses were classified into the following categories: to learn job skills, to earn a degree or certificate, to transfer elsewhere, and for personal enrichment or other reasons. The responses to these questions are shown in table 3. Students beginning at less-than -2year institutions were relatively easy to classify. Since these institutions offer only vocational certificates, students can only be enrolled in certificate programs, and the highest degree they can earn there (their first degree goal) is a certificate (81 percent indicated this as their degree goal). About 19 percent indicated that they did not expect to earn any degree at that institution. When asked the purpose for enrolling, the majority (73 percent) indicated that their primary reason for enrolling at a less-than-2-year institution was to learn job skills.19 At 2-year institutions, the options are more varied. Depending on how the questions were interpreted, and the students' convictions (or indecision) at the time, the responses varied in\u00b0H owever, the survey questions may be biased. Those who expected to receive no degree or to earn a certificate were asked if they were enrolled for a job-related reason or some other reason. The others were only asked to state their primary reason. For details see \"Purpose for enrolling (PGM6Y1)\" in appendix A. "}, {"section_title": "49", "text": "Based on these responses, an additional composite variable was constructed to classify the beginning students by their combined expectations for earning a degree at the first institution and for transferring elsewhere, with or without a degree. In order to see if there was a difference between the persistence and attainment of students who had already declared a major in a field that was directly related to specific types of careers and those who were still undecided or were in a general liberal arts program, those in associate's degree programs were classified into two groups: liberal arts or undeclared majors and applied fields of study (anything other than liberal arts, primarily such fields as business, nursing, and technology).20 Students in associate's degree programs with majors in the applied fields were more likely than those in liberal arts or undeclared majors to say that their primary reason for enrolling was to acquire job skills (25 percent compared with 8 percent) and less likely to say that they planned to transfer to a 4-year institution (32 percent compared with 52 percent) (table 4). Those in applied majors were also twice as likely as those in liberal arts and undeclared majors to expect to earn a degree at the first institution without any plans to transfer (54 percent compared with 25 percent). Among those in the liberal arts and undeclared majors, 41 percent expected to transfer without completing an associate's degree, compared with 19 percent of those in applied fields. As shown in figure 5, the beginning students at all less-than-4-year institutions were relatively evenly distributed among vocational certificate programs, applied associate's degree fields, and liberal arts or undeclared associate's fields, with about one-third in each area (31, 34, and 35 Figure 5Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students enrolled in less-than-4-year institutions, by first program and field and first degree goal percent, respectively). The percentage of students who had left postsecondary education without a degree was also the same in each of these programs (42 percent) (figure 6 and table 5). However, the attainment rates after three years were higher for those beginning in the certificate programs (46 percent) than for those in either of the associate's degree programs (20 percent and 9 percent)."}, {"section_title": "18 1", "text": "Students in Less-Than-4-Year Programs There are several reasons for the higher attainment rates of those in certificate programs. Certificate programs are relatively short in duration. The full-time students who completed certificates did so in an average of 15 months.21 Moreover, the majority (55 percent) of the students in certificate programs were always enrolled full time (table 6). In addition, most (82 percent) of the students in certificate programs expected to earn a certificate at the institution where they started.22 21Figure 9 below. 22Table 4 above.

Moreover, just onethird (36 percent) of the students in associate's degree programs attended full time during their entire period of enrollment. In addition, those in associate's programs were less likely to expect to earn a degree at their 2-year institution. As shown in table 4 above, among liberal arts/undeclared majors, about one-half planned to earn a degree (22 percent before transferring and 25 percent with no transfer plans). After three years, just 9 percent had actually earned a degree, and most of these students (7 percent) were still enrolled and continuing their education (figure 6). Among those in applied associate's degree programs, about three-fourths (74 percent) expected to complete a degree at the institution, and 20 percent did so within three years. About one-half of those with degrees (11 percent) continued their education. Beginning students who were always enrolled part time were twice as likely to leave postsecondary education without a degree than those always enrolled full time (70 percent compared with 37 percent; table 5). There was no difference in the percentage of beginning students in certificate and in associate's degree programs who were always enrolled part time (25 and 22 percent, respectively; table 6). The proportion of beginning students always enrolled part time was directly related to the age of the students, however. Among the beginning students who were 18 or younger, just 11 percent were always enrolled part time; among those age 30 or older, 45 percent were always enrolled part time. Among those who identified themselves as primarily employees rather than students, about one-half (51 percent) were always enrolled part time, and among those who did not expect to earn a degree at that institution or to transfer, 43 percent were always enrolled part time.23 This suggests that the low persistence rates of beginning students who were always enrolled part time was not just related to their attendance pattern but also to their reasons for enrolling."}, {"section_title": "Beginning Students at Public and at Private, for-Profit Institutions", "text": "As shown previously, there is a substantial overlap in institution level, institution control, and degree programs offered. Less-than-2-year institutions are primarily private, for-profit and offer only certificate programs. Two-year institutions are primarily public, and most of the students are in associate's degree programs. This overlap tends to obscure any differences in the persistence and attainment of beginners that may be related to whether they are enrolled in public or in private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. The distribution of beginning students at public and at private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions according to the various indicators of programs, degree goals, and purpose was shown in table 3 above. At the public institutions, enrollments were dominated by the 2-year community colleges, and just 4 percent were enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions. At the private, for-profit institutions, on the other hand, the majority of beginning students (66 percent) were attending less-than-2-year institutions. Since less-than-2-year institutions do not offer associate's degrees, one of the major differences between beginning students at public and private, for-profit institutions was the type of program in which they were enrolled (figure 7). At the private, for-profit institutions, 80 percent of the beginning students were in vocational certificate programs, and 20 percent in applied associate's degree programs. This was the, reverse of the distribution at the public institutions, where about 20 percent were in certificate programs and about 80 percent in associate's degree programs. Moreover, while all of the beginning.students in associate's degree programs at private, for-profit institutions were in applied fields of study, those in public institutions were as likely to be in liberal arts or undeclared majors as to be in applied fields (40 percent and 41 percent, respectively). Students' degree goals at the first institution were also quite different (figure 7). The majority of beginning students at private, for-profit institutions expected to earn either a certificate (65 percent) or an associate's degree (18 percent); just 2 percent indicated that they intended to transfer to a 4-year institution. At the public institutions, on the other hand, one-fourth of the beginning students said that their goal was to transfer to a 4-year college. As was shown in table 3, when the students at the public institutions were asked their primary purpose for enrolling, about one-third (36 percent) said that they intended to transfer, and about one-fifth (22 percent) replied that earning a degree was of primary importance. Since earning a degree and transferring are not mutually exclusive, the various combinations of transfer or degree expectations are also shown at the bottom of table 3. At the private, for-profit institutions, 83 percent of the beginning students indicated in some way that they intended to earn a degree at the institution, with no intention of transferring. At the public institutions, on the other hand, about half as many (44 percent) indicated that they intended to earn a degree at the institution without any plans to transfer. About the same percentage (45 percent) of students at the public institutions indicated that they did intend to transfer, either after earning a degree (19 percent) or without a degree (26 percent). The differences in the programs and degree goals among beginning students at the public institutions and those at private, for-profit institutions partly reflect the predominance of enrollments at 2-year institutions in the public sector, and at lessithan-2-year institutions in the private, for-profit sector. A direct comparison among students enrolled in 2-year institutions, however, Figure 7Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who first enrolled in public and private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions, by first program and field of study and by first degree goal "}, {"section_title": "57", "text": "continues to show some of the same differences found in the totals of both sectors (table 3). Beginning students at 2-year private, for-profit institutions were more likely to be enrolled in certificate programs than those in 2-year public institutions (42 percent compared with 17 percent) and therefore were more likely to have the goal of earning a certificate (35 percent compared with 12 percent) than their counterparts at public institutions. About one-half (49 percent) of beginning students at both public and private, for-profit 2year institutions had the goal of earning an associate's degree at that institution (table 3). The percentage whose primary purpose for enrolling was to earn a degree was also the same in both public and private, for-profit 2-year institutions (22 and 23 percent, respectively). However, those at the private, for-profit 2-year institutions were more likely to say that their primary reason for enrolling was to gain job skills (57 percent compared with 22 percent) and were much less likely to say that their primary purpose was to transfer to a 4-year college (3 percent compared with 38 percent). In addition to enrolling in shorter programs, focusing on gaining job skills, and having degree goals specific to the programs offered at the first institution attended, beginning students at private, for-profit institutions were more likely to attend full time for their entire period of enrollment (table 6). About three-fourths (77 percent) of the beginning students at private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions were always enrolled full time, compared with one-third (33 percent) of the beginning students at the public institutions. Moreover, about one-fourth (26 percent) of the beginning students at the public institutions were always enrolled part time, compared with just one-tenth (9 percent) at the private, for-profit institutions. Persistence and Attainment at Public and at Private, for-Profit Institutions Most of the beginning students at private, for-profit institutions were enrolled in short-term certificate programs, while most of those in public institutions were enrolled in longer term associate's degree programs. Based on the analysis in the prior sections of this report, it might be expected that students in the for-profit sector would have higher rates of attainment at the first institution attended. A comparison of the institutional retention and attainment rates of beginning students in vocational certificate and associate's degree programs at public and private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions is shown in table 7. Those who first attended private, for-profit institutions did have higher attainment rates than those who first attended public institutions. Fiftytwo percent of those at private, for-profit institutions attained a credential (44 percent earned certificates and 8 percent earned associate's degrees), compared with 14 percent in the public institutions (8 percent certificates and 6 percent associate's degrees)."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "58;", "text": "Students in Less-Than-4-Year Programs Table 7-Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who began in less-than-4-year institutions according to 3-year persistence and attainment and retention at the first institution attended The disparity in the attainment rates reflects the difference in the type of program as well as the difference in the transfer plans of the beginning students in the two sectors (figure 7). The majority of students at public institutions were in associate's degree programs, which require longer to complete, and nearly 40 percent did not plan to get any degree at that institution (15 percent had no degree goal and 24 percent had plans to transfer). The majority of those in private, for-profit institutions were in short-term certificate programs, and over 80 percent did intend to get a certificate or degree at that institution (65 percent planned to get a certificate and 18 percent planned an associate's degree). However, the difference in attainment rates at public and private, for-profit institutions is still evident when comparing certificate and associate's programs within the two sectors (figure 8 and table 7). About one-half (54 percent) of those who began in certificate programs at private, for-profit institutions attained a certificate at the first institution attended, compared with 30 percent of those who began at public institutions. The percentage of beginning students in associate's degree programs who attained an associate's degree at the first institution attended was also higher at the private, for-profit institutions than at the public institutions (35 percent compared with 7 percent). The percentage of beginning students in associate's degree programs who left postsecondary education from the first institution attended was the same in both sectors, however (34 percent).  The attainment rates in both certificate and associate's degree programs are higher at private, for-profit than at public less-than-4-year institutions. The reasons for this difference may be that beginning students at for-profit institutions are more likely to attend as full-time students and that the academic term structure is often more flexible at the private, for-profit institutions than at the public institutions. Many private, for-profit institutions offer programs that allow for continuous enrollment without a regular term structure or summer vacations. This is reflected in the time it takes to attain a degree, i.e., the number of months between the start and completion of a program (figure 9). Full-time students who completed certificates at private, for-profit institutions finished in an average of 12 months, while those who completed certificates at public institutions required an average of 16 months. Similarly, full-time students who completed an associate's degree at public institutions took 25 months, 3 months longer than those who received an associate's degree at private, for-profit institutions.  "}, {"section_title": "61", "text": "Over a period of three years, beginning students may change their initial degree programs, fields of study, and degree goals. As shown in table 5 above, the degrees actually attained by students are not always consistent with their original degree programs or goals. Students starting in certificate programs may earn associate's degrees, and those in associate's degree programs may only earn certificates. Some students may also transfer from one type of institution to a similar or different type, whatever their original expectations. The students at the private, for-profit institutions were more likely to be in shorter programs, focus on gaining job skills, intend to get a degree, and attend full time for the duration of their enrollment. The students at the public institutions were more likely to be in longer programs, focus less on job skills, intend to transfer to 4-year institutions with or without a degree, and attend part time during all or part of their enrollment. In terms of their persistence anywhere in postsecondary education, the type of lessthan-4-year institution where they began may be less important than whether they were always enrolled as full-time students. As shown in figure 10, among the students who were always Figure 10Percentage distribution of 1995-96 students beginning in less-than-4-year institutions who were always enrolled full time, by total 3-year persistence and attainment and control of first institution attended enrolled full time, there was no difference between the public and the private, for-profit sectors in the percentage of beginners who had left postsecondary education entirely after three years (36 and 37 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Employment Outcomes for Students in Vocational and Applied Fields of Study", "text": "About two-thirds of the beginning students at less-than-4-year institutions were enrolled in career-oriented programs, either in vocational certificate or associate's degree programs in applied fields, as previously shown in figure 5. The beginning students in vocational certificate and applied associate's degree programs were concentrated in three general fields of study: business/secretarial (24 percent), nursing and allied health (20 percent), and technical/mechanical (20 percent) (table 8). An additional 8 percent were in cosmetology. The associate's programs were usually in business administration, licensed nursing and allied health technicians, and engineering technology. The certificate programs were usually in secretarial, practical nursing or health assistants, mechanical trades, or cosmetology.24 At the private, for-profit institutions, about onefourth (26 percent) of the beginning students were enrolled in cosmetology certificate programs, a type of vocational training that was rarely offered at public institutions. 24However, the reported majors were often generic, such as \"business\" or \"nursing,\" without further distinctions. As shown earlier in table 5, 42 percent of the beginning students in vocational certificate programs at less-than-4-year institutions completed a program within three years (usually in about one year) and did not continue further education, and another 42 percent left postsecondary education without completing a program. Among those in applied associate's degree fields, about 11 percent completed a program and left, and about 42 percent left postsecondary education without a degree. Although the percentage who left before completion was the same in both types of programs, the attainment rates in the certificate programs were higher, in part because certificates could be completed in less time than associate's degrees. The economic benefits of completing a vocational certificate or applied associate's degree have been the subject of some debate. Many studies have shown that there are long-term economic benefits from taking courses in less-than-4-year institutions, but there is disagreement about whether there are additional benefits to completing a program and attaining a certificate or associate's degree.25 The time frame of this study may be too short to address this issue. The students who started in certificate or associate's degree programs and were no longer enrolled in 1998 would usually have been employed for just two years or less after leaving postsecondary education (with or without a credential). The students who had started at less-than-4-year institutions in 1995-96, who were no longer enrolled in 1998, and who were employed were asked about their starting salaries in the job held after they left postsecondary education. The sample sizes are too small to report significant differences in salaries between those who did or did not complete degrees within fields, or differences by field among those who did attain a degree. However, the median full-time starting salaries for all those who attained a certificate or associate's degree were the same as for those who did not complete a program ($15,000).26 Although there was no difference in the reported median starting salaries, those who had completed a program perceived greater benefits from their postsecondary education than those who did not. Table 9 shows the benefits of their education reported by those working full time in 1998, both for those who completed a certificate or associate's degree and those who did not, by field of study. Those who had completed their programs were more likely to indicate that they were able to take on more responsibility (70 versus 47 percent), had better job opportunities (74 versus 51 percent), and were able to earn higher salaries (66 versus 38 percent) because of their education than those who did not.27 25For a good recent review of the issues, see T.

The three-year persistence rates (i.e., attained or still enrolled) of students beginning in certificate programs and those beginning in associate's degree programs are the same, and the persistence of full-time students is also the same for those who began in public and those who began in private, for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. The attainment rates in both certificate and associate's degree programs are higher at private, for-profit than at public less-than-4-year institutions. The reasons for this difference may be that beginning students at for-profit institutions are more likely to attend as full-time students, and that the academic term structure at the private, for-profit institutions allows students to complete their degrees in somewhat less time than at the public institutions. The economic benefits of having completed a program and receiving a credential at a lessthan-4-year institution may not be apparent in the short-term. Although the median starting salaries ($15,000) were the same whether or not students received a credential, those who did complete a program were more likely to perceive positive economic benefits from their education than those who did not.

attended less-than-2-year institutions, most of which provide short-term vocational training (table 6.1a). The age that students first began their postsecondary education was strongly related to the level of institution they first attended. Those who were 18 years or younger were far more likely to enroll at the 4-year level (56 percent) than were all older students including 19-year-olds (34 percent), 20-through 23-year-olds (22 percent), and those 24 or older (10 to 11 percent; table 6.1b). While men and women were equally likely to enroll at the 4-year level (41 percent), men were more likely to attend 2-year institutions (53 percent versus 48 percent), and women were more likely to attend less-than-2-year institutions (11 percent versus 6 percent; table 6.1b).29 Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of all 1995-96 beginning students attended public institutions, while 16 percent and 11 percent, respectively, attended private, not-forprofit and private, for-profit institutions (table 6.2a). Roughly one-quarter (27 percent) of dependent students from high-income families ($70,000 or higher) attended private, not-for-profit institutions, compared with 15 percent of dependent students from families with incomes under $25,000 (table 6.2b). Nearly half (46 percent) of all 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students attended public 2-year colleges, while approximately one-quarter (26 percent) attended public 4year institutions and 15 percent attended private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. The remainder attended other less-than-4-year institutions, including 7 percent in private, for-profit less-than-2-year institutions (table 6.3a). Asian or Pacific Islander students were more likely than Hispanic or black, non-Hispanic students (35 percent versus 22 percent and 21 percent, respectively) to enroll in public 4-year institutions (table 6.3b). Black, non-Hispanic students were more likely to attend private, not-for-profit lessthan-2-year institutions than were white students (13 percent versus 5 percent; table 6.3b). 28The numbers appearing in these compendium tables will differ slightly from those published in the NCES report 1999-030, Descriptive Summary of 1996-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students, because a longitudinal weight based on students enrolled in the base-year and follow-up survey was used. In the former pUblication, the NPSAS:95-96 cross-sectional weight was used. 29Among all beginning students, 54 percent were women. L. Kojaku and A.M.

Taking into account parents' education, students whose parents attained lower levels of education (high school or some postsecondary education short of a bachelor's degree) were more likely to be women (57 percent and 58 percent, respectively). In contrast, among students whose parents held either a bachelor's or advanced degree, there was no measurable gender difference (table 6.4b).\nDue in part to their likelihood of attending part time, students who began at the 2-year level were more likely to work full time (34 percent) than were those who began in either less-than-2-year institutions (23 percent) or 4-year institutions (11 percent; table 7.2a).

These risk factors fall into three areas: enrollment, financial and family status, and high school graduation status. The enrollment risk factors include (1) attending on a parttime basis and (2) delaying enrollment a year or more after high school graduation. Family and financial risk factors include (3) being financially independent of parents according to financial aid criteria, (4) working full time while enrolled, (5) having dependents, and (6) being a single parent. The final risk factor is (7) dropping out of high school or completing through alternative means such as a GED or high school equivalent certificate. Students .were grouped into four categories of risk: none, one risk factor, two or three risk factors, and four or more. Having no risk factors means a student falls into a category that is commonly referred to as \"traditional,\" meaning he or she entered postsecondary education immediately after graduating from high school, attended full time, and was financially dependent on parents. By comparison, students having four or more risk factors would be highly nontraditional, that is, at high risk of leaving postsecondary education without attaining. Among 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students, about half (55 percent) were identified as nontraditional, meaning they had one or more risk factors (table 6.10a). While most beginning students attending 4-year institutions had no risk factors (75 percent), the opposite was true for those attending 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions. Just 26 percent and II percent, respectively, of these students had no risk factors, Table Compendium while 23 percent and 33 percent, respectively, had four or more risk factors (table   6.10a). Due in part to the high risk associated with being single parents (i.e., they have at least three risk factors by definition),35 women were more likely than men to have four or more risk factors (20 percent versus 11 percent; table 6.10b). Nearly 30 percent of black, non-Hispanic students had four or more risk factors, in contrast to 15 percent of white students, 14 percent of Hispanic students, and 13 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students (table 6.10b). About 25 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Native students were also at high risk, with four or more risk factors, but because of small sample sizes, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they were more or less likely than other groups to have four or more risk factors (table 6.10b). Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely than students in all other racial/ethnic groups except white students to have no risk factors (55 percent compared with 27 to 37 percent).
