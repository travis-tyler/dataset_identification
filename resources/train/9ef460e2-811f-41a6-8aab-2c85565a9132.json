(Contains 10 tables.) (SLD) States participating in the National Assessment of Educational Progress State Assessment program (state NAEP) are required to sample at least 2,500 students selected from at least 100 schools per subject assessed. In this ideal situation, 25 students are assessed for a subject in each school selected for that subject. If more than one subject is being assessed for the given state and grade, say k subjects (with k usually 2), then as many as 25k students may be assessed at a single school for the target grade if the grade enrollment is sufficiently large.\nTwo problems have arisen in implementing the required design: (1) some states have too few schoolssometimes fewer than 100 within a target gradeand (2) some states have small schools, thereby requiring many more than 100 schools to obtain a sample of 2,500 students per subject. Specific policies have been developed to exempt states from the stringent sample design requirement above for each case (e.g., Forsyth et al. 1996 , Freund and Carlson 1997 , Rust 1997 .\nThe \"partial sample option\" addresses the first problem and allows states to negotiate a smaller sample, but not less than 1,250 students per subject assessed. The plan generally requires at least one session per subject per eligible and cooperating school and may require two, three, or four sessions per subject per grade in some schools. Per policy implemented in 1994, there must be 100 schools in the sample or the total number of schools eligible if less than 100.\nA \"sparse state sample option\" has been proposed to deal with the second problem for the 1998 state NAEP. If the required number of schools exceeds 120 when applying the required design, a sampling plan may be negotiated that meets the following: (1) at least 115 schools per grade, (2) at least 80 schools per subject within each grade, and (3) no school selected with less than half the probability required in the initial requirements.\nBoth options yield a minimum sample size of 1,250 students per subject per grade and in practice would yield sample sizes closer to 2,500. Requiring adequately high precision is equivalent to requiring that the variance of estimates be bounded above by some maximum value. Often relative standard error is used as a standard, but this can be converted to a variance requirement for each specific estimate.\nln discussing simple random sampling, Cochran (1973, p.25) suggests that in practice, the finite population correction factor can be ignored (i.e., treated as a multiplicative factor of one) if the sampling fraction does not exceed five percent. A more general reason for ignoring the finite population correction factor, however, is stated in his discussion of comparisons between domain means (p. 39). For this type of analytic purpose, one wishes to test whether two (domain) means could have been drawn from the same infinite population. Since such a test relates to an infinite population, Cochran states it is not appropriate to apply a finite population correction to the variance formulation. Cochran does not re-address these issues with regard to stratified or cluster sampling, both of which apply to the state assessment samples. The usual variance formulation for stratified sampling is equivalent to applying finite population correction factor of zero to the variance component associated with between-stratum differences. When all schools are sampled, schools are treated as strata rather than as primary sampling units. When schools are treated as strata, there is no contribution of between-school differences to the variance of estimates. When a high fraction of schools is sampled, it seems natural to take an intermediate position: namely, to apply a finite population correction factor between zero and one to the between-school component of variance."}, {"section_title": "Approach", "text": "In this paper, we explore the application of finite population correction factors to the between-school component of variance and examine how this might effect sample size requirements in the types of states that currently require exemptions from the minimum sample requirements for the state NAEP. We also explore how we might preserve the infinite population assumptions for hypothesis testing relating to comparisons between domain means. For this preliminary exploration, we develop hypothetical school and student population structures and hypothetical variance component distributions. For each variance component distribution, we determine the effective sample size resulting from the minimum state NAEP sample size requirements when the infinite population assumptions are a good approximation to reality (i.e., when the finite population correction factor can be ignored at all stages of sampling). We then examine how this effective sample size can be maintained with an alternate sample design which recognizes the population structure and applies the finite population correction factor at the school stage of sampling."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Assumptions", "text": "The Ideal Population Structure\nFor variance modeling purposes, we assume that the ideal population structure has the following components:\nFifty geographic strata each with a large number of schools Large and equal numbers of eligible schools in each stratum A large number of eligible students in each school\nFrom such a population, the sample design for a grade assessment would consist of two schools per stratum and 25 students per subject assessed from each sample school, or a total of 100 schools and 2,500 students per subject."}, {"section_title": "Variance Component Distributions", "text": "We will investigate three variance component distributions corresponding to three levels of intra-school correlation coefficients: 0.10, 0. The variance of an estimated mean for the ideal setting can be modeled as:\nThe first component of variance, a , drops out since all strata are included with certainty, and implicitly, a finite population correction factor of zero is applied. The remaining two components of variance correspond to schools and students, respectively. The variance under simple random sampling (assuming a finite population correction factor of 1) would be simply:\nThe design effect can be computed as a ratio of the design-based variance to the variance under simple random sampling, or:\nThe design effect can be computed as the ratio of the actual sample size to the effective sample size; e.g., for model A the design effect is 2,500/1,163 or 2.15. The inverse of the term in brackets can also be interpreted as the effective sample size which is shown in the final column of Table 1 . The effective sample sizes shown are for a sample of 100 schools and 2,500 students per subject selected from an ideal hypothetically infinite population."}, {"section_title": "Finite Population Variance Models", "text": "When we consider incorporating the finite population correction factor at the school and/or student level, there are at least two possible options:\nVariance model 1: Apply the finite population correction factor at the school level and ignore it (set to 1) at the student level Variance model 2: Apply the finite population correction factor at both levels and add back a variance component for the finite population\nBoth of these models are presented in oversimplified formparticularly with regard to all schools having about the same enrollment, or schools within major strata having about the same enrollment. Even though this is unrealistic, it should still help to develop an understanding of the options being considered without developing empirically-based formulae for real state populations.\nThe finite variance model 1 can be written as: where N2 refers to the number of schools in the population, n2 refers to the number of schools in the sample, and n3 refers to the number of students selected per school.\nNote that if all schools are selected in the sample, this effectively treats schools as strata with all the variance contributions coming from sampling within schools. Also, no finite population correction factor is applied within schools, so that hypothesis tests about differences between domain means can reasonably be based on infinite population assumptions.\nAnother way to recognize infinite population assumptions would be based on model 2 which adds back a component of variance related to treating the finite population as a simple random sample from an infinite population. This variance can be modeled as: + N2N3 where 02 is the overall population variance, N3 refers to the average number of eligible students per school.\nThe choice of appropriate variance models depends on how one views the finite real world arising from or being generated by some infinite process or super-population model. Model 1 treats schools and their served communities as being fixed and finite; it views the students, as arising from individual super-populations. The characteristics of the communities served and educational environments of the schools are unique and can vary considerably from school to school. Student performance in model 1 can be viewed as being the combined outcome of community and school environments. To allow us to perform analytical studies and to use standard infinite population-based tests (e.g., those based on Normal distribution theory), the student performance measures are viewed as arising from the individual super-population models specific to the community and school environments of each individual school. The variance component for schools is a function of the differences among the basic processes occurring in each school's educational and community environment.\nIn contrast to model 1, model 2 treats the state's finite population of students and their performance measures as arising from a single infinite process or super-population model. The finite sample arising from this single model is then arranged into schools and their served communities. The arrangement process is not random and results in a nonzero school variance component. To represent the true variance under this process, the finite 6\nThe Effects of Finite Sampling Corrections on State Assessment Sample Requirements population variance (finite at all stages) is based on the particular super-population outcome and the particular arrangement of students into schools (the first two terms in ). Then, an estimate of variance arising from the generation of the finite population from the super-population model is added (the final term in Vi2 )3\nIn the remainder of this report, we limit consideration to model 1 because we believe it provides a better representation of the relationship of the finite population to the underlying infinite processes we wish to evaluate in the analysis of assessment data. We view the structure of schools and their served communities as fundamental contributors to the characteristics of students and the performance measures of the student population rather than viewing all states' students as arising from a single process and then simply being partitioned in some arbitrary manner among the schools in a state. Note that stratification and its effectiveness in controlling the variance of estimates is largely influenced by the craft of the study designers and not by any random process; this view of effective stratification is intuitively more consistent with model 1.\nIn order to study populations with a mixture of large and small schools, we model a partition of the population into two major strata based on size of school. This more general model reflects a mix of large and small schools and is written as: where W, is the proportion of eligible students in large schools and W2 (= 1 ) is the proportion of eligible students in small schools. Population and sample sizes are appropriately defined with an additional leading subscript. Note that common variance components are assumed across size of school strata.\n3 Kendall and Stuart (1966, pp. 190-191) show how the variance of a statistic can be partitioned based on any condition c into a component which is the expected value over all c of the variance of the statistic given c, and a component which is the variance over all c of the expected value of the statistic given c. In this case the condition c is defined as a particular super-population outcome of a particular state's finite population of students. Other Anomalous Population Structures Table 2 shows some distributions of schools by size for selected states and grades; data are extracted from the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data 1993 (Sierra Systems Consultants, Inc. 1994 . No state fits the ideal population model; these states were selected because they were believed to exhibit some of the problems encountered in the.strict interpretation of state NAEP sample size guidelines. For the purposes of summarization, small schools are defined as those with 1 to 49 students in the target grade. Large schools have 50 or more students in the target grade. In actual practice, probability-proportional-to-size samples of schools would be selected; probabilities could be adjusted so that approximately equal probability samples of students could be selected after considering the feasible number of sessions at each school. We use artificial examples to examine the impacts of sample allocation on effective sample sizes both to simplify the calculations and to enhance interpretation. In Table 3 , we show the hypothetical ideal (population 1) as well as five other hypothetical but finite populations which illustrate some of the situations that prevent strict application of the state NAEP guidelines and which roughly match some of the cases shown in Table 2 . Populations 2 and 3 illustrate the few schools problem where the \"partial sample option\" has been applied; these are similar to Delaware grades 4 and 12 or Rhode Island grade 12. Population 4 illustrates the problem with many small schools for which a \"sparse sample option\" has been proposed; this population resembles the For each of the five hypothetical finite populations (populations 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Table  3 , we consider four alternate sample designs. The first design considers attempts to follow the state NAEP guidelines as closely as possible with first priority given to achieving a sample of 2,500 students per subject and second priority given to achieving a sample of at least 100 schools. All designs use proportional allocation to the two sizes of school strata; i.e., the student sample size is approximately proportional (within rounding of design parameters) to the student population in each size stratum. The alternate designs proposed for each hypothetical finite population involve a reduced sample size based on achieving the same precision as the population 1 ideal would achieve under each of the three variance component distributions shown in Table 1 ; the precision standard is based on achieving or exceeding the effective sample sizes shown in the rightmost column of "}, {"section_title": "769", "text": "A ternate samp ing designs emp oying finite samp mg correction assumptions t at, for t e named variance component distribution, meet or exceed the effective sample siies obtained under the current state NAEP design (with no finite sampling corrections).\nIn general, these two artificial populations lend support to a policy which allows states with few schools to reduce their sample size below those usually specified for participation in the state NAEP. The Many Small Schools Problem\nPopulation 4 (Table 6) illustrates the problem encountered when states have many small schools. About one-half of the state's student population is enrolled in small schools. In this example, the state NAEP requirements could be met with a sample of 151 schools. Depending on the variance component distribution assumed, school sample sizes for optional sample designs range from 105 to 115 schools to achieve effective sample sizes equivalent to those obtained using the strictly infinite population model. One of the factors operating in determining effective sample size for this case is the reduced clustering effect associated with the small schools in a large portion of the sample. Population 5 (Table 7) was chosen to illustrate a case where both types of limitations influence the sample allocation; in fact, this population does not exhibit either problem since the state NAEP standard design requires only 104 schools. Because the number of schools is large in both school size strata, the finite population correction has only minimal influence on effective sample size. Required sample sizes for both schools and total students are reduced only moderately by taking account of the finite population correction."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "The Effects of Finite Sampling Corrections on State Assessment Sample Requirements 1 0 0 Population 6 (shown in Table 8 ) was also selected to exhibit the many schools problem. This represents a much smaller state, and application of the finite population correction factor does materially reduce the required sample size from the standard state NAEP model. The state NAEP requirement is not excessive in magnitude, but it does represent a high proportion of the school population. The alternate design options allow for reduction of the proportion of schools sampled. Table 9 shows the design effects for total population estimates, for males, and for a region constituting one third of the state assuming the six hypothetical populations studied above; all results are shown for variance component distribution A and the sample allocation chosen for that distribution in Tables 4 through 9 . We use variance model 1 and define the design effect as:\nNote that the numerator in this expression incorporates the finite population correction' for the school component of variance and that any contribution from the component of variance associated with within-state strata is completely eliminated. No finite population correction is assumed for the simple random sample variance in the denominator. Design effects for subgroups which partition all (or nearly all) sessions tend to reduce the design effect since the effect of clustering is reduced; the design effects for males exhibit this behavior. Subgroups which are formed in terms of entire schools, such as regional estimate, maintain the same clustering effects, and assuming constant variance components across subgroups, the same design effects.\nMore complex changes in design effects are associated with subgroups such as ethnic groups which may exhibit varying concentrations over schools. Table 10 shows design effects for three populations based on their distribution across schools in selected states. Design effects were computed assuming stratification by ethnic subgroup concentration and averaging clustering effects over strata. The model used to approximate these design effects in Table10 took account of the distribution of schools by concentration of the population subgroup. It also took account of the differing finite population correction factors in different size of school strata for populations 5 and 6. To gain a better intuitive understanding of the design effects for subpopulations when using a finite population correction factor, it may be useful to examine a simpler approximation to the design effect for subgroups. When there is no stratification and no finite population correction, the design effect is often expressed as Deff = 1 + p (n3 1) where we carry over the notation from the previous section on finite population variance models and define the intra-school correlation.coefficient as p = 1 -a32/a2. If we wish to incorporate stratification, subgroup estimation, and a finite population correction at the first stage as assumed in variance model 1, the simple model can be enhanced as Deff = 1 + p(ydn3fPc2 1) where y = G22/(012+ 022), or the portion of the remaining variance associated with schools, d represents the proportion of the population that belongs to a particular subgroup or domain, and fpc2 represents the finite population correction factor for the school stage of sample selection. Several observations can be made from this model. If the finite population correction, fpc2, goes to zero, the design effect beComes simply I p taking full advantage of the initial strata and schools as stratifying variables to totally eliminate contributions from the first two components of variance. If the product, ydn-Afpc2, becomes less than 1 for any reason, the design effect will also be less than 1. For the three populations and sample allocations considered in Table 10 for models 3 and 5 utilized the partitioned or mixed variance model, vii, m and the finite population correction factor is zero in the first partition. The simpler model uses an average finite population correction factor which does not recognize the mix of zero and nonzero corrections."}, {"section_title": "RFST COPY AVAILARLE", "text": "Many of the sample size requirements for state NAEP stem from the need to support subgroup level estimates. One must examine both expected yield and projected design effects for population subgroups. The main problem for some subgroup estimates may be that proportional allocation will not yield adequate sample sizes to support the planned analyses. Without adequate stratification controls in a proportional allocation design, the subgroup sample size may behave as an uncontrolled random variable, leaving the adequacy of the sample size to chance. Stratification can be applied to reduce this type of variability in achieved sample sizes; drawing larger overall samples can also reduce the sample-to-sample variability in achieved subgroup sample sizes, thus reducing the risk of an unusually small subgroup sample occurring by chance."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "text": "The investigation above lends support to alternate sample size specifications in both states with few schools and states with many small schools. Some additional changes in optional designs should also be considered. The alternate.allocations used above assumed proportional or near proportional allocations to the large school and small school strata. Appropriate cost modeling and the application of optimum allocation theory could yield less costly designs which would most likely favor more sampling from the larger schools. The precision requirements for each design were based on maintaining the effective sample size that would pertain to the ideal hypothetical population case (or, equivalently, to the case in which the state had a sufficiently large number of schools such that finite population corrections would have very little impact on the variance). A better approach would be to base the required effective sample size on the needs of data users.\nBetter estimates of variance components associated with strata, schools, and students for a variety of assessment measures would also be of great assistance in investigations such 16 The Effects of Finite Sampling Corrections on State Assessment Sample Requirements 22 as this one. These estimates should be combined with the development of variable survey cost models so that optimal sample design decisions could be based on minimizing overall cost that is subject to meeting specified precision (or, equivalently, effective sample size) requirements.\nAllowing states to implement design options other than the standard requirement of at least 100 schools and at least 2,500 students per subject could actually help to reduce the variable costs associated with administration, field quality control, scoring, and data processing. Analyzing a state's school and student population distributions in order to fully develop an alternative which incorporates the reduced sample size and still meets analytic requirements for selected subgroups as well as for the total population would add to the total cost of state assessments. If this process could be routinized, the increased cost should be controllable. Some initial experience would quickly disqualify a large number of states from consideration so that these additional costs should also only apply to a few special cases. In general, analysis of the adequacy of sample and overall survey designs with respect to users' analytic needs should be viewed as essential to the ongoing success of any longitudinal data series such as the National and State assessments of education; the review of state assessment designs certainly fits within this general concept."}]
