[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Intense Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) are commonly observed at intermediate depth in the eastern part of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Karstensen et al., 2008;Keeling et al., 2010). Observations indicate a strong oxygen decline within these regions during the last 50 years (Stramma et al., 2008(Stramma et al., , 2012. A change in oxygen levels can result from both changes in circulation and biogeochemistry. Remineralization of sinking organic material consumes oxygen in the ocean interior, while transport tends to resupply oxygen by diffusive (Gnanadesikan et al., 2012) or advective (Duteil et al., 2014;Montes et al., 2014) processes. Natural or anthropogenic changes in ocean circulation and export production therefore potentially lead to changes in oxygen concentrations, which may either cancel or reinforce each other on different time scales. For instance, using a coupled biogeochemical circulation model, Deutsch et al. (2011) and Ito and Deutsch (2013) suggested that in the north eastern tropical Pacific Ocean the changes in oxygen solubility and respiration due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) compensate, damping the magnitude of the interior oxygen variability on interannual time scales. On decadal time scales, the integrated variability of biogeochemical and physical processes produce a pronounced oxygen variance, possibly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Deutsch et al., 2011). In the eastern tropical North Pacific, local changes in the trade winds appear to play a central role in setting oxygen variability as they control the coastal upwelling, biological productivity, and therefore the amount of respiration occurring in the thermocline (Deutsch et al, 2014). The strength of trade winds, connected with the Walker circulation (Feng et al. 2011), also affects the linkage between tropical and extra-tropical regions via upper-ocean meridional transports associated with the Subtropical-Tropical Cells (STCs) (McCreary and Lu., 1994;Schott et al., 2004). The STCs transport the ventilated waters from subtropical \u00a92014 American Geophysical Union.

In the Pacific Ocean, observations have shown a decline of the strength of these cells by 30 percent over the period 1953 to 2001 (Zhang and McPhaden, 2006). This multidecadal change can be decomposed into two parts: a STC decrease from the 1960s to the mid 1990s followed by a progressive recovery (McPhaden and Zhang, 2004;Feng et al., 2011). Model studies showed that the spin-up and -down of the STCs contribute to equatorial sea surface temperature anomalies and vertical shifts of the thermocline (Kleeman et al., 1999;Nonaka et al., 2002;L\u00fcbbecke et al., 2008). As suggested by McPhaden and Zhang (2002), long-term changes or fluctuations of the STCs might impact the transport of biogeochemical tracers, i.e, of oxygen and nutrients and could thus exert an effective control on oxygen levels in the tropical ocean. Here we use a coupled biogeochemical circulation model integrated from 1948 to 2007 to assess the mechanisms, physical and biogeochemical, of changes in tropical Pacific oxygen concentrations. After a description of the experimental strategy (part 2), we assess the multidecadal trend of the simulated interior oxygen concentration and compare it to observations (part 3). We then investigate the mechanisms of the simulated trends, delineating the impacts of oxygen transport and respiration (part 4), followed by an assessment of the role of the STCs in setting the oxygen concentrations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (part 5)."}, {"section_title": "Model experiments", "text": "The ocean model builds on the NEMO3.4 code (Madec, 2008). The configuration used is ORCA05 (see Duteil et al. (2014) for a more detailed description) in \"offline\" mode. The \"offline\" circulation is provided by a previous interannual ORCA05 \"physics-only\" simulation, forced by the COREv2 1948COREv2 -2007 (Large and Yeager, 2009). The biogeochemical model is a 6 component NPZD-type model optimized by Kriest et al. (2010) in a steady-state circulation field derived from the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and A spin-up is first performed using the COREv2 'normal year' forcing. After 1000 years of integration, the tracers reached a quasi equilibrium state in the upper 1000 m ( Figure A1). The modeled oxygen distribution in the interior of the ocean (Figure 1a) is consistent with the patterns of the World Ocean Atlas (WOA) (Garcia et al., 2010), with low levels in the eastern tropical regions and high levels in the subtropics and in the regions of water mass formation. The area of suboxic volume (oxygen lower than 5 mmol.m -3 ) appears however larger in the model than in the observations. This is the case in most current models (Cocco et al., 2013) as a possible consequence of model grid resolution, which lack an explicit representation of the equatorial zonal jets (Getzlaff and Dietze, 2013;Duteil et al., 2014). We performed two experiments starting from the previously described spun up state : -BIOVAR: the interanually varying 1948 -2007 circulation is applied to all the biogeochemical tracers. This experiment assesses the combined role of oxygen transport and respiration variability on the oxygen field variability. -BIOCLIM: the interannually varying 1948 -2007 circulation is only applied to the oxygen tracer, while a repeated climatological annual cycle circulation is applied to the other tracers, \u00a92014 American Geophysical Union.

The first 10 years of the experiments are discarded as the shift from climatological to interannual forcing causes an initial perturbation: the analysis focuses on the period 1958-2007."}, {"section_title": "Oxygen trends in the ocean interior", "text": "The observed oxygen trend is characterized by a general decline in oxygen concentrations in tropical regions during the last decades, in particular in the Pacific Ocean (Stramma et al., 2008;. This decline is shown in Figure 1b using data from the World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD2013) (average 160\u00b0W-coast, 10\u00b0S-10\u00b0N: see the data coverage in Figure A2). The 300 m depth level has been chosen as it is located in the upper thermocline, close to the minimum of oxygen values (Karstensen et al., 2008;Stramma et al., 2008;Keeling et al., 2010). The mean oxygen concentration decreases by about 5 mmol.m -3 in this region from 1950 to 2010. We only use the grid boxes (see Figure A2) where data are available during all decades to compute the decadal evolution. In the experiment BIOCLIM, where the biology and hence the respiration is kept at a climatological annual cycle, the changes in the Pacific oxygen concentration from 1958 to 2007 are particularly pronounced ( Figure 1c) and are characterized by a linear decline ( Figure   1d). In this basin, the mean oxygen concentration decreases by 5 mmol.m -3 .decade -1 between 20\u00b0S and 20\u00b0N, where oxygen is already low (Figure 1c). Bands of strong negative trends are also found around 20\u00b0 latitude in both hemispheres at the boundaries between subtropical gyres and tropics. In the gyres, between 20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 latitude, the mean oxygen concentration is almost constant. Changes are weaker by one order of magnitude in the Atlantic Ocean \u00a92014 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. compared to the Pacific Ocean. In the Southern Ocean, simulated oxygen increases from 40\u00b0E to 160\u00b0W and decreases from 160\u00b0W to 60\u00b0W around 50\u00b0S. In the experiment BIOVAR (Figure 1e and 1f), where respiration is allowed to vary interannually, the changes in oxygen concentration are strikingly different, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Simulated oxygen concentrations increase linearly by up to 5 mmol.m -"}, {"section_title": "3", "text": ".decade -1 in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, where concentrations below 50 mmol.m -3 were found in the beginning of the experiment. Overall, the pattern of long-term oxygen change appears closer to observations (Figure 1b) in BIOCLIM ( Figure 1d) than in BIOVAR (Figure 1f), suggesting that the biological response might be weaker in reality than in our model. Conversely, the changes in oxygen concentration are similar in BIOCLIM and BIOVAR in the subtropical gyres and the Southern Ocean, showing that in these regions the changes in oxygen concentration are primarily governed by oxygen transport processes, with comparatively minor contributions from biogeochemistry.  mainly by circulation changes, as seen above, but changes in the oxygen respiration also play some role in our simulations. During the last decades, respiration decreases in the tropics (Figure 3a), due to a reduction of phytoplankton biomass caused by a rarefaction of phosphate in the mixed layer (Figure 3b). The progressive decrease in the strength of the equatorial current system and the STCs has two antagonistic effects: First, a decrease of phosphate supply into the mixed layer, as the equatorial upwelling is reduced. Second, a reduced input of low-phosphate water originating from the gyres, which tends to increase tropical phosphate concentrations. According to our model, the reduction in upwelling dominates and reduces phosphate concentrations in the tropical mixed layer (Figure 3b) and associated export production and respiration. The result is an unrealistic increase in oxygen levels in this region in the BIOVAR experiment despite reduced ventilation (Figure 1d), which is inconsistent with observations (Figure 1b). While the simulated decline in surface phosphate is in agreement with the WOD2013 data ( Figure 3c) (average 160\u00b0W-70\u00b0W, 10\u00b0S-10\u00b0N, for data coverage see figure A3), with a progressive decline by 10 percent from 1950 to 2010, the model's mean surface phosphate concentration in that area is one order of magnitude too low (Figure 3b) due to the neglect of iron limitation in the model. The same surface pattern is shown in Kriest et al. (2010) from which the biogeochemical model has been adapted (their figure 4, experiment 28). As that model still yields subsurface oxygen and phosphate concentrations that agree well (and in the rms metric context agree 'best') with observations, we believe that this surface bias does not have substantial effects on our analysis of thermocline oxygen changes."}, {"section_title": "Covariance of oxygen concentration and STC strength", "text": "The index of the STC strength has been computed similarly as in Lohmann and Latif (2005) as the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of the MOC in the range 10\u00b0N-10\u00b0S and the upper 250 m of the ocean. The STC index decreases by about 10 Sv from 1960 to 2000 in agreement with previous model studies and observations. In particular, L\u00fcbbecke et al. (2008) showed a decrease of the same STC index by about 15 Sv from 1958 to 2001 in their reference model configuration. The long-term geostrophic volume transport inferred from observations in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9\u00b0N and 9\u00b0S decreased by 7 Sv from 1950 (28Sv) to 2000 (22 Sv) (Zhang and McPhaden, 2006). As a note of caution, the CORE forcing used in the current study may be biased by artificial trends in the wind fields before the mid 1970s, which might lead to an overestimation of the STC decline (Schott et al., 2007;L\u00fcbbecke et al., 2008) and to a damping of decadal variability, which reaches 7-10 Sv in observations (Zhang and McPhaden, 2006) while it does not exceed 2-3 Sv in our model experiments. In addition, STC simulations may be affected by spurious model drift possibly reaching 30 percent of the multi-decadal trend (Feng et al., 2011). Removing a drift in the STC transport is not straightforward as biogeochemical processes are characterized by a highly non-linear behavior. Despite these biases, a lower STC index is nevertheless simulated from 1975 to 2000, corresponding roughly to the positive PDO phase. A recovery of the STCs, correlated with the subsequent negative PDO phase, is simulated during the last years of the model experiment although to a much smaller extent than in observations where the STC strength nearly doubles in a few years (McPhaden and Zhang, 2004), from 12 Sv in 1996 to 22 Sv in 2000 (Zhang and McPhaden, 2006). The STC directly impacts tropical subsurface tracers by the STC's advection of anomalies from the mid-latitudes (Gu and Philander, 1997) and through changes in STC strength and hence the transport of the considered property (Kleeman et al., 1999). As a result, on \u00a92014 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. interannual and decadal time scales the STC index covaries with equatorial sea surface temperatures and phytoplankton concentrations, constrained by the input of nutrients ( Figure   4a). Oxygen concentrations vary similarly when the biogeochemical tracers are kept to climatological values (experiment BIOCLIM). In particular, oxygen concentrations in BIOCLIM are characterized by a long-term decrease from 35 to 15 mmol.m-3 from 1960 to 1995, but tend to stabilize and increase by a few micromoles in the last decade due to the STC recovery. When biology is fully interactive (experiment BIOVAR), the decrease of oxygen consumption compensates the decrease in oxygen transport due to the slower connection with subtropical gyres, ultimately leading to an oxygen increase of about 10 mmol.-3 during the last 50 years. The interannual to decadal variability has been estimated by computing the standard deviation of the oxygen time series, after removal of the long-term trend and the application of a 8-years running mean. It is twice as large in BIOCLIM (2.8 mmol.m-3) as in BIOVAR (1.4 mmol.m-3). The variability in the oxygen concentration is due to both variability in transport and respiration (Figure 4b), which partly compensate in BIOVAR. Such a stabilizing mechanism has been described in ocean models for the upper thermocline of the subpolar north (Deutsch et al., 2006) and eastern tropical (Ito and Deutsch, 2013) Pacific region. In the latter study the variability of export production and oxygen consumption is, however, strongly constrained as the biological nutrient uptake is parameterized via a linear relaxation of simulated surface nutrients to the respective monthly climatology. Their "}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusion", "text": "Using a coupled biogeochemical circulation model, we show that the transport of oxygen from the well-ventilated subtropical gyres to the tropical regions is reduced from 1948 to 2007, leading to a pronounced decrease in oxygen concentrations (about 5 mmol.m -3 .decade -1 ) when respiration is kept at a constant climatological value (experiment BIOCLIM).This study highlights the key role played by the STCs in controlling nutrient and oxygen concentrations in the tropical oceans. The simulated decrease of the strength of these cells by about 30 percent during the last decades is in good agreement with observations and induces a decline in tropical oxygen concentrations. The variability in biogeochemical and physical processes almost compensates each other and leads to a decreased oxygen variance both on interannual and decadal time scales. In comparison with observations the long-term oxygen decrease in experiment BIOCLIM, where the biology has been set to a climatological value, is more realistic than the results of experiment BIOVAR, where simulated oxygen levels increase. This suggests that the amplitude of biological changes induced by a slowdown of the upper-ocean overturning is weaker in reality than in the model that we employed, possibly due to the lack of iron limitation which in reality regulates the amount of export production. According to our model results, and in contrast to the oxygen changes around 20 o N investigated by Deutsch et al. (2014), the changes in tropical oxygen concentrations observed during the last decades should be linked mainly to a reduction of oxygen transport. In a suite of 7 earth system models, Cocco et al. (2013)   m) from 2000 to 2100 in a suite of 10 CMIP5 models. While the decrease of primary production (-4 to -10 %) driven by enhanced stratification is a robust feature across these models, there is less agreement concerning the evolution of low oxygen water volume in tropical regions (decrease of 2 % to an increase of 16 % for a threshold of 50 mmol.m-3) presumably due to changes in circulation and in particular in the subtropical cells. Yang et al. (2014) showed a large variability in the STC evolution in a subset of 8 CMIP5 models as the long-term trend varies from -2 to +2 Sv from 1900 to 2008 depending of the model considered (Yang et al., 2014). Our results suggest a close correlation of the strength of the STCs and thermocline oxygen levels in the eastern tropical Pacific. They are thus complementary to the conclusions of Deutsch et al. (2011Deutsch et al. ( , 2014 who argue that a decrease in trade winds as projected for the next decades would decrease the upwelling strength, leading to a deepening of the thermocline and then an increase in oxygen levels in the eastern tropical North Pacific region. We show that vertical motions of the thermocline have little impact on oxygen concentration in regions where horizontal dynamics and transport are vigorous, in particular close to the equator where a decrease in wind-driven ventilation is associated with a reduction in oxygen levels. For example, Czeschel et al., (2012) observed a strong oxygen decrease in the eastern equatorial Pacific (110\u00b0W) from the 1980s to the 1990s (50 to 20 mmol.m-3) followed by an increase by 20 to 30 mmol.m-3 from 2000 to 2010. These oxygen variations are consistent with the observed STC variability (figure 4c), supporting our model-based analysis. Conversely, the modulation of oxygen content in the water column by the variability of the thermocline depth is likely to be more important in regions characterized by strong vertical dynamics, such as the California upwelling system investigated by Deutsch et al. (2011Deutsch et al. ( , 2014). \u00a92014 American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. In summary, we have shown here that atmospherically driven variations in the STCs connecting tropics and subtropics and controlling oxygen supply to the tropical ocean could explain a large part of the tropical oxygen variability on (multi-)decadal timescales.
