This definition is generally thought to select AD patients with more rapid pathophysiological and functional activity declines and high mortality rate [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The prevalence of rpAD found in the literature varied greatly across different studies and conceptual definitions [2, 3] . Therefore, reliable results in large-scale populations are crucial to better characterize these set of individuals for future clinical trials designed to test interventions able to mitigate the aggressive disease progression in this population. So, studies of prevalence of rpAD in a larger study population such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database are highly desirable [6] .\nRecent studies have shown that several biomarker modalities can predict cognitive decline in AD populations, including glucose hypometabolism measured by uptake of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) [7, 8] , hippocampal atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [9] , decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-b (Ab ), increased CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) [8, [10] [11] [12] , and the APOE genotype [1, [13] [14] [15] . However, parts of these results remain inconsistent. Moreover, these biomarkers were separately tested in different study during longer follow-up period. Therefore, when AD patients were dichotomized into rpAD and non-rpAD based on MMSE score loss 4 points within 6 months, for such a given population of rpAD, which biomarkers more correlate with the rapidly cognitive decline during the short-term follow-up period still need to be verified in the same AD population. Based on this idea, we decided to investigate the prevalence and comprehensive biomarkers' characteristic of rpAD patients from ADNI database in the same population, which could contribute to a better understanding of the disease in this population."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study samples", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

We have four important findings: (1) the prevalence of rpAD patients was 17.6% in mild AD according to the definition of MMSE score loss 4 points within 6 months, (2) APOE genotype seemed to have no effect on rpAD, (3) there was lower p-tau/tau ratio in rpAD, and (4) rpAD patients showed significant region-specific hypometabolism (FDG-PET) especially in left angular and left temporal cortices.\nThe present study confirmed that rpAD commonly existed in mild AD with 17.6% prevalence. This findings is consistent with the previous reports showing that 10% to 30% of mild AD patients manifest rpAD [1, 2] . It is important to mention that different prevalence of rpAD among studies might be caused by different definitions of rapidly cognitive decline, as reflected in the MMSE score loss. A general but clinically useful definition of rapidly progressive course of AD may be \"an obvious deterioration in patient status with a short period (6-12 months).\" We defined rpAD according to MMSE score loss 4 points within 6 months, which represented a higher risk of institutionalization and mortality rate as reported previously [1, 5] . The rapid cognitive and functional changes were also well captured by the ADASCog 13 and FAQ over 12 months. Thus, we confirmed that the rapid changes observed in the MMSE were reflected in different cognitive and functional measures. The rpAD definition of MMSE score loss 4 points within 6 months could be very informative. Meanwhile, the 6-month follow-up period seemed to be a practical interval in clinical practice in deciding to use and change drug treatment. Thus, based on 6-month cut-off value, a proportion of AD patients really have a rapid course of disease. The APOE is the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. APOE genotype influences onset age of AD [21] [22] [23] . Yet, it is still a matter of debate whether APOE genotype would predict the progression of AD [1] . Many studies have failed to connect the presence of APOE genotype to cognitive decline because of the fact that it is dependent on disease severity [14] . Our results support this notion showing that in mild AD there was no difference in frequency of APOE \u03b54/\u03b54, APOE \u03b53/\u03b54, and APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 occurrence between rpAD and non-rpAD. In addition, there was no difference in MMSE and ADAS-Cog 13 score loss in APOE \u03b54/\u03b54, APOE \u03b53/\u03b54, APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 positive, and APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 negative rpAD patients. Thus, our data demonstrate that APOE genotype does not increase the risk and severity of rpAD in the mild stage of disease. However, a positive association of cognitive decline with APOE genotype was found in several studies [15, 24] . Yet, we must point out that there are still many differences in the selected measures, the number of patients, duration of follow-up, and visiting interval between the present study and others. In this study, we focused on rapidly cognitive decline in 6 month short-term duration of follow-up. In the future, one more frequent and prolonged evaluation should occur to understand APOE genotype effect on the rapidly progressive course in mild AD.\nCSF biomarkers, such as increased tau and p-tau and decreased Ab , are useful diagnostic marker for AD.\nYet, the results remain inconsistent in predicting progression of AD by CSF biomarkers [10] [11] [12] . Recent longitudinal studies have found a relation between CSF biomarkers and disease progression, which indicated that a combination of high CSF t-tau without proportionally elevated p-tau, and high tau/Ab 1-42 ratio is related to a rapidly cognitive decline [10] . We must point out that the conclusions about CSF biomarkers as predictors of disease progression were more suitable with longer follow-up period. In the present study, AD patients were dichotomized into rpAD and nonrpAD based on MMSE score loss 4 points within 6 months. During the short-term follow-up period, we found that there were no obvious differences in baseline concentration of CSF tau, p-tau, and Ab 1-42 in rpAD and non-rpAD group. Regression analysis also did not showed causal relationship between group status and CSF tau, p-tau, and Ab . Interestingly, in comparison with non-rpAD, a trend for higher tau/Ab 1-42 ratio and lower p-tau/tau ratio in rpAD was observed, which could reflect adjoint relationship and offer differential value for rpAD during the short-term follow-up period. In the literature, higher tau/Ab 1-42 ratio reflected the pathology of AD with increased tau and decreased Ab . CSF t-tau represents one common biomarker for neuronal degeneration [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . P-tau is one more specific biomarker for AD and is related to neurofibrillary tangles [30] [31] [32] . The lower p-tau/tau ratio indicated a low rate of p-tau and seemed contrary to general knowledge for high p-tau, which was associated with main AD pathology. Recent evidence demonstrated that p-tau can benefit the neurons via preventing against an acute apoptosis, instead resulting in neurodegeneration [33] [34] [35] . This could suggest that p-tau has compensatory or protective effect. From this point of view, lower p-tau/tau ratio suggests higher neurodegeneration and more rapidly cognitive decline. Previous research reported that hippocampus atrophy rate correlated with cognitive decline rate over time in AD [9, 36] . Yet, during the short-term follow-up period, the change of MRI hippocampus volume did not offer differential value for rpAD. Similarly, baseline cortical amyloid deposition (Florbetapir-PET) in mild AD did not show useful information for rpAD in the relative short-term follow-up period. Our research revealed that the baseline hypometabolism (FDG-PET) was lower in rpAD patients compared with non-rpAD, which persisted in the 6-month follow-up period. Hypometabolism difference was region specific and located in left angular and left temporal cortices. Our ROC analysis of FDG-PET also clearly demonstrated that left angular and left temporal cortices were the regions with higher AUC and predictive value for the diagnosis of rpAD. Thus, hypometabolism in FDG-PET in AD-related regions might be a sensitive neuroimaging marker for the early detection of rpAD before MRI hippocampus atrophy and cortical amyloid deposition.\nTaken together, by using the high-quality ADNI database, we identified that rpAD commonly existed in mild AD. Cerebral hypometabolism and lower p-tau/tau ratio could provide potential clinical differential value for rpAD in the short-term follow-up period. 2. Interpretation: Our study demonstrated a comprehensive assessment about the prevalence and multiple biomarkers' characteristic of rpAD patients in short-term follow-up period. We found that rpAD commonly existed and cerebral region-specific hypometabolism could provide clinical predictive value for identifying rpAD.\n3. Future directions: Our study contributed to a better understanding of rpAD. These findings are crucial to better characterize these set of individuals for future clinical trials designed to test interventions able to mitigate the aggressive disease progression in this population.
