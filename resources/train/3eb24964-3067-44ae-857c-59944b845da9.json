Today the program serves more than a quarter of the pregnant women and half of the infants in the United States, at an annual cost of about $6.2 billion. Through its contribution to the nutritional needs of pregnant, breastfeeding, and post-partum women; infants; and children under 5 years of age; this federally supported nutrition assistance program is integral to meeting national nutrition policy goals for a significant portion of the U.S. population. To assure the continued success of WIC, Congress mandated that the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reevaluate the program's food packages every 10 years to assure that they remain aligned with the goals of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In 2014, the USDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to undertake this reevaluation. This complex task included consideration of whether or not WIC participants should be permitted to purchase white potatoes with the cash value voucher (CVV), a part of the benefit package that provides access to fresh fruits and vegetables. In its first of three reports, published early in 2015, the committee recommended that white potatoes be allowed as a WICeligible vegetable for purchase with the CVV. This, the second report of this series, provides a summary of the work of phase I of the study, and serves as the analytical underpinning for phase II in which the committee will report its final conclusions and recommendations (the third and final report). In this report, the committee provides the findings and conclusions from its evidence gathering and data analyses. Finally, the report presents the committee's criteria that lay the groundwork for phase II of the study, and offers a framework to guide development of the committee's recommendations. The work of the committee was greatly enhanced by the contributions of many individuals who participated in the study's public activities. The committee is grateful to the speakers in its data-gathering workshops who gave valuable insights as well as their time to assist the committee with its task. The committee also thanks the members of the public who provided comments in open sessions or through the committee's website. Lastly, the committee is indebted to the many WIC staff members who gave their time and expertise to help committee members better understand administration and participation in the WIC program. The size of this report is testimony to the magnitude of the committee's task. It exists thanks to the hard work of many individuals. Committee members volunteered many hours of their time to this work. Their collaborative spirit as well as careful thinking and writing are to be commended. The committee was supported in its work by two consultants.

Its goal was to provide supplemental foods that would supply nutrients lacking in the diets of low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum women, infants, and children less than 5 years of age, who had at least one nutritional risk factor. The WIC program also provides nutrition education and referrals to health and social services. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) requested that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) undertake a review of the WIC food packages to align the program with dietary guidance in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In response, the IOM convened the Committee to Review WIC Food Packages (the committee) to address this task. This, the phase I interim report, is the second of three reports. The first report, the Evaluation of White Potatoes in the Cash Value Voucher: Letter Report, recommended allowing white potatoes for purchase with the cash value voucher. This second report presents the evidence, analyses, and framework that will be applied to develop the final report (phase II), which will include recommendations. In the final report, recommendations for revisions to the WIC food packages will build on the revisions recommended in the 2006 IOM WIC report (implemented in 2009) and the evidence presented here, including an update and additional analyses. This interim (phase I) report contains an evidence-based review of relevant scientific literature, analyses of dietary intakes as well as food expenditure data and data on breastfeeding trends. The dietary intake evaluation included comparison of WIC participants to WIC-eligible non-participants. A comparison of intakes before the 2009 food package changes to after these changes will be presented in the final report (phase II). The committee identified possible priority nutrients and food groups that could be used to address nutritional inadequacies (see Chapter 1 for the complete statement of task). To design the phase I approach, the committee reviewed the key objectives of the WIC program and relevant changes to the WIC population, food packages, and dietary guidance and eating patterns among U.S. populations that occurred since the last IOM review of WIC food packages. Based on its preliminary review of evidence the committee developed the approach to the task outlined below."}, {"section_title": "THE COMMITTEE'S APPROACH", "text": "The committee's information-gathering activities included convening two workshops, conducting a comprehensive literature and report review, analyzing data, considering comments from the public and information obtained from committee member visits to WIC clinics and shopping with WIC vouchers. Data analyses were conducted with two national datasets. First, an independent evaluation of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data was conducted to examine intakes of nutrients and food groups of WIC participants and WICeligible non-participants (low-income and pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum women; infants; and children ages 1 to less than 5 years). Second, the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) data were evaluated to determine the contribution of WIC foods to household food expenditures. Approaches to a sensitivity analysis and a regulatory impact analysis were developed, to be completed in phase II. The sensitivity analysis will evaluate the effect of major food package changes on nutrient and food group intakes and package cost. The regulatory impact analysis will assess the impact of WIC food package changes on program participation, the value of food packages, and program cost and administration. To serve as the baseline for the sensitivity and regulatory impact analyses evaluations, the committee developed an approach to generating baseline food package nutrient profiles and determining costs of the food packages."}, {"section_title": "Application of Current Dietary Guidance to the Task", "text": "The recommendations of the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2015 DGAC report), along with the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), served as the basis for evaluation of nutrient and food intake adequacy in this report. The USDA's Healthy U.S. Food Pattern served as the basis for comparison of food group intakes by WIC participants and WIC-eligible non-participants. Other key recommendations in the 2015 DGAC report included identification of shortfall nutrients and nutrients of public health concern, and limits for sodium, solid fat, and added sugars intakes. Nine shortfall nutrients were identified in the 2015 DGAC report (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, calcium, magnesium, fiber, potassium, as well as iron for premenopausal females). Among these shortfall nutrients, calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium were classified as nutrients of public health concern because their under-consumption has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Iron was a shortfall nutrient of public health concern for adolescent females and premenopausal adult females. A specific limit for cholesterol intake was not indicated, and the recommended sodium intake limit for the general population was set at 2,300 mg per day. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and 2015 DGAC report apply only to individuals ages 2 years and older. Therefore, the committee compiled current published dietary guidance for individuals under 2 years of age issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authoritative groups to evaluate adequacy of the diets of WIC participants of these ages.  [2005][2006][2007][2008]. Only nutrients with intakes above recommended levels in more than 5 percent of the population for at least one population subgroup are presented. The committee's literature review found no evidence of excess nutrient intake for breastfeeding infants or formula-fed infants 0 to 6 months of age. * Nutrients represent those for which 5% or more of the population subgroup exceeded the UL. SOURCES: As indicated in Table 11-2 of this report. See Chapter 3 for details on determination of excessive intake. The criteria outlined above will be further explored (and possibly revised) in phase II after an update of the phase I review as well as consideration of the results of the analysis of nutrient and food consumption by WIC participants in NHANES 2011-2012 and limitations related to cost. The committee's proposed process for revising the WIC food packages in phase II is illustrated in Figure S-1. The objective is to ensure that the revisions fall within the criteria outlined in the previous section, with attention to cost-constraints. First, the current food packages will be evaluated for the nutrients and food groups provided and alignment with dietary guidance, as well as the challenges faced during implementation. After reviewing this information, the committee will identify priority changes in the food packages and test possible changes in an iterative fashion to align with the criteria and ensure overall program cost neutrality (the sensitivity analysis). During this process, the criteria or framework may be modified if deemed necessary. The committee anticipates that this process will involve trade-offs, with final recommendations guided by the criteria and cost constraints. Once the iterations result in changes that meet the final criteria, recommendations will be finalized. A regulatory impact analysis will then be conducted to assess the impact of changes in WIC food packages on program participation, the value of the food packages as selected, 1 and program costs and administration. the food packages (see Appendix D, Tables D1-D2 for information on the current food packages). Most, but not all, of the 2006 IOM report recommendations were fully implemented. For example, recommendations to add a cash value voucher (CVV) for the purchase of fruits and vegetables and to reduce the quantities of milk, cheese, and eggs in the food packages were implemented fully. Other recommendations, however, underwent modification before implementation. As an example, the recommendation to allow only whole grain breakfast cereals was modified to require that at least one half of all breakfast cereal on each state agency's authorized food list have whole grain as the primary ingredient by weight, thereby providing participants with a choice to continue to purchase breakfast cereals that are not whole grain. Finally, some recommendations were not implemented at all. For example, the proposed addition of a higher-value CVV for breastfeeding mothers was not implemented, with the 2014 final rule specifying that breastfeeding women would receive the same value CVV as all other women participants (USDA/FNS, 2014a). Table 1-1 illustrates that while most changes were implemented by fall of 2009 in accordance with the interim rule (USDA/FNS, 2007a), changes have been implemented over a period of 6 years. The final change (i.e., allowing a yogurt substitution for milk) was still underway at the time of this writing. A number of research activities have been undertaken to evaluate the impact of WIC generally and the food package changes specifically. As shown in Appendix E, Table E-1, USDA-sponsored investigators have studied changes in the behavior of vendors, the availability of vegetables and fruits for purchase with the CVV, the availability of foods in new package sizes, and the pattern of household-level food purchases. More recently, in response to a request from Congress, the USDA-FNS charged the IOM's current Committee to Review the WIC Food Packages to conduct a two-phase evaluation of the WIC food packages and develop recommendations for revising the packages to be consistent with the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and to consider the health and cultural needs of a diverse WIC population while remaining cost neutral, efficient for nationwide distribution, and nonburdensome to administration in national, state, and local agencies. The statement of task for this study is presented in Box 1-1. This report is the second of three reports aimed at fulfilling the USDA-FNS request. The first report in the series, An Evaluation of White Potatoes in the Cash Value Voucher: Letter Report , assessed the impact on food and nutrient intakes of the WIC population of the 2009 regulation to allow the purchase of vegetables and fruits, excluding white potatoes, with a CVV and recommended that white potatoes be allowed as a WIC-eligible vegetable . For this second (interim) report, the committee was tasked with a more comprehensive review of evidence to support the development of recommendations that will appear in the final (phase II) report. This review of evidence supported the development of the proposed criteria and framework to be used for possible food package revisions in phase II. The evidence and analyses summarized in this report are limited by the statement of task. Although the committee's review of evidence took into account that food selection and preparation affects the nutrient composition of the diet, some aspects of food preparation were beyond the scope of its task. Specifically, the addition of fat from butter, other fats, or toppings to vegetables, bread, rice or other foods by the consumer may be likely, but the committee was not asked to consider how WIC participants modified WIC foods for consumption. Additionally, because the committee was charged to consider foods that are readily available in the marketplace, this review will not consider foods under development, nor recommend the development of new foods. Finally, changes to USDA-FNS programs that are linked to the WIC food package but are fiscally independent (e.g., farmers' markets) are considered for context, but no changes to the functions of such programs will be suggested in phase II."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND", "text": "1-3\n1-7\n1-21 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS vegetables,\" \"starchy vegetables,\" and \"beans and peas.\" The recommended quantities of \"darkgreen vegetables\" and \"other vegetables\" decreased. There were no changes in recommended intakes of total fruit, grains, protein foods, or oils. Recommended intakes of dairy foods were slightly increased for two calorie levels. Compared to the 2010 DGA, the 2015 DGAC reported no changes to the recommended amounts from each of the major food groups or food subgroups, except for small changes to the subgroups of protein foods. One notable change was the specification of calories from saturated fats and added sugars, which was given as a single percent of total energy intake in the 2010 DGA. In the report of the 2015 DGAC, limits were given separately for solid fats and for added sugars. The implication is that energy from these two dietary components is not interchangeable. As a result, low intake of one does not imply that a higher intake of the other would be appropriate. The food patterns in the 2010 DGA included templates for several variations in the USDA Food Pattern, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Eating Plan, and Mediterranean, vegetarian, and vegan patterns. The 2015 DGAC report included a healthy U.S.style, healthy Mediterranean, and healthy vegetarian patterns ."}, {"section_title": "PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS", "text": "This report contains only findings and conclusions, which are summarized in Chapter 11. It does not make recommendations. However, the committee was tasked with developing a preliminary list of priority nutrients and food groups that could be used to address nutritional deficits in the WIC population . To help with subsequent phase II activities and based on evidence reviewed in this report, the committee developed criteria and a proposed process to use during its phase II evaluation of the current WIC food packages, also described in Chapter 11.\nIn addition to considering nutrient intake (Chapter 4), food intake (Chapter 5), and health status of WIC participants (Chapter 6), the committee considered a number of other factors before developing its preliminary list of nutrient and food priorities for consideration during phase II evaluation of the food packages. Specifically, the committee reviewed the role of the WIC food packages as intended by the USDA-FNS; applicability of the 2015 DGAC report recommendations to WIC food packages; the science of functional ingredients added to foods and infant formulas in the WIC food packages; the infant formula regulatory and market landscape; choice and flexibility within the food packages; and cost considerations. The approach to considering these other factors is described in Chapter 9. In addition to its dietary intake tasks, the committee was tasked with the planning and implementation of a food expenditure analysis. Chapter 10 summarizes results of the phase I analysis illustrating the contribution of WIC foods to total household food expenditures. Key findings from all chapters, except Chapter 3 because of its focus on methodology, are highlighted in Chapter 11. Also included in Chapter 11, and based on findings detailed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, is the committee's preliminary list of food groups that could be used to address nutritional deficits in the WIC population; the committee-developed set of guiding principles, or criteria, for use in its phase II study; and a proposed process, or framework, to use as a basis for decision-making during phase II of the study.\n\nThe 2007 WIC food package redesign challenged food vendors to supply some new food items and provide some existing items in unprecedented quantities, affecting the demand for food items and, in some cases, requiring vendors to change their supply systems. For example, authorized vendors are required by USDA to stock at least two different fruits and two different vegetables, but minimum stocking requirements vary from state to state. California requires vendors to stock at least five different fruits and five different vegetables, while other states require only the federal minimum (USDA/FNS, 2014b). Vendors appeared to face some challenges when adapting to the 2009 revisions in WICeligible foods. Managers of small stores reported that they had difficulty in finding suppliers for some items (e.g., a 1-pound loaf of bread, fresh fruit, and low-fat milk), as demand was perceived to be low for healthier food items among the general population (Andreyeva et al., 2011;Gittelsohn et al., 2012). Gleason et al. (2014) reported that vendors serving American Indian communities found it difficult to anticipate demand and therefore maintain the supply of some WIC foods. Vendors have also reported issues with delivery of spoiled items (Gleason et al., 2014) and maintaining freshness .\n\nAs with the nutrient profiles for the baseline composite food packages, nutrient data for each food change will come from the USDA Standard Reference Database, Release 27 (USDA/ARS, 2014). Should major changes to the food packages be considered, the amount of change in nutrient intake will be evaluated in terms of its effect on the risks of nutrient inadequacy by adjusting the intake distribution by the amount of the nutrient change. For minor changes, the amount of change in nutrient intake will be assessed without looking at distribution shifts. Changes in food group and subgroup intake will be evaluated with respect to changes in the degree to which 2015 DGA food group recommendations are met. Finally, cost changes will be evaluated for all food and combination changes.\n\nThe mean usual energy intake of WIC participating infants less than 6 months of age was 705 kcal per day, which is 19 percent higher than the EER of 594 kcal per day for these individuals (see Table 4-8). .3 (0.35) NOTES: AI = Adequate Intake level; g/kg/d = grams per kilogram of body weight per day; kcal = kilocalories; NA = data not available; N = sample size; tsp-eq/d = teaspoon-equivalents per day. Intake data were insufficient to calculate reliable estimates for fiber intakes; NR = no recommendation; SE = standard error. There were no statistically significant differences between the WIC and eligible non-WIC subgroups. Subgroup definitions are as follows: a WIC = All individuals reporting participation in WIC regardless of income level. b Eligible Non-WIC = Low-income individuals that did not report participation in WIC. c All Low-Income = All individuals at \u2264 185 percent of poverty. At the time of analysis, the WIC indicator was not available for NHANES 2011-2012. Thus, the \"All Low-Income 2011-2012\" group serves as a proxy for current intakes of this population. d All NA notations indicate that data are not available because Statistical Program for Age-adjusted Dietary Assessment (SPADE) requires more than two observations per group with two non-zero intakes in order to estimate a within person variance. SOURCES: Intake data were obtained from NHANES 2005(USDA/ARS, 2005. Reference intakes for protein, total carbohydrate, and total fat are per the Dietary Reference Intake reports (IOM, 2002  ; N = sample size; SE = standard error. There were no statistically significant differences between WIC and eligible non-WIC subgroups. Subgroup definitions are as follows: a WIC = All individuals reporting participation in WIC regardless of income level. b Eligible Non-WIC = Low-income individuals that did not report participation in WIC. c All Low-Income = All individuals at \u2264 185 percent of poverty. At the time of analysis, the WIC indicator was not available for NHANES 2011-2012. Thus, the \"All Low-Income 2011-2012\" group serves as a proxy for current intakes of this population. SOURCES: Intake data were obtained from NHANES 2005(USDA/ARS, 2005. EERs were calculated according to Dietary Reference Intake report (IOM, 2002.\nSecond, using NHANES data to capture data from WIC participants specifically depends on accurate self-identification by WIC recipients in NHANES, and determination of \"eligibility\" among other, low-income individuals. The committee's comparison of the weighted total number of recipients reporting WIC participation, as well as extensive experience reporting on social assistance programs like WIC, suggest that WIC use is underreported in NHANES (Bitler et al., 2003;Celhay et al., 2015;Meyer et al., 2015). In addition, there are challenges to determining individuals who are \"eligible\" but do not participate accurately. In addition to determination of demographic or physiological eligibility (i.e., age, pregnancy, post-partum and breastfeeding status), some WIC-eligible individuals may not be captured in the NHANES low-income (\u2264185 percent poverty-to-income ratio [PIR]) groups because they are of higher income levels. Applying the income criterion of \u2264 185 percent of the PIR does not necessarily correspond to state-level income requirements for WIC eligibility. Individuals may still legitimately participate in the program if adjunctively or automatically eligible due to participation in Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). For these reasons, there may be more individuals eligible for WIC than would be included in a screen of \u2264 185 percent of the PIR. Finally, even if NHANES were to capture WIC participation exactly, the number of participants who are enrolled in WIC would still be very small.\nThere was no change in intake of \"low-fat\" milk (as defined in this study) by women. Importantly, this study was conducted prior to issuance of the final rule eliminating 2 percent milk from most food packages and allowing only skim or 1 percent (USDA/FNS, 2014).\nFood group intake findings from IFPS II (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008) and FITS 2008 (Deming et al., 2014) are summarized in Table 5-2. Findings from a recent NHANES analysis evaluating food group contributions to energy and nutrient intake (Grimes et al., 2015) are summarized in Table 5-3. Highlights of the three selected reports are discussed below.\nDifferences did emerge for consumption of sweetened beverages and fruit-flavored drinks, however, with more WIC participants 12-23.9 months old consuming these on a daily basis (39.6 percent and 31.1 percent, respectively) compared to non-participants (22.0 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively). Consumption of carbonated sodas (sweetened or non-caloric was not specified) also appears to have been more common among WIC participants 12-23.9 months old, but the point estimate for non-participants was imprecise due to small sample sizes and low frequency of consumption (10.3 percent of WIC vs. 1.8 percent of non-WIC). Approximately 18 percent of WIC participants 12-23.9 months old consumed salty snacks on a given day, which was comparable to non-participants. The 2005-2012 NHANES analysis found that sweet bakery products contributed 1.8 percent of the total energy intake of 6-11.9 month olds (Grimes et al., 2015). Among 12-23.9 month olds, sweet bakery products, sugar-sweetened beverages, savory snacks (e.g. potato chips, tortilla chips, popcorn, pretzels, snack mixes), candy, and other desserts each contributed more than 1 percent of total energy intake (Grimes et al., 2015).    Grimes et al. (2015), as intake contributed to less than 1 percent of total energy intake. d Sum of \"White Potatoes\" group and \"Vegetables, excluding potatoes\" group. \nThe prevalence of obesity and overweight among children is high and differs with ethnicity and poverty. In the nationally representative NHANES 2011-2012, 22.8 percent of U.S. children aged 2 to 5 years were overweight and obese (combined) (see Table 6-4; Ogden et al, 2014). The prevalence of obesity and overweight combined was higher among Hispanic children (29 percent) and lower among Asian children (9 percent) compared to non-Hispanic white or African-American children (21-22 percent) (Ogden et al, 2014). The prevalence of obesity and overweight combined in the 2011 PedNSS was 30 percent for children ages 2 to less than 5 years and higher than that reported from NHANES 2011-2012 (CDC, 2011b). The prevalence of obesity was 14 percent among children whose families had a poverty-income ratio (PIR) lower than or equal to 50 percent. This prevalence dropped to 12 percent among those whose families had a PIR of 151 to 185 percent (CDC, 2014b).\n\n\nThis is higher than the proportions of WIC families in the Phillips et al. (2014) study that were reportedly issued medical foods, which is likely to include specialty (exempt) formulas.\n\n10-1\nFoodAPS relies primarily on self-reported participation in the WIC program to establish program participation. There were some households that redeemed WIC vouchers but did not report that they were currently participating in WIC. This difference may be due in part to lags in enrollment and benefit issuance. Also, as would be expected and as previously mentioned, some households had no food expenditures or no food expenditures for food at home during the survey week. The committee assumed that these households were similar to other households and that their lack of expenditures for that week reflected weekly variation in food purchase and acquisition patterns. That is, households with no food purchases captured in the survey week have purchased food at a different time in the month that WIC foods were prescribed.  \nThe committee's phase II activities will include an update to the comprehensive scientific literature review that was conducted for this interim report, a reevaluation of the nutrient and food intake data compared to the 2015 DGA, an evaluation of nationwide costs and distribution of foods to ensure that the recommended new food packages are efficient for nationwide distribution, and sensitivity and regulatory impact analyses. A sensitivity analysis will consider each recommended alternative food item and change in quantity relevant to nutrients, the DRIs, food groups and subgroups, and cost. A regulatory impact analysis will assess the impact of proposed WIC food package changes on program participation, the value of the food packages, and program cost and administration. Additional details of the approaches to be used for the different activities are discussed in Chapter 3. Additionally, the committee will continue its iterative process and modify the criteria described above and the decision-making framework for making changes to the food packages, if deemed necessary.  , phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, and fluoride.

Although the U.S. population has increased 9 percent since 2005, from 296 to nearly 322 million, births have contributed minimally to this increase (USCB, 2005(USCB, , 2015. Since 2007, birthrates have been declining . The greatest contributions to population growth have come from immigration, temporary and permanent residency, and other population shifts (DHS, 2014). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the majority of growth in the U.S. population from 2000 to 2010 resulted from an increase in Hispanic and Asian populations (USCB, 2011). The 2010 American Community Survey found that 92 percent of the U.S. Hispanic population comprises 10 subgroups, with the top three being Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban (Motel and Patten, 2012). The national WIC caseload increased between 2006 and 2010 (see Figure 1-1), reaching a peak participation of approximately 9 million in 2010, and then declined to approximately 8 million participants by 2014 (USDA/ERS, 2015a). A 2014 evaluation by the USDA-Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) found that the largest decline in WIC participation since the program's inception occurred in fiscal year 2014, with 5 percent fewer eligible individuals participating in 2014 than in 2013 (USDA/ERS, 2015a). That declining trend has continued into 2015 (see Figure 1-2). The overall decline in WIC participation may be at least partially attributed to decreasing U.S. birthrates, as well as to the nation's improving economic health. In order to examine whether trends in WIC participation reflected changes in the population eligible for the program, analyses of the number of participants per eligible person, the number of participants and the number of persons eligible were carried out by the committee. Data were available through 2012, and as illustrated in Figure 1-3, changes in WIC participation through 2012 largely mirrored changes in eligibility. A number of factors in play since 2006 have likely influenced WIC participation.

Additionally, the 2015 DGAC reported strong evidence that the seafood industry has been rapidly expanding to meet demand and that, in contrast to past decades when fisheries collapsed because of overfishing, current fisheries are increasingly employing sustainable management strategies to avoid long-term collapse (USDA/HHS, 2015). There has also been growing interest in local and regional food systems. Another recent report prepared by the USDA/ERS (2015b) at the request of the House Agriculture Committee focused on trends in U.S. local and regional food systems. The report indicated that that producer participation in local food systems trended upward from 2007 to 2014, with both the value of farmers' markets and direct-to-consumer sales of food increasing. Since 2007, the number of farmers' markets has increased by nearly 200 percent, regional food hubs by nearly 300 percent, and school districts with farm-to-school programs by more than 450 percent (USDA/ERS, 2015b)."}, {"section_title": "Changes in the Dietary Patterns of Americans", "text": "For the U.S. population overall, after decades of increases, mean energy intake decreased significantly between and 2009(Ford and Dietz, 2013.

In this context, supplemental foods are those foods containing nutrients determined by nutritional research to be lacking in the diets of pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants, and children, and foods that promote the health of the population served by the WIC program as indicated by relevant nutrition science, public health concerns, and cultural eating patterns, as prescribed by the Secretary. \u00a7 17 4 ) The term supplemental is not quantified in a regulatory context, but the term implies provision of less than 100 percent of what is needed, with specific focus on provision of foods that address shortfall nutrients, including nutrients of public health concern. Given the WIC program objective to supplement participants' usual diets, it is useful to know the potential contribution of the WIC food packages to USDA-recommended food group intakes (USDA/HHS, 2015). Table 1-7 shows the proportion of each USDA major food group and subgroup supplied to an individual by a monthly food package if consumed in maximum amounts. Although Table 1-7 was created by applying a 1,300 kcal weighted food pattern for children equivalent to 1,225 kcal per day and 2,200 5 kcal per day for women using the 2015 DGAC report food patterns (USDA/HHS, 2015), the WIC food packages serve individuals with a wide range of energy needs. The data presented in the table are therefore only approximations of the proportion of food intake needs contributed by the WIC food package, assuming full redemption and consumption. As shown in the table, for children, WIC foods provide approximately 77, 36, 90, 55, and 60 percent of the recommended intakes for fruits, vegetables, dairy, grains, and protein, respectively. For pregnant and partially breastfeeding women, the food packages provide approximately 57, 19, 98, 25, and 47 percent of the recommended intakes for those same food groups. c-eq 0.9 77 1.2 1.1 57 0.9 47 1.1 2.0 Juice, 100% c Fruit (juice only) c-eq 0.5 107 0.5 0.6 91 0.4 61 0.6 0.

Although the 2015 DGAC report does not specify a juice recommendation for adults, in this table 33% of fruit intake is allotted to 100% juice, according to the DGAC's finding that 33% of fruit intake comes from fruit juice in the overall U.S. population (USDA/HHS, 2015). d To determine the maximum allowance, a composite of fruits purchased was developed using percent of total food group intake data (supporting Appendix E-2 of the DGAC, 2015 report; Personal communication, P. Britten, 2015). Fruits contributing to 5 percent or more of intake were included in their respective proportions and matched to 2014 price data. Only fresh fruit was included as all states allow fresh forms. Fifty percent of the cash value voucher (CVV) was assumed ($4 for children and $5.5 for women, respectively). e To determine the maximum allowance, a composite of vegetables was developed using the percent of total food group intake data (supporting Appendix E-2 of the 2015 DGAC report; Personal communication, P. Britten , 2015). Vegetables contributing to 5 percent or more of intake in each subgroup were included in their respective proportions and matched to 2014 price data. Only fresh vegetables were included as all states allow fresh forms. Fifty percent of the CVV was assumed ($4 for children and $5.5 for women, respectively). f Milk was selected to represent the maximum allowance for this WIC food category as it allows for the largest number of dairy servings per day. Substitutions may include soymilk, cheese, or tofu. In the USDA food patterns, tofu is categorized as a dietary contributor to the protein group. g For package VII, milk and cheese provided in WIC are added together to compare to the USDA dairy food group; 1.5 oz of natural cheese = 1 c-eq milk. h Whole wheat bread was selected to represent the maximum allowance for this WIC food category as it allows for the same number of grains servings per day as other possible substitutions. The Grains category here includes both whole wheat bread and breakfast cereals. Substitutions include brown rice, bulgur, oatmeal, barley, tortillas, or whole wheat pasta. i Note that in packages IV and VI, legumes or peanut butter can be selected. Total protein for these packages as presented in the table includes peanut butter and not legumes because peanut butter is more regularly purchased (USDA food package options report). In packages V and VII, both are provided; therefore, total protein includes legumes plus peanut butter. j Legumes were considered a protein substitution (in addition to a vegetable option) as it alternates with peanut butter, another protein source, in the food packages. If considered a contributor to vegetable intake, the contribution would be 21% and 10% of the DGAC recommendations for vegetable intake for children and women, respectively. k 0.5 ounces of peanut butter = 1 ounce-equivalent serving of nuts, seeds, and soy.

Based on an examination of nationally-representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, Jacknowitz and Tiehen (2007) examined WIC program exits and found that those participants who exited the program early reported that taking part required too much effort (25.7 percent) or they had scheduling or transportation problems (10 percent). Transportation has been cited in other studies as a barrier to participation (Gleason et al., 2014). Some studies have noted language spoken by WIC staff as a barrier to participation (e.g., Tiehen and Jacknowitz, 2008), but others note that some groups like Hispanics tend to enroll earlier in WIC than their non-Hispanic counterparts (e.g. Swann, 2007). The most extensive quantitative study on barriers to WIC participation was conducted in New York State (Woelfel et al., 2004). 1 In this study, a total of 3,167 parents and caretakers at 51 local agency sites completed a survey on barriers that was developed through qualitative and focus group work. Of the 68 potential barriers included in the survey, 11 were identified by over 20 percent of respondents. Waiting too long in the waiting room was the most frequently cited barrier (48 percent). Difficulties in bringing the infant or child to recertify and rescheduling appointments were key variables associated with failure to pick up WIC benefits. Features of the physical environment (crowded, with limited kid-friendly areas) were reported as reducing participant interest in coming to the WIC site. Duration of appointment wait time, customer service, and to a lesser extent facility environments, were identified by WIC participants as potential areas for improvement in a smaller study in Florida conducted by Christie et al. (2006). Barriers to participation in other national food assistance programs may have implications for WIC, although eligibility and certification requirements differ substantially between programs. Algert et al. (2006), for example, showed that lack of a permanent address, language barriers, changes in eligibility restrictions, and stigma were associated with lower rates of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Moreover, participants often perceived that the differing administrative requirements for food assistance programs were complicated (Gilbert et al., 2014). Also of note, participation patterns generally followed patterns of national economic health (USDA/ERS, 2013) with increasing participation during times of recession. In a study of food assistance programs not including WIC, Martin et al. (2006) described lack of comfort, difficulty with paperwork, and difficulty carrying food home as barriers to participation. Both Martin et al. (2006) and Jacknowitz and Tiehen (2007) found that believing one's family was ineligible was a reason for either not participating or exiting a program early."}, {"section_title": "Redemption Patterns and Barriers to Redemption", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Redemption of WIC Foods", "text": "Publicly available data on redemption of WIC foods have not yet been collected on a national level. Limited data are available at the state level on redemption after the implementation of the 2009 rule. The most comprehensive study of WIC food package redemption thus far was conducted by the Altarum Institute using electronic benefit transfer (EBT) data from three states: Kentucky, Michigan, and Nevada . The findings are summarized in Box 2-2. From January through March 2012, full redemption 2 of issued food packages ranged from 9.5 to 16.4 percent, partial redemption ranged from 75.6 to 84.4 percent, and nonredemption ranged from 4.1 to 8.0 percent. Differences in redemption were related to race and ethnicity, geography, household size, and the number of WIC family members. The likelihood of nonredemption did not differ greatly based on race or ethnicity in any of the three states and was lower for rural compared to urban residents only in Nevada. Odds of full redemption were significantly higher in households with an infant under 6 months of age. Based on focus group work, barriers to redemption included receiving too much of a food, dislike of a food, and lack of knowledge on how to prepare a food. Foods with the highest redemption rates included infant formula, fruits and vegetables, milk, and eggs . The final rule specified that, for individuals over 2 years of age, only skim or 1 percent milk could be issued, barring any qualifying medical conditions (USDA/FNS, 2014a). In a recent study, Rimkus et al. (2015) found that the availability of lowerfat milks was limited in certain communities. They surveyed 8,959 food stores in 468 communities where a nationally representative sample of students attending public schools resided and found that the odds of carrying lower-fat milks was up to 67 and 58 percent lower in majority black or Hispanic communities, respectively, than in white communities. Important to note is that data for this study were collected between 2010 and 2012, before the final rule eliminating milks of 2 percent fat or higher was implemented (in 2014). Despite the potentially limited availability of lower-fat milks, milk had one of the highest redemption rates of the WIC foods in 2012 . Foods with the lowest redemption rates included jarred baby meats, beans, peanut butter, infant cereal, jarred fruits and THE WIC  PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS vegetables, and whole grains .  found that redemption of infant food was low compared to other foods in a study of Wisconsin WIC participants. At 18 months after the implementation of the 2009 package changes, infant fruit and vegetable vouchers were redeemed at 50 percent and infant meat at 34 percent, compared to cheese, eggs, juice, and milk, which were redeemed at 91 to 97 percent post-implementation.  found that redemption rates of jarred infant foods declined with age in a study of WIC participants in California. In this study, participants indicated high satisfaction with jarred infant foods although 66 percent reported that they would prefer to have CVVs for fruits and vegetables for their 6-to11-month-old infants instead of the jarred foods if permitted. The 2014 final rule allows a $4 or $8 CVV for fruits and vegetables in place of a portion of jarred infant food (USDA/FNS, 2014a). A major change in the 2009 WIC food package was inclusion of the CVV for purchase of fruits and vegetables. As discussed in the committee's Letter Report, very little information is available in the published literature or from reports to describe the extent to which the CVV is redeemed or how WIC participants apportion the CVV across types and forms of fruits and vegetables . As noted in Chapter 3, for this report the committee investigated potential sources for data on foods redeemed by WIC participants. Although obtaining nationally representative data remains challenging, available state agency redemption data indicate that the 74 to 78 percent of the CVV was redeemed in Texas from January to March of (Texas Department of Health Services, 2015.

Prior to the food package revisions, a survey administered to parents and caretakers of WIC participants in New York State found that issues with food procurement (store policies, food availability) and the WIC food packages (adequacy, satisfaction with the items) were barriers to participation (Woefel et al., 2004). Since the 2009 food package change, factors identified that negatively affect the WIC shopping experience include food package policies (e.g., container size), grocery store experiences (e.g. cashier interactions), and personal misunderstanding and embarrassment. Positive factors include helpful vendors and both vendor and participant understanding about the use of the CVV (Najjar, 2013). With respect to the CVV, several small studies were carried out after implementation of the 2009 food package changes to evaluate the perception and use of the CVV by WIC participants. Bertmann et al. (2014) reported that CVVs were inconsistently redeemed in Arizona. They identified several barriers to redemption: participants' perception of annoyance or anger expressed by cashier or other shoppers; cashiers' lack of training; fluctuation in enforcement of WIC redemption rules from store to store and week to week; and feelings of embarrassment or judgment when using the CVV. The authors cautioned, however, that their findings might not be generalizable to other WIC populations. In a Wisconsin study of WIC participant CVV redemption patterns,  reported positive responses overall to the package changes, but with differences in non-use and maximum use of the CVV among some WIC subpopulations. Some participants described a level of discomfort with having to do math in the store, which the researchers hypothesized may be enough to deter use of the benefits. Other vendor-level challenges noted included difficulty maintaining fresh foods (particularly in smaller stores), anticipating client demand and having the correct package sizes available. The effect of allowing split tender for CVV purchases (using a different payment method for the amount over the CVV benefit) on redemption has yet to be comprehensively evaluated."}, {"section_title": "Maximizing Participation and Redemption", "text": "The committee searched for literature exploring strategies to increase both participation in WIC and redemption of WIC benefits.

In the Altarum study described previously,  examined the transition to the EBT system and found that in WIC, EBT is preferred by vendors and participants over paper vouchers. Most participants considered the use of EBT a positive shopping experience that improved use of the benefits and minimized waste because of its convenience and portability, allowance for benefit balance tracking, and ease of checkout. The researchers concluded that, although some technical challenges persist, EBT appears to have a promising positive effect on participant satisfaction and redemption.

Consumers often behave in ways (e.g., make decisions about foods) that contradict standard assumptions of economic theory (Just and Payne, 2009). Individuals often exhibit biases, a prime example being loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984), when making choices. Loss aversion refers to the tendency to treat losses differently than gains, that is, people will pay less for an object they do not already have compared to what they will accept to give that object up. People also exhibit a tendency to remain within the status quo, even if choosing an alternative action seems clearly better. The implication for WIC is that there may be ways to frame food package choices to influence participant decisions, for example to make the breastfeeding package the status quo or \"default\" choice, or alternatively, to make it clear that when one chooses the partial or non-breastfeeding package, the mother receives less food.There is evidence to suggest that when selecting new goods, individuals tend to focus on utilitarian characteristics (functional features of a good; an example for food is \"healthful\"), but when deciding what to give up, they focus instead on hedonic characteristics (experiential features of a good; an example for food is \"taste\") (Dhar and Wertenbroch, 2000;USDA/ERS, 2007). Thus, individuals might be willing to consider healthfulness when adding foods to their diet, but be less willing to give up a food that is perceived as tasting good. In the context of WIC, an example would be a greater willingness to add low-fat yogurt compared to giving up higher-fat milk. The USDA, Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) also reviewed research showing that specific cues (i.e., appearance, brand, name, price, and information) can influence product choices, which may be relevant for the labeling of food items (USDA/ERS, 2007). Cognitive overload can also affect choice. When there are too many options competing for one's attention, one is more likely to make decisions based on habits or rules of thumb than on logic. This might be relevant for WIC participants trying to find the least expensive brands, which can change frequently in states with least-expensive-brand rules. Labeling of products as \"WIC\" food items or prepackaging fruits and vegetables in even-dollar amounts reduces the time and difficulty in making decisions for program participants and may also reduce the vendor costs of handling WIC products at the check-out. In the context of WIC, making healthier choices easier to identify and select might increase purchase and consumption of these foods. In terms of how choices affect consumption, additional evidence cited in USDA-ERS (2007) indicates that when the salience of food is increased, people consume more of it, suggesting that increasing the salience (how much particular items stand out or are noticed) of better food choices might increase consumption. In the context of WIC, making better food choices in the food packages more salient through advertising might increase purchase and consumption of those foods. USDA-ERS (2007) also cited evidence showing that more variety can lead to more consumption. Based on evidence from SNAP literature, mental accounting, another type of bias whereby people make choices based on having allocated specific funds for specific purposes, might also have implications for WIC food packages (USDA/ERS, 2007). If participants think of their WIC vouchers as special, they might purchase and consume more WIC foods than they would otherwise (i.e., if they were making their food choices based on total income and treating the vouchers as cash). Finally, there is considerable evidence from the field of behavioral economics that the present time is valued more than future time and that individuals respond differently when asked what they would trade \"now\" for $10 provided in 2 weeks compared to what they would trade 1 month from now for $10 provided in 6 weeks (Loewenstein, 1988). 3 In the context of this decision being faced by a new WIC woman participant, the trade-off would be what the participant might receive now compared to the value of what would be received later. The choice now is the value of 806 fluid ounces of formula right away and less food in her package compared to the value of the breastfeeding package now (extra food in the package for the mother and nothing for the infant). The option (choice) later in the period of 6 to 12 months from now is the relatively lower value of the formula package but no benefits for the mother compared to the value of the breastfeeding package (maternal food and some additional food [meats] for the infant). The participant might be inclined to select the breastfeeding package at higher rates than if she had made the decision at some point before the baby was born, over both choices which occur in the future. Recommitment has been suggested as a strategy to address this tendency, or present bias. In the WIC program, periodic WIC office visits and breastfeeding peer counseling offer participants continuing opportunity for (re)commitment."}, {"section_title": "FACTORS AFFECTING ACCESS TO FOOD", "text": "The committee was tasked (during its phase II portion of the study) with ensuring that foods recommended in the food packages are available to WIC participants.

In the National Survey of WIC Participants II (NSWP-II) study conducted in 2009 (USDA/FNS, 2012), WIC participants redeemed their benefits primarily at large grocery stores and supermarkets (63 percent) or combination food store and retail outlets (22 percent).

At the time of delivery of this report, current data were not available on the employment status of WIC participants, and the most recent NSWP (NSWP II, published in 2012) did not include employment information. National Census Bureau data for 2013 indicate that 20.3 percent of working women (15.1 million women) were below 185 percent of poverty. Thirty-seven percent of these were working full-time (5.6 million), and 62 percent were working part-time (9.5 million) (USCB, 2014). The number of low-income working families in the United States rose from 10.2 million in 2010 to 10.4 million in 2011 (Roberts et al., 2013). In 2012, 39 percent of these families were headed by working mothers. Of all families, the share of low-income female-headed working families increased from 54 percent in 2007 to 58 percent in 2012 (Povich, 2014 working adults may have expenses for transportation to work that reduce money available for other transportation purposes, such as shopping for WIC foods. In addition to its effect on access to WIC foods, employment may also affect dietary patterns and the extent to which acquired or purchased WIC foods are actually consumed. Data from the American Time Use Survey (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011) indicates that full-time employment appears to be associated with significantly reduced time spent preparing food (Sliwa et al., 2015). Data from the same survey (2006)(2007)(2008) show that lower income and the presence of young children are both associated with significantly more time spent in food preparation (Senia et al., 2014). A smaller study of more than 2,000 mothers in Minnesota supports this finding, indicating that those with full-time employment spent less time on food preparation and consumed fewer fruits and vegetables compared to mothers with part-time or no employment (Bauer et al. 2012). Working mothers may also experience additional time stress that can affect preparation of healthy meals at home (Beshara et al., 2010;Jabs and Devine, 2006).

In a study of Illinois WIC vendors, Zenk et al. (2012) compared the availability of five fruit and vegetable types before versus after the 2009 food package changes. Overall, changes were positive for most vendor types and were statistically significant for several categories of fruits and vegetables (see Appendix G, Table G-2). Similarly, after comparing the availability of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains pre-and post-2009 in 252 stores and convenience stores in Connecticut, Andreyeva et al. (2011) concluded, \"When facing new government regulations to stock certain healthy foods, Connecticut convenience and grocery stores found ways to deliver healthy foods that were previously lacking in their stores and communities.\" Some carryover to stores that did not participate in WIC was also noted, possibly attributable to changes in the food supply chain. The greatest impact was observed in low-income communities. Havens et al. (2012) likewise reported that the 2009 WIC food package revisions increased availability of healthy foods (defined as fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains, and lower-fat milk) among WIC-certif\u0131ed vendors compared to those without WIC authorization in Hartford, Connecticut. Improvement in the \"healthy food supply score\" varied from 16 percent in WIC convenience and grocery stores in higher-income neighborhoods to 39 percent in lower-income areas. 4 Most of the increases were attributed to increased availability and variety of whole grain products (Andreyeva et al., 2012).  O'Malley et al. (2015) also reported changes between 2009 and 2010 in both medium and small WIC stores and increased availability of cereals and grains, juices and fruit, and jarred infant fruits and vegetables. Rose et al. (2014) also reported the 2009 WIC food package changes improved the availability of these foods in small stores in New Orleans. A recent systematic review confirmed overall improved availability of WIC foods at WIC-authorized vendors in the four studies identified (Schultz et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Relationship of Food Availability to Food Choice", "text": "Changes in WIC package food availability may translate into healthier food choices. For example, Black et al. (2009) reported that participants viewed whole wheat bread as healthier and a majority indicated that they and their children would increase consumption if it were provided by WIC. In California, 94.6 percent of WIC participants reported they would use their WIC benefits to purchase whole grain bread (California WIC, 2007). Once made available, national EBT data reflecting redemption of WIC foods will provide an indication as to whether WIC participants actually do purchase whole grain options. Likewise, data on grain intake before and after the 2009 food package changes that will be presented in the phase II report may provide an indication of the degree to which the food packages may have affected intake of healthier options."}, {"section_title": "ADMINISTRATION OF THE WIC FOOD PACKAGES", "text": "At the request of the USDA, Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS), changes to the WIC food packages must not unduly add to the burden of the numerous state and local agencies responsible for WIC program administration. Nor should they unduly add to WIC vendor burden, given that ease of WIC program administration is closely linked to the ability of WICauthorized vendors to provide WIC foods (see Figure 2-1). This section summarizes the multileveled complexity of challenges to administering WIC food packages. The complexity of the challenges with administering the WIC food package is perhaps best illustrated with an example. The 2006 IOM report recommended the inclusion of 1 to 2 pounds of whole wheat or whole grain bread in the food packages for women and children and specified that other whole grain foods, including brown rice, bulgur, oatmeal, barley, and soft corn or whole wheat tortillas, could substitute for whole wheat bread on an equal weight basis. The 1-pound size was recommended by the IOM committee as a way to provide a specific number of additional whole grain servings to better align the food package with the 2005 DGA. This size was available in the market, but not widely available at the time. The IOM committee did not fully recognize the consequences of this recommendation. USDA implemented the whole grain recommendation in interim and final rules , requiring states to offer whole grain bread in a 1-pound loaf and permitting states the option to authorize an equivalent amount of any of the other whole grain options identified in the IOM report. As of 2015, all state agencies reported allowing at least one alternative to whole-grain bread, and more than 90 percent offered at least two alternatives (USDA/FNS, 2015b). The diversity of whole grain options available from state to state reflects the different choices made at the state level. Although a 1-pound sized loaf of whole grain bread was not widely available in the marketplace when the interim rule was released in 2007, prior to the 2009 implementation of the rule, food manufacturers were able to begin production and distribution of a 1-pound loaf of whole grain bread and meet the demand for the new size (USDA/FNS, 2015a). However, doing so required substantial changes to production. At the vendor level, the rule required changes to purchasing and distributing whole grain bread, as well as the dedication of shelf space and clear labeling of the 1-pound loaf for WIC participants. Similarly, 1-pound packages of soft corn and whole wheat tortillas were not commonly available in 2007, and manufacturers and vendors began producing and distributing tortillas in a 1-pound package size. At the local agency and participant level, WIC education focused on the new whole grain option in the food package and specified clearly the package size and type of bread (100 percent whole wheat) that was authorized. Additional education was provided in those states allowing substitutions. Finally, the WIC participant had to find the 1-pound loaf of bread at the store, which was initially challenging as supply was not immediately abundant in 2009. The fact remains that commercially packaged WIC bread is smaller than all other bread and is often difficult to locate in the store."}, {"section_title": "State-Level Challenges", "text": "Administrative Challenges: Package Sizing and the CVV A key benefit of the 2009 food package changes was the ability for states to tailor the package where state options were allowed . Although this led to some inconsistencies in specific foods available from state to state, it enabled state administrators to make decisions that maximize the suitability of the foods to their regional population and also contain costs. For example, the final rule allowed children ages 12 to 24 months to receive fatreduced milks if overweight or obesity was a concern (USDA/FNS, 2014a). Seventy-two percent of WIC state agencies adopted this option as of 2015, covering 60 percent of WIC participants (USDA/FNS, 2015b). Thirty percent of WIC state agencies, covering 41 percent of WIC participants, allowed organic forms of some WIC-eligible foods. WIC state agencies have the option to allow organic options for all foods except fruits and vegetables covered under the CVV, for which state agencies must allow organic purchases. Thirty-nine percent of WIC state agencies, covering 15 percent of WIC participants, allow infants to receive a $4 CVV and 64 ounces of jarred infant fruits and vegetables instead of 128 ounces of jarred fruits and vegetables. Eighty-five percent of state agencies provide package tailoring for homeless participants, making this option available to 87.8 percent of WIC participants nationwide (USDA/FNS, 2015b). Tables 2-3 and 2-4 provide data on forms of milk, cheese, peanut butter, beans and peas, whole grains, canned fish, and fruits and vegetables allowed by WIC state agencies, further illustrating the variability in WIC-approved food lists among states. Although the 2009 changes were well received, two notable administrative challenges were package sizing and the new CVV. The package size challenges around whole grain bread were illustrated above. As another example, to meet the maximum allowance of milk specified in the interim rule, states had to authorize the purchase of a quart size in addition to gallons and half gallons. The quart size of milk is not only less available across both large and small vendors, but often more expensive. The final rule now allows states to substitute yogurt for one quart of milk and cheese for three quarts of milk (USDA/FNS, 2014a), reducing but not eliminating the need to authorize the quart container. Furthermore, manufacturers changed some package sizes between the time of the interim and final rules, with many peanut butters available in the marketplace changing from 18 to 16 ounces and some juices from 64 to 59 ounces, requiring states to modify their WIC-approved food lists in these categories (with permission from USDA). Addition of the CVV marked the first time the WIC food package included a food item with a specified dollar value, meaning states had to decide if participants would be able to use their own funds or SNAP benefits to pay the difference. States were required to offer fresh fruits and vegetables with the CVV and were given the option to include dehydrated, frozen, and canned varieties (with no added sugars, fats, or oils). Implementation required extensive education for participants and vendors alike. Now that implementation is complete nationwide and all states have systems that allow split tender, further use of the CVV is not anticipated to present significant challenges. However, a hypothetical requirement that all states include canned fruit and vegetables has the potential to be challenging for some states, primarily due to the very large number of canned options that would have to be authorized. The October 2015 change to the mother's CVV from $10 to $11 is unlikely to pose an administrative burden, with the exception of Food Package VII for women who are exclusively breastfeeding twins. 5 These women are prescribed 1.5 times the maximum allowance, which will result in a CVV benefit of $16.50; some state systems do not allow programming of cents and will therefore be required to average the benefit over a 2-month period until their systems can be modified to accommodate cents. Finally, the final rule's allowance for states to substitute a CVV for fruits and vegetables in lieu of a portion of infant food for the 9-11-month-old infant (USDA/FNS, 2014a) is slow to be implemented. Although some states are moving toward implementation of this option, other states cannot implement it because of the requirement that the substitution be only fresh fruits and vegetables. Limiting the infant CVV to only fresh fruit and vegetables creates a significant burden for participants and local agencies in states whose EBT systems do not readily accommodate the issuance of a fresh-only fruit and vegetable voucher (Personal communication, public comment submitted by Texas WIC, July 30, 2015).  6.9 NOTE: Data are from the WIC Food Package Policy Options II study (USDA/FNS, 2015b); responses for the study were received from 86 of 90 state agencies, covering 99.98% of WIC participants. a The final rule established 1% and nonfat milk as standard issuance for women and children age 2 and older (a change from the interim rule, which also included 2% milk as standard issuance). The final rule authorizes 2% milk, soy-based beverages, and tofu as substitutions for 1% and nonfat milk based on nutrition assessment and consultation with a healthcare provider if necessary. The final rule also permitted yogurt as a milk alternative for women and children. However, since this option was not implemented until after data collection for the study from which this table was derived was completed, data on number of state agencies authorizing yogurt are not documented here. b The final rule permits any type of mature dry beans, peas, or lentils in dry or canned forms. All WIC state agencies authorize some form of dry beans and peas; 81% of state agencies authorize all varieties of dry beans and peas. c WIC state agencies are required to offer whole wheat or whole-grain bread. They also have the option to offer whole-grain alternatives. "}, {"section_title": "State Management Information Systems and Electronic Benefit Transfer Systems", "text": "Some state-level administrative challenges arise from the specifications and limitations of management information systems (MIS) and EBT systems being implemented. Although some states have linked their MIS changes with the adoption of EBT systems, others have elected to update their MIS systems and adopt EBT in separate steps. There is not a single MIS or EBT system that has been adopted nationwide. While some states are developing their own systems, other states and ITOs have grouped together to share a common MIS platform (e.g. the Mountain Plains States Consortium) (USDA/FNS, 2013a). The diversity in MIS and EBT systems offers states unique abilities to tailor their systems to meet local needs. However, all systems are required by USDA-FNS to ensure consistent MIS standards and meet basic program administration and reporting requirements (USDA/FNS, 2013b). All states are required to adopt EBT technology by 2020, and as of this writing, 12 states and four ITOs have completed the transition to EBT. Although there are many benefits to EBT, including improved tracking of issued and redeemed benefits, the challenges to state agencies in the planning and implementation of EBT are not trivial. The EBT system is developed to limit purchases to only those foods authorized by the program, and the linked databases that code \"WIC-approved\" foods must be updated continually in response to changes in the marketplace. USDA-FNS is in the process of developing a nationally representative Universal Product Code (UPC) database in collaboration with states, which should help to alleviate some of this burden. The effort is anticipated to improve efficiency across the WIC program. WIC benefits are grouped by EBT systems at the household rather than individual level, allowing more flexibility in food acquisition when more than one family member is a WIC participant. However, having more than one family member receiving benefits makes determining individual redemption rates more difficult. The early adopters of EBT systems have worked out a number of these challenges, paving the way for all states to move toward EBT by 2020. Two methods of WIC EBT are currently in use: (1) offline EBT in which the food benefit data is placed on a \"smart card\" (a plastic card with an embedded computer chip), and (2) online EBT in which access to the food benefit data occurs through real-time communication between the WIC vendor and the entity maintaining the EBT prescription information. The decision about which method to employ is based on a variety of factors, including each state agency's unique regulations and information systems capacity, technology costs and benefits, and the impact on WIC vendors and participants."}, {"section_title": "Cost-Containment", "text": "All states must balance diversity and availability of WIC foods with cost, and costcontainment strategies are often viewed as limiting consumers' choice. One of the WIC program's primary cost-containment practices is negotiating rebate contracts with manufacturers of infant formula. These rebates have contributed to significant savings and enabled WIC to serve a larger number of participants, but at the same time these rebates may limit the ability of the WIC program to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding (see Chapter 7). Additional cost-containment practices include limiting authorized vendors to stores with lower food prices and limiting approved brands, package sizes, forms, or prices (e.g., least expensive brand requirements)."}, {"section_title": "Local Agency Challenges", "text": "At the local agency and participant level, education plays a role in the successful implementation of the WIC food package. Although local agency staff members typically do not have authority to make decisions about the foods that will be authorized, they are instrumental in providing participant-centered one-on-one and group education and nutrition counseling. This education and counseling is designed to both maximize participant understanding of what can be purchased with their WIC benefit and how to organize purchases at the vendor (e.g., separate their WIC foods from other foods they are purchasing), as well as how to provide and prepare WIC foods for the family in alignment with the DGA. The introduction of new foods in the food package is facilitated at the local agency level by staff training and participant education prior to the changes. As an example, for the 2009 food package change, the California WIC program started a statewide campaign for staff training nine months prior to the October 1 changes. Statewide participant education began 6 months prior to the changes. Together, these efforts eased the transition to the new food packages, which took effect all at one time (Ritchie et al., 2010;. With release of the final rule in 2014, additional changes to the food packages have been implemented incrementally which may have been more challenging. For example, all states were required to offer only skim and 1 percent milk to all women and children ages 2 and older by September 29, 2014 (most states allowed 2 percent milk prior to this date), and all states were allowed to offer yogurt, but few were able to implement both changes at the same time because of the approval processes required to add yogurt."}, {"section_title": "Vendor Challenges", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ensuring the Availability of WIC-Approved Foods", "text": "To become an authorized WIC vendor, individual stores must meet certain criteria established by the state agency, which may include minimum stocking requirements, geographic need, and history of compliance.

They increased both sales and profitability for the items offered in the revised food package (Andreyeva et al., 2011) and sales of newly eligible food items to non-WIC customers (Gittelsohn et al., 2012). Increased demand, without a compensating change in supply, is frequently associated with an increase in price. Some vendors reported difficulty finding and maintaining suppliers for some foods. However, available evidence finds that prices did not increase for those items, suggesting that vendors adjusted their supply quantities without incurring increased costs (Zenk et al., 2014). The revised food packages were designed to be cost neutral to WIC (not more than 10 percent above or below the current level of funding), and while sales apparently increased from WIC foods for some items (reduced-fat milk, whole grains, fruit and vegetables), sales likely decreased for others (whole milk, juice) (Andreyeva, 2013a(Andreyeva, ,b, 2014."}, {"section_title": "The Electronic Benefit Transfer System", "text": "The Altarum study described earlier in this chapter  reported that EBT implementation both improved the ability of vendors to track inventory and stabilized inventory because participants were able to make purchases throughout the month instead of during a single visit.

Indeed, retailers often charge fees to suppliers for shelf space (\"slotting allowances\") (FTC, 2003). Demand for foods in the WIC package affects how retail vendors allocate their shelf space. When WIC agencies require participants to purchase an item in a size or style that is different from the size or style that is predominantly purchased by non-WIC customers, retail vendors have been challenged to offer that item (see, e.g., Gittelsohn 2012). Saitone et al. (USDA/ERS, 2014) found that smaller vendors, because of their typically higher operating and procurement costs, are more likely to charge higher prices for WIC products than larger vendors do. They also found, however, that small vendors comprise only a small percentage of total WIC redemptions. In a study in Texas, fruits and milk (two key WIC foods) were both significantly more expensive (approximately 27 cents more) per pound in rural than urban areas (Tisone et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "The Case of \"WIC-Only\" Vendors", "text": "As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the majority (52 percent) of WIC households report using supercenter-type stores as their primary food shopping store (USDA/ERS, 2015a) (see Table 2-2). Research also suggests that low-income households in general are more likely to economize in their food shopping practices by purchasing more private-label products and buying in larger volumes (Leibtag and Kaufman, 2003). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new store type evolved that catered to WIC households. These \"WIC-only\" stores offered only WICapproved foods and were usually located in the vicinity of WIC offices. Because these stores catered only to WIC participants, they were unconcerned about sales to non-WIC participants. Studies at the time showed that prices for some items at WIC-only stores were 13 percent to 16 percent higher than similar items at other stores (Neuberger and Greenstein, 2004). Since then, USDA has implemented procedures to limit the ability of WIC-only stores to price WIC items higher than retailers that sell both WIC and non-WIC foods. 6 There are few peer-reviewed papers that examine pricing at WIC-only stores, but McLaughlin et al. (2013) showed in a conference paper that WIC-only stores have an incentive to set prices at the maximum level allowed by USDA regulations. Saitone et al. (USDA/ERS, 2014) found that A-50 vendors (WIConly stores fall in this category of vendor) in California redeemed food packages at the maximum allowable level 81 to 94 percent of the time. The \"WIC-only\" experience highlights the importance of competitive pricing to contain costs to the WIC program. The pressure on retail food stores to keep prices low to attract sales from non-WIC customers is a powerful incentive that keeps prices low for WIC items (Neuberger and Greenstein, 2004). If that pressure is missing, then prices are likely to rise."}, {"section_title": "Manufacturer Challenges", "text": "Like WIC vendors, manufacturers of WIC foods play a central role in the WIC participant experience (see Figure 2-1).

As mentioned previously, manufacturers were able to begin production and distribution of the 1-pound loaf of bread before 2009 implementation of interim rule (USDA/ERS, 2015b), but doing so required substantial changes to production. Even though a 1pound loaf provides fewer servings than the more common 24-ounce loaf of bread, it is usually sold at the same or a higher price. As per the 2014 final rule, whole wheat pasta is at a 1-pound size is permitted as a substitute for whole wheat bread. However, 87 percent of whole wheat pasta is sold in 12 and 13.5 ounce sizes.

Only limited experimental options are available (e.g. random assignment of a WIC service area to delayed start of a new benefit) because random assignment of individuals to receive or not receive WIC benefits is not considered ethical. In the 1980s, David Rush and his colleagues used studies of several different designs (e.g. historical, longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional), each with different weaknesses, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the WIC program (Rush et al., 1988a,b,c,d). Such a large and comprehensive study has not been repeated. As a result, nearly all studies reviewed for this report compare WIC participants to a group of nonparticipants or use a pre-post design (relative to a change in the food package). These study designs are not sufficient for causal inference.  used nonparametric partial identification methods to jointly account for selection and measurement problems and evaluate the causal impacts of WIC on food insecurity in children, using NHANES data. Their methods offer an alternative approach and bound the average treatment effects of WIC on observed outcomes. A challenge to analyzing WIC-specific data is a phenomenon known as selection bias, which occurs when individuals who choose to participate in a program are different from eligible individuals who choose not to participate. These differences can be either observable or unobservable. With many social assistance programs, participants are likely to be negatively selected, that is, less well off, for example with less education or less wage income (compared to nonparticipants). This leads to results that make it appear that the program is not as effective as it really is. Conversely, participants may be positively selected for unobserved or unobservable characteristics, such as motivation or the eagerness to keep their children healthy (Besharov and Germanis, 2001). This leads to results that are biased upward that make it appear that a program, such as WIC, has more positive effects than it really does. For WIC specifically, positively biased effects could also result from longer-lasting pregnancies, with longer pregnancies increasing the chances that WIC-eligible women will enter the program, and also giving them a longer time period over which to benefit from the program. 3 Using 1992-1999 data from the Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, Bitler and Currie (2005) conducted a survey of mothers at 6 months postpartum and found that WIC participating women were negatively selected for several observable characteristics compared to WIC-eligible, nonparticipating women whose birth was paid for by Medicaid. Specifically, they found that WIC participants were less educated, less likely to be married, more likely to be of minority race, more likely to be teen mothers, less likely to report the father's information on the birth certificate, more likely to be obese, more likely to use public assistance and less likely to have wage income in the past year, and more likely to have had a previous low birth weight or premature infant if not a first-time mother. More recently, in a study of birth records from New York City, Currie and Rajani (2015) examined women who were pregnant more than once but who chose to participate in WIC only for one birth. They found that WIC pregnancies were more likely when women were younger, unemployed, unmarried, or had experienced a bad previous birth outcome. When there is negative selection on observable factors, as shown in these two studies, it seems likely that there is also negative selection on at least some unobservable factors (e.g., the woman's propensity to have negative birth outcomes outside of any conditions that can be measured by the researcher) as well. There is little reason to expect that there is solely an upward bias in the reported program effects because of the likely cumulative effect of negative selection on these factors (Altoni et al., 2005(Altoni et al., , 2008. Evaluation of WIC participant outcomes before and after the 2009 adoption of the new food package is complicated by the fact that adoption of the new package took place at the tail end of a recession and at a time when families were facing the worst labor market since the deep recession of the early 1980s. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the funds necessary to increase the maximum benefit level of SNAP of about 15 percent (EOPUS, 2014). Inasmuch as SNAP recipients are automatically eligible for WIC, many WIC participants also receive SNAP benefits. Among those who were receiving both benefits, food expenditures and consumption may have changed because SNAP increased the maximum benefit level."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Relevant Reports", "text": "In addition to the literature search described above, relevant IOM reports and government reports related to the task, also published since 2005, were identified and evaluated.

The EER for pregnant and breastfeeding women also includes energy needs associated with the deposition of tissue or the secretion of milk. This committee used these equations. For pregnant women, the second trimester of pregnancy was assumed to cover all stages of pregnancy because a woman's specific stage of pregnancy at the time her intake was assessed is not recorded in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). For breastfeeding women, the EER assumed the first 6 months postpartum.

For this report, PC Software for Intake Distribution (PC-SIDE) was used to implement the ISU method (nutrients). To estimate the distribution of dietary components consumed episodically (food groups and subgroups), the Statistical Program for Age-adjusted Dietary Assessment (SPADE), a method similar to the National Cancer Institute method was implemented (Dekkers et al., 2014). These software packages are specifically designed for estimating the usual intake distributions of populations, and are not appropriate for application to individuals (IOM, 2000b)."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Prevalence of Inadequate Nutrient Intake with EARs", "text": "In all of the statistical analyses, intake data were weighted to population values by using survey weights associated with survey participants. Fractional jackknife replicate weights (Fuller, 2009) were used to estimate standard errors of estimated percentiles. Usual nutrient intake distributions were estimated using methods that account for the statistical properties of the data (intra-individual variation and reported data that are not normally distributed [Nusser et al., 1996;IOM, 2000b]). Beaton (1994) and Carriquiry (1999) suggested that the prevalence of inadequate intakes in the group can be estimated by the proportion of persons in the group whose usual intakes do not reach the EAR for the nutrient. This approach is known as the EAR cutpoint method. A difficulty arises when one wishes to estimate prevalence of inadequacy in a group that includes persons from groups that have different EARs. If the sample size is too small to carry out separate analyses for each group, it is possible to proceed as proposed by IOM (2000b). This approach for estimating prevalence of inadequacy when combining population subgroups with different EARs consists of rescaling daily intakes for one of the population subgroups so they can be compared to the EAR of the other group (a similar re-scaling was used in . This approach was applied to two of the population subgroups of interest in this work: children aged 2 to less than 5 years, and women aged 19 to 50 years of age. Neither of these two groups aligns with the DRI gender and age groups; this is particularly true for women. As a result of low sample sizes, pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum (not breastfeeding) women were grouped into single analytic samples by WIC participation and income status. The resulting prevalences of inadequacy must be interpreted carefully when the EARs for the groups that are being combined are very different. For example, the EAR for iron for pregnant women is APPROACH TO THE TASK 3-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS approximately three-fold that for lactating (breastfeeding) women 19 to 30 years of age. 4 Thus, the overall prevalence of iron inadequacy for the combined group may conceal a relatively high prevalence among pregnant women and a much lower prevalence among lactating women. For iron specifically, another caveat is that requirements are not normally distributed for women, mostly because of menstrual losses of iron. As a result, the EAR cut-point method cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of inadequacy of iron. Inasmuch as most of the women in the analytical sample were either pregnant or breastfeeding and the sample size was small, the EAR cut-point method was nonetheless implemented. These limitations were considered when interpreting the data. In addition to analyzing nutrients in reference to EARs, means and usual intake distributions were also determined for nutrients with AIs . Interpretation of intake differs for nutrients with AIs in that only limited inferences can be made about the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy. If a mean intake level is equal to or exceeds the AI, it is likely that the prevalence of inadequacy is low, but no conclusion can be drawn about the prevalence of inadequacy for a mean intake level that falls below the AI (IOM, 2000b). For this reason, in this report the prevalence of inadequacy was not evaluated for nutrients with AIs. Note that only AIs are available for infants 0 to less than 6 months of age, therefore the prevalence of inadequacy of any nutrient could not be calculated for this age group."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Prevalence of Excessive Intakes", "text": "Excessive intakes of micronutrients were assessed by comparing observed nutrient intake to the UL for that nutrient, as described in .

By and large, the published NHANES databases have few missing values, in particular for nutrient intake. The population survey weights were applied to all analyses, generating estimated intake values representative of the U.S. population, including by income categories.

Oversampling of some NHANES population subsets has been discontinued (CDC, 2014), which was a concern for several of the WIC subgroups of interest because small subgroup sizes may result in statistically unreliable population-level estimates. 11 The committee's initial goal was to analyze WIC participants 12 and WIC-eligible nonparticipants in subgroups of infants (formula or breastfed), children (1 to less than 2 and 2 to less than 5 years of 9 NHANES respondents are assigned weights specific to the 2-year datasets. Separation of a two-year dataset requires re-computation of population weights, which was beyond the scope of this study. It also required knowledge of the location of the participant and the dates of the interviews. Both of these variables are unpublished to preserve privacy of participants. 10 In addition to the difficulties with separation of the 2009-2010 NHANES dataset noted in footnote 7, this period spanned the change in food packages. It was therefore not considered appropriate for either the pre-or postfood package change assessments. 11 The committee determined that a mean usual intake can be calculated within 3 percent of the true value (95 percent confidence interval) with a minimum of 17 individuals, for most nutrients. This minimum is not adequate for accurate calculation of population-level intake adequacy. 12 Capturing WIC participation is dependent upon accurate reporting in NHANES. The committee's comparison of the weighted total number of recipients reporting WIC as well as extensive experience with reporting of program like WIC suggest that WIC use is underreported. There is also a challenge in identifying the low-income group as eligible: The concept of income reported in NHANES does not correspond to state-level income requirements for eligibility. Some individuals may be income ineligible but may still legitimately participate in the program if adjunctively or automatically eligible due to participate in Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). age), and women (19 to 50 years of age, eligible being pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum). These subgroups allow for comparison of nutrient and food intake of all individuals who participate in WIC compared to individuals who qualify but do not participate in the program. Inspection of the data in the survey years of interest (2005 through 2012) indicated that modification of these initially outlined population subgroups was required. Table 3-2 details the limitations of NHANES for developing these initially designed population subsets and the modifications made to accommodate the limitations. Following careful consideration of these limitations, the committee designed the final population subgroups that would be analyzed for this report (see Table 3-3). Subgroups identified as low-income include all individuals with income \u2264 185 percent of the povertyincome ratio (PIR) (based on PIR guidelines in HHS, . The WIC subgroups include only individuals reported as being on WIC in the NHANES survey (these individuals may or may not have a PIR of \u2264 185 percent). There are two reasons for inclusion of any income level in the WIC group: (1) income could change within the certification period, but the individual remains in the program at the new income level, and (2) the objective is primarily to evaluate the effect of the food package, not the effect of income. WIC-eligible nonparticipating individuals were identified in the survey by not reporting being on WIC, but with a PIR of \u2264 185 percent and for women, having a qualifying physiological state (e.g. pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum)."}, {"section_title": "Adjustment for Small Sample Sizes", "text": "As indicated in Table 3-2 some of the sample sizes were small. The committee determined that means for subgroups other than women were adequately precise, despite sample sizes as small as 19. For example, to estimate mean usual intake of calcium for infants ages 0 to less than 6 months, a minimum sample size of 17 infants is required to obtain an estimate that is no more than 20 mg below or above the true mean with 95 percent certainty. For zinc, a minimum of seven infants is required to estimate the mean usual intake within 0.2 mg of the true value. This is because the estimated variance of usual intake tends to be small, in particular for infants. For quantities (i.e. \"% Inadequacy\") other than means, the required sample sizes are significantly larger. For women, some samples remained small and the variance large despite combining all pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum individuals into one group. To generate more robust nutrient intake estimates of the ratio of the within to the between person variance in intake, the method of Jahns et al. (2005) was applied. In this method, the variance ratio estimated from the subgroup intake data is combined with a ratio estimate obtained from the group of all women. To do this, an estimate of within-person variance (external variance) is generated using PC-SIDE to assess intake information of all low-income, pregnant, lactating, or postpartum women in all survey years. An internal ratio estimate is obtained separately for each sub-group. A new within to between-person variance ratio, is then computed as a weighted average of the external and internal variance ratio estimates. On average, the external variance was weighted by 100, and the internal variance was weighted by the number of women in the subgroup who provided 2 days of information. When this number is small (as in the case of pregnant or lactating women in 2011-2012), the external variance plays a larger role in the combined estimate. The resulting estimates are less subject to the large degree of variability in the within-person variance estimate that can be introduced by a small sample size. Both means and the \"% Inadequacy\" have improved reliability. For the analysis of episodically consumed foods, small samples add enormous challenges. Neither the NCI method nor SPADE (used here) results in reliable estimates of distributions of usual food intake when the sample size is small and the proportion of zero consumption is large. In many cases, the programs fail to converge, and no estimation beyond the usual intake mean is possible. Further, neither of the two approaches (NCI or SPADE) permit combining an external and an internal within-person variance estimate when estimating the intake distribution, so the approach followed for nutrients (described above) cannot be implemented for foods. Consequently, with the small sample sizes that were available for women, and the large proportion of zero intakes observed for many of the food sub-groups, estimates of the proportion of usual intakes of foods below recommendations are less reliable. Estimates of mean food intake are, however, adequately precise and only these are presented for women (Dekkers et al., 2014). a NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) includes a Food Security Survey Module that contains an identifier for individuals currently receiving WIC benefits and those who received WIC benefits in the last 12 months. This identifier can be used to identify subgroups of individuals receiving WIC with WIC-eligible women not receiving WIC benefits and also with lowincome women who are not currently pregnant, lactating, or postpartum (i.e., eligible for WIC). b The typical age distribution for WIC participation is 18-34 years (USDA/FNS, 2013a).

The three tasks and the evaluation approach are outlined in Table 3-4. "}, {"section_title": "Assessing Diet Quality", "text": "The committee was tasked with evaluating the diet quality of WIC-eligible subpopulations using the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010 ; see Box 3-2]) and one additional index of the committee's choosing. A second index was developed, as detailed in the Letter Report (IOM, 2015): Options for a second index were considered by the committee, based on its evaluation of the literature on existing diet quality indexes other than the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and with consideration to three criteria: (1) the index can be applied to adults and children, (2) 24-hour recall data are applied, and (3) the index is based on a metric other than comparison to the DGA. After reviewing potential indexes, the committee determined that responding to the task would require an index that focuses mainly on nutrient content to provide a contrast to the food-group focus of the HEI-2010. However, the committee found that existing nutrientbased indexes could not be applied directly for two reasons. First, they could not be applied because they use Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet as reference standards for nutrient intake rather than age-appropriate DRI values. Second, they do not necessarily include all of the nutrients and dietary components the committee was interested in assessing, based on current knowledge about nutrients of concern in the diets of young children and women of childbearing age (the 2010 DGA) and the committee's assessment of the nutrient intakes of Briefly, the committee developed a Nutrient-Based Diet Quality (NBDQ) index based on the mean probability of adequacy for the 9 shortfall nutrients, calculated for each individual (see Box 3-2). 13 The possible scores range from 0 to 100. This approach is very similar to that recently published by Verger et al. 2012, except that the NBDQ includes only shortfall nutrients as defined by the 2015 DGAC. When tracked with energy intake, the association between the NBDQ index and energy intake was not strong, which suggests that the index is a summary measure that predicts dietary quality beyond simply being a measure of overall energy intakes (see Appendix K, Figures K-1 through K-3). Further details of the committee's development of NBDQ are described in Appendix K. The NBDQ was applied to all subpopulations excluding infants. Because it is based on the DGA food patterns, which apply only to individuals ages 2 and older, the HEI was likewise applied only to individuals ages 2 year and older (see Appendix K, Table K-1). The NBDQ was applied to individuals aged 1 year and older because nutrient adequacy can be defined for these individuals based on the EARs or AIs. 13 There are ample precedents for the use of a composite nutrient adequacy index. Mean adequacy ratios have been used for many years and have more recently been updated to reflect the DRIs. The NDBQ is essentially the same as the indexes used in several published studies (Foote et al., 2004;Murphy et al., 2006 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Comparisons in NHANES Analyses", "text": "For this report, the only statistical testing of hypotheses conducted by the committee were for a difference between means of WIC participants and eligible non-WIC participant subgroups. Participants in the 2011-2012 NHANES were not included in statistical comparisons because individual samples in these years represented a different time period and the available data combined both WIC participants and eligible non-participants. As a result, data from 2011-2012 did not provide an appropriate comparison group. In all cases, pairwise t-tests were applied with estimated standard errors that account for the complex design of the NHANES surveys. Tests were implemented for differences in means of the usual intake distributions of nutrients and foods, for the prevalence of inadequate intakes, and for overall mean HEI scores. The NBDQ Index, constructed as a combination of estimated percent of adequacy of nutrients with and without an EAR was not included in the statistical comparisons because an estimate of the standard error of the mean index requires approximations that are justified only in large samples. Because of the lack of reliability of reported energy intake values (Subar et al., 2015), statistical comparisons were likewise not applied to this measure. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Accurately representing baseline package composition is fundamental to subsequent (phase II) assessment of changes in nutrient intake, food intake, and cost. The methods used to construct baseline food packages and evaluate their costs are summarized here. The approach used here parallels that applied in the 2006 WIC report , but it will use updated food options and selection (redemption) data."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Food Package Composition and Nutrient Profiles", "text": "Each of the food packages prescribed by WIC (see Appendix D, Tables D-1 and D-2) includes specific food categories (e.g., milk or breakfast cereals) with specifications for foods allowed under each category (i.e. skim or 1 percent milk, breakfast cereals with \u2264 6 g sugar per serving). The set of prescribed food categories constitutes the \"package\" under the revised 2009 food packages. For some food packages, only one choice of food is offered (i.e. whole milk as the \"Milk\" for children 1 to 2 years of age). However, for other food packages or ages, multiple choices are available within one food category (for example, either skim milk or 1 percent milk could be chosen within the category of \"Milk\" for women). To create a baseline \"Milk\" category from which to evaluate dietary intake and cost changes, the committee will develop a composite of the available options. For example, the committee considered milk choices based on the regulations defining allowed substitutions and rates of substitutions, USDA/FNS studies of state allowed substitutions (USDA/FNS, 2011) and state data on redemptions (which were available from some of the states that are using electronic benefit transfer [EBT] for redemption of WIC benefits). State data on redemption of issued WIC foods is useful for this purpose because it provides information about the proportions (weights) of \"Milk\" category redemptions that are skim, 1 percent, yogurt, soy beverage, tofu or cheese among the available substitutions. These data will be used to develop reasonable selections (allocations) for specific foods. Information from redemption shares as well as allowable substitutions and state options will be used to determine the proportions of each type of food in a food category (for example, the \"Milk\" category is 50 percent skim milk, 40 percent 1 percent milk, 10 percent low-fat yogurt). Nutrient and costs for each food 'category' will then be determined from the proportion-weighted component of foods. The baseline composite food categories containing foods purchased with a CVV were computed differently than for other WIC food categories. Because the CVV can be used to purchase many different fruits and vegetables, the composition of baseline representative CVVs for the different categories were computed as weighted averages of several specific items based on their rates of purchase. The contribution (weight) of vegetables (e.g., broccoli) to each vegetable category (e.g., dark greens) will be determined by USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) for use by the 2015 DGAC (Personal communication, P. Britten, USDA/CNPP, September 24, 2014). For each composite food category, the relative proportions of different options will be used to construct nutrient profiles. The protocol for estimating these nutrient profiles will be similar to that used in the previous evaluation of WIC food packages   , 2014). For some foods, nutrient data from USDA will be used without modification (e.g., whole milk). For most foods, however, weighted composite nutrient data will be created, for example, the nutrient profile for \"milk\" will be composed of nutrients contained in all the various types of milk and milk substitutes included in the baseline composite milk food category, weighted accordingly. Nutrient profiles for the composite fruit and vegetable food groups and subgroups will be created based on weighted contributions of only those individual fruits and vegetables contributing 5 percent or more to each group or subgroup. Although CVVs can be used to purchase fruits and vegetables in canned, frozen, fresh or dehydrated forms, depending on state regulation, for baseline compositions used in the phase II report, allocation for most fruits and vegetables was assumed to be in fresh form, because all states are required to allow purchase of this form. This, as well as the relative proportions of foods in the WIC food categories (i.e. types of milk), maybe revised in phase II pending the availability of additional redemption data."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Prices", "text": "To evaluate the costs of the baseline food packages, the committee will need to determine a baseline time period to use for the evaluations. Although July, 2015 would be appropriate as this date occurred after implementation of allowing the purchase of white potatoes with the CVV, as well as the substitution of whole grain pasta (allowed effective May 2014), price and other product and program data for 2015 are limited at the current time (e.g., the yogurt substitution deadline is ongoing) and some data are not available at the time of this report. Therefore, 2014 price and other program data will be used for the initial phase II analysis, with an update to 2015 price data later in phase II. The average price of each food category in the WIC food package will be determined by assessing prices for qualifying foods (USDA/FNS, 2013b). The same approach will be used for infant formulas. Baseline price data for all food products except fruits and vegetables are available from retail scanner data (from the Information Resources Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois, through a third-party agreement with the ERS). These data will be supplemented, when needed, by other sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics national average price data, Internet sources, or local store price data. For fruits and vegetables, ERS price data will be used. Recently, the ERS updated its computation of prices for fruits and vegetables using market purchase data from retail sales data for 2013 (USDA/ERS, 2015a).

However, there were two methodological differences relevant to nutrient intake estimation between the USDA-FNS analysis and the analysis conducted here: First, the committee examined WIC participating compared to WIC-eligible non-participating children, but USDA-FNS analyzed three subgroups of children: WIC, non-WIC lower income (\u2264 185 percent of poverty), and nonparticipating higher income children. Second, the committee applied the Iowa State University (ISU) method while USDA-FNS applied the National Cancer Institute method for usual intake estimation and also made statistical comparisons when possible. The USDA-FNS report focused on children ages 1 to less than 5 years of age because the samples for infants and women were too small to yield reliable estimates. Nutrient intake results in the USDA/FNS (2015) report are presented in Appendix O and summarized briefly here. A key finding of USDA-FNS report was that large proportions of children ages 1 to less than 5 years old had inadequate intakes of vitamin E as well as vitamin D and calcium. Non-WIC-participating higher-income children were significantly more likely to have lower vitamin E intakes than WIC participating children. Mean potassium and fiber intakes were below the AIs 1 for these nutrients across all groups. The majority (74 percent) of all children had excessive intakes of sodium. For macronutrients, intakes of total fat were outside the appropriate range for 30 percent of children and their intakes and were more likely to be too low than too high. Saturated fat intakes were above recommended levels for 83 percent of children. Consumption of energy from \"empty calories\" (i.e., solid fats and added sugars) was two to three times the recommended upper limit of 10 to 14 percent of total calories. "}, {"section_title": "NHANES ANALYSIS: NUTRIENT INTAKES", "text": "This section presents intakes of micronutrients, macronutrients, and energy for three groups ( WIC participants, 2005 income-eligible non-participants, and 2011-2012 low-income individuals) across relevant WIC age categories (pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, 19 to 50 years; formula-fed infants 0 to less than 6 months; formula-fed infants 6 to less than 12 months; children 1 to less than 2 years; and children 2 to less than 5 years). Too few breastfeeding infants with reported food intake were included in NHANES to estimate their usual intakes of foods for any survey years of interest. Micronutrient, macronutrient, and energy intake means and distributions of the adequacy percentages discussed in this chapter are presented in Appendix P. Although USDA-FNS was interested in comparing intakes among WIC participants before and after the 2009 food package change, the indicator of WIC participation for the 2011-2012 NHANES dataset became available only after completion of these analyses. Therefore, a comparison of nutrient intakes among WIC participants before the 2009 food package changes to those after the changes could not be conducted. Moreover, only the 2005-2008 NHANES data were considered appropriate for comparison of WIC participants to WIC-eligible nonparticipants. 2 All individuals who were income-eligible for WIC from NHANES 2011-2012 were analyzed as a proxy for WIC participants. In phase II, the WIC indicator will be applied to the NHANES 2011-2012 dataset so that, depending on the sample sizes in 2011-2012, intakes of WIC participants in 2011-2012 can be compared to those of income-eligible non-participants. With adequate sample sizes, WIC participant intakes can also be compared before and after the 2009 food package changes. Nutrient intakes were compared to the DRI references values appropriate for evaluation of groups, the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) or the Adequate Intake (AI) values, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), and the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). PC Software for Intake Distribution (PC-SIDE) was used to implement the Iowa State University (ISU) method of determining usual nutrient intake distributions. The methods used to conduct these analyses of NHANES data are described in detail in Chapter 3. As indicated in Chapter 3, the prevalence of inadequacy or excess was estimated by determining the proportion of persons in the group whose usual intakes do not reach the EAR, fall outside of the AMDR, or exceed the UL. When combining groups with different EARs, intakes in one of the groups were rescaled so they can be compared to the EAR of the other group (IOM, 2000a). This re-scaling approach was applied to the group with children 1 to less than 5 years of age, and to the combined group of pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women . No conclusion can be drawn about the prevalence of inadequacy for an intake level that falls below the AI (IOM, 2000a); therefore, mean intake values are presented for these nutrients. 3 Intakes of macronutrients that fall above or below the AMDR may increase the risk of chronic disease. A prevalence of inadequacy or excess greater than 5 percent was considered of concern. 4 Vitamin D intake data are presented only for infants ages 0 to less than 12 months because serum vitamin D data are not available for this age group. Vitamin D intake data are not presented for other age groups because of the limited utility of intake information for the assessment of adequacy (Taylor et al., 2013). In phase II, the effects of potential food package changes on vitamin D content of the packages will be assessed in the sensitivity analysis. For several population subgroups, the sample size is small (i.e., for eligible non-WIC infants 0 to less than 6 months of age, n = 21). Although the mean is adequately precise with small sample sizes in these NHANES datasets (except for the women's subgroup in 2011-2012), intake estimates falling at the ends of the distributions are less precise. For the small subgroup of women, a variance adjustment was applied to reduce the effect of variability in within-person variance (described below and in Chapter 3). WIC participant and eligible non-WIC participant subgroups were compared by t-test. One consequence of the small sample sizes is that the standard error values are large and thus only large differences between means can be detected."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Intake of Pregnant, Breastfeeding, and Postpartum Women, Ages 19 to 50 Years", "text": "As described in Chapter 3, the sample sizes for pregnant, lactating, and postpartum women were small; therefore respondents of all physiological stages were combined into one analytical subgroup. In addition, the external variances were adjusted by the method of Jahns et al. (2005) to produce estimates that were less subject to the large degree of variability in the within-person variance estimate that can be introduced by a small sample size (described in Chapter 3). The re-scaling method was applied to accommodate differences in nutrient requirements for these various physiological states. There were no statistically significant differences between WIC-participant and eligible non-participant subgroups."}, {"section_title": "Micronutrient Adequacy", "text": "For pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, the prevalence of inadequacy was greater than 5 percent for most nutrients across all subgroups: calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, zinc, thiamin, folate, and vitamins A, E, C, and B6 (see Table 4-1). Low riboflavin and niacin intakes were present in a smaller percentage of women (6 to 9 percent) in the 2005-2008 dataset, but not in the most recent dataset. Micronutrients with the highest prevalences of inadequacy were vitamin E (88 to 98 percent across groups), vitamin A (58 to 60 percent), iron (39 to 66 percent), and magnesium (47 to 65 percent). Vitamin C inadequacy was also present in at least 30 percent of each subgroup analyzed. 4 As described in Chapter 3, a concerning level of inadequate or excessive intake of any nutrient is usually defined as less than 2.5 percent of the population of interest . This percent should translate to an equivalent percentage of impaired function or adverse effect. For this report, a 5 percent threshold was applied. This is a slightly relaxed standard, which accounts for some of the uncertainty in setting the EARs, as well as some of the generally accepted errors associated with dietary assessment.

Total fat intakes expressed as a percent of calories, however, were high across all groups, with 49 percent of 2011-2012 low-income women having intakes above the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR). Excessive energy from total fat was more prevalent for WIC participating (39 percent) compared to WIC-eligible non-participating women (18 percent). Approximately 11 percent of women across all subgroups had excessive energy from saturated fat. The prevalence of low percent of energy from carbohydrate was high only for WIC participants (11 percent), compared to 3 percent for eligible non-participants. Given that lowering or raising the percent of energy from one dietary macronutrient affects the contribution of the others, it is possible that the prevalence of excessive energy intakes from total fat is related to the prevalence of low energy intakes from carbohydrate. However, as recommended in the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2015 DGAC report) the focus for this age group should be ensuring that the intake of energy from saturated fat is below 10 percent (USDA/HHS, 2015). The 2015 DGAC report did not include any recommendations on energy from total fat or from carbohydrates. As shown in Table 4-3, all three of the subgroups examined here reported a mean energy intake from saturated fat that was slightly above the recommended 10 percent. Mean fiber intakes for women were below the AI, and mean intakes of added sugars were excessive across all subgroups. Reported energy intake data are presented in Table 4-4. Mean usual intakes were higher than the calculated Estimated Energy Requirements (EERs) for WICeligible non-participating women and 2011-2012 low-income women, but not for WIC participating women. These findings should be interpreted with caution because reported energy intakes are known to be inaccurate (Subar et al., 2015) and mean intakes could also be affected by differing proportions of pregnant, lactation, and postpartum women within each subgroup.

EERs were calculated according to Dietary Reference Intake report (IOM, 2002.\nThe macronutrient intakes for this age group are summarized in Table 4-18. Although the 2015 DGAC report's recommendations were for children aged 2 years and older, the recommended limits on percent of energy from saturated fat and grams of sugar are applied here as well. Mean saturated fat intakes were high across all subgroups (more than 10 percent of energy), and fiber intakes were low. For WIC participating children, intake of added sugars was approximately twice the recommended limit (3.2 tsp-eq per day) for the 1,000-1,300 kcal weighted diet pattern 6 applied to children in this report. If a lower energy intake level, closer to the mean EER for WIC participants in this age group was considered (925 kcal), intakes of these macronutrients are of even greater concern. As noted for women who also had low intakes of carbohydrate, the focus for this age group is the excessive intake of saturated fat as opposed to low carbohydrate intake. Usual energy intake estimates and the corresponding EER values are presented in Table  4-19. Estimated mean intakes exceeded the EERs across subgroups. For example, energy intake of WIC participating children (1,314 kcal per day) was 42 percent higher than the EER for this subgroup (925 kcal per day).  <10% of kcal Mean % of kcal 13.6 (0.16) 13.2 (0.28) 13.1 (0.22) NOTES: AI = Adequate Intake; AMDR = acceptable macronutrient distribution range; g/d = grams per day; g/kg/d = grams per kilogram of body weight per day; kcal = kilocalories; N = sample size; SE = standard error; tsp-eq/d = teaspoon equivalents per day.

The prevalence of low total fat intakes ranged from 9 to 15 percent, with the greatest difference between WIC participating children (15 percent) and WIC-eligible nonparticipating children (9 percent). The prevalence of excessive total fat intakes ranged from 6 to 9 percent across the subgroups. Mean saturated fat intakes were only slightly above the recommended 10 percent of energy intakes across all subgroups, although as noted in the next paragraph, reported energy intake appeared to be excessive. Fiber intakes were approximately half the AI. Mean added sugars intakes (15 tsp-eq per day, see Appendix P) were approximately five-fold of the recommended limit for a weighted 1,300 kcal diet. Usual mean energy intakes and the corresponding EER values are presented in Table 4-24. As for younger children, reported energy intakes exceeded the calculated EERs for all subgroups, although the difference among the subgroups was smaller than it was for the younger children.

Evaluation of iron and energy provided in the WIC food packages for fully formulafeeding infants WIC formula is required to contain a minimum of 1.5 mg iron per 100 kilocalories at standard dilution 5 (USDA/FNS, 2014). Participating formula-fed WIC participating infants ages 0 to 3 months old receive a maximum of 806 fl oz per month (537 kcal per day), and infants 4 to less than 6 months of age receive 884 fl oz per month (589 kcal per day). These quantities of formula provide slightly less energy than the calculated EER for the WIC subgroup in this report, 594 kcal per day. Infants participating in WIC who consume infant formula as their sole source of nutrition would be provided with 8.1 to 8.8 mg of iron per day at this range of energy intakes.

Although the accuracy of data reported in NHANES has been questioned (Archer et al., 2013), it remains the best available source of nationally representative food and nutrient intake data. In their recent commentary, Subar et al. 2015provide a detailed review of the strengths and limitations of the NHANES data. They acknowledge the weakness of NHANES for some purposes but also note the utility of these data for developing population-level policies related to nutrition. Nonetheless, use of NHANES data had limitations relative to the committee's task, as previously noted in the Letter Report issued for this study . First, the WIC to non-WIC comparisons were made using data from 2005-2008, which were not the most recent NHANES datasets available. Although these analyses update the prior IOM report (2006), a more recent and WIC-focused comparison (using NHANES 2011-2012) is desirable. The indicator of WIC participation was not available for the most recent NHANES dataset in time for this report, but it will be available for phase II.\nThe committee recognized several potential limitations to interpreting the data presented in this chapter. Since the IOM (2006) report, there has been only limited national-level work evaluating the food intake patterns of infants up to 24 months of age. The two nationally representative surveys summarized here (IFPS II and FITS 2008) were completed 8 or more years ago and may not adequately reflect current feeding practices. As noted previously, the committee anticipates that results of the WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study will be available in phase II (Harrison, 2014). Limitations to the nutrient intake analyses that were discussed in Chapter 4 are also applicable to the food intake analyses of NHANES data presented here. In addition, the food intake data include many zeros in a reported day's intake and this feature of the data requires appropriate methods that account for the zero intakes in estimating the intake distributions (see Chapter 3). The sample sizes are smaller across population subgroups in the food intake analysis compared to those for nutrient intake because (due to software requirements) individuals included in the sample must have 2 days of reported intake to estimate usual intakes of foods (reported intake could be zero on one or both days). In some cases, this results in sample sizes that are quite small. For example, the 2011-2012 low-income population subgroup of women includes only 29 individuals. The only software that does not require equal number of observations per person is the NCI software, but it failed to converge in several cases in these analyses. In this report, a population-weighted approach was applied using SPADE. An alternative, simplified approach was applied in the Letter Report  to compare intake to recommendations. Also, in the Letter Report, PC Software for Intake Distribution (PC-SIDE) and the Iowa State University method were used instead of SPADE, and for different sample years and respondent selection criteria, so mean intakes and the comparisons to recommended intakes differ between the Letter Report and the analyses presented here. Overall, comparisons to recommended food patterns presented in this report are similar to those in other studies. Most recently, Krebs-Smith et al. (2010) applied an approach similar to that used here to compare intakes to federal dietary recommendations using 2001-2004 NHANES data. Although the food groups were categorized differently then, most individuals in the U.S. population did not meet the recommended intakes for any food group except \"total grains\" and \"meat and beans.\" As the committee found in its analysis, energy intake from solid (saturated) fats and added sugars was excessive. Similar to the findings in this report and those of Krebs-Smith et al., (2010), the 2015 DGAC report indicated overall poor intakes of food groups that supply important nutrients. The reliability and consistency of the HEI-2010 has been validated for prediction of diet quality (Guenther et al., 2014); however, the index has a few limitations. Consumers of beans and peas may have lower scores for \"seafood and plant proteins\" or \"total vegetables\" because the beans and peas are counted towards other groups first, then any \"leftover\" is counted as contributing to these groups. The HEI-2010 also does not account for physical activity or the appropriateness of energy intake. Therefore, an individual who consumes too much energy may have higher HEI scores than one consuming an appropriate level of energy but whom, as a result, has difficulty meeting the recommended food pattern. For example, individuals over the age of 8 with energy needs less than 1,600 kcal will have difficulty meeting nutrient requirements Nutrition-Related Health Risks in the WIC Population INTRODUCTION Women, infants, and children ages 1 to less than 5 years who meet the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) eligibility criteria for income, life-stage category, and residency status are presumed to be at nutritional risk (IOM, 2002). 1 These nutritional risks include anthropometric; biochemical; dietary; clinical, health, and medical; and other risks (USDA/FNS, 2013). This chapter begins with a summary of the WIC specification of these risks and the most commonly reported risks for WIC participants. Next, the health outcomes associated with these nutritional risks are discussed. For each outcome, its prevalence is described in women, infants, and children from 1 to less than 5 years of age participating in WIC, and the relevant U.S. population based on national and regional evidence. During its evaluations, the committee remained aware of the importance of maternal nutrition on infant health (IOM, 2011a), as well as differences among racial and ethnic groups that are represented in the WIC population. This chapter ends by covering food safety risks relevant to the WIC population and the food packages."}, {"section_title": "4-38 REVIEW OF WIC FOOD PACKAGES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimating Micronutrient Adequacy", "text": "To estimate the adequacy of micronutrient intake, adjustments were made to calculate nutrient adequacy in analytical subgroups in which more than one EAR was applicable. Using this method may conceal a relatively high prevalence among pregnant women and a much lower prevalence among lactating women, as described in Chapter 3. This case is applicable to the assessment of iron adequacy in children and iron and folate adequacy in women. In addition, iron inadequacy in women may be incorrectly estimated because a normal distribution of requirements was used, which assumes that women who are pregnant, lactating, or postpartum do not skew requirements due to menstrual losses. As noted previously, for nutrients with an AI value only, no inference can be made about nutrient adequacy. Several of the micronutrient intake estimates should be interpreted with caution because of small sample sizes (see Chapter 3, Table 3-2). The committee calculated that a mean usual nutrient intake can be calculated within 3 percent of the true value (95 percent confidence interval) with a minimum of 18-20 individuals, depending on nutrient and on age group. This minimum may not apply to calculation of population-level intake adequacy. At the same time, the statistical method applied gives relatively reliable numbers around the median and mean even with small sample sizes, but with less reliability at the tails of distributions. Sample sizes for women remained small despite combining all pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum individuals, but the estimates were stabilized by weighting the external variance, and therefore, should be reliable (Jahns et al., 2005). Finally, because all women were combined to generate more robust sample sizes, it was not possible to determine differences in the prevalence of inadequacy among these three reproductive categories. Furthermore, mean intakes and prevalences of inadequacies for these subpopulations may be affected by differing proportions of pregnant, lactating, and postpartum women within each subpopulation. As a result, comparison across the subpopulations (such as WIC vs. WIC-eligible) should be interpreted with extra caution. "}, {"section_title": "Estimating Macronutrient and Energy Intake", "text": "Although estimates of energy requirements (EERs) have been published, an individual's requirements depend on many factors and cannot be precisely estimated. The EERs used in this report were calculated based on established equations developed by the IOM (2002/2005). Recently, Butte et al. (2014) proposed that the IOM (2002/2005) equations overestimate energy expenditure for toddlers because they are based on incorrect physical activity assumptions. The committee is aware of this finding and will consider it when developing its final recommendations. The mean energy intake of infants was at least 30 percent higher than the EER used in this report and, for children, 42 percent (children 1 to less than 2 years) and 18 percent (children 2 to less than 5 years) higher. This suggests that caretakers of children in these subgroups may be over-reporting energy intakes, as has been proposed in other studies (Eck et al., 1989;Devaney et al., 2004) as well as in the previous IOM review of WIC food packages . Assessing dietary intake in people of any age is challenging, but measuring the diet of infants and very young children can be particularly problematic. Multiple people may be responsible for the care of the child, and collecting an accurate picture of intake often requires combining parental reports with observations from other caretakers (Foster and Adamson, 2014). Should over-reporting be the case, nutrients identified in the NHANES analyses as under-consumed become more significant concerns. In contrast to infants and children, reported mean energy intakes of women in this report were 10 percent lower than estimated average needs. There is robust evidence that adults tend to underreport energy intakes if they are overweight (Macdiarmid and Blundell, 1998), and CDC data indicate higher levels of obesity in lower-income women (CDC, 2010). A recent evaluation of reporting accuracy in NHANES 2002-2012 indicated that 25 percent of adults ages 20 and older were likely to underreport energy intake. Respondents were more likely to underreport if female, non-Hispanic black, having lower education or income, and if overweight or obese (Murakami and Livingstone, 2015). Subar et al. (2015) and Archer et al. (2013) agree that selfreported energy intake is of limited value as a measure of true energy intake. Underreporting could exaggerate the estimated micronutrient inadequacies for women identified in this report, however, as noted in Subar et al. (2015), if the discrepancy between reported and recommended intakes is large enough, concern may be warranted even considering a degree of error. In general, underreporting is more pervasive than over-reporting (Murakami and Livingstone, 2015), especially among overweight and obese women (Briefel et al. 1995;McKenzie et al., 2002).   A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc   In phase I, the committee was tasked with assessing food intake of WIC-eligible populations. This chapter summarizes the committee's findings. The approaches applied included an evaluation of findings from published surveys on dietary intake (for individuals younger than 2 years of age), NHANES analyses similar to the nutrient intake analyses described in Chapter 4, and a literature search for supplemental information. The information summarized in this chapter, in combination with the nutrient intake information presented in Chapter 4, support identification of nutrient and food group priorities for the WIC food packages."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE AND REPORT FINDINGS: FOOD INTAKE OF WIC PARTICIPANTS", "text": "The committee reviewed the literature for information on food intakes of WIC participants, with a particular focus on complementary feeding practices. A summary of the committee's findings is presented here."}, {"section_title": "Food Intake of WIC Participants Compared to Non-Participants", "text": "The committee identified five cross-sectional studies that compared food intakes of WIC participants to non-participants. Three conducted crude analysis on food intake data: (1) a small regional study in South Carolina (McElligott et al., 2012), (2) an analysis of data from the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) (Deming et al., 2014) and (3) a study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010 (Watowicz and Taylor, 2014). Ages ranged from 6 months to 4 years. All three studies found higher intakes of juice among WIC participants compared to non-participants. Other notable findings were lower intakes of whole fruit among 1-to 4-year old WIC participants (Deming et al., 2014) and higher milk intakes among 2-to 4-year old WIC participants compared to non-participants, although the latter finding was not statistically significant (Watowicz and Taylor, 2014). Additional detail on findings from the FITS study is presented later in this chapter. The USDA-FNS Diet Quality of American Young Children study (see Chapter 4 for a description of the methodology) examined food intakes of WIC-participating and non-WIC children using NHANES 2005NHANES -2008. Their analysis indicated that compared to income-eligible nonparticipants, WIC participating children were more likely to consume WIC juice, cow's milk, whole milk, regular soda, beans, and WIC cereals, and less likely to consume fruit (excluding juice) and fats and oils added to foods (USDA/FNS, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Food Intake and the Revised Food Packages", "text": "Except for studies on breastfeeding, data characterizing the effect of the 2009 WIC food package changes on children's food intake or health are sparse. The data that do exist are regional. Two prospective cohort studies were conducted using the same population sample, a group of Hispanic and African-American mother-child pairs from 12 Chicago WIC clinics (Odoms-Young et al., 2014;Kong et al. 2014). Baseline data were collected in summer 2009 before the WIC food package revisions were implemented. Odoms-Young et al. 2014reported that, 6 months postrevision, fruit consumption increased among Hispanic mothers; low-fat dairy consumption increased among Hispanic mothers, Hispanic children and African-American children; and whole milk consumption decreased among all groups. Additionally, home food availability of low-fat dairy and whole grains increased. No significant changes in diet quality were observed for any other group. Kong et al. (2014) reported that, 18 months postrevision, low-fat milk intake increased for African-American and Hispanic children and that whole milk intake decreased for all groups. Four pre/post studies compared food intake before and after the 2009 WIC food package revisions. Again, as with the two Chicago studies, all three were regional. One was conducted in New York State , one among Indian tribal organizations across multiple states (Ishdorj and Capps, 2013), and the third in California . Despite numerous differences among the populations sampled, including varying cultural food preferences, the studies consistently suggest that the 2009 WIC food package changes were associated with increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat/fat-free milk and decreased consumption of whole milk. Specifically,  reported that food intake and healthy behaviors of more than 3.5 million children ages 0 to 4 years participating in the New York State WIC program showed an improvement between 2008 and 2011. In particular these improvements included delayed introduction of solids and increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and reduced fat milk. In a study of 1,642 Native American children ages 2 to 4 years who participated in WIC, Ishdorj and Capps (2013) found increases in lower-fat milk, fruit, vegetable, and whole grain intake following revisions of the food packages.  conducted a random telephone survey of California WIC families before and after the 2009 changes to the WIC packages. Based on their assessment of 3,004 (in 2009) and 2,996 (in 2010) households, they found significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and decreases in consumption of fat milk. Their findings were for families, but the increased consumption of reduced fat milk was specifically identified in children. In their recent systematic review, Schultz et al. (2015) reported that there was an overall improvement in dietary intake after the 2009 food package changes, although the body of evidence was limited. The committee came to the same conclusion after its own independent review. Finally, Meiquari et al. (2015) conducted a pre-post study that surveyed African-American WIC participant mothers and their eldest child at two WIC clinics in Atlanta, Georgia, specifically to examine the impact of the 2009 food package changes on milk intake. The authors reported that children significantly increased their intake of low-fat milk after the food package changes, although \"low-fat\" was defined as all forms other than whole, including 2 percent milk."}, {"section_title": "FOOD INTAKE OF WIC-ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS", "text": "5-3\n5-7\n5-9"}, {"section_title": "Racial and Ethnic Differences in Intake of WIC and Other Foods", "text": "Many findings suggest that food purchasing and consumption patterns may be strongly connected to culture, race, or ethnicity (Dubowitz et al., 2007(Dubowitz et al., , 2008Berm\u00fadez-Mill\u00e1n et al., 2009;Kong et al., 2013;Pooler and Gleason, 2014;Chaparro et al., 2015). This is evident in the WIC population, for example, Kong et al. (2013) compared the diets of African-American and Hispanic mothers and their 2-to 3-year old children who were enrolled in WIC prior to the 2009 food package revisions. Although the dietary intake of all groups fell short of national recommendations, the diets of Hispanic mothers and children were lower in percentage of calories from fat, added sugars, sodium, and sweetened beverages and higher in vitamin A, calcium, whole grains, fruits, and dairy foods, compared to their African-American counterparts. Reported differences in intake among and between racial and ethnic groups, however, are not always consistent (Faith et al., 2006;Chaparro et al., 2015;Cho et al., 2015;.

(2013) found urban African-American women consumed a wider variety of fruits than their rural counterparts. Compared to rural children, urban children were provided with a wider variety of vegetables and consumed them more frequently. Additional information on the effect of rural versus urban settings on food accessibility is presented in Chapter 2."}, {"section_title": "Complementary Food Intake of Individuals Younger Than 2 Years of Age", "text": "Complementary feeding is broadly defined as the addition of any foods other than human milk or formula to an infant's diet. This transition to table foods typically starts when the nutritional needs of the infant surpass what can be provided through human milk, usually occurring at around 6 months of age and lasting until a child is around 24 months of age (AAP, 2014). Although several large-scale surveys have asked parents and guardians to report when complementary foods were first introduced in their children's diets, infant dietary intake has not been a primary focus for most of these studies (NIS-Child Hard Copy Questionnaire, 2015; ECLS-B 9-Month Questionnaire; SLAITS-National Survey of Early Childhood Health, 2000). The WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study, a longitudinal, nationally representative study of infants in low-income families, is currently underway, and the committee anticipates results for review in phase II (Harrison et al., 2014). For this report, the committee relied on food intake data from three large contemporary datasets: 1 NHANES on foods that contribute to energy and nutrient intake in infants 0-24 months old (Grimes et al., 2015). Findings from the committee's own analyses of NHANES data are summarized later in this chapter. A comparison of the designs of IFPS II and FITS 2008 is outlined in Table 5-1. It should be noted that the data from these two studies were collected before the October 1, 2009, deadline for states to implement revisions to the WIC food packages. The IFPS II analysis detailed below combined WIC with non-WIC infants, and the results reflect all consumption in the 7 days before the survey. The FITS 2008 analysis described in this section, in contrast, compared WIC and non-WIC participants, and the data collected were for food intake only during the 24 hours before the interview.  d A year 6 follow-up study of children initially assessed in the IFPS II has been conducted, evaluating links between early feeding practices and various health outcomes (Fein, 2014). e Number represents sample included in the analysis, not entire NHANES sample. f Information about dietary supplement use was collected in each of the overall study designs, but the three reports on food group intakes did not evaluate supplement use. g Report-specific analysis, Deming et al., 2014. h Two days of dietary intake per sampled child was used to calculate usual nutrient intake distributions, Briefel et al., 2010. i While two 24-hour recalls are part of the NHANES procedures, Grimes et al. (2015) only evaluated intake reported on the first day of recall.

The FITS 2008 data showed that fruit consumption on a given day was less common in WIC participants 12-23.9 months old than in their non-participant counterparts (Deming et al., 2014). For NHANES infants, fruit composed a greater proportion of energy intake of children aged 12-23.9 month compared to infants 6-11.9 month olds (4.8 percent vs. 2.3 percent, respectively; Grimes et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Percent Juice", "text": "The proportion of IFPS II infants who consumed 100 percent juice in the week prior to the survey increased as they aged (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008).

The 2005-2012 NHANES analysis showed 100 percent juice contributed to 1.5 percent and 5.9 percent of total energy intake of infants 6-11.9 months and 12-23.9 months of age, respectively (Grimes et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Vegetables", "text": "Vegetables were introduced to the IFPS II infants at a median age of 5-6 months (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008). FITS 2008 data suggest that a lower percentage of WIC infants 6-11.9 months old consumed any vegetable on a given day compared to non-participants, a difference not seen 12-23.9 month groups (Deming et al., 2014). Due to small sample sizes and the infrequency of the responses, point estimates for intake of specific types of vegetables (e.g. dark green, deep yellow) were largely imprecise for infants less than 1 year of age. On a given day, a portion of WIC participants 12-23.9 months in the FITS 2008 study reportedly consumed white potatoes (41.5 percent), other starchy vegetables (17.0 percent), deep yellow vegetables (16.0 percent), dark green vegetables (12.0 percent), and other vegetables (28.7 percent) (Deming et al., 2014). Vegetable intake contributed to less than 1 percent of energy intake of 2005-2012 NHANES 6-11.9 month old infants (Grimes et al., 2015). For 12-23.9 month olds, total vegetable intake contributed to 3.2 percent of energy (Grimes et al., 2015).\nVegetables are the source of many of the shortfall nutrients including nutrients of public health concern, including fiber, potassium, iron, folate, and vitamin A (USDA/HHS, 2015). According to the 2015 DGAC report, the U.S. population consumes few servings of vegetables. Specifically, at ages 1 to 3 years, only 10 and 15 percent of boys and girls, respectively, consumed the recommended amounts of vegetables (1 cup of vegetables per day (USDA/HHS, 2015). According to the committee's analyses (see Chapter 5), even fewer (at most, 6 percent) of children participating in WIC or from low-income households ages 1 to less than 5 years consumed the recommended amounts of vegetables. These trends were similar among young adult females in the United States. Less than 10 percent of women ages 19 to 30 years met the recommendation for 2 to 3.5 cups per day, and at most, 4 percent of pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women participating in WIC or from low-income households consumed this amount. With respect to vegetable subgroups, again based on 2015 DGAC findings, more than 90 percent of individuals in the United States do not meet the recommended intakes for red and orange vegetables and more than 80 percent do not meet intake recommendations for dark greens, starchy vegetables, and dry beans and peas. Based on the committee's analyses, at least 74 percent of WIC participants and individuals from low-income households failed to meet recommended intakes of dark green vegetables. Intake of dry beans and peas was similarly poor for women in the committee's analysis, but higher for younger WIC participants and low-income populations than the general U.S. populations. The computation of intake of dry beans and peas was slightly different in the committee's analysis compared to that of the DGAC 2015. 3 Vegetables in the WIC food packages WIC participants can acquire vegetables from the WIC food package either by choosing 100 percent vegetable juice with the juice allowance or by purchasing vegetables with the CVV. Vegetable juice can be purchased within the same quantity limits allowed for fruit juice. The quantity of vegetables that can be purchased with the CVV varies greatly depending on the vegetables selected and local price. Using national price data, the committee estimated that an $11 CVV would permit women to purchase 0.4 cup-equivalents of vegetables and 0.5 cup-equivalents of fruit per day in total, assuming that 50 percent of the voucher would be spent on fruits and 50 percent on vegetables (see Table 1-7). This equates to approximately 16 percent of vegetable intake recommendations."}, {"section_title": "Grains and Grain Products", "text": "Grains were present in the diets of 18.3 percent of 3-month-old IFPS II infants, primarily in the form of infant cereal (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008). Similarly, infant cereals were the primary grain contributors in the diets of FITS 2008 infants 0-5.9 months old (Deming et al., 2014). In later infancy (6-11.9 months), non-infant cereals were present in the diets of 26.4 percent of infants, and crackers, pretzels, or rice cakes were being eaten by 39.4 percent of WIC participating infants (Deming et al., 2014). In the 12-23.9 month group, 56.2 and 63 percent WIC participants were consuming grains in mixed dishes and non-infant cereals, respectively  (Deming et al., 2014). For 2005-2012 NHANES infants 6-11.9 months of age, mixed grainbased dishes and breads, rolls, and tortillas each contributed to 2.3 and 1.1 percent of total energy intake, respectively (Grimes et al., 2015). For 12-23.9 month olds, mixed grain-based dishes; bread, rolls, and tortillas; crackers; ready-to-eat cereal; quick breads and bread products; and cooked cereals each contributed more than 1 percent of total energy intake (Grimes et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Meats and Meat Substitutes", "text": "Meat and meat substitutes were introduced to IFPS II infants at a median age of approximately 8 months (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008).

Point estimates of meat and meat substitute consumption among FITS 2008 WIC participants ages 0 to less than 6 months are imprecise due to sample size and because consumption of meats and meat substitutes was an uncommon event for this age group (Deming et al., 2014). In general, baby food meat was not commonly consumed (< 10 percent in any age group). On a given day, 23.5 percent of older WIC infants (6-11.9 months) and 71.9 percent of WIC children (12-23.9 months) consumed non-baby food meat. Only 28.3 percent of children 12-23.9 months reportedly ate eggs on a given day. Among 2005-2012 NHANES 6-11.9 month olds, meat and meat substitute food groups (e.g. poultry, plant-based protein foods) each contributed to less than 1 percent of total energy intake (Grimes et al., 2015). In contrast, 2005-2012 NHANES 12-23.9 month olds reportedly consumed poultry, cured meats and poultry, eggs, mixed meat/poultry/seafood dishes, and plant-based protein foods (Grimes et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Dairy", "text": "For the majority of IFPS II infants, cow's milk and milk products (excluding breast milk and infant formulas) were not present in their diets until late infancy, with the median age of introduction being approximately 10 months (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008). By approximately 10.5 months of age, 17.3 percent of IFPS II infants were consuming cow's milk. FITS 2008 found that approximately 13 percent of WIC participants 6-11.9 months old consumed cow's milk on a given day (Deming et al., 2014). Cow's milk was consumed on a daily basis by more than 80 percent of WIC participants 12-23.9 months old, with the majority (59.2 percent) reportedly consumed whole milk. A greater proportion of WIC participants consumed reducedor low-fat milk on a given day, compared to their non-WIC counterparts (31.8 vs. 19.7 percent). Cow's milk contributed to 3.1 percent and 22.4 percent of total energy intake of 2005-2012 NHANES infants aged 6-11.9 months and 12-23.9 months, respectively (Grimes et al., 2015). Among 12-23.9 month olds, cheese, yogurt, and flavored milk contributed another 2.6, 1.7, and 1.3 percent of total energy, respectively (Grimes et al., 2015).\nDairy foods provide vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all nutrients of public health concern. Consumption of dairy foods is associated with lower risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity . Dairy foods in the USDA food patterns include fluid milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, milk-based replacement meals, and some nondairy milk products, including fortified soymilk, but not almond or other plant-based milk-type products. The 2015 DGAC report identified low-or nonfat dairy as part of a healthy dietary pattern. (A summary of evidence on the health effects of dairy fat is provided later in this chapter.) Among the U.S. population at large, dairy intake begins to decline in adolescence and persists at very low levels among adult females, with fewer than 5 percent of women consuming the recommended 3 cup-equivalents of dairy per day (USDA/HHS, 2015). In contrast, in the analyses for this report, dairy intakes were met by approximately 50 to 70 percent of WIC participant children and low-income children ages 1 to less than 5 years and an even greater proportion of women (86 to 92 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Desserts, Sweetened Beverages, and Savory Snacks", "text": "In the IFPS II cohort, fatty and sugared foods were present in the diet of nearly a quarter of 9-month old infants (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008).

The committee's reasons for concern are explained below. It should be reiterated that data collection for IFPS II, FITS 2008, and most of the presented NHANES analysis occurred prior to the full implementation of the WIC food package revisions. Some of the changes, such as not issuing complementary foods prior to an infant reaching 6 months of age, have the potential to affect the areas of concerns described below. Large datasets exploring the postrevision status of infants, however, do not currently exist."}, {"section_title": "Early Introduction of Complementary Foods", "text": "Of the 1,334 IFPS II mothers who provided complete data, 40.4 percent reported introducing solid food before their infant was 4 months of age (before 17 weeks; Clayton et al., 2013). This early introduction of complementary foods was half as common among breastfed infants (24.3 percent) compared to infants that were formula fed or mixed fed (52.7 percent and 50.2 percent, respectively). Women who introduced complementary foods early were more likely to be participating in the WIC program, according to Clayton et al. (2013). In another analysis of the IFPS II data that used different criteria and cutoffs, the estimated proportion of early introducers (before 15 weeks) was 21 percent, and early introduction of complementary foods was associated with lower maternal education (Fein et al., 2008b). The reported differences in proportion of early introducers may be due to differences in the cut-off ages of infants included in the respective studies. The FITS 2008 data also suggested that a portion of infants were receiving complementary foods before 4-6 months of age. Introduction of these foods appears to be delayed compared to FITS 2002 infants (Siega-Riz et al., 2010). The early introduction of complementary foods may reflect early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding and has implications for infant weight gain. Gaffney et al. (2012) reported that the weight-for-age z-score of 691 IFPS II infants (primarily Caucasian) at 1 year of age was significantly higher in infants who received complementary foods before 6 months of age compared to those who received them at or after 6 months of age. Chapter 6 provides a summary of health outcomes associated with inappropriate infant weight gain."}, {"section_title": "Iron-Fortified Foods and Supplements", "text": "Healthy, full-term infants are typically born with sufficient iron stores for at least the first 4 months of life (AAP, 2014). The iron concentration of human milk, however, is relatively low and, although readily absorbed by the infant, can be insufficient to meet iron needs in the latter half of infancy. Inasmuch as iron deficiency can have potentially long-lasting neurocognitive effects (see Chapter 6 for a summary of health outcomes associated with iron deficiency in infants), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infants who consume at least half of their daily feedings from human milk receive a 1 mg/kg/day iron supplement starting at 4 months of age, with the supplement eventually being displaced by iron-rich complementary foods AAP, 2014). Using IFPS II data, Dee et al. (2008) compared the intake of iron-rich foods among exclusively breastfed versus mix-fed, full-term infants and found that, by 6 months of age, 80 percent of mix-fed infants were consuming infant cereal and 14 percent were consuming meat. In contrast, nearly a quarter of exclusively breastfed, full-term infants (23 percent) did not have a regular iron-rich food source in their diets. Iron supplementation among both exclusively breastfed and mix-fed infants was fairly uncommon, with less than 10 percent reporting using iron supplements at any given time during the survey. Among FITS 2008 infants, which included infants of all breastfeeding intensities, Butte et al. 2010found mean iron intake among 6-11 month olds to be 15.8 mg/day, with 12 percent consuming inadequate iron (relative to the EAR of 6.9 mg/day). Among 12-23 months old, inadequate iron uptake was not apparent. Based on the 2005-2012 NHANES analysis (Grimes et al., 2015) which did not include supplement use in the evaluation, the top foods that contributed to iron intake among 6-11.9 months olds were infant formulas (44.8 percent), baby foods (43.1 percent), ready-to-eat cereals (3.1 percent), and grain-based mixed dishes (1.0 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Early Introduction of Cow's Milk", "text": "The early introduction of cow's milk can affect the health of an infant. For example, a portion of infants experience significant increases in occult fecal blood loss when fed cow's milk, with the response diminishing with age (Ziegler et al., 1990(Ziegler et al., , 1999Jiang et al., 2000). Furthermore, cow's milk has a high protein, but low iron content. As such, it may displace foods with higher iron content in the early months of complementary feeding and thereby compromise an infant's iron status. Some international guidelines for the introduction of cow's milk into the diets of infants and young children suggest that a limited amount is permissible (usually 500 mL/day after 6 or 9 months of age), especially if accompanied by an iron supplement (Agostoni and Turck, 2011;FAO, 2013). The AAP, however, recommends that whole milk should not be introduced before 12 months of age AAP, 2014). Estimates from IFPS II, FITS 2008, and the 2005-2012 NHANES indicate that infants are being fed cow's milk prior to 12 months of age. IFPS II results found that, at 10.5 months, 17.3 percent of infants had consumed cow's milk in the previous week (Grummer-Strawn et al., 2008). Overall, 25.9 percent of IFPS II infants had consumed cow's milk prior to 10.5 months of age, a practice more common among mothers with lower education levels (Fein et al., 2008b). FITS 2008 data indicate that an estimated 13.3 percent of WIC infants aged 6-11.9 months consumed cow's milk on a given day (Deming et al., 2014). For infants 6-11.9 months of age included in the 2005-2012 NHANES analysis, cow's milk contributed 3.1 percent of total energy intake (Grimes et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Foods of Poor Nutritional Value", "text": "Results from IFPSII, FITS 2008, and the 2005-2012 NHANES indicate that desserts, sweetened beverages, and salty snacks are parts of the diets of children less than 24 months of age. These foods are typically energy-dense and nutrient-poor, and have little nutritive role in the diets of young children. Higher consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods has been associated with lower micronutrient intake in young children (Webb, 2006) and can help to establish taste preferences, which has implications for dietary patterns later in life (Beauchamp and Mennella, 2009;Mennella, 2014 "}, {"section_title": "NHANES ANALYSIS: FOOD GROUP AND SUBGROUP INTAKES", "text": "In addition to evaluating NHANES findings reported in the literature (i.e., Grimes et al. 2015), the committee conducted its own analyses of NHANES data.

As mentioned in Chapter 4, the WIC identifier for the 2011-2012 NHANES dataset became available only after completion of these analyses. Therefore, it was not possible to compare food intakes among WIC participants before the 2009 food package changes occured to those after the changes were implemented. Moreover, only the 2005-2008 NHANES data were considered appropriate for comparison of WIC participants to WIC-eligible non-participants. 1 All individuals who were income-eligible for WIC from NHANES 2011-2012 were analyzed as a proxy for WIC participants. In phase II, the WIC indicator will be applied to the NHANES 2011-2012 dataset so that, depending on the sample sizes in 2011-2012, intakes of WIC participants in 2011-2012 can be compared to those of income-eligible non-participants. With adequate sample sizes, WIC participant intakes can also be compared before and after the 2009 food package changes. Food group and subgroup intakes among WIC participating women, infants, and children were evaluated relative to the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2015 DGAC report) recommended intakes or other dietary guidance as appropriate. To estimate the distribution of dietary components consumed episodically (food groups and subgroups), the Statistical Program for Age-adjusted Dietary Assessment (SPADE), a method similar to NCI, was implemented. For all population subgroups for which the percent below recommended food intakes could be calculated with reasonable precision, a population level prevalence of low intakes of 50 percent or more was considered of concern (see detailed explanation of these methods in Chapter 3). WIC participant and eligible non-WIC participant subgroups were compared by t-test. One consequence of the small sample sizes is that the standard error values are large and thus only large differences between means can be detected 1 The 2009-2010 NHANES dataset spanned the period of time over which the 2009 food package changes were implemented. It was therefore not considered appropriate for either the pre-or post-food package change assessments. As noted in Chapter 3, separation of a 2-year dataset requires re-computation of population weights, which was beyond the scope of this study. Food group and subgroup intakes for women compared to recommendations are presented in Table 5-4, with mean usual intakes and intake distributions presented in Appendix Q. No statistically significant differences between WIC participant and WIC-eligible nonparticipant subgroups were identified. For low-income women in the 2011-2012 NHANES dataset, the estimated percent below recommendations data are not reliable because the population subgroup size was small and the variance was large. 2 Therefore, mean usual intake data are presented so comparisons can be made across subgroups of women. Estimates of \"% below recommendations\" was adequately precise for women in the 2005-2008 dataset; therefore these data are presented. More than 50 percent of WIC participating women and WIC-eligible nonparticipating women in the 2005-2008 NHANES survey had low intakes of all food groups, with the exception of refined grains (0 to 6 percent) and meat, poultry, and eggs (45 to 46 percent). Nearly 100 percent of these women had low intakes of total vegetables and whole grains. Likewise, nearly all women in the 2005-2008 NHANES survey had low intakes of dark green vegetables (for WIC-participating women, not enough consumed foods from this group to generate reliable estimates), red and orange vegetables (95 to 98 percent), and starchy vegetables (84 to 98 percent). Very low intakes (i.e., 80-95 percent of the population subgroup below recommendations) were also evident for beans and peas, nuts, seeds and soy, total dairy, and oils. Mean usual intake data were also compared across subgroups of women. There were small differences across these groups in food intake, but women in the 2011-2012 NHANES dataset consumed more total fruit, total vegetables (as well as dark green and red and orange), whole grains, total protein foods (including meat, poultry and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy), and total dairy compared to women in the 2005-2008 NHANES survey. Too few women in the most recent survey consumed beans and peas or seafood to generate estimates. Intake of WICeligible non-participating women was generally greater than that of WIC participating women, except for total fruit, red and orange vegetables, and beans and peas. For WIC participating women from the 2005-2008 population subgroup, mean intake of solid fats was 37 g-eq per day, or over twice the recommended limit of 18 g-eq per day. Their intake of added sugars was 23 tsp-eq per day (see Appendix Q, Table Q-2), which was approximately triple the recommended limit of 8 tsp-eq per day.

These results are consistent with the analysis of food group intakes reported earlier in this chapter. The results are also generally consistent with findings from the USDA-FNS (2015) Diet Quality of Young American Children report. However, there were differences between the committee's analysis and the USDA-FNS (2015) report for some of the component scores.

In the committee's analysis, there were no significant differences between WIC children and incomeeligible non-participant children for these components. 4 One potential reason for the discrepant findings (both analyses are based on 2005-2008 NHANES data) is that the USDA-FNS results were age adjusted to account for differences in the age distribution of WIC participants and nonparticipants. The analysis conducted by the committee was not age adjusted. In addition, the food patterns databases applied were different between the USDA-FNS's and the committee's approach.

Differences for the component scores were mixed (some were higher in 2011-2012 and some were lower), but the main contributors to the higher total score in 2011-2012 were higher scores for fatty acids (healthy fats), whole grains, sodium, and empty calories.  .0 (1.05) NOTES: HEI = Healthy Eating Index; SE = standard error.

The committee was not able to evaluate the effect of the 2009 food package change on WIC participants' health because the NSWP-II report data cannot be ascribed to a time period specifically before or after this change. In addition to WIC-specific data, the committee considered two sources of relevant national data: (1) NHANES, which is released on a biennial basis (USDA/ARS, 2005, and (2) the CDC's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), for which data are collected annually .

For some risks, such as inappropriate weight status (high or low weight for height) in children at least 2 years of age and women, the preferred definition is based on body mass index (BMI) cutoff points but, if height and weight cannot be reliably measured, an alternative approach is allowed. For anemia, low hemoglobin or hematocrit is used, which includes all causes, such as genetic, inflammatory and nutritional deficiency (iron, folate, and vitamin B12). Further, hematocrit or hemoglobin may be directly measured in some states or taken from self-reports or medical records in other states. A state agency may use more, but not less, restrictive criteria (USDA/FNS, 2011).  Pregnant Women Trimester specific cutpoints for hemoglobin (g/dL) and hematocrit (%) respectively: 1st: 11.0 and 33.0; 2nd: 10.5 and 32.0; 3rd: 11.0 and 33.0 (CDC, 2009) Infants and Children 6 months to < 2 years: < 11 g/dL or < 32.9% for hemoglobin or hematocrit 2 to < 5 years: < 11.1 g/dL or < 33.3% for hemoglobin or hematocrit (CDC, 2009) CDC, 2009;IOM, 2009;CDC, 2011c;CDPH, 2015. WIC agencies can report multiple nutritional health risks for a participant (up to 10 in 2012) (USDA/FNS, 2013). In 2012, 40 percent of infants and 60 percent of children had only one reported nutritional risk (USDA/FNS, 2013), whereas 54 percent of breastfeeding women had three or more reported nutritional risks. The committee recognizes the value and importance to USDA-FNS of WIC programs reporting nutritional risk of participants using nationwide criteria. As a result of the multiple risk reporting and the use of multiple approaches for nutritional risk assessment, interpretation of the frequency of reported risks is challenging. Therefore, the committee cites only the five most frequently reported nutritional risks for WIC participants in 2012 (see Table 6-2). For all women participants, high weight for height (measures of overweight and obesity) (see Table 6-1) were the most common nutritional risk criteria reported. This criterion was reported for 53 to 54 percent participating women at enrollment. Inappropriate nutrition practices are the most commonly reported risk for infants (31 percent) and children (64 percent). Such inappropriate practices include feeding practices that compromise appropriate infant or child growth, health, or safety; risk associated with complementary feeding for those 4 to 23 months of age; failure to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) by those 2 years and older; and dietary supplement practices including inadequate, excessive, or inappropriate usage (see Table  6-1). For children, high weight for height/length (a measure of overweight or obesity) (see Table  6-1) was the second most commonly reported nutritional risk (24 percent). The committee considered using these reported nutritional risk data as one measure of the prevalence of these conditions in the WIC population but decided against using this approach. This is because of the multiple risk criteria reporting for an individual, the potential variance in actual measure or alternative approaches for some assessments, and variance among states in the use of directly measured versus self-reported values or values extracted from the medical record. The committee found that the variance introduced by these factors limited the utility of these data for assessment of prevalence. Instead, the committee relied upon national and regional (state or smaller WIC specific) evidence determining prevalence of health risks of interest (see Table  6-3). This section summarizes maternal nutrition-related health risks before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and after pregnancy and the effects of these risks on both maternal and infant health outcomes. Women who are not pregnant or postpartum are not categorically eligible for WIC participation, but the potential impact of key nutrition-related health risks before pregnancy are discussed, as they relate to pregnancy outcomes. Finally, health risks that can be affected by the composition of the food package are discussed for pregnant women in terms of maternal and fetal outcomes, postpartum women, and breastfeeding women."}, {"section_title": "Nutrition-Related Health Risks Before Pregnancy", "text": "The committee considered two nutrition-related health risks that occur before conception and can affect pregnancy outcomes, namely inappropriate weight status (i.e., overweight and obesity) and folate status.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high among WIC participants and U.S. women of reproductive age (see Table 6-3). PNSS data from 2011 indicated a 26 percent prevalence of overweight and 27.6 percent prevalence of obesity in WIC women (CDC, 2011a). The combined prevalence of obesity and overweight in U.S. reproductive-age women (20 to 39 years) was 55.8 percent in 2011-2012 (Flegal et al., 2012), with black or African-American and Hispanic females having higher rates of overweight and obesity compared to other groups (Flegal et al., 2012;Ogden et al., 2014).  b Overweight calculated by difference of reported combined overweight and obesity prevalence and obesity prevalence in women ages 20 to 39 years based on NHANES 2009-2010 (Flegal et al., 2012) c Age-adjusted prevalence of underweight in women ages 20 to 39 years from NHANES 2011-2012 (CDC, 2014a) d Low serum folate for women 15-44 years in NHANES 1999-2010 (Pfeiffer et al., 2012).

However, also following the fortification rule, the DGA began to emphasize intake of whole grains (USDA/HHS, 2000), for which folic acid fortification is not required. Subsequently, the 2009 changes in the WIC food packages included introduction of whole wheat bread (or allowable substitutions from other whole grain options), and required that WIC vendors ensure that half of cereal choices were made with whole grains. Although 40 percent of adult U.S. females consume folate primarily through mandatorily fortified enriched cereal grain products, another 16.8 percent consume it through voluntarily fortified ready-to-eat cereals as well as mandatorily fortified enriched grains (Yang et al., 2010). The committee noted that no fortification of corn masa flour (used to make tortillas) is required. Williams et al. (2015) reported that the prevalence of neural tube defects across the United States between 1995 and 2011was highest among Hispanics, many of whom commonly consume products made with corn masa flour. Available data on WIC participants from North Dakota (Watts et al., 2007), California (predominantly Hispanic participants [Leonard et al., 2014]), and Georgia (Dunlop et al., 2013) indicated that folate intakes were below recommendations. In Chapter 4 (see Table 4-20), the committee reports a higher prevalence (50 percent) of folate inadequacy among pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum WIC participants compared to low-income non-WIC participants in NHANES 2005-2008 or all low-income women in NHANES 2011-2012. However, the prevalence of folate deficiency based on serum folate 2 is very low (0.9 percent, Table 6-3) in reproductive age women in 1999-2010 NHANES (Pfeiffer et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "NUTRITION-RELATED HEALTH RISKS IN THE WIC POPULATION", "text": "6-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS"}, {"section_title": "Nutrition-Related Health Risks During Pregnancy", "text": "Nutrition-related health risks during pregnancy include inappropriate gestational weight gain, type 2 and gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, maternal iron deficiency and anemia, low maternal vitamin D, and low maternal choline intake (IOM, 2009).

Among WIC participants, the frequency of \"greater than ideal\" or \"less than ideal\" weight gain based on IOM (2009) guidelines 3 was 48 and 21 percent, respectively, in the 2011 PNSS survey (see Table 6-3; CDC, 2011a)."}, {"section_title": "Type 2 and Gestational Diabetes", "text": "Pre-existing type 2 diabetes or the development of gestational diabetes during pregnancy increases the risks of high birthweight, 4 birth defects, birth by cesarean delivery, high blood pressure and preeclampsia, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, and miscarriage or stillbirth (IOM, 2009;CDC, 2012a;Dean et al., 2014;Hartling et al., 2014). Prepregnancy obesity greatly increases the risk for development of gestational diabetes. However, emphasizing reduced energy intakes and weight loss may not be appropriate for pregnant women with diabetes because pregnancy requires achieving gestational weight gain goals (IOM, 2009). Instead, current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association for pregnant women with type 2 or gestational diabetes focus on tight glycemic control to reduce adverse outcomes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2014) noted, \"substituting lowglycemic load foods for higher-glycemic load foods may modestly improve glycemic control,\" but graded the evidence as a C indicating conflicting evidence supporting the recommendation (ADA, 2014). A recent systematic review reported that a diet with low glycemic index foods reduced maternal insulin and newborn weight, suggesting that a focus on the glycemic of foods may be useful for pregnant women with diabetes (Viana et al., 2014). The committee was not able to find data specific to the prevalence of gestational diabetes in the WIC population on a national level. Regional data available from Los Angeles County, California, indicated a prevalence of 12 percent in 2014. This prevalence varied with ethnicity (from 6.6 for African-Americans to 17.6 percent for Asian-Pacific Islanders) (Personal  2015). The national prevalence of gestational diabetes in 2010 was estimated to be as high as 9.2 percent (DeSisto et al., 2014).

Associated nutritional risk factors for preeclampsia include both pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity (Dean et al., 2014) and low pre-pregnant weight (Savitz et al., 2012). A Cochrane systematic review found that calcium supplementation greater than 1 g per day, especially in women consuming lowcalcium diets, was associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia (Hofmeyr et al., 2014). Although low vitamin D status, assessed by serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, known as 25(OH)D, levels, has been inconsistently associated with the risk for preeclampsia in the past, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, 2014) cited newer studies suggesting a possible relationship between vitamin D and reduced risk for preeclampsia.

Maternal iron deficiency and iron-deficient anemia are associated with several adverse maternal outcomes, including fatigue, weakness, and tachycardia (AHRQ, 2015).

The varying physiologic changes in iron stores and hemoglobin that occur across pregnancy require the use of multiple biomarkers and trimester-specific cut-points for evaluating iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia. Emerging evidence links obesity-induced inflammation with iron deficiency and anemia through its disturbances of iron absorption and sequestration (Becker et al., 2015). This was of interest to the committee because of the high prevalence of obesity in the WIC population. However, no data could be identified on obesityinduced, iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy. PNSS data indicate a prevalence for third trimester anemia from any cause of 34 percent in WIC respondents (CDC, 2011a). NHANES data from 1999-2006 indicated a prevalence of anemia in pregnant women of 5.4 percent (see Table 6-3; Mei et al., 2011). The committee was also interested in iron deficiency even though it is not a WICreported nutritional risk because of the importance of maternal iron status for early infant iron status. NHANES data from 1999-2006 indicate a prevalence for iron deficiency (based on total body iron) in pregnant women of 18 percent.

Potential adverse outcomes of low maternal vitamin D for the neonate include preterm delivery, small for gestational age, and neonatal bone health AHRQ, 2014). In a recent systematic review of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, Harvey et al. (2014) found only modest evidence (limited by its observational nature and lack of concordance with intervention trials) to support a relationship of maternal vitamin D status with birthweight or bone mass and judged the evidence insufficient to support vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. In its updated review on vitamin D and health outcomes, AHRQ (2014) found no consistent relationship between vitamin D or vitamin D supplementation and birthweight and conflicting observational evidence for relationships with preterm birth and small for gestational age (AHRQ, 2014).

Although choline appears to have positive effects on cognitive function and risks of chronic diseases later in life, the mechanisms are not fully understood (Jiang et al., 2014).

Low birth weight Low birth weight is defined as a birthweight less than 2,500 g and includes infants born either small for gestational age (less than 10th percentile birthweight for gestational age) or preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) (CDC, 2015). Being small for gestational age increases risks of perinatal mortality and morbidity, including metabolic alterations such as hypoglycemia and hypothermia (Saggese et al., 2013). Both conditions are known risk factors for developmental programming of adult health and disease (Martin-Gronert and Ozanne, 2012). Both prepregnancy underweight and lower than recommended gestational weight gain increase the risk of the child being born small for gestational age (IOM, 2009 sample of WIC participating women reports a low prevalence of prepregnancy underweight of 4.5 percent (see Table 6-3; CDC, 2011a), but a higher prevalence of \"less than ideal\" weight gain of 21 percent. As noted previously, preeclampsia also increases the risk of being small for gestational age (via its effect on intrauterine growth restriction (Lin et al., 2015). Although specific causes of preterm birth are unknown, undernutrition, prepregnancy underweight, and lack of specific nutrients may increase the risk (Bloomfield, 2011;Dean et al., 2014). In analysis of data from PRAMS, pregnancy underweight was associated with an increased risk of preterm labor (Shin and Song, 2014). Reduced risk of preterm delivery has been associated with consumption of several different protein-rich food sources, fruits, and some whole grains, and increased risk with consumption of primarily discretionary foods (Grieger et al., 2014). In addition, zinc inadequacy specifically may play a role in preterm birth; an evidence-based review of zinc supplementation in pregnancy was associated with a 14 percent relative reduction in preterm births in low-income women (Ota et al., 2015). The combined prevalence of babies born small for gestational age and preterm birth was 13.9 percent based on PNSS sample of infants born to WIC participating women (see Table 6-3). Of this, 10.5 percent of infants were born preterm and 3.4 percent were born small for gestational age (full-term, low birth weight) (CDC, 2011a). High birth weight High birthweight is defined as a birthweight greater than 4,000 g (CDC, 2009), which is greater than the 90th percentile among full-term infants. The term large for gestational age is more general and refers to a birthweight greater than the 90th percentile for gestational age. High birth weight increases the risk for morbidity in infants. As discussed previously, maternal prepregnancy overweight and obesity, excess weight gain above that recommended, and diabetes (type 2 or gestational) during pregnancy all increase the risk for the neonate to be large for gestational age and have a high birth weight. PNSS data indicate that 6.9 percent of WIC infants had a high birth weight in 2011 (see Table 6-3; CDC, 2011a)."}, {"section_title": "Nutrition-Related Health Risks in Postpartum Women", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Excessive Weight Retention", "text": "A key nutrition-related health risk among postpartum women is excessive maternal weight retention (IOM, 2009), generally defined as a body weight of more than 5 kg above prepregnancy weight at 6 months postpartum. Excessive postpartum weight retention increases the risk of obesity, even in women with normal prepregnancy BMI (Endres et al., 2015). Further, it increases the risk of an adverse cardiometabolic profile (Kew et al., 2014). In a national prospective cohort study of American women, nearly one-third who had a normal prepregnancy weight were overweight or obese at 1 year postpartum (Endres et al., 2015). Evidence is building on the importance of interconceptional nutrition and health on birth outcomes and long-term maternal health (IOM, 2009). A thorough evaluation of this evidence was beyond the scope of WIC and the scope of the committee's task. Excessive postpartum weight retention, however, could contribute to such interconceptional nutritional risk and adverse birth outcomes or longterm maternal health. Gestational weight gain above the recommended amounts (IOM, 2009;Endres et al., 2015) is associated with excessive postpartum weight retention and is greater for African-American than Hispanic women (IOM, 2009;Endres et al., 2015), white, or other ethnic groups (Endres et al., 2015). In the PRAMS 2002-2003 survey of U.S. women, approximately half of those surveyed had excessive gestational weight gain, with the highest rates in non-Hispanic multiple-race women (54 percent) and lowest rates in non-Hispanic Asian Women (33 percent) (IOM, 2009). Based on a national prospective cohort study (Endres et al., 2015), other factors associated with gestational weight gain above the 2009 IOM Guidelines include being of lowerincome, having a high school education, receiving public aid, being less likely to work outside of the home, not being in a relationship with the child's father and not having planned the pregnancy.

A systematic review reports a pooled risk ratio of 7.4 (based on 20 cohort studies) of developing type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes (Bellamy et al., 2009). This risk may in part depend on maternal ethnicity. Based on prevalence data, women from South Asia or South East Asia appear to have a higher risk of gestational diabetes compared to Caucasian, African-American, or Hispanic women (Yuen and Wong, 2015).

High weight for height (overweight and obesity) is the most prevalent nutritional risk criterion reported for breastfeeding WIC participants (see Table 6-2) (USDA/FNS, 2013). This section considers how overweight and obesity can adversely impact breastfeeding success. A recent systematic review found that prepregnancy obesity is associated with lower intention to breastfeed, lower initiation and shorter duration of breastfeeding . In addition, evidence has associated obesity with delayed lactogenesis II, the postpartum onset of copious milk production (Rasmussen and Kjolhede, 2004) and a lessadequate milk supply . The mechanisms underlying these adverse effects of obesity on breastfeeding are complex, not well understood, and include biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors (Rasmussen, 2007). In a study published after the systematic review by Turcksin and colleagues, obese women in the IFPS II sample did not differ in intent to breastfeed, but were less likely to ever breastfeed and more likely to cease breastfeeding earlier than normal-weight women . Another study published after this review found nearly twice the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding in primaparous, but not multiparous, obese women compared to women of normal weight (Kronborg et al., 2013). The authors suggested that interventions to enhance the duration of breastfeeding among obese women might best target those with \"little or no breastfeeding experience\" (Kronborg et al., 2013).

Low birth weight at term is associated with the developmental programming of several adult chronic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (Saggese et al., 2013). Emerging evidence, though controversial, has similarly associated rapid catch-up growth in infants with low birth weight and being small for gestational age, particularly excess weight-for-length gain (Belfort et al., 2013), with obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome as well as cardiometabolic risk, later in life (Jain, 2012). Being small for gestational age, but not low birth weight, was found in a systematic review to be modestly associated with childhood, but not adult, morbidity (Malin et al., 2015). High birth weight and being large for gestational age increase the risk for hypoglycemia in the neonate (Rozance, 2014) and the risk for adult chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (Martin-Gronert and Ozanne, 2012).

In its review of the evidence, the committee was mindful of the complexity of growth and its implications for interpreting commonly used anthropometric measures of growth.\nAs discussed above for infants, inappropriate growth patterns in children indicative of either undernutrition (e.g., underweight, short stature) or overnutrition (accelerated patterns such as obesity and overweight) are of concern because of both their immediate and long-term adverse health effects. Overall, evidence exists for both slowed and accelerated growth patterns among children participating in WIC."}, {"section_title": "Failure to Thrive", "text": "Failure to thrive represents inappropriately slowed growth of both length and weight (Grissom, 2013). Although failure to thrive is sometimes defined clinically as being less than the 5th percentile of weight-for-age on multiple occasions or a deceleration of growth that crosses two major percentiles, it is more accurately defined by a combination of anthropometric growth parameters (Cole and Lanham, 2011). Failure to thrive generally presents before 18 months of age. Failure to thrive may result in developmental delays, recurrent severe infections and cardiac abnormalities, in addition to growth failure. The risk of failure to thrive is increased by low birth weight and can result from inadequate caloric intake, impaired caloric absorption, or excessive caloric expenditure (Cole et al., 2011). In the PedNSS nationally representative sample (CDC, 2011b), 3.5 percent of infants and children less than 5 years of age were underweight, as defined by being less than the fifth percentile of weight for length or stature, which is another clinical definition of failure to thrive.

Having high weight-for-length both at birth and at 6 months has been shown to increase the risk of obesity at 3 years by 4 percent (Taveras et al., 2009). Infant obesity, when defined not just as high weight for length, but also in terms of excess subcutaneous fat, was associated with delayed motor development in low-income African-American infants 3-18 months of age (Slining et al., 2010). Both infant and early childhood obesity and overweight are influenced by early infant feeding practices. In the 2008 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS), energy intakes were higher than those generally recommended for infants for both the 0-6 and 6-11 month age ranges (Saavedra et al., 2013). In a systematic review, Weng et al. (2012) reported that breastfeeding reduces the risk of childhood overweight by 15 percent and cited evidence that early childhood overweight is associated with early introduction of complementary foods. Adair (2008) found an association of early childhood obesity with the inappropriate introduction of complementary foods, such as the bottle feeding of infant cereal mixed with formula. Early childhood obesity has not been linked, however, to intakes of any specific complementary foods or food groups (Grote and Theurich, 2014).

However, these studies examined the absolute rate of weight gain rather than change in weight-for-age (WAZ) or weight-for-length (WLZ) Z-scores.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that iron supplementation (oral 1 mg/kg/day) in exclusively breast-fed infants begin at 4 months of age to prevent iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia (AAP, 2014). Older infants 6 to less than 12 months of age Human milk alone provides inadequate quantities of iron for infants over 6 months (AAP, 2014;L\u00f6nnerdal et al., 2015). Recommended iron intakes increase at 7 months to 11 mg per day (a Recommended Dietary Allowance [RDA]) from a low of 0.27 mg per day (an AI) for infants 6 months and younger . After 6 months, this additional iron is needed to meet growing iron demands for tissue accretion, increases in tissue and storage iron, increases in hemoglobin, obligatory iron losses, and neurodevelopment (Berglund and Domell\u00f6f, 2014). The AAP recommends that complementary foods rich in iron (red meats and vegetables rich in iron) be introduced early to help meet this demand (AAP, 2014). Further, the AAP recommends that oral iron supplementation is appropriate for infants 6 to 12 months of age who are not consuming the recommended amount of iron from formula and complementary foods (AAP, 2014). An AHRQ systematic review (AHRQ, 2015) noted that, despite some evidence for improvement of hematological values following iron supplementation, evidence for improved clinical health outcomes was lacking. Low birth weight infants may be at greater risk for iron deficiency because of lower iron stores and more rapid catch-up growth, but the evidence to support iron supplementation specifically in infants with low birth weight is limited (Long et al., 2012). Boys may be at more risk for iron deficiency based on reports of poorer iron status biomarkers (L\u00f6nnerdal et al., 2015). Emerging evidence also suggests potential adverse effects of excess iron, particularly from iron supplementation, on linear growth in iron-replete older infants (L\u00f6nnerdal et al., 2015). The prevalence of anemia in children 6 -11 months is 18 percent in 2011 nationally representative sample in PedNSS (CDC, 2011b). The committee was unable to identify any national prevalence data on iron deficiency in infants less than 12 months of age.\nIron remains important for growth and cognitive development and function in children 1-5 years of age, with the recommended iron intake decreasing from 11 mg per day in older infants to 7 mg per day in 1-3-year-old children and then increasing again to 10 mg per day in 4-5 year old children ). These changes in recommended iron intake reflect changes in growth and the steadily larger mass of the older child. Despite the importance of iron, Thompson et al.'s (2014) systematic review reported a lack of data on the effects of iron supplementation on anemia and cognitive development in children 2-5 years old. Anemia Low hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration is indicative of all causes of anemia, and varies with age and ethnicity among U.S. children. The 2011 PedNSS reported a nationwide prevalence of anemia of 14.4 percent (ages less than 5 years) (see Table 6-4). Prevalence was higher in younger children ages 1 to less than 3 years (18.1 to 15.6 percent) than older children ages 3 to less than 5 (10.5 percent).

Although human milk has a low zinc concentration, it provides the necessary zinc for breastfed infants for approximately the first 6 months (AAP, 2014). After this time, foods containing zinc are emphasized as part of complementary feeding (AAP, 2014). Older infants 7 to 11 months of age For infants older than 6 months, human milk alone provides inadequate quantities of zinc (AAP, 2014). Older infants obtain approximately 90 percent of their required zinc intake from complementary foods (Krebs, 2007). The AI for infants less than 6 months of age is 2 mg per day. For older infants (6 to less than 12 months), there is an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for zinc of 2.5 mg per day . Infants, particularly those with low birth weight, are at risk for zinc deficiency and have limited adaptive homeostatic mechanisms for modest zinc intakes (Krebs, 2007;Krebs et al., 2014). Also at risk are older infants who are breastfed and receive plant-based complementary foods low in zinc or with less bioavailable forms. Complementary meat baby foods provide higher content and bioavailability of zinc than non-fortified plant foods (Krebs, 2007). USDA-FNS does not report on zinc intake of older infants who are participating in WIC. Relatively few older infants (less than 6 percent) in the 2008 FITS consumed inadequate zinc, with a majority (68 percent) consuming more than the UL (5 mg per day) from foods and beverages, primarily infant formulas and fortified infant cereals .

Also unclear is whether either prenatal or postnatal supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids improves visual acuity. A study in primates suggests that prenatal deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids can result in some limitations in visual acuity of offspring at 3 years of age . However, in a randomized control study of maternal prenatal supplementation of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, it did not enhance visual acuity in offspring at 4 months of age (Smithers et al., 2011). No evidence could be identified on the status of omega-3 fatty acids or the visual acuity of the WIC population.

Therefore, the committee examined national and regional evidence on iron deficiency in WIC and U.S. children aged 1 to 3 years available from two studies, which assessed iron deficiency using multiple biomarkers, as required. Some caution is needed in interpreting the results of both studies because of possible selection bias (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of selection bias). The first study analyzed nationally representative data for 960 children from the NHANES 1999-2002(Brotanek, 2015; see Table 6-4). Overall, iron deficiency 5 was 8 percent and declined with age from 11 percent at 1 year to 5.6 percent at 3 years (Brotanek, 2015). The second study examined iron deficiency in 350 children aged 1-3 years from two California counties (Schneider, 2005) and reported an overall prevalence of iron deficiency of 16 percent. A number of factors influenced iron deficiency in the two studies. Discordant results were reported for ethnicity. Brotanek (2015) report a higher prevalence of iron deficiency in Hispanic children (12 percent) than in white and African-American children (6 percent), but Schneider (2005) did not find an association of Hispanic ethnicity with iron deficiency. 6 The two studies differ slightly in the biomarkers used to assess iron deficiency and the proportion of Hispanic children (40 percent in Brotanek's study and 25 percent Hispanic and Latino in Schneider's study). Other factors also influenced iron deficiency in Brotanek's study including language, obesity, and food insecurity status of the household. However, poverty did not affect the prevalence of iron deficiency in 1-3-year-old children (Brotanek, 2015). The relationship of WIC participation to iron deficiency also differed in the two studies, one of which examined participation of the mother during pregnancy (Schneider, 2005) and the other examined participation of the child (Brotanek, 2015). Schneider (2005) reported an increased risk (2.6 times) of iron deficiency in children 1-3 years in California whose mothers did not participate in WIC compared to those whose mothers did participate in WIC while pregnant.

Several of these guidelines are currently or potentially applicable to the WIC food package. For pregnant women, the two primary foodborne illness concerns are listeriosis (caused by exposure to Listeria monocytogenes) and toxoplasmosis (caused by exposure to Toxoplasma gondii) (FSIS, 2013). These pathogens can also be transmitted to a developing fetus. Listeriosis, for example, can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and fetal death, and may have consequences after birth. Raw and unwashed fruits and vegetables carry some risk of transmission of both pathogens, but washing or cooking vegetables greatly reduces these risks (USDA/FNS, 2015). Although unpasteurized soft cheeses also carry some risk of L. monocytogenes and should be avoided, pasteurized, harder, and processed cheeses are appropriate for consumption in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Other foods that carry a higher risk of Listeria contamination include luncheon meats and hot dogs. In pregnancy, raw meat, seafood, and eggs should be avoided. Infants should not consume raw foods, unpasteurized dairy foods, or juice, and honey should not be consumed before 12 months of age (FDA, 2014). Although liquids (e.g., ready-to-feed formulas) are generally sterilizable, powder formulas are typically not sterile and have a higher probability of containing pathogens, so care must be taken with home preparation to avoid inadvertent contamination (AAP, 2014). Expressed human milk must be handled properly to maintain its quality and ensure that it is safe for infant consumption.

Following the release of the report, strong consumer and scientific interest led the FDA to investigate further. In 2012 and 2013, the FDA amended its regulations such that the use of BPA-based coatings was no longer permitted in baby bottles, sippy cups, and infant formula packaging. These amendments were based only on petitions filed by the American Chemistry Council and a Congressperson which asserted that the use of BPA in these products had been abandoned in industry practice (FDA, 2015b).

Examples of unintentional contaminants include dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). Foodborne environmental contaminants are further classified by their biochemical profile.

Meats and full-fat dairy foods contribute a majority of the total dietary intake of dioxins and DLCs, whereas fish and shellfish are the greatest contributors of PCBs (Travis and Hattemer-Frey, 1991;Roeder et al., 1998). Fetuses are exposed to lipophilic contaminants through placental transfer of these substances; their body burden can be equivalent to about one-fifth of what it is for the mother (Koopman-Esseboom, 1994;Abraham et al., 1996). Additional exposure occurs through human milk. However, the concentration of PCBs, dioxins, and DLCs in human milk decreases throughout the period of lactation (Lorber and Phillips, 2002). Further, because of the rapid turnover of fatty tissue throughout infancy, children who were breastfed did not differ from those who were formula fed in total body burden of polychlorinated lipophilic contaminants (Patandin et al., 1997;Lorber and Phillips, 2002). Levels of lipophilic contaminants in the environment, and thus in the food supply, have declined in recent years, likely as an outcome of stricter environmental regulation of emissions. Further, there is a high level of uncertainty in determining health risks from exposure because of the variable toxicity of different congeners. Nevertheless, a recommendation to federal nutrition assistance programs to include low-fat and skim milk for children over 2 years of age was made to reduce potential exposure and body burden of these contaminants, particularly among young girls before entering their child-bearing years . This recommendation was incorporated into the 2014 WIC food package final rule in which only 1 percent or skim milk was permitted for individuals 2 years and older as a means of limiting fat intake (USDA/FNS, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Heavy-Metal Contaminants", "text": "Mercury, specifically methylated (organic) mercury, is the heavy-metal contaminant of greatest concern to human health, with pregnant women at the greatest risk.

Given that WIC provides support for over half of all U.S. births, the WIC program plays a key role in influencing infant feeding decisions, particularly among low-income women. In fact, more than any other entity, WIC comes closest to having a nationwide coordinated breastfeeding program in place. At the same time, paradoxically, the WIC program engages heavily in the distribution of infant formula. WIC infant formula accounted for between 57 and 68 percent of all formula sold in the United States in 2004-2006 (the most recent years for which a published estimate was available) (USDA/ERS, 2010). hired by the program (i.e., certified by the International Lactation Consultant Association), and the provision of breast pumps to women. 2 WIC has been actively protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding since 1989, when Congress enacted the first of a series of laws affecting WIC breastfeeding activities.

In 1992, Congress required that the USDA establish a national breastfeeding promotion program and provided various means by which this could be funded. Two years later, Congress passed the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act, not only requiring that state WIC agencies spend $21 for each pregnant and breastfeeding woman in support of breastfeeding promotion, but also that state agencies collect (and report every 2 years) data on the incidence and duration of breastfeeding among WIC participants. 3 In 1998, the 105th Congress authorized WIC agencies to use food funds for the purchase or rental of breast pumps. 4"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE SOURCE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING", "text": "It is widely accepted that breastfeeding is beneficial for both mother and infant (AAP, 2014). An abundant literature documents short-term benefits of human milk for infants in particular. In infants, beyond the essential nutritional value, human milk contains numerous protective factors that help prevent infectious disease (Gertosio et al., 2015). But the long-term effects for both infants and mothers are less well studied. This section summarizes available data on the long-term health benefits of breastfeeding in infants and mothers, with a focus on data specifically relevant to the WIC population. Given that it is unethical to assign infants at random to be breastfed or not, the committee recognized that most of the studies in which the effects of breastfeeding on health outcomes of the mother and her child have been evaluated are observational. They therefore have the wellknown weaknesses characteristic of these types of studies. In particular, these studies are not suitable for causal inference. In addition, interpretation of the findings summarized here is limited by the variability across studies and among subjects in duration and intensity of breastfeeding. However, there is strong biological plausibility for an association between breastfeeding and several, but not all, infant health outcomes studied are well as some maternal health outcomes. Although several recent studies suggest that association of breastfeeding with health outcomes including weight or obesity (Cope and Allison, 2008;Smithers et al., 2015) or cognition (Colen and Ramey, 2014; Jenkins and Foster, 2015), are not significant, a large body of evidence supports these associations (Horta et al., 2015a, b)."}, {"section_title": "Infant Benefits of Breastfeeding", "text": "The WHO (2013) systematic review of the literature reported several long-term health benefits associated with breastfeeding, including decreased risk of obesity, particularly in high- income countries. Additionally, infants who are primarily breastfed have been shown to be at lower risk for type 2 diabetes, although the association is not necessarily causal and may be related to the lower incidence of childhood obesity among breastfed infants (Ip et al., 2007;WHO, 2013;Horta et al., 2015a). Additional evidence suggests that breastfeeding is associated with lower systolic blood pressure, but not with cholesterol concentrations or the incidence of cardiovascular disease (WHO, 2013;Aguilar Cordero et al., 2015). Breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk for many other health complications as well, including childhood leukemia, non-specific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, sudden infant death syndrome, and atopic dermatitis (Ip et al., 2007;Amitay and Keinan-Boker, 2015). Additionally, breastfed infants may have increased protection from asthma later in childhood (Lodge et al., 2015). Finally, Tham et al. (2015) reported that breastfeeding for up to 12 months may be protective against the development of early childhood dental caries, but data were inconclusive for such an association after 12 months of age. Available data regarding cognitive outcomes for breastfed infants are mixed (Ip et al., 2007;WHO, 2013). In a recent systematic review, Horta et al. (2015b) reported that breastfeeding was positively associated with intelligence test outcomes as late as 19 years of age, after adjusting for maternal intelligence. Meta-regression performed as part of this meta-analysis confirmed that the association between breastfeeding and intelligence remained when only the studies with the strongest research designs were included. The strength of the evidence varies for each of the associations described above, and is strongest for reduced obesity, type 2 diabetes, and childhood leukemia.

Lastly, they found no evidence to suggest an association of breastfeeding with osteoporosis (Ip et al., 2007). In their recent review, Chowdhury et al.

However, there was no statistically significant difference in child weight comparing those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. A single study showed that children who were breastfed for more than 6 months had lower odds of rapid infant weight gain (Edmunds et al., 2014). In addition to weight status, another primary focus of many of these WIC-focused studies was iron status. However, small sample sizes and heterogeneity in iron status measures, analytical approaches, and age ranges of the children studied make it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between breastfeeding and iron status among WIC children. For maternal health outcomes, the committee identified two studies that reported less maternal weight retention in mothers who breastfed their infants for more than 20 weeks (Krause et al., 2010;\u00d8stbye et al., 2010).

A number of social, cultural, and structural barriers to breastfeeding in the WIC population have been reported, including the lack of prenatal, perinatal, and postpartum breastfeeding support (e.g., support from health care providers, family members, and partners); the need to return to work and lack of access to pumps, time, and inadequate pumping facilities at worksites; lack of child care; social norms regarding breastfeeding in public; and promotion of a sexualized body image in western society (Hurst 2007;Heinig et al., 2009;Mickens et al., 2009;Stolzer, 2010;Hedberg, 2013;Spencer et al., 2015). Additionally, one topic that has been widely discussed among researchers, advocates, and other WIC stakeholders has been the provision of formula in WIC. Research suggests that the availability of formula may contribute to lower breastfeeding adoption and duration in women enrolled in the program (Varela et al., 2011;Hedberg, 2013). However, as noted by Jiang et al. (2010), a major challenge to measuring the causal effect of WIC on breastfeeding (and the causal effects of WIC on many outcomes, as described in Chapter 3) is the issue of selective enrollment. WIC participants tend to be more socio-economically disadvantaged than eligible nonparticipants, which may partially explain their lower tendency to breastfeed (Gundersen, 2005;7-10 REVIEW OF WIC FOOD PACKAGES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS Jiang et al., 2010). Chapter 3 includes a detailed discussion of the challenge posed by selective enrollment (\"selection bias\") when analyzing WIC-specific data. As mentioned in Chapter 2, studies of breastfeeding in the WIC population have shown that the prevalence varies among cultural groups, with the greatest differences appearing at the point of initiation. Although African-Americans face similar barriers to breastfeeding that other women in the United States face, evidence suggests that they face these barriers to a greater extent (Spencer and Grassley, 2013). Sparks (2011) found that African-American women were significantly less likely to initiate breastfeeding compared with women from other racial/ethnic groups, but this was no longer true when the model was adjusted for covariates. Several studies have indicated that African-American women receive less encouragement to breastfeed from physicians and WIC counselors (Beal et al., 2003;Johnson et al., 2015;Spencer et al., 2015). Evidence suggests that African-American women experience unique historical, cultural, and structural barriers to initiating and sustaining breastfeeding. Several studies have noted that as compared to white women, African-American women are less likely to receive breastfeeding information and support from their health care providers (Spencer and Grassley, 2013) and WIC providers specifically (Beal et al., 2003). Additionally, historical images of African-American women serving as wet nurses for white children during slavery (Gross et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2015) as well as existing perceptions of African-American women as \"strong\" or \"hypersexual\" may also impede the support they received for breastfeeding both within and outside their African-American community (Gross et al., 2015;Spencer et al., 2015;. These and other barriers suggest a need for implementing multi-level approaches to promote and alleviate breastfeeding disparities among WIC and WIC-eligible women. In addition to barriers to breastfeeding, researchers have identified multiple factors that facilitate breastfeeding initiation among both WIC participants and low-income women more generally. These include support from healthcare providers, breastfeeding promotion and assistance at the hospital, use of breastfeeding peer counselors, inclusion of lactation services in existing community-based programs, and supportive breastfeeding policies at the state and local levels CDC, 2014a;Lilleston et. al., 2015). However, the effectiveness of these approaches may vary among different racial and ethnic groups (Smith-Gagen et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Breastfeeding", "text": "In its literature search, the committee identified many barriers to breastfeeding among WIC women (see Table 7-5) and in low-income populations generally.

Several factors related to returning to work have been identified as barriers to breastfeeding, including anticipated lack of acceptance by coworkers (Rojjanasirat and Sousa, 2010; Hedberg, 2013). Onsite lactation is another challenge. A goal of Healthy People 2020 is to ensure that 38 percent of employers provide an onsite lactation room (HHS, 2015), starting from a 2009 baseline of 25 percent. To help reach this goal, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care act amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) required employers to provide a time and location to express human milk for 1 year after PROMOTION, MOTIVATION, AND SUPPORT OF BREASTFEEDING WITH THE WIC FOOD PACKAGES 7-11 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS the child's birth (DOL, 2011).

Education in the hospital was also reported as an incentive to breastfeed . On an individual level, existing perceptions (cultural or otherwise) of breastfeeding as beneficial was associated with an increased likelihood of breastfeeding (Heining et al., 2006;Vaaler et al., 2010;. The provision of formula through WIC appears to be a major incentive for women to enroll in the program, but it competes as an incentive with the enhanced food package offered to breastfeeding mothers (see Chapter 2 for a review of relevant behavioral economics principles). Unfortunately, women enrolled in WIC or who are considering enrollment in the program perceive the formula feeding package to be of higher economic value than the enhanced breastfeeding package Jensen and Labbok, 2011). For many women, the program delivers conflicting messages by supporting breastfeeding while at the same time distributing infant formula at no cost to participants (Holmes, 2009).

The six studies, all of which used a repeated cross-sectional design, are summarized here. Based on a time-series analysis using data from three sources PRAMS data covering 19 states, 2004 data from 50 states plus Washington, DC, and 2007-2010 PedNSS data), Joyce and Reeder (2015) found that, between 2004 and 2010, breastfeeding outcomes improved among both WIC and low income non-WIC participants. The trends in improvements in \"any breastfeeding\" and \"breastfeeding for at least 4 weeks\" were similar in both groups, and the increased prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months was more pronounced among low-income non-WIC participants.

While this decrease corresponded to an increase in the selection of the full breastfeeding package, an increase in the formula package and total amount of formula was also seen. Breastfeeding initiation did not appear to be affected by the revised food packages. An important limitation of this study is the short periods for the pre-and for post-implementation observations. The committee also considered four regional studies. In a study conducted in New York State,  reported an increase in the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation from 72.2 percent in 2008 to 77.5 percent in 2011. Similarly, two studies reported improved breastfeeding outcomes among WIC participants living in Los Angeles Langellier et al., 2014), with both ever-breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months increasing between 2005 to 2008 and 2011 (Langellier et al., 2014). Finally, in a small pre-post cross-sectional study conducted in central Texas, Thornton et al. (2014) found small increases in both the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation and duration among WIC infants. Schultz et al. (2015) included the work of several of these research groups Wilde et al., 2012;Langellier et al., 2014) in their recent systematic review and also concluded the results of these studies were mixed. Importantly, five of the aforementioned studies were based on pre/post or time series designs without low-income, non-WIC participants as a comparison group. The only study that included such a comparison group, Joyce and Reeder (2015), concluded that, because improvements in breastfeeding outcomes among WIC participants were similar to those of nonparticipants, the changes they observed in the WIC population were unlikely to be explained by the 2009 food package changes.

In another study in which the mean duration of breastfeeding among WIC participants and non-participants was compared, Jiang et al. (2010) reported different results between two statistical analyses. Their multiple regression analysis showed that the adjusted mean breastfeeding duration was significantly longer in non-WIC participants than in WIC participants (3.88 vs. 3.35 months). In their propensity matching analysis, they did not find a significant difference in the mean breastfeeding duration between WIC participants and nonparticipants. Inasmuch as propensity matching methods can balance baseline characteristics of the two-matched groups to reduce the self-selection bias, the difference between results obtained by using these two approaches indicates that baseline demographic differences, rather than WIC participation, are more likely to explain the differences in the breastfeeding duration."}, {"section_title": "Exclusivity", "text": "Based on an analysis of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), Ziol-Guest and Hernandez (2010) found no significant association between entry into WIC (at any trimester of pregnancy) and exclusive breastfeeding.

There exists no generally accepted definition of medical fragility. Examples include an infant with failure to thrive and an adult with a wired jaw. Individual states have policies regarding who may qualify under WIC. Nutrition plays a pivotal role in the health of medically fragile individuals, especially children, with appropriate nutrition preventing or mitigating significant neurodevelopmental deficiencies and being potentially life-saving. Depending on an individual's specific medical needs, food package III can be tailored by including non-contract 1 infant formulas with unique nutritional composition or WIC-eligible medical foods (see Box 8-1). As detailed in the interim rule and verified in the final rule, individuals receiving food package III may be issued 455 ounces of WIC formula 2 per month, but only in addition to (not instead of) the maximum allowance of all other foods in the package appropriate for their life-stage (USDA/FNS, 2014). Exceptions to these food package regulations may be made as necessary and as dictated by the final rule (USDA/FNS, 2014). 3 There are no publicly available data for estimating how many WIC participants nationwide receive food package III. A report detailing electronic benefit transfer (EBT) redemption patterns in Kentucky, Michigan, and Nevada indicated that, on average, 1.5 percent of WIC families in these states were issued a medical food of some kind, although not necessarily through food package III . Only 54 percent of these families redeemed the entire package and 14 percent redeemed none of the package. Non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic white families were more likely to redeem the entire package than non-Hispanic black families, and 72 percent of families in urban areas redeemed the full benefit compared to 53 percent in large rural areas .

Exempt infant formula is always non-contract.

When allergy manifests as disease, those diseases, such as dermatitis, asthma and rhinitis, are commonly referred to as \"atopic\" diseases. Researchers still do not understand the underlying factors that cause atopic disease, although several theories have been put forth. Prominent among these is dysbiosis of the microbiome (Brown et al., 2013), which at one time was known as the \"hygiene hypothesis\" (Strachan, 1989). It has also been suggested that how and when foods are introduced into the diet of infants influences the risk of food allergy in particular (NIAID, 2010). Food allergy has been defined as an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food; the specific food component eliciting the immune response and causing symptoms is the allergen (NIAID, 2010). Proper diagnosis of allergy is important because, in 50 to 90 percent of cases, symptoms presumed to be associated with food allergy are not related (NIAID, 2010). Food allergies can be either IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated. The symptoms of IgEmediated food allergy include cutaneous, ocular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and other miscellaneous effects. Diagnoses of IgE-mediated allergies are made using food elimination diets and oral food challenges (i.e., symptoms resolve when the causative food is removed from the diet and recur following an oral challenge). Non-IgE-mediated immunologic reactions to food include food protein-induced enteropathy, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, allergic contact dermatitis, and systemic contact dermatitis. Some, but not all, non-IgEmediated allergies can be diagnosed using food elimination diet and oral food challenges. Several expert groups have made still-evolving recommendations for prevention of food allergy. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended delaying the introduction of allergenic foods in infants at higher risk of allergy development (AAP, 2000). However, subsequently, the AAP reported insufficient data to document a protective effect of any dietary intervention beyond 4 to 6 months of age (Greer et al., 2008). Likewise, a committee convened by the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommended that infants be breastfed for 4 to 6 months to prevent food allergy but that the introduction of solid foods not be delayed beyond 4 to 6 months, regardless of whether they are potentially allergenic (NIAID, 2010). Based on accumulating evidence ; see also Alexander, REVIEW OF WIC FOOD PACKAGES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS al., 2010), the NIH committee further recommended hydrolyzed 4 (and not soy) formula for the prevention of allergy in non-breastfed or supplemented breastfed at-risk infants (NIAID, 2010). In accordance with these earlier recommendations, in 2013 the American Academy of Allergy recommended breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months, use of a hydrolyzed protein infant formula for atrisk infants who are not breastfed, and the introduction of solid foods at 4 to 6 months of age (Fleischer et al., 2013). 5 In addition to recommending the delayed introduction of allergenic foods, AAP (2000) also recommended avoidance of some foods by breastfeeding mothers. However, authors of a recent systematic review of maternal intake during pregnancy or lactation did not find any conclusive evidence of an effect of maternal diet on atopy in infants (Netting et al., 2014). Similarly, the NIH committee referenced above recommended against maternal restriction of allergenic foods during pregnancy and lactation as a means of reducing the likelihood of allergy development in infants (NIAID, 2010). Despite these ever-evolving recommendations, the prevalence of reported food allergy has continued to rise. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data indicate that, among children ages 0 to 17 years, reports of food allergies increased approximately 50 percent between 1997 and 2011 (CDC, 2013). The prevalence of food allergies appears to be higher in non-Hispanics and in families with higher household incomes (CDC, 2013). The most common food allergies are allergies to peanut, tree nuts, seafood, milk, and hen's egg (NIAID, 2010), although wheat, fish, and soy allergies are also relevant to the WIC food packages. There is some evidence that early introduction of peanut protein reduces the likelihood of peanut allergy (Du Toit et al., 2008Gruchalla and Sampson, 2015). Based on this evidence, in September 2015 AAP issued interim guidance for the early (between 4 and 11 months of age) introduction of peanut protein to high-risk infants under care of a healthcare provider (Fleischer et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "WIC food package options for individuals with food allergies", "text": "In sum, with respect to food allergy, the committee's review of the literature indicated that most experts recommend breastfeeding for approximately 6 months and the provision of hydrolyzed protein formula for non-breastfed infants who are at risk of developing allergy. In accordance with these recommendations, hydrolyzed protein infant formulas for allergy at-risk infants are available to formula-fed WIC infants with a physician's prescription. Because it is not fully understood how introduction of solid foods in the first year of life might influence the development of allergy, there is no currently defined role for WIC-provided infant foods in allergy prevention. For children and adults, the current WIC packages include substitutions for allergenic foods so individuals with most major food allergies can be accommodated (see Table 8-1). However, as noted in the table, there is no current substitution in the case of an egg or fish allergy. Importantly, WIC offers participants with food allergies a number of educational resources to support adherence to dietary restrictions (USDA/FNS, 2015a)."}, {"section_title": "MEETING DIVERSE DIETARY NEEDS AND PREFERENCES 8-5", "text": "PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS"}, {"section_title": "Celiac Disease", "text": "Approximately 1 in 200 individuals living in the United States have celiac disease, an immune-mediated inflammation of the small bowel caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten (a protein found in wheat and other grains) and related proteins (Guandalini and Assiri, 2014;Mooney et al., 2014). The disorder is neither IgE-nor IgG-mediated. A diagnosis is based on histology of a small bowel biopsy. A recent meta-analysis that included data from over 4 million women indicated that women with celiac disease have an increased risk of obstetrical complications (Saccone et al., 2015). These included preeclampsia and preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, low birthweight, or a small for gestational age infant (Saccone et al., 2015). An Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) systematic review indicated that women with undiagnosed celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (evidence graded as fair) . Delayed introduction of wheat proteins to the diet was once thought to prevent or delay the onset of the disease (Norris et al., 2005). However, results from a recent study and metaanalysis suggest that the time to first introduction of gluten into the diets of infants is not an independent risk factor for developing celiac disease by 5 years of age (Aronsson et al., 2015;Szajewska et al., 2015). Additional research may be needed on the optimal timing and amount of introduced foods containing gluten (Lebwohl et al., 2015). Treatment for celiac disease includes lifelong avoidance of wheat, barley, and rye. Individuals with symptoms for celiac disease should be tested and, if positive, receive detailed nutritional counseling on gluten avoidance, because even milligram levels in the diet can have severe long-term health consequences (Rubio-Tapia et al., 2013). Because gluten-free grains (e.g., rice, potato flour, tapioca flour, corn) are not typically fortified, gluten-free diets may be low in iron and folate, as well as dietary fiber (Thompson, 2000).

A vegetarian diet does not include animal flesh foods (i.e., meat, fish, seafood), but does include other animal products (e.g., eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt), whereas a vegan diet excludes all animal foods and products. In 2015, the DGAC developed and evaluated a Healthy Vegetarian Food Pattern and found that it can meet nutrient intake needs for individuals ages 2 years and older . Individuals who consume a vegan diet should pay particular attention to their intakes of vitamins  PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS B12 and calcium, but their requirement for these nutrients can be met by consuming fortified foods . If no eggs are consumed (as in a vegan diet), intake of eicosapentaneoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) may be low . The position of AND is that both vegetarian and vegan diets are not only adequate, but may promote the prevention or aid in the treatment of certain health conditions . The WIC food package includes several foods that by nature are compliant with vegetarian and vegan diets, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, peanut butter, and grains. However, there are currently no vegetarian/vegan substitutions for fish and no vegan substitutions for eggs or cheese (see Table 8-1). The proportion of the WIC population that prefers these types of diets is unknown, but 2012 estimates indicated that approximately 5 percent of Americans considered themselves vegetarian and 2 percent vegan (Newport, 2012). With respect to infant feeding practices, the AAP supports the provision of soy proteinbased formulas in cases where an infant's caretaker prefers to provide a vegetarian diet (as well as in cases where an infant does not tolerate cow's milk formula) (Bhatia et al., 2008;AAP, 2014). A potential nutrition-related health challenge for these infants is ensuring adequate iron intake. As described in Chapter 6, the introduction of complementary foods to infants at approximately 6 months of age is recommended, in part, to ensure adequate iron intake, with AAP (2014) encouraging early introduction of red meats and other foods rich in iron. A vegetarian or vegan substitution for infant meat is not currently permitted in the WIC food packages.

Very generally, for Kosher diets, meats must be prepared a certain way, animal products must come from Kosher-prepared animals, and packaged foods must be Kosher-certified. Fruits and vegetables are considered inherently Kosher. To be considered Halal, meats must be prepared in a particular way and milk and foods prepared from milk must come from Halal animals. With respect to the WIC food packages, although federal regulations do not specify any requirement for availability of food that meet the needs of individuals who follow either of these diets, states have the option to accommodate these individuals.

Household food security status was assigned based on the number of food insecurity indicators reported. Rates of food insecurity have been relatively stable since 2008. As detailed in the most recent assessment, 14.0 percent of all U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in 2014. Households with children were at higher risk. About one in five (19.9 percent) households with children under age 6 experienced food insecurity. Food insecurity was higher among African-Americans (26.1 percent) and Hispanic (22.4 percent) households, compared to white, non-Hispanic households (10.5 percent).

Food insecurity may delay infant and toddler development (Rose-Jacobs et al., 2008) and have adverse effects on children's academic performance and social skills (Jyoti et al., 2005). Specific to pregnancy outcomes, food insecurity has been associated with pregravid obesity, higher gestational weight gain, higher adequacy of weight gain ratio, low birth weight and gestational diabetes (Ivers and Cullen, 2011). Recent studies conducted among the WIC population have found that those who live in food-insecure households score lower on mental health scales (Matthews et al., 2010), have lower diet quality (Kropf et al., 2007;Mathews et al., 2010), and are more likely to exhibit child feeding styles that are associated with development of childhood obesity (Gross et al., 2012).WIC children who live in food-insecure households may be at higher risk of being overweight or obese (Metallinos-Katsaras et al., 2011."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between WIC Participation and Food Insecurity", "text": "Inasmuch as the WIC program is only one policy instrument used in the national effort to reduce or prevent food insecurity in the United States, it is challenging to evaluate its independent contribution to this effort.

The committee reviewed the literature to identify studies that examined the link between WIC participation and food insecurity while accounting for selection or other possible sources of bias to the estimated effects of WIC. Only one such study was identified .

However, the relationship between food security and participation in nutrition assistance programs such as WIC is complex, and is difficult to capture in the cross-sectional survey that is used to monitor food security in the United States. Inasmuch as WIC provides food and nutrition education, one might expect that households that participate in WIC would have lower rates of food insecurity than comparable households that do not participate in the program. On the other hand, if food insecurity leads households to enroll in WIC, the proportion of household that are food insecure may be higher among participants than nonparticipants. (Again, see the discussion in Chapter 3 on selection bias and how it limits interpretation of results from WIC-only studies or comparisons of WIC and non-WIC participants.) Indeed, among WIC-eligible households in 2014, 2 41.1 percent of households that received WIC benefits were food insecure and 32.1 percent for households that did not receive WIC benefits were food insecure (USDA/ERS, 2015b). Similar patterns were observed among households eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and comparable patterns have been observed among WIC participants and nonparticipants in smaller, local studies (Burkhardt et al., 2012;Odoms-Young et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "The Role of the WIC Food Packages in Nutrition Education", "text": "Nutrition education is key in supporting WIC participants' choices to purchase healthy foods, prepare those foods in a healthful manner, and consume them as part of a diet in alignment with the DGA. Indeed, WIC is the only federal supplemental nutrition assistance program to have a nutrition education component required by law (as specified in sections 17(b)(7), 17(f)(1)(C)(x), and 17(j) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended, and the Federal WIC regulations in sections 246.2 and 246.11 [NARA, 2007]).

WIC state agencies have the responsibility to develop educational materials aligned with these federal requirements (USDA/NAL, 2006). In addition, the food packages themselves provide foods that serve as a tool to meet the dietary goals of the DGA and around which education can be designed. Results from multiple studies document the effect of WIC nutrition education on participant knowledge, attitudes, and behavior change (USDA/ERS, 2007;Kavanagh et al., 2008;Ritchie et al., 2010;USDA/FNS, 2010;Sullivan et al., 2011;Whaley et al., 2012a, b;Isbell et al., 2014). In California, Ritchie et al. (2010) demonstrated that nutrition education alone led to increased consumption of low-fat milk and whole grains even before the 2009 changes to the WIC food packages took place. Following the policy change, consumption of these foods increased further (Whaley et al., 2012a). A study of the effect of the 2009 breastfeeding food package change on rates of breastfeeding (Whaley et al., 2012b) demonstrated significant increases in exclusive breastfeeding in the 6 months prior to the policy change, when staff training and participant education focused on exclusive breastfeeding and the upcoming policy changes. Similar changes were not evident in other states where staff training and participant education specific to the breastfeeding food package changes were not a focus prior to the food package change.

These \"shortfall\" nutrients include vitamins A, D, E, and C; folate; calcium; magnesium; potassium; and fiber (see Table 1-6). For adolescent and premenopausal females, iron is also a shortfall nutrient. Of the shortfall nutrients, calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium are also classified as nutrients of \"public health concern\" because under-consumption of these nutrients is linked with adverse health outcomes. Iron is included as a nutrient of public health concern for adolescent and premenopausal adult females because of increased risk of irondeficiency for these groups. The 2015 DGAC also identified two nutrients-sodium and saturated fat-that pose health risks because of overconsumption . Added sugars were also identified as a nutrient that is overconsumed and should be limited . With respect to food intakes, the 2015 DGAC found that the majority of the U.S. population is consuming less than the recommended intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy, all of which are important food sources of the shortfall nutrients (USDA/HHS, 2015). Intakes of refined grains exceed recommendations. Children between the ages of 2 to 5 years, however, do consume the recommended amounts of fruit and dairy. Given that WIC served approximately 28 percent of U.S. children ages 2 to less than 5 years of age in 2012 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013;USDA/FNS, 2013), it is likely that the WIC food packages contribute to these population estimates of both nutrient and food group intakes. The committee's NHANES analysis of nutrient intakes comparing children participating in WIC with children eligible for WIC but not participating provides further insight (see Chapters 4 and 5)."}, {"section_title": "Dietary Guidance for Specific Food Groups Applicable to the WIC Food Packages", "text": "Here, food groups that are under-consumed based on the 2015 DGAC report are considered first (vegetables and whole grains for women and children and fruit and dairy for women), followed by foods for which consumption is important but are not considered to be of concern in the DGAC report (protein foods). For ease of reference, Table 9-1 provides a summary of the 2015 DGAC report's major food group categories and examples of one serving equivalents in each category (similar information for food subgroups can be found in Appendix T, Table T "}, {"section_title": "Whole Grains", "text": "Whole grains are good sources of several key shortfall nutrients, including fiber, iron, folate, magnesium and vitamin A. The FDA defines whole grains as \"cereal grains that consist of the intact, ground, cracked, or flaked kernel, which includes the bran, the germ, and the inner most part of the kernel (the endosperm)\" (FDA, 2009). If the kernel is no longer intact, the grain mixture must have the same relative proportions of bran, germ and endosperm as the original grain, with the rationale that the balance of nutrients is maintained. The Whole Grains Council issues two related stamps (symbols placed on food packaging). Products eligible for the \"100% Whole Grain\" stamp must contain at least 16 g of whole grains per serving. Products eligible for the BACKGROUND AND APPROACH TO CONSIDERING FOOD PACKAGE OPTIONS 9-9 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS \"Whole Grain\" stamp must contain at least 8 g of whole grains per serving (Oldways Whole Grains Council, 2013). Examples of whole grains include brown rice, popcorn, bulgur, whole wheat, oats, and barley. Whole grain product availability in the marketplace has grown substantially, from approximately 360 new product introductions in 2005 to more than 900 new product introductions in 2012. Whole grain product innovations in the marketplace include whole grain ready-to-eat cereals, pancakes, French toast, breads, pasta, crackers, snacks, wraps, entrees, and pizza crusts (Mintel International, 2012). The 2015 DGAC report included the recommendation that half of all grain intake come from whole grains and reported that, overall, whole grain intake of the U.S. population is too low (nearly 100 percent of women 19 to 50 years of age had intakes below recommendations). Intake of refined grains, in contrast, is too high. The same was the case for all subgroups analyzed in this report (see Chapter 5). Whole grains in the WIC food packages Whole grains in the WIC food packages may come from either the whole wheat bread or breakfast cereal food categories. Whole grains must be the primary ingredient by weight in all whole grain bread products, and all whole grain bread products must conform to the FDA standard of identity specifying that \"whole wheat flour\" and/or \"bromated whole wheat flour\" are the only flours that can be listed in the ingredient list (USDA/FNS, 2015c). WIC food package substitutions permitted for whole grain bread include brown rice, bulgur, oats, and whole grain barley, pasta/macaroni, and tortillas (USDA/FNS, 2014). For the WIC cereals food package category, at least 50 percent of breakfast cereals on state agency food lists are required to contain a whole grain as the primary ingredient. This parallels the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs requirements that half of the grains offered during the school week must meet the whole grain-rich criteria 4 (USDA/FNS, 2012a). All foods in both the whole wheat bread and breakfast cereal categories must meet FDA labeling requirements for making a health claim as a whole-grain food of moderate fat content FDA, 2003). In terms of what participants may ultimately redeem, options in the whole wheat bread category must be whole grain, but options selected for breakfast cereals from the state-authorized food lists may or may not be whole grain. As noted in Chapter 6, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require fortification of whole grain products with folic acid. For example, \"bread, whole wheat, commercially prepared\" (from the USDA Standard Reference Database, Release 27 [USDA/ARS, 2014a]) provides 12 \u00b5g of dietary folate equivalents (DFE) per ounce, whereas \"bread, white, commercially prepared\" provides 48 \u00b5g DFE per ounce. Assuming that grain intake of women in the NHANES analysis conducted for this study was 100 percent bread (realizing that in reality it is a combination of different grain-based foods), current daily intake of folate from whole grains would be 7.2 \u00b5g DFE and, from refined grain sources, 313 \u00b5g DFE. If all grain intakes were changed to whole grain sources, total daily intake (from grains) would drop from 321 to 86 \u00b5g DFE. Thus, there is a trade-off between increasing consumption of whole grains versus increasing consumption of folic acid from enriched, but not whole grain, products."}, {"section_title": "Fruits (Including Fruit Juice)", "text": "According to the 2015 DGAC report, fruit contributes substantial amounts of, fiber and potassium, two nutrients of public health concern. The majority of children 1 to 8 years of age in the general U.S. population meet recommended intakes for total fruit (1 cup and 1.5 cups per day, respectively). However, few adult women consume the recommended daily amount (2.5 cups per day). More than half the fruit intake for Americans 1 year of age and older comes from whole fruit. Fruit intake is composed of slightly less whole fruit for children ages 1 to 3 years of age. In the analyses conducted for this report, children ages 2 to less than 5 years in both the WIC and lowincome subgroups consumed approximately half the recommended fruit intakes (including 100 percent juice), and women (pregnant, lactating or post-partum) consumed even less. Recommendations specific to fruit juice The fruit category in the 2015 DGAC report includes both whole fruit and 100 percent fruit juice (see Box 9-1 for the regulatory definition of 100 percent fruit juice), with 1 cup (8 ounces) of 100 percent fruit juice being equivalent to 1 cup of whole fruit (USDA/HHS, 2015). Although whole fruit is not distinguished from 100 percent fruit juice in either the 2010 DGA or the 2015 DGAC report, the 2010 DGA recommended limiting the amount of 100 percent juice consumed in place of whole fruit given the lack of fiber and potential to contribute excess calories to the diet (USDA/HHS, 2010). Likewise, the AAP recommends that 100 percent fruit juice be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day for children ages 1 to 6 years (AAP, 2014). The AAP rationale was that 100 percent fruit juice is easily overconsumed because it tastes good, but it lacks the fiber contained in whole fruit and offers no nutritional advantages over whole fruit. For infants younger than 6 months, the AAP recommends no juice be provided (AAP, 2014). Its rationale was to avoid displacement of other key nutrients from human milk, formula, or complementary foods. In the analyses presented in Chapter 5, children ages 2 to less than 5 had a mean usual intake of fruit of 1.43 c-eq per day (compared to a recommended intake of 1.19 c-eq per day). Applying the 2015 DGAC estimate that approximately 42 percent of fruit intake is from juice (USDA/HHS, 2015), this equates to approximately 0.6 cup-equivalents of juice per day, which falls within the AAP recommended limit of 4 to 6 ounces per day. Fruit juice and health Although the 2015 DGAC did not review the effect of fruit juice on health in their report, several groups have conducted evidence-based reviews to examine the impact of 100 percent juice consumption on health. They failed to find a link with the risks of developing either type 2 diabetes (Xi et al., 2014) or childhood obesity unless the portion sizes were large . The results of other reviews suggest potential positive effects of consumption of 100 percent juice on a number of health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognition, hypertension, urinary tract infections, and disease-related processes (i.e., inflammation, oxidation, platelet function, vascular reactivity) (Coelho et al., 2013;Lamport et al., 2014;Hyson et al., 2015). Authors of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics review  reported that children who consume 100 percent fruit juice tend to consume more calcium and potassium and are therefore at lower risk of inadequacy for these nutrients. Fruit juice in the WIC food packages Fruit juice (100 percent only) is provided in the WIC food packages as a separate food category. The juice provided must adhere to the FDA standards of identity for fruit (NARA, 2014a) or vegetable juice (NARA, 2014b), be pasteurized and unsweetened, and contain at least 30 mg of vitamin C per 100 mL of juice. Vegetable juice may be reduced in sodium. The 2009 food package revisions eliminated juice for infants and reduced juice for children from 288 to 128 fluid ounces, which is the equivalent of the AAP recommendation of not more than 4 ounces per day (see Table 9-2) (AAP, 2001). Currently, both children 1 to 4 years of age and women (depending on the food package) may receive up to 128 fluid ounces of juice, or the equivalent of 4.27 ounces per day, for a 30-day period.  evaluated the effect of the reduction in the juice allotment in the 2009 food packages on juice consumption in Connecticut and Massachusetts.

Currently, the U.S. population consumes similar amounts of milk and cheese (53 percent of dairy intake comes from milk and 45 percent comes from cheese) (USDA/HHS, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Protein Foods", "text": "Protein foods provide essential amino acids, and some protein foods are important sources of iron. As previously mentioned, iron is a nutrient of public health concern for adolescent and adult females. Meat foods in the protein group provide heme iron, which is more bioavailable than non-heme plant-derived iron. Heme iron is especially important for young children and pregnant women . Protein foods include meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, soy, nuts, and seeds. Dairy foods also provide protein, but are part of a separate food group in the food patterns. The 2015 DGAC reported that nearly 80 percent of boys and 75 percent of girls ages 1 to 3 years meet or exceed the recommended intake of protein foods, approximately 60 percent of boys and girls ages 4 to 8 years also meet or exceed these recommendations, and approximately 40 percent of females ages 19 to 30 meet the recommendation for intake of protein foods.  . Most of the protein foods consumed across all age groups are from the meat, poultry, and eggs group. In the analyses presented in this report for WIC participants and low-income individuals, fewer than 20 percent of children ages 1 to under 2 and slightly under 50 percent of children ages 2 to 5 met recommended intakes for total protein foods. For women, approximately 30 to 40 percent met recommended intake amounts. Intakes of seafood and nuts, seeds and soy were very poor across all age groups. Protein foods in the WIC food packages Protein foods are included in several WIC food categories, including peanut butter (which can be substituted with legumes), eggs, fish, and infant (baby food) meats.

One ounce was selected as a conservative example. "}, {"section_title": "Saturated Fat", "text": "Although the 2015 DGAC report did not include an upper limit for total fat intake, recommendations included replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated alternatives and replacing solid animal fats with non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts . Additionally, the 2015 DGAC noted, \"a potential approach to increasing intake of shortfall nutrients and nutrients of public health concern while simultaneously decreasing intake of overconsumed nutrients of public health concern would be to increase intake of fat-free or low-fat fluid milk in lieu of cheese\" (USDA/HHS, 2015, p. 108). Major sources of saturated fat in the American diet include mixed dishes (burgers, pizza, sandwiches and tacos), snacks and sweets, protein foods (meats, deli and cured meats and poultry), and dairy (higher fat milk, yogurt and cheese) (USDA/HHS, 2015). Since 2012 the National School Lunch Program (a federal nutrition assistance program that is also required to align with dietary guidance) has required that all milk served in schools be lowfat or fat-free and, if flavored, fat-free (USDA/FNS, 2012b). Similarly, the current WIC food package allows only 1 percent or fat-free milk for individuals ages 2 years and older, and quantities of cheese were reduced in 2009 to a maximum of 1 or 2 pounds per month, depending on the food package. Rehm et al. (2015) modeled replacement of whole, reduced-fat or flavored milk with plain low-fat or skim milk and found that replacement reduced intakes of energy and saturated fat and did not compromise calcium or potassium intakes. Table 9-3 illustrates that consumption of 1 ounce of cheese plus 1 cup of 1 percent milk per day provides approximately 40 percent of the recommended daily limit for saturated fat (18 g) for a 2,200-kcal food pattern. Considerations for dairy fat Some emerging data suggest that dairy fat consumption may have different implications for health than other types of saturated fats (Holmberg and Thelin, 2013;Kratz et al., 2013Kratz et al., , 2014Scharf et al., 2013;Da Silva et al., 2014;Yakoob et al., 2014;DeBoer et al., 2015;Keast et al., 2015). This topic was not covered by the 2015 DGAC report because these data were just appearing in the published literature at the close of DGAC deliberations (Personal communication, A. Lichtenstein, Tufts University, as commented to the committee in their workshop held on March 12, 2015). The committee reviewed studies published since the DGAC 2015 completed their deliberations. Highlights are summarized here. Kratz and colleagues (2013) reviewed 16 studies on the relationship between consumption of dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods and obesity or cardiometabolic disease. They found no positive associations between intake of dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods and either adiposity at baseline or adiposity over time. Most of the studies that they reviewed (11 of the 16) showed an inverse association between high-fat dairy consumption and indices of adiposity. Studies in which the relationship between high-fat dairy consumption and metabolic health was examined reported either an inverse or no association. The authors concluded that observational evidence does not support the hypothesis that either dairy fat or high-fat dairy foods contribute to either obesity of cardiometabolic risk. Keast and colleagues (2015) analyzed data from the 2005-2008 NHANES and found that despite greater energy and saturated fat intakes, dairy consumption was not associated with greater body weight or measures of adiposity. Scharf et al. (2013) examined 10,700 children at age 2 and 4 years participating in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a representative sample of U.S. children. Across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic status subgroups, 1 percent/skim milk drinkers had higher BMI z scores than 2 percent/whole milk drinkers. As the ECLS-B was an observational study, it is possible that reverse causality was an issue and the results may be a reflection of parents of children with higher BMIs being more likely to be counseled by their health care provider and more likely to adhere to recommendations to select low-fat milk. Scharf and colleagues (2013) speculated that one explanation for the inverse association with dairy fat and childhood adiposity may be that the presence of fat in milk may induce satiety and reduce the appetite for other energy dense foods."}, {"section_title": "Added Sugars", "text": "Added sugars are sweeteners of various types added to foods (i.e. corn syrup, fruit juice concentrate, fructose, maltose, among many others, and do not include naturally occurring sugars such as those in 100 percent fruit juice or lactose in dairy products . The 2015 DGAC report recommended that added sugars not exceed 10 percent of total energy intake (USDA/HHS, 2015). Specifically, the 2015 DGAC report recommended replacing soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages (including sports drinks) with nonfat milk to reduce the intake of added sugars and increase the intake of calcium, vitamin D and magnesium . As discussed in Chapter 6, one concern with added sugars (and dietary carbohydrates in general) is the development of dental caries, particularly early childhood caries (ECC). Major sources of added sugars in the American diet include beverages (not including unflavored milk and 100 percent fruit juice), snacks and sweets, breakfast cereals and bars, and some dairy foods (such as flavored milks and sweetened yogurt). With few exceptions, foods with added sugars are generally not permitted in the WIC food package. However, although the FDA has issued a proposed rule, at present manufacturers are not required to label added sugars. Therefore, total sugars are limited in the WIC food specifications (USDA/FNS, 2014). Specifically, cereals may contain no more than 6 grams of sucrose and other sugars per dry ounce (a typical serving size), and yogurt must contain no more than 40 g of total sugars per 1 cup (USDA/FNS, 2014). Fruited yogurts generally exceed the 40-g regulatory limit and are therefore not permitted for purchase. One serving of yogurt that meets WIC specifications (i.e., based on the USDA Standard Reference Database, Release 27 [USDA/ARS, 2014a]), for example low-fat vanilla yogurt, provides 74 percent of the recommended added sugars limits (32 g per day) for women consuming a 2,200-kcal diet. One serving of a breakfast cereal containing the limit of 6 grams of added sugars would contribute 19 percent of the recommended added sugars limit per day for an individual adhering to a 2,200 kcal diet."}, {"section_title": "Sodium", "text": "The 2015 DGAC report recommended lowering sodium intakes to less than 2,300 mg per day (USDA/HHS, 2015). Sodium is ubiquitous in the U.S. food supply and is contained in many food categories, with the exception of fruits and fruit juices, which contain little sodium. The CDCdubbed \"salty six\" food categories that contribute the most to sodium consumption among Americans include breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, poultry, soup, and sandwiches (AHA/ASA, 2014). The 2015 DGAC report encouraged efforts to reduce sodium in prepared and processed foods, as well as in home cooking by using recipes with small amounts of sodium . In the WIC food packages, sodium intake comes primarily from cheese, canned vegetables, and canned fish. It is otherwise limited in most other food categories, and lower-sodium options are generally encouraged (USDA/FNS, 2014). For some products, the low-sodium version costs more, which may affect inclusion of these products on state WIC food lists. 5 For example, the typical sodium content of a one ounce-equivalent serving of representative WIC cheese (cheddar) contributes 12 percent of the recommended sodium intake for women who consume a 2,200-kcal diet (see Table 9-3)."}, {"section_title": "Cholesterol", "text": "Previously, the DGA recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to no more than 300 mg/day (USDA/HHS, 2010). The 2015 DGAC report did not make this recommendation; it stated that available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum (blood) cholesterol. This position is consistent with recommendations made by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA, 2014). In addition, the 2015 DGAC analysis of national survey data indicated that cholesterol was not overconsumed . Eggs, a primary source of cholesterol in the American diet, are currently included in the WIC food packages for children and women. Amounts were reduced in the 2009, primarily to allow room for additional foods and secondarily to reduce the total amount of cholesterol in the package (protein was not considered a priority nutrient) . Although cholesterol appears to be of less concern at this time, eggs also contain saturated fat (9 percent of the daily recommended limit per egg on a 2,200 kcal diet), which, as previously mentioned, is considered a nutrient to limit. The WIC food packages provide 0.4 eggs per day in all packages, with the exception of the package for fully breastfeeding women which provides approximately 0.8 eggs per day. To establish a basis for intake evaluation for WIC participants form birth up to 2 years of age, the committee evaluated the most recent recommendations of the AAP, AND, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other published sources, as presented in Chapter 3, Table 3-1. The AAP recommends human milk as the sole food for healthy, full-term infants for approximately the first 6 months of life and supports continued breast feeding for at least 12 months (AAP, 2014). The AAP (2014) further recommends that, in the absence of human milk, iron-fortified formulas are the most appropriate substitutes for feeding healthy, full-term infants during the first year of life. The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life (WHO, 2013). The introduction of complementary foods should begin at approximately 6 months of age, depending on an individual infant's development (e.g., whether the infant has attained the necessary oral motor skills, whether growth faltering has occurred) (AAP, 2014). Acknowledging that iron and zinc deficiencies may occur in older breastfed infants, the AAP further recommends the introduction of meats, vegetables with higher iron content and iron-fortified cereals for infants and toddlers as the first foods . Cow's milk is not recommended before 1 year of age by the AAP because of the increased risk of iron-deficiency anemia (i.e., because of low bioavailability of iron from cow's milk, low concentration of iron in cow's milk ,and potential for intestinal blood loss) (AAP, 2014). The WHO recommends porridge and a wide variety of pureed foods, including meats, to initiate the transition from a fluid to a solid diet (WHO, 2013). Some infants may be developmentally ready for finger foods or foods of different textures at an earlier age. In alignment with AAP guidance, WIC educates participants that infants may be ready to take solids earlier than 6 months (USDA/FNS, 2014). Chapter 5 (Tables 5-2, 5-3, and 5-4) summarizes results from the committee's analyses of food intakes for infants and children under the age of 2 years, which indicated concerns around early introduction of complementary foods including cow's milk and foods of poor nutritional value, as well as iron supplementation. The committee recognizes that the WIC food packages provide complementary foods only as early as 6 months of age (USDA/FNS, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "FOODS CONTAINING FUNCTIONAL INGREDIENTS", "text": "The committee was asked to consider the current science on functional ingredients (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], arachidonic acid [ARA], probiotics, prebiotics, beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene) added to foods for infants, children, and adults to determine how USDA-FNS might approach the inclusion of foods containing these ingredients in the WIC food packages."}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Framework for Functional Ingredients", "text": "At the time this report was written, the FDA had not established a definition for functional foods or ingredients. Functional ingredients are permitted in foods if evidence indicates the ingredients are safe at estimated national levels of consumption, but efficacy of these ingredients is not evaluated or regulated by the FDA. Broadly, functional foods and ingredients are thought to provide a \"health benefit beyond basic nutrition,\" and may be 9-20 REVIEW OF WIC FOOD PACKAGES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS beneficial to long-term health (Crowe and Francis, 2013). At present, no nationally agreed-upon framework exists for determining the levels of substances in foods that can be linked to health benefits, although development of such a framework is under discussion in the nutrition community. Global organizations use various criteria to evaluate benefits (e.g. level of evidence supporting the beneficial outcome, level of exposure to the component, forms and sources of the component) (Crowe and Francis, 2013). A functional ingredient can be a nutrient or non-nutrient component, while functional foods are generally regarded as having properties-taste, aroma, and/or nutritive value-of conventional foods. These characteristics set functional nutrients and functional foods apart from supplements (GAO, 2000). The position of AND is that \"functional foods\" can be whole, fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods (Crowe and Francis, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Findings on Health Benefits", "text": "Functional ingredients that have been systematically evaluated for outcomes within WIC's target population are listed in Table 9-4 (see Chapter 3 for a summary of how the functional ingredients and studies listed in this table were selected). Two characteristics of the table should be noted. First, aside from statements related to formula-fed infants, the reviews and positions listed in the table are largely evaluations of the ingredient administered as a supplement and not in a food form. However, while these statements may not accurately represent the health effects that occur when the ingredient is consumed as part of a food matrix (Jeffery, 2005;Crowe and Francis 2013), the relationships and strength of evidence provide insight into the current understanding of the biological role of the component. Second, diseases or conditions that are atypical in the WIC population (e.g., gout) or that may not be affected by the short-term, supplemental nature of the WIC program (e.g., cancer, heart disease) were not included in this evaluation. Data that support a link between functional components and health outcomes are generally insufficient or inconclusive. Probiotics appear to have the most consistent data indicating a beneficial effect (i.e., in relation to diarrheal conditions). However, with regards inclusion of probiotics in routine formulas, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has recently released an opinion stating there is currently insufficient data to make a judgment on the safety and health benefits of probiotics for healthy infants (BfR, 2015). For other functional ingredients listed in Table 9-4, evidence for health effects may be apparent for specific subpopulations or health conditions of less relevance to the general WIC population. For example, the 2015 DGAC noted that evidence for effects of EPA and DHA on neuropsychological health is substantial, and combined supplementation is now considered a complementary therapy for major depressive disorder . Note that the 2015 DGAC did not review probiotics or prebiotics and that lutein, lycopene, and beta-carotene are all considered collectively as \"carotenoids\" (USDA/HHS, 2015). In addition to health outcomes, cost is another important factor to consider when determining if foods with functional ingredients should be added to WIC food packages. Functional foods may have higher prices than their conventional counterparts, but may be costeffective in the long run if a health impact were to offset medical costs (Schmier et al., 2014). Following their designation as being \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) by the FDA, DHA and ARA were added to infant formulas sold in the United States starting in 2002.

USDA-FNS requested that the committee evaluate three specific aspects of infant formulas as a component of the food packages. Two of these aspects were addressed in Chapter 4, namely the maximum monthly allowances for infant formula and iron concentration. The third aspect was the nutritional and health effects of functional ingredients in infant formulas. A summary of the committee's review of the science related to the nutritional and health impact of functional ingredients in infant formulas is provided here. Since the 2009 food package changes, the variety of infant formula products available in the marketplace has expanded substantially. As a foundation for this task, the committee reviewed changes in the infant formula market landscape over the past decade, including but not limited to functional ingredients."}, {"section_title": "The Regulatory Process Governing Infant Formula", "text": "During the first several months of life, infants are unique in that all their nutrient requirements must be met by a single food source, namely either human milk or formulas. In recognition of the importance of a single food source for infant health, the U.S. Congress passed the Infant Formula Act of 1980, later amended in 1986, as section 412 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (NARA, 2014c). The associated regulations (NARA, 2014d) set standards for safety and nutrient sufficiency; establishes premarket submission, registration, and records retention requirements; specifies infant formula adulterant; grants the FDA mandatory recall authority; and mandates that formula meet \"quality factors\" (i.e., supporting normal growth, biological quality of protein). Formulas currently sold in the United States must contain minimum concentrations of 29 nutrients 6 (3 of which are specifically required for all non-milk-based formulas) and not exceed the maximum concentrations for 9 of these nutrients. At least 90 days before introducing a new or reformulated product (see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.3 for definition of a \"major change\"), a manufacturer must submit a notification to the FDA that includes the product composition, processing and packaging information, and required assurances that it meets the quality factors. After first production of the formula and before it is introduced to the market, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a summary of test results assessing the levels of each of the required nutrients in the formula and must certify good manufacturing practices were established, in accordance with 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 106 regulations. Additionally, because the infant formula market is continually evolving and to ensure suitability of new or reformulated infant formulas, manufacturers are required to test and document that products are safe, support healthy growth when provided as the sole source of nutrition, and contain protein of biological quality (NARA, 2014c). Manufacturers may add ingredients which are not required but may have health benefits to formulas in ways that will set their products apart from their competitors (AAP, 2014, p. 63;Aggett et al., 2001). These additions and reformulations are permissible only when included in the premarket submission to the FDA. Each ingredient must be an approved food additive, be GRAS under the conditions of intended use, or are be used in accordance with a prior sanction (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 140(a)). To ensure the formula matrix meets the quality factor of supporting normal physical growth (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.96), manufacturers must demonstrate that the added ingredients do not interfere with the bioavailability of the required nutrients."}, {"section_title": "WIC Formulas", "text": "As discussed in Chapter 7, WIC encourages exclusive breastfeeding during an infant's first months of life and continued breastfeeding thereafter. In instances where an infant is partially breastfed or fully formula-fed, WIC aims to provide enough formula supplementation to meet, but not exceed, an infant's nutritional needs. As such, WIC does not function as \"supplemental nutrition program\" in its provision of infant formula. The formulas provided by WIC must comply with the federal definition of and nutrient requirements for infant formulas. In particular, they must provide at least 1.5 mg iron per 100 kilocalories at standard dilution; provide approximately 20 kilocalories per 100 milliliters at standard dilution; be able to be delivered orally or via tube feeding; and require nothing but water to be added for them to be in a liquid, ready-to-drink state (USDA/FNS, 2014). Partially or fully formula-fed infants can receive select milk-based and soy-based formulas through the WIC program. Formulas intended for healthy term infants (\"nonexempt\" formulas) are generally provided in powdered or concentrate form, unless living conditions require use of a prepared formulation. In an effort to contain costs, manufacturers must bid to be the sole supplier of a state's standard formula. The manufacturer, in return for exclusivity, provides the agency with a significant rebate on each container of contract formula purchased with the WIC benefit ($1.7 billion in 2012 [USDA/ERS, 2013]). As discussed in Chapter 8, in instances of medically documented qualifying conditions, infants may be eligible to receive nonstandard products. Given these infants' unique dietary needs, exempt formulas can deviate from the federal nutrient requirements if the FDA is provided with substantiated medical, nutritional, scientific, or technological justification (NARA, 2014e).

Partially hydrolyzed protein-containing formulas, for instance, are marketed as being soothing, providing comfort, and promoting regularity. Various formulas are advertised as managing colic, gas, fussiness, and spit-ups because some of the ingredients (e.g., lactose, protein source or composition) have been modified. Partially hydrolyzed formulas may also be indicated in infants at risk of allergy (see Chapter 8 for additional detail). In accordance with the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)), any statement or claim on the label must be truthful and not misleading. Most label claims fall under the structure/function claim category, referring to an effect \"derived from nutritive value\" (FDA, 2014a). As such, the relationship describes a nutrient or compound in the food rather than the food as a whole. The only type of infant formulas with a qualified health claim are those that are 100% whey-protein partially hydrolyzed, but the claim includes a statement of the relative dearth of data supporting it (e.g., \"Little scientific evidence suggests that\u2026\") (FDA, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Organic and Non-GMO Formulas", "text": "Only one of the manufacturers holding WIC state contracts makes an organic infant formula (although other manufacturers make organic brands).

The new products were a modification of available products and provide one less kilocalorie per prepared fluid ounce (19 vs. 20 kcal/fl oz). The rationale for transitioning to lower-energy formulas was that it better reflected the energy density of human milk (Abbott Nutrition, 2015a). Inasmuch as the standard WIC formulas must provide 20 kcal/fl oz (USDA/FNS, 2015c), states can choose to offer these lower-energy formulas in cases of medically documented qualifying conditions rather than as standard issue. 8 However, given the lower energy in these formulas, concern has been raised about effects on infant growth. Findings from a recent systematic review suggest that healthy full-term infants consuming formulas with lower protein and/or lower energy levels than standard formulas have adequate growth, comparable to breastfed infants, although the authors recommended additional long-term evaluations of these formulas (Abrams et al., 2015). One manufacturer that did not reformulate its products to be lower in energy, however, has challenged the need for lower-energy formulas and currently (at the time this report was being written) intends to maintain the caloric density of their formulas at 20 kcal/fl oz (Mead Johnson, 2014). A taskforce of the AAP submitted a letter to USDA-FNS requesting a reevaluation of the 20 kcal/fl oz criterion for WIC formulas (AAP, 2012).

Additionally, since 2009, the Altarum Institute has been conducting interview, survey, and focus group studies with WIC participants across sites. A key theme emerging from these studies is that participants are especially satisfied with the flexibility allowed in the food packages (e.g., being able to choose canned beans instead of dried or corn tortillas instead of bread) and want as much food and brand variety as possible Personal communication, S. Whaley, Public Health Foundation WIC Enterprises, June 4, 2015). In a study by Altarum of women who had left the WIC program, responses to the question \"What could WIC do to encourage you to participate in the program again?\" included negative comments about food selection (e.g., being allowed to acquire only store brands, not being able to acquire the type of milk or formula needed) ."}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Future Modifications to Improve Choice and Flexibility", "text": "As noted in the interim rule, substitution for a food in the WIC food categories \"must be nutritionally equivalent or superior to the food it is intended to replace\" . The implication of this statement is that the nutrient content of substitutions for WIC foods should be similar, components (i.e. protein) should be of similar quality, and nutrients should be similarly bioavailable. As an example of a substitution comparison, the 2015 DGAC evaluated a number of milk alternatives and found that, while most contain potassium, the amounts of it vary. Additionally, although most are fortified with calcium, calorie amounts are higher in some alternatives for a similar intake of calcium and calcium absorption is lower in plant-based milk alternatives (USDA/HHS, 2015). Both the interim and final rules require that soy beverages (a currently allowed milk alternative) provide a minimum 8 g of protein, 100 IU for vitamin D and 500 IU for vitamin A, and 276 mg calcium per 8 ounces  representative almond milk in the USDA's standard reference database contains similar amounts of micronutrients, but only 1 g of protein per 8 ounces (USDA/ARS, 2014a). Therefore, almond milk would not be considered nutritionally equivalent to cow's milk because of the notably lower protein content."}, {"section_title": "COST CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "As part of the task, USDA-FNS requested that modifications to the recommended food package be cost-neutral to allow the WIC program to maintain the current average food package cost, adjusting for inflation and allowing for no more than 10 percent variance in per-participant average monthly food costs. As was the case for the 2006 IOM review, the term cost neutrality means that the average cost per participant of the complete set of revised WIC food packages proposed by the committee (in phase II) does not exceed the cost of the current WIC food packages. Table 9-5 illustrates how costs were contained in the 2009 food package revisions. Creating the final recommendations in the IOM (2006) report involved determining the priority nutrients and food groups, then evaluating cost of addressing those gaps in an iterative process. Details of these considerations are presented in that report. The same approach will be taken in phase II of this review. The committee was tasked with determining whether any cost increases associated with the potential expansion of options or new substitutions for foods could be offset by other package modifications while maintaining the overall nutritional goals, other population needs, and administrative constraints of the food package. WIC is not an entitlement program. As a result, it has a fixed budget appropriate, so funds may not be available to cover the cost of WIC foods for those who are eligible. Consequently, cost-containment is an important concern. A primary cost-saving practice of the WIC program is the negotiation of rebate contracts with infant formula manufacturers, as described previously. These rebates have contributed to significant savings and permitted more participants to be served by WIC (USDA/ERS, 2015a). Additional cost-containment practices include limiting approved brands, package sizes, forms, or prices (e.g., least expensive brand requirements), and limiting authorized vendors to stores with lower food prices. Smaller vendors, often with higher operating and procurement costs, are more likely to charge (and be reimbursed for) higher prices for WIC products than larger vendors. A recent USDA-ERS report documented that policies intended to reduce maximum allowable WIC reimbursement rates would have little to no effect on most standard-size supermarkets, where the majority of WIC transactions take place (USDA/ERS, 2014). On the one hand, containing costs is essential for maximizing program funds to serve as many WIC-eligible individuals as possible. Yet strategies that limit cost are often synonymous with strategies that limit choice. Cost-containment practices that restrict participant choice in such a way that some foods become undesirable for purchase undermine WIC's goal to provide healthy and nutritious foods to low-income individuals. As a result, states attempt to balance containing cost with promoting enough variety and choice among healthy WIC foods that families will want to purchase those foods.

Analysis reported in the phase I report focuses on the level and contributions of at-home and away-fromhome food expenditures and the WIC food package to total food expenditures for three kinds of households: (1) households that receive WIC benefits, (2) households that are eligible for WIC but do not participate in the program, and (3) higher-income households that would meet the eligibility criteria (having a pregnant woman or child in the household under the age of 5 years old) except for income. The analysis relied on recently released data from a national survey of households that was conducted by the USDA Economic Research Service (USDA/ERS, 2015a). The analysis also provided insights into household demographics (e.g., presence of pregnant women, infants, and young children), food insecurity, and share of food acquired with WIC benefits (i.e., for households receiving WIC benefits).

The survey design had four target groups defined in terms of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation and total reported household income. The three target income 10-2 REVIEW OF WIC FOOD PACKAGES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS groups were income less than 100 percent of the federal poverty-to-income ratio (PIR); income greater than or equal to 100 percent and less than 185 percent of the PIR; and income greater or equal to 185 percent of the PIR. Sampled households were selected through a multi-stage sample design. Prior to release, several quality controls were exercised, including verification of reported SNAP participation by linking responses on SNAP participation and purchases to SNAP administrative records. Information on the SNAP participation status (as revised in the match to administrative data) was used in constructing the final sampling weights. Each household was given a final sampling weight to be used in making the sample nationally representative of all noninstitutionalized households in the contiguous United States, and the analyses and standard errors account for the complex sampling design. With respect to food purchases and acquisitions, the survey is a unique source of information on foods eaten both at home (FAH) and away from home (FAFH), as well as extensive information on the sample households. Purchase and acquisition data for each household were collected over a 7-day period. The data provide information on quantities; prices; expenditures for all foods eaten both at home and away from home and purchased or acquired from all sources (including large and small grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores, gas stations, and food marts); and source of payment for foods consumed at home (i.e., WIC voucher or other method of purchase). During a shopping event where more than one type of tender was used to purchase foods, although it is impossible to determine exactly which foods were obtained with the WIC voucher, it is possible to determine how much the WIC voucher contributed to the total purchase cost and what food items were purchased during the shopping event. In addition to food purchase and acquisition data, the survey collected information on income, food security status (a scale based on responses to 10 questions used to assess household food security, USDA/ERS, 2015b), and reported WIC participation as well as some demographic information (e.g., presence of a pregnant woman, infant, or young child) which were used here to differentiate among the three types of households. Of note, households were not asked about breastfeeding or postpartum women. Forty-eight percent of the WIC households also participated in SNAP (USDA/ERS, 2015c)."}, {"section_title": "Application of the FoodAPS Dataset for This Report", "text": "The household served as the unit of analysis for this study. For example, if a WICparticipating mother and her infant lived in a household with the mother's (non-WICparticipating) parents, the entire household (mother, infant, and mother's parents) was coded as \"WIC,\" not just the mother and her infant. As mentioned previously, three types of households were analyzed for this report: (1) WIC participating households (i.e., households reporting either having a member participate in the WIC program or a purchase event with use of WIC voucher), (2) eligible non-WIC households (i.e., households with a pregnant woman or a child under 5 years old and with income \u2264 185 percent PIR), and (3) non-eligible non-WIC households (i.e., households having a pregnant woman or a child younger than 5 years old and with income greater than 185 percent PIR). Although the survey did not cover breastfeeding or postpartum women, it is likely that these women were captured as part of WIC-participating households with infants. All household members were asked to track and report their food purchases or acquisitions during the survey week, including all foods eaten at home and away from home. Each purchase or acquisition was considered a separate \"event.\" The sum of events across food purchased and acquired for at home and away from home use constitutes the total food FOOD EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS 10-3 PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS expenditures for that household (for the survey week). Some households (4 percent of WIC participating households, 2 percent of eligible, non-WIC participating households, and 3 percent of higher-income households) reported no food purchases or acquisitions (FAH or FAFH) during the survey week. Nonetheless, they were included in the analysis to generate a representative \"average\" amount of food expenditures for all households, because, over the course of a month, households vary widely in the frequency and size of their food purchases and acquisitions. Among all households examined in the FoodAPS, 7 to 9 percent reported no FAH expenditures in the interview week (including 8.7 percent of WIC households). With respect to the 10 FoodAPS questions related to food insecurity, the sum of affirmative responses (\"yes,\" \"often,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"occurring 3 or more days\" were all coded as affirmative) on questions related to food insecure conditions were used to assign USDA 30-day Adult Food Security Scale values. A raw score of 0 (none of the 10 questions eliciting an affirmative response) was assigned a value of 1 (high food security), a raw score of 1-2 (1-2 affirmative responses) was assigned a value of 2 (marginal food security), a raw score of 3-5 was assigned a value of 3 (low food security), and a raw score of 6-10 was assigned a value of 4 (very low food security). For this analysis, households with assigned values of 3 and 4 were identified as food insecure. Data were weighted in estimates of mean values and standard errors using the household weights; all standard errors account for oversampling and the complex survey design of FoodAPS. 3 Mean food expenditures and food insecurity scores were compared using t-tests, and distributions of demographic and food insecurity data were compared using the Pearson chisquare statistic between WIC households and both types of non-WIC households (Rao and Scott, 1984)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics of the Survey Households", "text": "Compared to both types of non-WIC households, WIC households were more likely to have infants and pregnant woman but less likely to have young children (children ages 1 to less than 5 years old) (see Table 10-1).

In the CPS, in contrast, households were first asked whether they experienced food-insecure conditions in the prior 12 months and only afterward, based on an initial affirmation of any food-insecure condition, were they asked about the past 30 days. The NHIS used a 30-day reference period but the survey was administered throughout the year, unlike the FoodAPS which was administered between April and January. Also unlike the CPS and NHIS, the FoodAPS was administered in the context of each household providing a detailed record of information on food purchases and acquisitions that is not collected in the other surveys (USDA/ERS, 2015b).

The key findings from these analyses are as follows: 1. Infants are progressively exposed to a variety of food groups as they transition to complementary foods, but may not have a broad exposure on any given day. 2. Introducing complementary food before 4 months of age appears to be more common among WIC participating mothers compared to non-WIC mothers and those who do not exclusively breastfeed. 4 This practice has implications for infant weight gain and for health outcomes associated with inappropriate infant weight gain. 3. Estimates from the Infant Feeding Practices Study (IFPS) II suggest that approximately one quarter of infants are introduced to cow's milk before the time recommended (1 year of age). Cow's milk consumption on any given day occurred in 13.3 percent of WIC infants 6 to less than 12 months of age in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2008 study. 4. Published national survey data suggest four areas of concern for food group intakes of infants ages 0 to 24 months: early introduction of complementary foods; low intakes of iron-rich foods, particularly meats; early introduction of cow's milk, and; consumption of desserts, sweetened beverages, and salty snacks. 5. Analyses of NHANES data for low-income children ages 2 to less than 5 and women participating in or eligible for WIC showed that: a. For most food groups and subgroups, more than half of children and women had mean intakes below amounts recommended in the DGAC 2015 report. b. Whole grains, vegetables (particularly dark green and red-orange), and seafood were the food groups with the highest prevalence of mean intakes below amounts recommended in the 2015 DGAC report. c. Mean intakes of solid fats and added sugars exceeded the recommended limits specified in the 2015 DGAC report for almost all children and women (87 to 100 percent). 6. The number of low-income women in the NHANES 2011-2012 subgroups is small and distribution estimates are imprecise. This limits the ability to make population-level comparisons to recommended intake amounts. However, mean intake estimates can be compared across survey years. 7. Mean total Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores for women and children were well below the maximum possible score of 100 (51.9 for WIC women and 59.8 for WIC children). For WIC participating women, scores were lowest relative to the maximum possible score for greens and beans, whole grains, fatty acids (healthy fats), seafood and plant proteins, and empty calories.

The conclusions and supporting evidence will be updated and used in conjunction with additional planned analyses to develop the committee's recommendations in phase II. 1. Participation in WIC has declined recently. The reasons for this are likely multifaceted and cannot be attributed to the initial roll-out of the food package changes. Paper vouchers are being replaced by EBT, which may improve program participation as well as redemption of issued benefits. 2. There are some racial and ethnic differences in satisfaction with specific items in the food packages but, aside from the limited availability of Kosher and Halal food options, the packages appear to be broadly culturally suitable. 3. Both women and children (children ages 2 to less than 5 years) WIC participants had low or inadequate intakes of several nutrients that could potentially be addressed with food package changes. These inadequacies may be linked to food intakes that fell below recommendations for specific food groups. 4. Women, infants and children had excessive intakes of several nutrients. In some cases, these excessive intakes may be addressed with changes to the food packages; in other cases, they may be addressed with nutrition education. 5. Inasmuch as the sample size of low-income women in the 2011-2012 analysis was small, it was not possible to estimate the proportion of the population with food group intakes that were inadequate or excessive compared to recommended intakes. Small sample sizes for some of the population subgroups are likely to limit further disaggregation into WIC participants and WIC-eligible non-participating individuals. Therefore, in phase II, mean intakes can be compared between groups and to recommendations, but a population-level comparison to recommended intakes for women before and after the 2009 food package changes is unlikely to be possible. 6. The committee notes that the 2005-2008 NHANES nutrient and food intake data do not capture the impact of the 2009 food package changes. Results from these survey years are therefore not suitable to serve as the sole basis for final determination of nutrient and food group priorities in phase I. The nutrient and food group gaps identified in this report will be re-evaluated in phase II as the NHANES 2011-2012 \"WIC\" identifier is incorporated into the analysis. 7. Breastfeeding promotion and support appear to play a role in the improvement of breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity among WIC participants. The 2009 changes to the food package to improve support for breastfeeding women were associated with only limited positive changes in breastfeeding behavior. There may be additional possibilities for aligning the food packages with support for breastfeeding women. 8. The current WIC food packages provide adequate options for participants with most major food allergies, celiac disease, and food intolerances, but inclusion of substitutions for eggs and fish may be warranted. 9. Vendors and manufacturers were able to adapt to the 2009 food package changes with some challenges.

To determine whether regulatory changes made to WIC food packages are associated with coincident changes in program participation, the committee compared the number of WIC participants with data to the number of individuals eligible for program participation at the state level (USDA/FNS, 2015a). The resulting proportion of participants reflects both the program generosity (the income limit for participation in the program) as well as the number of categorically and income eligible individuals by state and year, with the eligibility calculations including adjustments for income eligibility or eligibility through participation in other programs as well as other adjustments made to the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement data (USDA/FNS, 2015b). The committee plotted these trends and estimated models of these program coverage rates, that is, the number of participants/number eligible by state and year as a function of what share of the year the new package was in effect for, state-fixed effects, and some controls for the state of the economy (the unemployment rate), and, in some specifications, year fixed effects and program participation rates per person in the state (participation rates in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF] and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] program and participation rates in the regular, extended and emergency Unemployment Compensation program [Bitler and Hoynes, 2013]). The state fixed effects controlled for time invariant differences in state participation among WIC eligibles, and the year-fixed effects controlled for national level shocks. The committee included these in the model because there was variation in the exact month of implementation of the 2009 food package change across states, with New York and Delaware implementing in January and many other states not implementing until the regulatory deadline (dates are reported in Appendix F of USDA/FNS, 2012). The models were estimated by both ordinary least squares and weighted least squares with the eligibility totals used as weights to produce population-representative results. The data span the period from 2006 to 2012. The variance/covariance matrices and associated inference allow for arbitrary within-state correlations of the error terms. Note that the eligibility shares were only available for all WIC participants rather than by eligibility category. Figure 1-5 from Chapter 1 shows the time series of the aggregate national program coverage rate components-the national total number of participants by calendar year and the national total number of eligibles by calendar year. There is little evidence that the number of participants changes in 2009 any more than the number of eligible persons. Figure E-1 shows coverage rates (take up by eligible individuals) for selected states. Again, coverage does not seem to move systematically in 2009. The raw correlation between the annual coverage rate and the share of the year a state had the new package in place is 0.031 (i.e., holding everything else constant, implementing the new package everywhere would be associated with a 3.1 percentage point increase in the coverage rate relative to a pre-2009 rate of 61 percentage points). However, 2009 marks the end of the Great Recession (using the NBER ending date) and also marks the peak year for the number of WIC eligibles in the data (shown in Figure 1-5), suggesting the importance of adjusting these comparisons for the business cycle. Further, associated with the stimulus, there were expansions in the generosity of SNAP benefits (which ended in November 2013), expansions in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages matching rate for Medicaid expenditures, and a stimulus associated TANF emergency fund. Since categorically eligible individuals who participate in any of these programs are automatically eligible for WIC, there is possible concern that failing to control for effects of other programs might bias estimates of the effects of the initial rollout of the new food package. The committee therefore estimated a series of regressions with the unemployment rate and unemployment insurance recipiency per capita as well as SNAP and TANF caseloads per capita as controls in addition to state and year-fixed effects (regression results and controls in Table E-1). Once controlling for state-fixed differences and time effects, or alternatively, the unemployment rate, the coefficient on the share of the year for which the new package was in effect falls in magnitude and it is no longer statistically significant. This also holds if we add controls for the monthly average of Aid to Families with Dependent Children/TANF and food stamp caseloads per capita. The results suggest no significant difference comparing participation before to participation after implementation of the new food package, with and without the year fixed effects and other program participation rates. Further, the coefficients on the share of the year the new package was in effect are small in magnitude, with a typical estimate being 0.014 (again, on a pre-2009 baseline mean of 0.61 or 61 percentage points).   Each column represents a separate regression, and there is one observation per state-year combination. N is 357. The baseline mean for the participation rate is 0.608, and the baseline mean for the unemployment rate is 0.074. The key dependent variable is the state-by-year count of participants in WIC divided by an estimate of the number of WIC eligibles, using a series of reports on WIC-eligible estimation. The key independent variable is the share of each year during which a state had implemented the new food packages taken from USDA/FNS, 2012. The regressions are weighted by the total number of eligibles, and variance-covariance matrices allow for arbitrary autocorrelation within state. a P < .10 b P < .05 SOURCE: USDA/FNS, 2012.

To do this, the method described in IOM (2000) was applied using the DRI for assessment of intake of individuals and groups and z-scores were computed for each respondent as follows: a. Usual intake at the individual level was first estimated as the best linear unbiased predictor of intake (BLUP). The BLUP has the smallest prediction error variance among all linear predictors b. The difference between the individual's estimated usual intake of the nutrient and the EAR for the nutrient was then computed c. A z-score was computed as the ratio of the difference to the standard error of that difference. d. Finally, the probability of observing a z-value that was at least as large as the one we observed for the individual was computed and multiplied by 100. These calculations were repeated for all the nutrients included in the index.
