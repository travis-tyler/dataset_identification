[{"section_title": "2", "text": "The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS- belonging to the family of Coronaviridae and to the genus Betacoronaviridae, emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has already been introduced in 185 countries to date (1, 2) . In UK it has caused more than 166,443 reported cases and 26,097 death and in Brazil 80,246 cases and 5,541 deaths have already been reported, last update April 30 th , 2020 (2) . On March 11th, the WHO declared a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, reinforcing the need for all countries to implement measures for rapid detection and characterization of the virus to help mitigate virus transmission.\nGenomic surveillance has become a useful tool for better understanding virus pathogenicity, origin and spread. Obtaining accurately assembled, complete viral genomes directly from clinical samples is still a challenging task due to the low amount of viral nucleic acid in the clinical specimen compared to host DNA, and to the size of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is around 30 kb in length. Despite those limitations, we developed a sequencing protocol that successfully obtained whole genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples referred to the National Reference laboratory at FIOCRUZ in Brazil. This protocol was further optimised for higher throughput sequencing at University College London Pathogen Genomics Unit and UCL Genomics to sequence genomes for the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK).\nThe tiling amplicon multiplex PCR method has been previously used for virus sequencing directly from clinical samples to obtain consensus genome sequences (3). This protocol has been applied to Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing (3) (4) (5) (6) using preferentially short amplicons (~ 450 base pairs). Nanopore sequencing allows rapid turnaround times (1-2 days) for obtaining a consensus sequence directly from clinical samples and a allows faster response during an outbreak. In this study, we adapted this protocol to recover longer 2 kb reads, decreasing the number of primers required and thus reducing possible mismatches and/or undesired interactions. Additionally, it is easier to assemble larger viral genomes from longer reads enabling higher depth coverage (more than 100 x) in a reduced sequencing time.\nHere, we describe three protocols using a primer set designed to sequence SARS-CoV-2 directly from total RNA extracted from clinical samples, which were initially diagnosed using real-time RT-PCR (7, 8) . The protocols described herein can be applied to different sequencing platforms, such as Sanger, Illumina and Oxford Nanopore, and therefore are useful, accessible and adaptable to laboratories with different resources and sequencing facilities. By using this protocol, we generated 18 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (15 from clinical samples and 3 isolates from "}, {"section_title": "Primer design", "text": "A set of 17 primer pairs (Supplementary Table 1 Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Primer validation and Sanger sequencing", "text": "The primers were tested in silico using the Geneious R9 software against the 19 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes at that moment.

The reads were mapped 5 to Wuhan Strain MN908947, duplicate reads were removed from the alignment and the consensus sequence called at a threshold of 10X. The entire workflow was carried out in CLC Genomics Workbench software version 20.0.\nFor the Oxford Nanopore sequencing data, the high accuracy base called fastq files were used as an input for analysis. The pipeline used was an adaptation of the artic-ncov2019 medaka workflow (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). We used an earlier version of the workflow which used Porechop to demultiplex the reads.

The protocol was validated with RNA extracted from some of the first COVID-19 cases detected in Brazil and then optimized and developed for automation at two sequencing facilities at UCL (PGU and UCL Genomics) in London UK. Alternative protocols for Illumina platform, based on an initial amplification of larger fragments (8kb and 10.5kb) produced by one-step RT-PCR with high fidelity enzyme blends were also tested. However, they were prone to producing false mutations, likely due errors during amplification. Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 remains conserved, presenting few mutations scattered throughout the genome, the possibility of artificial mutations must be ruled out. We have demonstrated that this overlapping long amplicon multiplex PCR protocol suitable for samples with a wide range of viral loads, generating high coverage throughout the viral genome without artificial indels. It worked well on all four platforms tested (MinION, GridION, Illumina and Sanger) making it suitable for labs with distinct expertise, enabling successful rapid sequencing recovery of the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from clinical samples."}, {"section_title": "Ethical statement", "text": "The sequencing workflow optimizations were conducted with the purpose of protocol development and the samples used for this optimization were collected as part of the National Brazilian Surveillance and COG-UK London.
