[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. In this paper, we review studies that have investigated whether neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and neuroimaging measures predict decline to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prospective neuropsychological studies indicate that cognitive performance may be an excellent indicator of future progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, particularly when episodic memory is combined with tasks relying on executive control and language tasks. Research on neuropsychiatric symptoms reveal that depression, apathy, anxiety, and sleep disturbances can contribute to predictive models, though their sensitivity is typically lower than that found with cognitive measures. Finally, different structural brain imaging markers reveal excellent predictive accuracy. The paper discusses issues that will have to be addressed in future studies. First, it will be necessary to increase the evaluation of combined markers, as this may considerably improve predictive accuracy. Second, it will be necessary to move to earlier stages than MCI in order to expand the detection window. Third, processes of compensation and plasticity will have to be better investigated as research moves into earlier stages. The Consortium for the early identification of AD-Quebec (CIMA-Q) is presented as an instance of this approach, and potential batteries of measures are proposed."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed when affected patients meet criteria for dementia, a stage at which the brain has suffered sufficient damage to severely impact cognition and autonomy.

Belleville et al. / Detection of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease", "text": "determination of individuals who would benefit most from early interventions.\nStudies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be particularly contributive. Persons with MCI present a cognitive complaint that is confirmed with neuropsychological testing, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for AD. A large proportion of those individuals will develop dementia, marking the condition as a likely disease prodrome. There is also growing interest for a subjective cognitive impairment phase (SCI), preceding MCI [1] . In SCI, individuals present a cognitive complaint but perform in the normal range on classical neuropsychological tests. Importantly, not all SCI or even MCI develop dementia, an uncertainty that challenges clinicians [2] . Researchers can investigate the difference between stable and declining individuals as a way to investigate the earliest manifestations of AD. In this paper, we present a narrative review of longitudinal studies that have assessed the predictive accuracy of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and structural brain imaging measures in MCI and SCI. The initial selection of papers was based on the PRISMA guidelines [3] and the PICOS method was used to determine the research question and keywords. Because of space constraint, only the most relevant papers will be presented here. Our purpose is to recommend a combination of tests or measures that provide the best overall predictive accuracy for clinical practice or future studies.\nIn the MCI population progressing to AD, hippocampal (HC) and entorhinal cortex atrophy has some predictive value [57] [58] [59] . Fleisher et al. found that manually defined HC volume alone predicted conversion from MCI to AD (60% accuracy), and when combined with clinical data, predictive accuracy increased to 78.8% [60] . Stewart et al. [61] found that SCI was associated with lower HC volumes and temporal white matter lesions. In a smaller but similar sample followed longitudinally [62] , there was an association between HC volume change and subjective memory impairment at follow-up, and this relation was stronger in participants with the APOE 4 allele. Thus, HC volume seems to be an early indicator of growing cognitive impairment.\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy has also been found to be a significant predictor of conversion from MCI to AD [63] . Risacher et al. reported a similar global atrophy pattern in MCI converters and AD, and showed that baseline medial temporal atrophy was associated with conversion [64, 65] (see also [66] ). Whole brain and ventricular volumes have also been shown to predict progression, although the overall predictive accuracy level was relatively low [67] . A difference in cortical thickness has been found between normal controls, MCI and AD groups, as well as between stable and converting MCI subjects [68] . Cortical thinning [25] was associated with a 75% accuracy to discriminate progressor from stable MCI over a 2-year follow-up of 45 persons with MCI (specificity: 86.4; sensitivity: 61.1) and predictive accuracy was improved when cortical thinning measures (right anterior cingulate) were associated with memory measures (word recall and recognition), reaching an overall accuracy of 87.5% (sensitivity: 83.3; specificity: 90.9).\nMachine learning approaches using structural MRI can detect non-focal changes in the temporal lobe that have predictive value for the development of AD. In a group of 31 subjects with amnestic MCI, 22 of whom progressed to AD over an average of 2.2 years, Duchesne et al. obtained 81% overall accuracy (sensitivity: 70%; specificity: 100%) with MRI measures [69] . Fan et al. have found high predictive accuracy in 30 MCI subjects when combining MRI and PET, with AUC of 0.98 [70] . In SCI, Peter et al. have characterized the gray matter patterns of 24 SCI and 53 controls [71] and found greater similarity to an AD gray matter pattern in SCI compared to controls, and episodic memory decline was associated with an AD gray matter pattern. Thus, structural MRI measures are sensitive to the earliest signs of cognitive impairment related to AD."}, {"section_title": "COGNITION IN PRECLINICAL AD", "text": "Neuropsychological examination provides information about the presence, nature, and severity of cognitive deficits. It plays a key role in identifying AD and its MCI phase; greater knowledge regarding the impairment of specific cognitive domains can have enormous implications for the prediction of functional outcomes and for intervention planning.\nEpisodic memory refers to the record of personal events registered within a spatio-temporal context. Studies of MCI have indicated the presence of impaired episodic memory, a deficit that can be evidenced using verbal or visuo-spatial material [4] [5] [6] or with free or cued recall [4, [6] [7] [8] . Studies that have investigated the conditions underlying this memory impairment indicate a reduced ability to meaningfully encode an item [7] [8] [9] . Associative memory is the ability to associate previously unrelated items presented together or to associate one item to its spatial or temporal context. Many studies have reported impaired associative memory in MCI [4, 6, 9, 10] and a reduced level of memory recollection [11, 12] . Such deficits would reflect the early hippocampal dysfunction found in MCI. These findings indicate that memory conditions that predominantly engage recollective/associative abilities would be most sensitive to the early phases of AD. Working memory is also impaired in MCI, particularly in tasks involving on-line manipulation of information such as sentence span [13] or alphabetical recall. Furthermore, short-term retention is more impaired when delayed with interference-filled intervals in the BrownPeterson procedure [13] [14] [15] or when increasing item length in the sentence and operation span tasks [13] . Executive control-a process involved in tasks that are new or demanding-is severely impaired on tasks of inhibition (Hayling test [16, 17] , Stroop [14, 18] , rule breaking in the Tower of London [19] , Flanker task [20] ). Divided attention [21] , and global switching [22] were also found to be impaired. There is thus substantial evidence for a broad impairment of executive functions and attentional control in MCI.\nA large number of studies have examined the accuracy of cognitive tests to predict progression from MCI to AD. In this section, we will present those that have reported excellent overall predictive accuracy (>80%). Unsurprisingly, studies have revealed that a range of episodic memory tests are excellent predictors of future decline. For instance, different versions of word recall tests (Selective Reminding Test [23, 24] ; Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) [6, [25] [26] [27] ; California Verbal Learning Test [28] ; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT [29, 30] ) and Story recall [28, [31] [32] [33] tasks were found to have excellent predictive accuracy. Visual recall or recognition is less frequently reported as a strong predictor of progression [27, 33, 34] . Note that measures of non-memory domains (e.g., naming or category fluency [26, 35, 36] ) were not found to be excellent predictors, unless used in combination with episodic memory measures (see below).\nMultivariate analysis helps identify which combination of tests best predicts progression. One important finding from studies that relied on multivariate models was that a combination of memory and executive functions or language is particularly useful to predict future decline in MCI [30, 34, 37] . The mental control subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale combined with RAVLT delayed recall was shown to have a classification accuracy of 89% in memory-impaired non-demented patients, two years before AD diagnosis [30] . Similarly, high predictive accuracy was found when combining episodic memory with naming [38, 39] or verbal fluency [27, 40, 41] . Particularly high prediction values were obtained when combin-ing memory with more than one other domain. For instance, Belleville et al. followed 122 participants over an average of 4.5 years and found that a battery of tasks evaluating episodic memory (story recall and word lists), semantic memory (object naming and object decision), perception (orientation match from the Birmingham Object Recognition Battery), and working memory (Alpha span) showed an overall predictive value of 87.7% (sensitivity: 88%, specificity: 87.1%) to predict conversion from MCI to AD [42] . In another study, three computerized tests (abstract figure construction, verbal fluency, and delayed narrative recall) provided an overall predictive accuracy of 96% for conversion from MCI to AD (specificity: 99%, sensitivity: 73%) over two years [43] . Didic et al. [33] reported that combining two verbal tests (delayed story recall and object drawing recognition) provides a perfect accuracy (100%) in predicting MCI with amnestic presentation 3.5 years before the diagnosis, although this was done with a very small sample size (n = 26 at baseline).\nThe few longitudinal studies that have been used to identify predictors of progression to AD in cognitively intact older adults with a subjective complaint (SCI) typically show lower predictive accuracy than those in MCI. Derby et al. [44] showed that the FCSRT was more predictive than the Logical Memory subtest (for the four-year follow-up, sensitivity: 80.9% and 66.7%; specificity: 81.7% and 72.9% for FCSRT and Logical Memory, respectively). Jessen et al. [45] found that the best set of baseline predictors from SCI to dementia 4.5 years later comprised delayed word recall, semantic verbal fluency and MMSE performance (sensitivity: 79.6%; specificity: 66.4%). Similarly, Jungwirth et al. [46] found that verbal memory and visual motor speed performance predicted AD over five years in people who were non-demented at baseline (sensitivity: 82.8%; specificity: 82.4%). As was the case for MCI, results in SCI indicate stronger predictive accuracy when measures of episodic memory are associated with measurements of other cognitive domains, particularly the executive domain."}, {"section_title": "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND SUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS IN PRECLINICAL AD", "text": "Several longitudinal studies have revealed that neuropsychiatric manifestations and subjective complaints can be observed throughout the preclinical trajectory several years before MCI or AD onset [1] . Results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [47] indicated that larger levels of complaints on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire were related to accelerated objective memory decline over 11.5 years. Moreover, Jessen et al. [45] found that SCI accompanied by worry were associated with a higher risk of dementia over a 4.5-year follow-up compared to those who did not worry about their memory decline. Jessen et al. [48] also found that progression was as frequent in SCI accompanied by worry as in early MCI. These findings suggest that identifying the worrisome aspect of subjective memory impairment is critical to predict future cognitive decline in preclinical AD. Qualifying it as worrisome or not may thus be a critical way to differentiate older adults experiencing cognitive changes due to aging from those enduring more than the usual effects of aging [49, 50] .\nNeuropsychiatric manifestations can also help predict progression to dementia. In a clinical sample of 60 individuals with MCI, melancholic symptoms and the persistence of depression over two to three years significantly increased the risk of AD (sensitivity: 76%; specificity: 66%) [51] . In a study of 51 persons with MCI, both depression and apathy predicted progression to AD over two years [52] . Note however, that some studies failed to find an increased risk of developing AD in the presence of depression [53] . Interestingly, the same study revealed that persons with MCI experiencing apathetic symptoms were nearly seven times more likely to progress to AD than MCI without apathy (sensitivity: 35.3%; specificity: 92.7%) [53] . Finally, in a population-based sample, sleep problems in individuals with MCI almost tripled the risk of progressing to AD after two years [54] ."}, {"section_title": "STRUCTURAL IMAGING IN PRECLINICAL AD", "text": "The relationship between MRI measures and pathophysiological changes in AD has been well researched. The distribution of amyloid and tau pathology identifies stages in the disease propagation that follows a distinct sequence [55] and MRI can track this brain change pattern [56] . In addition, MRI is clinically valid. It is not invasive, it can be repeated with no risk for the patient and it is often used in clinical practice to exclude other causes for the cognitive changes. Because anatomical MRI is potentially quite sensitive to the early AD phase and is widely available in clinical practice, we restricted our review to this neuroimaging component."}, {"section_title": "S378", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION", "text": "An analysis of longitudinal studies of SCI and MCI identifies a range of potential markers for prodromal and preclinical AD. For cognition, excellent predictive levels (>80%) can be found using episodic measures, but better accuracy is obtained by adding executive and/or language tests. In general, combining cognitive tests helps predict conversion from MCI to dementia well above an 80% level of accuracy. For neuroimaging, a range of structural measures were identified as good predictors of future decline and some studies have reported excellent predictive accuracy as well. Although studies combining cognitive and neuroimaging measures are not frequent, they systematically report that this combination substantially improves their predictive models. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were found to contribute to predictive models. It is notable, however, that neuropsychiatric symptoms have much lower predictive accuracy than cognitive measures or brain imaging. This is due in large part to the fact that they have relatively low sensitivity compared to their specificity. This pattern reflects the possibility that those symptoms are only found in a particular subgroup of patients. Practically, it means that their presence signals an elevated risk of future AD, although their absence does not necessarily indicate that the patient is protected against the disease.\nMost of the previous studies aforementioned have limitations. First, in many cases, their design was retrospective: a prospective design is necessary to distinguish reference standard from predictive tests. Secondly, most studies have relied on clinical tests, while more sophisticated tests are likely to be more sensitive and/or specific (e.g., [42] ). Similar issues were found in neuroimaging studies. For instance, HC volumes are variable and there is considerable overlap with normal aging [72] . Some of the variance may result from the difficulty in accurately measuring HC volume. The use of standardized, quantitative, automated programs for calculating HC volumes will reduce this source of variance. Amongst the reviewed studies, most report predictive accuracies over a 2-3 year period, which is relatively short. This is in part due to methodological constraints, as many studies have a relatively short follow-up. Furthermore, the majority of these studies enrolled MCI patients, who progress to dementia at a rate of about 15% per year; most will have converted after a 3-4 year period. MCI is as a highly dynamic prodromal period, and not the optimal one in which to identify the earliest markers of AD. As one moves away from the time of the diagnosis, the magnitude of the effects will likely be reduced and logically, studies that investigated methods to predict AD in SCI reported lower predictive accuracies than those on MCI.\nIt is likely that, as one moves earlier into the disease time course, concepts such as brain reserve, plasticity, and compensation will influence symptom expression and development. Increasing evidence indicates that during the early MCI phase, some individuals compensate structural brain changes by increasing functional recruitment (a pattern referred to as hyperactivation) [73] [74] [75] [76] . This suggests that task-related activation as measured by PET or fMRI might represent a powerful biomarker for early AD, and could be used to understand why structural changes are not perfect predictors of future decline. However, these mechanisms may vary among individuals as a function of their accumulated or genetically determined brain reserve. Furthermore, neuroimaging brain changes evidenced decades before the earliest signs of cognitive impairment may not be so much signs of neurodegeneration but the expression of genetic risk states for AD, and/or markers of inter-individual variability of cognitive performance due to genetic or environmental factors [77] . So far, most studies have assumed that measures contribute in a systematic and coordinated manner to disease expression. However, as the field moves into earlier phases, it will be necessary to have a more complex approach and to assess the combination of predictors, their interactions, and the role of protective and compensatory factors on disease expression.\nThe goal of this review was to identify predictors supporting the early identification of AD. Our research indicates that clear markers of AD are present at least 2-5 years prior to diagnosis and that this can be used to construct a battery that would support clinicians into identifying persons at risk of future decline. Table 1 indicates a set of measures with high predictive accuracy as well as additional more sensitive measures (in italics) or measures of brain reserve. This is the battery proposed by the Consortium for the early identification of AD-Quebec (CIMA-Q; http://www.cima-q.ca), of which three of the authors (SB, CH, and SD) are leaders. The goal of CIMA-Q is to identify sensitive, valid, and clinically relevant functional and diagnostic markers, discover novel therapeutic targets, and refine preventive strategies. It involves a set of integrated research platforms including a longitudinal cohort registry of healthy older adults, MCI, and SCI who will receive multimodal assessment as identified in Table 1 . Our literature review indicates that finding early markers of AD will require designing complex studies relying on a multidimensional approach, including larger sample sizes, combining multiple markers, and identifying populations at risk to enrich the sample. This will only be possible through large and collaborative research initiatives."}]
