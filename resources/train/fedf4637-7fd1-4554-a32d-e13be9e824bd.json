[{"section_title": "", "text": "A symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in the general population, 1,2 and individuals with CAD are at greater risk than those who are disease free to progress to symptomatic CAD and cardiac death. 1, 2 Early identification and preventive treatment for asymptomatic CAD can potentially lower the risk for subsequent symptomatic CAD. The exercise ECG remains the most commonly used screening method to detect asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Numerous studies have shown that an ischemic ST-segment response to exercise is a risk factor for future coronary events in apparently healthy adults. [1] [2] [3] Moreover, the predictive value of exercise ECG is improved by a combined use of thallium scintigraphy. 1, 4 B-mode ultrasonography allows for the noninvasive observation of age-associated normative and pathological changes in the carotid arterial structure, including wall thickening 5, 6 and lumen enlargement. 7, 8 An association has been demonstrated between increased intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) and conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, including hypertension, 9,10 diabetes, 11, 12 hyperlipidemia, 13, 14 and cigarette smoking. 15, 16 Furthermore, several studies have shown a significant association of CCA IMT not only with cerebrovascular disease but also with clinical CAD. 6, 17 Despite the association between increased CCA IMT and clinically manifest CAD, it is unclear whether increased IMT also occurs in subjects with subclinical CAD. We hypothesized that CCA IMT would be increased in asymptomatic subjects with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. To examine this hypothesis, we performed B-mode carotid ultrasonography and maximal treadmill exercise ECG testing in a sample of apparently healthy community-dwelling volunteers. To amplify the hypothesis, we performed exercise thallium scintigraphy in those asymptomatic subjects with positive (ie, ischemic) exercise ECGs and compared IMT in the subsets defined by the thallium results.\nThe aim of this study was therefore to determine (1) whether CCA IMT is increased in asymptomatic subjects with an exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment depression and (2) whether among these asymptomatic individuals with ischemic exercise ECG, CCA IMT is larger in the subset with an abnormal exercise thallium scan than in those with a negative scan."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects were recruited from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). 18 The BLSA is made up of community-dwelling, predominantly white, college-educated volunteers who are studied approximately every 2 years with 2.5 days of extensive medical, physiological, and psychological examinations.

The stabilized BP after 15 minutes from the onset of testing was used for subsequent analyses. The right CCA was examined with the head tilted slightly upward in the midline position. The transducer was manipulated so that the near and far walls of the CCA were parallel to the transducer footprint and the lumen diameter was maximized in the longitudinal plane. A region \u03f71.5 cm proximal to the carotid bifurcation was identified, and the IMT of the far wall was evaluated as the distance between the luminal-intimal interface and the medial-adventitial interface. IMT was measured on the frozen frame of a suitable longitudinal image with the image magnified to achieve a higher resolution of detail. The IMT measurement was obtained from 5 contiguous sites at \u03f71-mm intervals, and the average of the 5 measurements was used for analyses.

With backward elimination, each 0.1-mm-greater IMT independently increased the risk for CAD by 1.91 (1.46 to 2.50) in the most parsimonious model (Table 5) . No interaction was observed among these variables."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study demonstrates a significant independent association between increased IMT and asymptomatic CAD as evidenced by ischemic ST-segment depression on the exercise ECG. Furthermore, there was a graded increase in IMT from CAD-free subjects to those with only a positive exercise ECG to those with concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium scans. These last individuals had an IMT that was essentially equal to that in patients with clinically manifest CAD. By logistic regression analysis, CCA IMT proved to be an independent predictor for manifest CAD and concordant positive exercise test results.\nA positive association between carotid and coronary atherosclerosis is well recognized. 23, 24 The increase in IMT from no CAD to possible CAD to definite CAD is consistent with the concept that coronary atherosclerosis is a continuum from normal through an asymptomatic stage to overt CAD. Furthermore, the asymptomatic CAD was independently associated with increased CCA IMT ( Table 3 ), suggesting that not only subjects with clinically manifest CAD but also those with evidence for asymptomatic CAD have increased IMT.\nTo further stratify the likelihood of asymptomatic CAD in the possible CAD group, we subdivided this group on the basis of their exercise thallium scintigraphic findings. A prior study from our laboratory demonstrated that concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium test results identify a Figure 2 . CCA IMT by CAD status defined by exercise ECG, thallium scintigraphy, and clinical manifestations. Group definitions are as follows: possible CAD-1, subset with positive exercise ECG but negative thallium scan; possible CAD-2, subset with concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium scan; and no CAD and definite CAD as defined in Figure 1 . Each point represents the mean IMT of subjects in a given age decade for a specific CAD category (*50s and 60s combined for possible CAD-2; \u202070s and 80s combined for possible CAD-1; and \u202180s and 90s combined for no CAD and definite CAD). Error bars indicate SE; numbers in parentheses indicate number of subjects represented by each data point. After adjustment for age, IMT significantly increased from no CAD to possible CAD-1 to possible CAD-2 but did not differ between possible CAD-2 and definite CAD (see Table 4 for statistics). subset of asymptomatic subjects at twice the risk for CAD events as those with a positive ECG alone, 1 with \u03f750% of these \"double positives\" developing clinical end points over a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. 2 In the present study, after adjustment for age, a graded increase in IMT was observed from CAD-free subjects to those with only a positive exercise ECG to those with concordant positive ECG and thallium tests (Table 4) . Thus, CCA IMT appears to increase in parallel with the increase in risk for myocardial ischemia as assessed by these noninvasive tests. It is noteworthy that this latter subset with asymptomatic ischemia on both exercise ECG and thallium scan demonstrated a mean IMT virtually identical to that in the group with manifest CAD (Figure 2) .\nIf CCA IMT increases in parallel with the likelihood of CAD, this association may be useful in identifying asymptomatic subjects with significant CAD. We have considered manifest CAD and asymptomatic CAD (confirmed by the concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium results) as essentially the same clinical entity on the basis of our prior observations. 1 On univariate analysis, the likelihood for CAD increased by 2.39-fold for each 0.1-mm increase in IMT. Furthermore, IMT was an independent predictor for CAD, increasing the risk by 1.91-fold for each 0.1 mm when controlling for the significant effects of age, hypertensive, and hyperlipidemic medications ( Table 5) .\nThe increase in IMT with the likelihood of CAD appears to be similar for both women and men. Men have thicker IMT than women at all levels of CAD status, but the degree of thickening going from no CAD to possible to definite CAD was similar by sex. In the multiple regression analysis (Table  3 , model 2), sex did not add to the prediction of IMT when stage of CAD was included. Also, sex did not affect the prediction of CAD by IMT (Table 3 ). However, with only 8 women with definite CAD and 2 women with possible CAD-2, our power to detect sex differences was limited in Table 3 .\nAlthough the overlap of CCA IMT between non-CAD and CAD subjects (Figure 1 ) precludes the use of IMT alone as a diagnostic marker for CAD, our observation suggests the utility of further screening for CAD in subjects with increased IMT, even if asymptomatic. As suggested in Table 5 , such screening would likely be most useful in older subjects with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. The threshold for exercise screening will depend on factors such as the pretest likelihood of CAD, the age and lifestyle of the individual, and the cost of exercise testing. Although aggressive medical or surgical treatment of silent myocardial ischemia has proven beneficial in patients with symptomatic CAD, 25, 26 the utility of such therapy in totally asymptomatic subjects remains unclear.\nIn addition, regression or slowed progression of IMT has been reported in subjects on lipid-lowering therapy. 27 If IMT changes in parallel with the progression of CAD, serial measurement of IMT may serve as a noninvasive marker for the efficacy of risk factor modification with antihypertensive 28 and lipid-lowering therapy. 27 Prior studies have shown independent effects of age and conventional coronary risk factors on CCA IMT. 9 -16 In the present study, IMT increased with age, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and each lipid measure (Table 2 ) and was larger in men and in smokers. However, independent associations were confirmed only with age, systolic BP, male sex, and TChol/ HDL (Table 3 , model 1). Age, systolic BP, and TChol/HDL remained significant predictors of IMT even after CAD status was included in the model (Table 3 , model 2), suggesting their strong atherogenic effects. The relatively low mean levels of FPG, TChol, and LDL-C in the BLSA subjects, as well as the low prevalence of smokers, probably account for their weak associations with IMT.\nOne limitation of the present study was a reliance on exercise ECG and thallium scintigraphy to stratify the likelihood of CAD. Although the ability of these exercise testing modalities to identify asymptomatic individuals at higher risk for a future coronary event has been shown in the BLSA 1, 3 and in other studies, 2, 29 such noninvasive stratification is imperfect.\nIn summary, this study demonstrates a significant association between asymptomatic exercise-induced myocardial ischemia and increased CCA IMT, similar to that seen in patients with manifest CAD. Although the primary purpose of carotid ultrasonography is not the detection of CAD, determination of IMT may help to identify asymptomatic individ- uals with a high likelihood for CAD and provide a noninvasive window for monitoring the efficacy of risk factor modification in these subjects."}]
