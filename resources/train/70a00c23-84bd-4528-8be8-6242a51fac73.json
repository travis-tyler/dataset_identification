However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent A\u03b2 burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that A\u03b2-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns.\nOBJECTIVE To examine relationships between A\u03b2 and non-A\u03b2 factors as well as neurodegeneration within AD regions in cognitively normal older adults. The study quantified neurodegenerative abnormalities using imaging biomarkers and examined cross-sectional relationships with A\u03b2 deposition; white matter lesions (WMLs), a marker of cerebrovascular disease; and cognitive functions. \nFor each individual, 3 AD-sensitive neurodegeneration biomarkers were measured: hippocampal volume, glucose metabolism, and gray matter thickness, the latter 2 sampled from cortical AD-affected regions. To quantify neurodegenerative abnormalities, each biomarker was age adjusted, dichotomized into a normal or abnormal status (using cutoff thresholds derived from an independent AD sample), and summarized into 0, 1, or more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker. Degree and topographic patterns of neurodegenerative abnormalities were assessed and their relationships with cognitive functions, WML volume, and A\u03b2 deposition (quantified using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography).\nOf our cognitively normal elderly individuals, 40% (n = 29) displayed at least 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker, 26% (n = 19) of whom had no evidence of elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention. In those people who were classified as having abnormal cortical thickness, degree and topographic specificity of neurodegenerative abnormalities were similar to patients with AD. Accumulation of neurodegenerative abnormalities was related to poor memory and executive functions as well as larger WML volumes but not elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study confirms that a substantial proportion of cognitively normal older adults harbor neurodegeneration, without A\u03b2 burden. Associations of neurodegenerative abnormalities with cerebrovascular disease and cognitive performance indicate that neurodegenerative pathology can emerge through non-A\u03b2 pathways within regions most affected by AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "mented abnormalities in neurodegenerative biomarkers proposed to be sensitive to AD in 23% of cognitively normal (NC) older people who have no brain A\u03b2, a group termed SNAP (suspected non-AD pathology). 3, 4 Similarly, we recently reported the absence of direct relationships between A\u03b2 deposition and neurodegeneration in regions affected by AD. 5 As biomarkers purporting to reflect AD-related neurodegeneration are clinically applied, it is important to characterize prevalence, degree, and topographic distribution of such neurodegenerative abnormalities and associations with other possible etiologies, such as cerebrovascular disease.

We defined thresholds for abnormality in cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, and hippocampal volume (HV) using samples of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) NC (A\u03b2  \u2212 ) individuals and patients with AD and applied these thresholds to a separate cohort of NC older people. We sought to compare the proportions of individuals with neurodegenerative biomarker abnormalities with previous studies, 3 examine degree and topographic distribution of neural injury captured by the biomarkers, and assess relationships between biomarker abnormality and cognition.

Abnormal thinning within cortical AD regions matched degree and topographic distribution of cortical thinning seen in patients with AD. Accumulation of abnormal neurodegenerative biomarkers was related to lower cognitive function and larger WML volumes. Our findings suggest that an AD-typical neurodegenerative pattern can emerge through non-A\u03b2 pathways and affect cognition in NC older adults.\nAlthough neither the BAC sample nor the ADNI samples are likely to be representative of a community-type sample of older people, the proportions of abnormal neurodegenerative biomarkers were highly similar to the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a community sample in which 29% of NC individuals had 1 and 8% had more than 1 abnormal biomarker. 3 Cognitively normal older people with abnormal cortical thickness most closely resembled patients with AD in degree and topographic specificity of cortical thinning. However, those with abnormal FDG-PET showed hypometabolism in the AD ROI comparable with patients with AD, but the ROI ratio indicated a topography less typical of AD, suggesting a more global pattern of hypometabolism. For people with HV abnormality, gray matter reductions were intermediate to normal BAC NC cases and patients with AD and more topographically restricted, yet the disproportionate loss of HV compared with the cortex was typical of AD. Together these results indicate that, while biomarker abnormalities present in NC older people are quite similar to those seen in AD, they are not necessarily identical in degree and topographic specificity. Neurodegenerative abnormalities in cortical thickness and FDG-PET were associated with decreased memory performance and executive functions. The presence of more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker accounted for lowest cognitive abilities in our sample. The accumulation of neurodegenerative biomarker abnormalities might reflect a more severe brain pathological stage that could potentially increase the risk of longitudinal cognitive decline 24 as well as development of clinical AD. 25, 26 Brain A\u03b2 deposition was not a necessary associate of neurodegenerative abnormalities. Similar to the 23% proportion of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging individuals, 3 26% of the BAC NC individuals harbored neurodegenerative abnormalities without concurrent fibrillar A\u03b2. Instead, neurodegenerative abnormalities in cortical thickness and FDG-PET were positively associated with WML volumes; the relationship was most evident when more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker was present. The result mirrors existing findings, showing that WML measures are related to gray matter atrophy including AD regions, which is tied to decreased cognitive functions in NC individuals. 8 The data imply that AD-typical neurodegenerative abnormalities can result from non-A\u03b2 pathways in NC older people. Such neural injury could be nonspecific to AD pathogenesis but increase the brain's vulnerability to A\u03b2 burden, since both factors interact to lower cognition. 5, 27, 28 This explanation would not necessarily contradict the potential importance of A\u03b2-plaque burden in preclinical staging of AD.\n2 Existing data also demonstrate that fibrillar A\u03b2 can drive gray matter injury [29] [30] [31] and cognitive decline. 28, 29, 32, 33 Alternatively, non-A\u03b2 neurodegenerative pathways might also play a direct role in the development of AD, since patients with mild cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration without A\u03b2 burden have almost the same risk of conversion to AD as those with both A\u03b2 and neurodegeneration. 34 Our study is limited by its cross-sectional nature and small sample size, which also restricted the analyses of different combinations of abnormal neurodegenerative biomarkers. Differences in sensitivity of the neurodegenerative biomarkers might also have influenced our results. In general, however, converging data from multiple studies suggest that abnormality in neurodegenerative biomarkers can occur in NC older people regardless of A\u03b2 deposition, which needs consideration in preclinical stages of AD.
