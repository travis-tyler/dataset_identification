[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Overfishing of bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean has motivated a search for pratical means of reducing bigeye catch. We develop a classification algorithm for the presence/absence of bigeye in purse-seine sets on floating objects, the dominant mode of purse-seining for bigeye, using the tree-based method random forests to explore the effects of gear characteristics. Although the location of the set was the strongest determinant of the presence of bigeye catch with these data, in some areas, bigyeye were more likely to be caught on floating objects with greater underwater depths and with deeper purse-seine nets. Misclassified sets were found to be concentrated within certain vessels, suggesting that the existence of additional 'vessel effects' on the presence of bigeye which may be amenable to further study. Results indicate that fishermen can avoid catching bigeye in some areas by changing the depth of the material hanging from the floating object and the actual fishing depth of the net, or by moving to other fishing areas.\nHowever, we believe that the complex nature of gear and environmental interactions, and the impact of gear restrictions on the catches of tuna species other than bigeye, argue 1 against the feasibility of fishery-wide gear restrictions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite recent efforts to improve the status of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), the most recent stock assessment (Maunder and Hoyle, 2007) indicates that fishing mortality remains too high to be sustainable. Management of the bigeye tuna population in the EPO is complicated (Maunder and Harley, 2006) .\nBigeye tuna is caught predominantly by longline and purse-seine gears, with approximately half the catch of bigeye occurring in purse-seine sets made on floating objects (IATTC, 2006a) . However, the dominant tuna catch in these floating object sets is skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), and the skipjack population in the EPO is estimated to be healthy. Thus, one of the management goals has been to find means of reducing catches of bigeye tuna in the purse-seine fishery on floating objects while minimizing losses of skipjack catch. Implementation of seasonal closures since 2000 affecting both purse-seine and longline fisheries have not provided an adequate reduction in bigeye tuna fishing mortality. Given that operationally-feasible time-area closures are unlikely to result in a sustainable bigeye fishery (Harley and Suter, 2007) , other options, including gear modifications, are currently being explored (Maunder, 2006) .\nFloating object sets that capture bigeye tuna appear to be concentrated within vessels.\nAll three tuna species, bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) , that are targeted by the purse-seine fishery in the EPO, are caught in floating object sets. Based on data collected by Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) observers during , approximately 54% of floating object sets by large vessels (> 363 mt fish-carrying capactiy) yielded catches of bigeye tuna, compared to 81% for yellowfin tuna and 93% for skipjack tuna. Yet total catches of bigeye tuna on floating objects are greater than those of yellowfin tuna on floating objects. Of the 158 vessels represented by these data, 28% did not catch any bigeye tuna. Floating object sets, regardless of the catch, tended to be concentrated within vessels. However, even accounting for this, the relationship between numbers of sets on floating objects and numbers of sets on floating objects that caught bigeye, by vessel, is not linear (Figure 1 ). This is contrary to what would be expected if sets per vessel that caught bigeye tuna were proportional to total sets. Although the specific vessels making the most sets on bigeye tuna changes from year to year, one possible explanation for this pattern is that each year some vessels increase their chances of catching bigeye tuna by where and when they fish, the gear that they use, and/or combinations of these options.\nIt has been suggested that some gear characteristics affected tuna catches during the 1993-1998 period of this fishery (Lennert-Cody and Hall, 2000) . However, this was a time when the fishery on floating objects was in transition from a fishery on flotsam (e.g., tree limbs) in nearshore areas to a largely fish-aggregating device (FAD)-associated fishery further offshore. Although partial confounding of gear and environmental factors is to be expected with fishery-dependent data, particularly in the EPO where there exist strong environmental gradients (e.g., Kessler, 2006) , the need to find operationallyfeasible means of reducing fishing mortality of bigeye tuna in the current FADdominated fishery, the availability of more comprehensive environmental data (e.g., ocean color), and the availability of improved descriptive statistical techniques for large data sets (e.g., Berk, 2006) suggests that gear effects warrant further study. Because vertical stratification of tuna species around floating objects has been noted by fishermen and fisheries observers, and identified through research (Schaefer and Fuller, 2002) , with bigeye deeper in the water column than skipjack, the current analysis focuses on aspects of the fishinging gear that might interact with vertical structure of the object-associated community, thereby affecting catch composition.\nIn this manuscript we present an analysis of the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch in purse-seine sets on floating objects for the 2001-2005 period. Given the results of the most recent stock assessments for bigeye tuna (Maunder and Harley, 2006; Maunder and Hoyle, 2007) , and the fact that almost half of floating object sets caught no bigeye, we focus on understanding processes that led to any amount of bigeye catch. The tree-based method random forests (Breiman, 2001 ) was used to build a classification algorithm for sets with and without bigeye tuna catch, placing more emphasis on correctly predicting the presence of catch. With this analysis, we attempt to determine: 1) how well the presence of bigeye catch can be described by characteristics of the environment, and the fishing operation and gear; 2) whether there is spatial structure in any gear effects; and, 3) the extent to which there may exist additional 'vessel effects' on the presence of bigeye catch beyond the explanatory ability of the predictors included in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data used in this analysis are from purse-seine sets on floating objects collected by IATTC observers aboard large vessels (> 363 mt fish-carrying capacity) between 2001 and 2005. The IATTC sampled over 67% of all fishing trips of large vessels over this five-year period (e.g., IATTC, 2006b), amounting to over 75% IATTC observer coverage of floating object sets of large vessels. The IATTC onboard observer program is described in Bayliff (2001) . Data were limited to sets that caught some amount of at least one of the three target species to avoid observations for which the fish escaped capture.\nRepeated sets on the same floating object, where they could be identified, were excluded (> 85% of sets were deemed 'first' sets). Data collected prior to 2001 were not included in this analysis to avoid potential trends in biases in tuna species identification. In particular, in 2000 the IATTC implemented a system for tracking tuna catch as part of the AIDCP 'dolphin safe' certification. As part of this process, the observer may discuss catch composition with the vessel's fishing captain. In addition, in 2000 the IATTC passed a resolution encouraging vessels to retain all tuna catch (IATTC, 2000) . This resolution has been renewed annually, but the degree of compliance is unclear (IATTC, unpublished data). Because tunas found in association with floating objects can be of small size, and hence less marketable, strict compliance with the resolution might affect a vessel's decision as to whether to initiate a set. After data processing, a total of 10,421 floating object sets was available for analysis.\nOver 85% of the floating objects set upon during this five-year period were estimated to have been FADs (IATTC, 2006a) . FADs may be constructed of a variety of materials, but the most typical construction is a raft (often of bamboo) with old purse-seine netting hanging underneath. FADs often carry some form of locating device (e.g., radio transmitter, satellite transmitter).\nTo describe variability in the occurrence of bigeye tuna catch, 22 predictors were considered in this analysis (see Table 1 for details). These predictors can be divided roughly into three groups: those describing aspects of fishing operations and gear, those describing the environment, and miscellaneous predictors. There were eight predictors included to describe aspects of the fishing operations and gear, five of which relate directly to the fishing depth of the purse-seine net or the underwater depth of the floating object. The actual in-water depth of both will vary depending on a number of factors, including winds and currents. Moreover, the fishing depth of the net is determined not only by its hanging depth, but also the rate at which it descends. For a given set of environmental conditions, the descent rate of the net is a function of mesh size, dolphin safety panel use, the 'hang-in' (number of meshes per unit length along the cork line), and the weight of the purse cable and chain. Data were available on the hanging depth of the net, its mesh size, presence of a safety panel, and the duration of the period over which the net descends to its fishing depth (Green, 1969) . Data were also available on the maximum underwater depth of the floating object. Environmental predictors included relate to measures of upper-ocean circulation (e.g., major currents, eddies), stratification and productivity. With the exception of sea surface temperature, environmental predictors represent climatologies estimated at set locations and dates. Location and date of the set were also included as proxies for local environmental conditions not captured by the other predictors. The two miscellaneous predictors were a proxy for the non-tuna community size at the object, and a proxy for the local floating object density.\nAs would be anticipated, given the opportunistic nature of the data collection process, the inshore-offshore orientation of the fishery (Figure 2 ), and the gradients in the oceanographic environment (Kessler, 2006) , several of these predictors are partially correlated (Table 2 ). For example, correlation between environmental predictors and predictors such as percent fouling likely result because floating objects will have a tendency to drift offshore in many areas of the EPO. The oceanography and bathymetry of the EPO result in correlations between latitude and longitude, and many environmental predictors such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a density, and mixed layer depth.\nIn addition, some gear and operational predictors are inherently correlated. For example, larger vessels (greater fish-carrying capacity) can carry larger nets which may have greater hanging depths than smaller nets. Larger vessels can fish further offshore due to their greater fish-and fuel-carrying capacities. Examples of the spatial dependence of several gear predictors are shown in Figure 3 .\nThe classification of each set as to the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch was based on the catch weights. Both catch weights (loaded weights plus discards) and loaded weights are estimated by observers. We use catch weights because they may more closely reflect the ecological relationship between the object-associated community and the environment and fishing gear."}, {"section_title": "Methods of analysis", "text": "With this analysis, we want to determine: how well the presence of bigeye tuna catch can be described by characteristics of the environment, fishing operations and gear; whether there is spatial structure in any gear effects; and, whether there may exist additional 'vessel effects'. Towards this end, the ensemble method 'random forests' (Breiman, 2001; Berk, 2006) was used to build a classification algorithm for the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch. The random forest method has been demonstrated to build better classification algorithms than other methods (Breiman, 2001 ). In addition, the estimates of misclassification errors provided by the random forest method are true forecasting errors, and the relative costs of the two types of mistakes that can be made (predicting bigeye catch when none occurred -'false positive'; predicting no bigeye catch when in fact there was catch -'false negative') can be easily specified. Our overall approach is similar to that of Lennert-Cody and Berk (2007) .\nRandom forests is a tree-based algorithm that builds on the classical Classification and Regression Tree approach (CART; Breiman et al., 1984) . It can be described in three conceptual steps. First, a large number of CART-like trees (a 'forest') are constructed, each on a different randomly selected sample from the original data. Observations not included in a particular random sample are referred to as 'out-of-bag' or 'OOB.' Second, each tree in the forest is built in a manner that is similar to a CART tree, but with two important differences: the candidate predictors that are available to define each node in the tree are a randomly selected subset of all predictors, drawn anew for each node; and, the resulting tree is not pruned. Finally, the predicted class of an observation by the forest is determined by majority vote among the individual trees for which the observation was OOB. (The predicted class of an observation from an individual tree in the forest is the dominant class on the relevant terminal node.) Details of the random forest algorithm can be found in Breiman (2001) and Berk (2006) .\nWe use the R statistical computing (R Core Development Team, 2005) package randomForest (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) to build a random forest classification algorithm for these data. The data set was randomly divided (by year) into two parts: a training data set with 5,210 sets (2,827 sets with bigeye, 2,383 without) and a test data set with 5,211 sets (2,844 sets with bigeye, 2,367 without). All classification algorithms were built on the training data set. The test data set was used to explore 'vessel effects' as described below. In the context of the current problem, it seems reasonable to place equal, if not added, emphasis on correctly predicting the presence of bigeye tuna catch when it occurred. Thus, we consider two different relative costs: equal relative costs of false negatives and false positives, and the relative cost of false negatives three times that of false positives. The different relative costs were achieved by building forests on data sets with different proportions of presence and absence observations (sampsize option in the randomForest package). Each classification algorithm was based on 5,000 trees.\nWithin the combinations of environmental conditions, locations, and fishing dates in the data set, we summarize the effects of gear characteristics on the presence of bigeye catch in several ways. The relative importance of each predictor was computed as the average percent decrease in prediction accuracy on the OOB data when the predictor's values were scrambled (Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Berk, 2006) . In addition, the relationship of each of the most influential gear predictors to the occurrence of bigeye catch were summarized by plotting the logit of the proportion if trees in the forest that voted for the presence of bigeye tuna versus the predictor (a form of 'partial dependence;' e.g., Hastie et al., 2001 ). This provides an estimate of the effect of a particular predictor on the 'probability' that a set was classified as having caught bigeye tuna, taking into account the average effects of the other predictors. To look for spatial structure in these relationships, these partial depedence plots were also constructed within each of 40 rectangular areas (10\u00b0 longitude by 2.5\u00b0 latitude, between 90-140\u00b0W and 12.5\u00b0S-7.5\u00b0N).\nThe size of the rectangular areas and the overall region were selected according to the large-scale circulation patterns of the EPO (Kessler, 2006) and the spatial distribution of the floating object fishery (Figure 2 ).\nTo explore 'vessel effects,' beyond what can be described by the available predictors, we compared observed and reported set classifications of the test data set. We focus on false negatives, bigeye tuna caught but none predicted, because this type of error may indicate alternative fishing strategies that were successful with respect to bigeye tuna.\nBecause there are different numbers of sets per vessel in the data set (Figure 1) , we compare the number of misclassifications of sets that caught bigeye to that which would be predicted from a binomial distribution. The binomial parameter was taken to be the false negative rate. In other words, for each vessel we computed the probability that out of n sets that caught bigeye tuna there would have been r or more sets for which no bigeye tuna were predicted. We refer to these probabilities as 'per-vessel' probabilities.\nThere is no convincing way to assess the extent that observations within vessels are independent, and thus we use the per-vessel probabilities as a relative measure of 'vessel effects;' the smaller the probability, the more unusual the data of that vessel with respect to the data of other vessels."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The random forest classifier was reasonably successful at predicting the occurrence of sets with bigeye tuna catch (Table 3) . Misclassification errors at equal relative costs for false negatives and false positives were 15% for sets that caught bigeye tuna and 18% for sets that did not (Table 3a) . When emphasis was placed on the correct classification of sets with bigeye tuna (relative costs of false negatives three times that of false positives), the false negative rate decreased from 15% to 8%, while the false positive rate increased from 18% to 29% (Table 3b ). (Achieving a false negative error rate of less than 8% would require higher relative costs, which may not be acceptable.) When location and date predictors were not included in the classifier, but the re quirement of three to one relative costs was maintained, the false negative rate increased by 2%, while the false positive rate increased by about 6% (Table 3c ).\nPredictor importance shows indication of strengths among some gear and environmental predictors, even though the location of the set appeared to be the most influential in determining whether a set caught bigeye (Figure 4) . Of the gear and environmental predictors included in this analysis, object depth, chlorophyll-a density, bathymetry, mixed layer depth, and sea surface temperature appeared to be the most useful for predicting the presence of bigeye tuna catch with this data set. The relative dominance of gear and environmental predictors remained largely the same when location and date predictors were not included in the classification algorithm, except that object depth became slightly less important while net depth became slightly more important (Figure 4) . The overall weak levels of variable importance would be anticipated given the correlations between predictors (Table 2) ; when a specific predictor is not selected to define a node of a given tree, some of its predictive ability may be captured by other predictors with which it is correlated.\nThe marginal effects of object depth and net depth, the two most important gear predictors that directly relate to the in-water depth of the gear (Figure 4) , are shown in Figure 5 for the classification algorithm with three to one relative costs (Table 3b ).\nOverall, sets were more likely to be classified as having caught bigeye tuna the greater the object depth and the greater the net depth. However, the marginal effects decreased somewhat on the deepest objects and with the deepest nets. Within the region of 90\u00b0-140\u00b0W and 12.5\u00b0S-7.5\u00b0N, the greatest marginal effects of object depth were found between 100\u00b0-130\u00b0W along the equator and in the southern area of the fishery, and offshore north of the equator between 2.5\u00b0-5.0\u00b0N (Figure 6 ). Object depth appeared to have little effect on whether a set was classified as having caught bigeye tuna in the inshore areas and in the northern most areas. Similar but less pronounced spatial structure is evident in the marginal effect of net depth (Figure 7 ). Also evident in Figures 6-7 is the influence of set location. For example, marginal effects in the inshore areas are clearly less than further offshore, regardless of latitude and gear.\nIn the test data set, there were 105 vessels over the five-year period that made at least one set catching bigeye tuna. The frequency distribution of per-vessel probabilities computed for these vessels using a binomial parameter of 0.08 (Table 3b ) is shown in Figure 8 . Per-vessel probabilities at or close to 1.0 correspond to vessels with relatively few sets for which bigeye tuna was caught but none was predicted. These are vessels for which the relationships captured by the random forest classifier adequately describe the occurrence of bigeye. Per-vessel probabilities close to 0.0 correspond to vessels with a larger number of false negatives, relative to the number of sets in which these vessels caught bigeye tuna. The random forest classifier failed to capture some of the important aspects of the data of these vessels with the available predictors. Within this group, the data of those vessels making the most sets on bigeye tuna might prove useful for exploring the possibility of other fishing strategies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this manuscript we have developed a classification algorithm for the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch in floating object sets to explore the effects of gear characteristics on the occurrence of bigeye catch. The presence of bigeye tuna catch could be reasonably predicted from information on the set location, the environment, and the fishing operation and gear. Among the gear characteristics studied that directly relate to the in-water depth of the floating object and the purse-seine net, the maximum depth of the object below the surface and the hanging depth of the net had the greatest effect on whether bigeye tuna were caught, with catches more likely on deeper objects and with deeper nets. These gear effects were most pronounced near the equator and in the southern area of the fishery.\nNonetheless, the location of the set (latitude, longitude) was the strongest determinant with this data set for the presence of bigeye tuna. False negatives (bigeye tuna caught but none predicted) were found to be concentrated to some extent within certain vessels suggesting that these vessels may also catch bigeye tuna in ways different from most of the fleet, i.e., in ways poorly described by the predictors included in this analysis. This represents a form of a 'vessel effect' that could be amenable to further study.\nAlthough results of this analysis are consistent with fishermen's experience that deeper objects and deeper nets may be more likely to lead to catch of bigeye tuna in some areas, the details indicate that gear effects are complex. For example, comparison of\nFigures 5-7 suggests that some of the decrease in marginal effects on the deepest objects and with the deepest nets likely reflects spatial structure in gear effects. However, particularly for net depth, an additional possibility is that this decrease may be indicative of a different fishing strategy used by some larger vessels. Larger vessels (greater fishcarrying capacity), which will tend to have deeper nets (Table 2) , will also have greater fishing range, and can carry a greater number of FADs. Instead of waiting for the optimal conditions to make a set so as to maximize catch on a particular FAD, these vessels may set on objects as they are encountered, a strategy made economically viable by the number of the FADs that can be placed and the period of time for which the vessels can remain at sea. In addition, many of the environmental predictors (including latitude and longitude) were correlated with gear characteristics, making it impossible to estimate gear effects independent of environmental conditions.\nThe results presented in this manuscript suggest that the presence of bigeye tuna catch in floating object sets exhibits characteristics consistent with some level of fishermen control. The importance of location as a predictor indicates that the presence of bigeye tuna in the catch is not a spatially random event (Figure 4 ). In addition, similarilites between the spatial distribution of object depth (Figure 3 ) and that of its marginal effect on the presence of bigeye catch (Figure 6 ), suggest some degree of planning on the part of fishermen. Thus, results of this study indicate that fishermen have several options available to them to try to avoid catching bigeye tuna, including changing the depth of the material hanging below the floating object and the fishing depth of the purse-seine net in certain areas of the fishery, and changing their overall fishing location.\nGiven the current status of bigeye tuna populations (Maunder and Harley, 2006; Maunder and Hoyle, 2007) and the operational infeasibility of spatial-temporal closures (Harley and Suter, 2007) , gear restrictions might seem a reasonable option for reducing fishing mortality of bigeye tuna. However, gear restrictions would affect all vessels and all areas of the fishery, perhaps reducing catches of other tuna species, such as skipjack.\nPrevious studies (Lennert-Cody and Hall, 2000) found some indication that catch per set of skipjack tuna increased with the hanging depth of the net. Fishery-wide restrictions on hanging depth might reduce catches of skipjack across a broad segment of the fishery, a seemingly unnecessary outcome given the focused nature of the fishery for bigeye. Many factors combine to determine the actual fishing depth of a net in a given set of environmental conditions. For this, and other reasons (Branch et al. 2006) , restrictions on the set-up of fishing gear would seem ill-advised. On the other hand, gear research directed towards improving acoustic techniques for the characterization of objectassociated communities (e.g., Shaefer and Fuller, 2005; Doray et al. 2006 ) would seem beneficial. The ability to accurately assess the compostion of object-associated tuna schools in areas where bigeye catch is likely would clearly improve imformation available to fishermen for making choices.\nOne benefit of the approach used in this analysis is that it identifies 'unusual' sets (fishing trips) of specific vessels through accumulation of misclassifications that could be subject to further analysis. Results of this approach could also be used to create categories of vessels for the purpose of estimating conventional vessel effects (or skipper effects; e.g., Ruttan and Tyedmers, 2007) , for example, by defining categories of vessels (or skippers) based on the magnitude of per-vessel probabilities. Used as a proxy for time the object spent in the water (i.e., soak time), although the relationship between fouling and actual soak time may be compromised by the fact that vessels may set upon/use objects belonging to other vessels, and it is not possible to track individual objects across vessel trips.
