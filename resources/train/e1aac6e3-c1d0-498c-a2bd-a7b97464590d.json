The purpose of this study was to assess and validate a semi-automated imaging workflow, called Biomarker Localization, Analysis, Visualization, Extraction, and Registration (BLAzER). We tested BLAzER using two different segmentation platforms, FreeSurfer (FS) and Neuroreader (NR), for regional brain PET quantification in images from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.\nMethods: 127 amyloid-PET and 55 tau-PET studies along with corresponding volumetric MRI were obtained from ADNI. The BLAzER workflow utilizes segmentation of MR images by FS or NR, then visualizes and quantifies regional brain PET data using FDA-cleared software (MIM), enabling quality control to ensure optimal registration and detect segmentation errors.\nResults: BLAzER analysis required only ~5 min plus segmentation time. BLAzER using FS segmentation showed strong agreement with ADNI for global amyloid-PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) (r = 0.9922, p < 0.001) and regional tau-PET SUVRs across all Braak staging regions (r > 0.97, p < 0.001) with high inter-operator reproducibility for both (ICC > 0.97) and nearly identical dichotomization as amyloid-positive or -negative (2 discrepant cases out of 127). Comparing FS vs. NR segmentation with BLAzER, the global SUVRs were strongly correlated for global amyloid-PET (r = 0.9841, p < 0.001), but were systematically higher (4% on average) with NR, likely due to more inclusion of white matter, which has high florbetapir binding.\nBLAzER provides an efficient workflow for regional brain PET quantification.

PET provides the ability to study functional and molecular processes in the brain in vivo, allowing exploration of an array of normal and pathological states, including neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric conditions, and neurooncology. Quantitation of PET data is well-established for research applications but less so in routine clinical settings. Recent research demonstrates the utility of quantification to supplement visual assessment for clinical PET, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and amyloid PET tracers [1] [2] [3] [4] . Quantification of targeted brain regions of interest (ROIs) [5, 6] is enabled using masks generated by automated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation algorithms, such as the widely used reference standard in research, FreeSurfer (FS) [7] [8] [9] , or the FDA-cleared and ISO-certified Neuroreader (NR) [10] [11] [12] [13] . By registering the segmentation mask with the PET scan, ROIs can be defined for PET measurements without laborious and potentially imprecise or biased manual delineation methods [6, 14] . Barriers to the use of this approach to quantitation of brain PET, particularly for clinical applications, include computationally intensive software, time-consuming workflows, the need for real-time visualization of the primary and processed data for quality control, and limited availability of FDA-cleared software suitable for this purpose.\nAccuracy and precision are key features of effective image analysis methods to ensure that the extracted biomarker data can provide reliable in vivo information of the physiological state or disease process of interest. However, efficiency, ease of use, and availability are also essential features for widespread and routine implementation of quantitative brain PET. Many current techniques require lengthy post-processing time [2, 15] and/or heavy computational workload [16, 17] . Incorrect segmentation of the brain MRI data and misregistration between PET and segmented brain regions are potential sources of error when extracting of regional PET data based on ROIs defined through fully automated segmentation [15] . Additionally, although qualitative and quantitative assessment can be performed separately, the ability to easily visualize images in real-time at different states of processing and registration can provide an important degree of quality control and allow for user input to correct problematic studies. Many of the current fully automated processing workflows that involve only inputs and outputs to optimize speed, can be liable to unidentified errors because there is no opportunity to visualize the processed images [18, 19] . Finally, other barriers to routine implementation of quantitative brain PET include the lack of versatility in existing tools to analyze images acquired or processed by different platforms, radiotracers, and segmentation algorithms. Radiotracers commonly used for brain PET analysis in AD include [ 11 C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) [20] [29, 30] for glucose metabolism. Multicenter clinical trials and longitudinal studies can benefit from a versatile workflow to standardize PET quantification [31] .\nAlthough a number of effective research workflows exist for regional brain PET analysis that combine one or more of the previously discussed features [8, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] , quantification still has not been widely implemented in routine clinical brain PET for AD, which relies primarily on visual assessment and components validated for routine clinical use. FDA clearance and ISOcertification are key features of not only NR, but also MIM, software that provides image visualization and quantification capabilities. Combining features of such tools could help lower the barriers between clinical and research workflows. However, to the best of our knowledge, no workflow exists that is efficient and easy for physicians and technologists to use, automatically segments ROIs in a customizable fashion, consists of FDA-cleared components, and allows for both qualitative and quantitative assessment for brain PET data in a clinical environment.\nWe present here a novel brain Biomarker Localization, Analysis, Extraction, and Registration (BLAzER) workflow for analysis of PET based on segmented brain MRI. We demonstrate that BLAzER works well for both global and regional PET quantification of brain amyloid-and tau-PET, respectively, in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia.\nAlthough this report focuses on AD biomarkers, BLAzER can be applied to any PET neuroimaging study that utilizes MR-based segmentation for defining ROIs. Additionally, we compare two different inputs for segmentation, FS and NR, which could be used with BLAzER for research and clinical applications, respectively."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "Images were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. All studies were approved by local Institutional Review Board at each institution through ADNI. Additional information is available at the ADNI website (www.adni-info.org).\n127 amyloid-PET and 55 tau-PET studies were selected from ADNI for a total of 178 unique subjects (4 overlap). Subjects were selected to represent the spectrum of ADNI participants in terms of cognitive status (cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)), and age (cohorts aged 55-59, 60-69, 70-79, and \u226580). Subject selection was performed prior to beginning image review or analysis and was based on the preceding demographic criteria alone to capture the broad range of neuropathology available in ADNI (Table 1) . Selection was blinded to the actual quality of the scans and output of the data, and image analysis was performed blind to subjects' cognitive status or age group. No exclusions were made at time of selection or subsequently during the analysis (i.e. all of the initially selected studies were included in the final analysis)."}, {"section_title": "Image sets used for analysis", "text": "All subjects in both the amyloid-PET and tau-PET cohorts had a volumetric brain MRI scan performed within 1 year of the PET study.

In summary, 4 x 5 min dynamic image frames, acquired 50 to 70 minutes post-injection, were co-registered to the first extracted frame of the raw image file. Then, the 6 five-minute frames were averaged to form a static PET image and reoriented into a standard 160 x 160 x 96 voxel image grid with 1.5-mm cubic voxels. Finally, each image set was filtered with a scanner-specific filter function to produce images of uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm FWHM, which is the approximate resolution of the lowest resolution scanners used in ADNI. Only the fully pre-processed, standardized, co-registered, and averaged PET images were used for this study.

FS, an open-source software, has been validated as a tool to measure brain volumes in various neurological diseases when compared to either manual delineation [6] or other algorithms [14] . FS uses a complex algorithm with a series of normalization and motion-correction approaches prior to even starting its intensity-based approach to parcellate the brain into not only the larger cortical structures, but also subregions to allow targeted measurement of specific ROIs [8, 9] . FS segmentation produces detailed ROIs, which allow for spatial delineation of brain regions beyond the main cortical and subcortical brain structures. Customization of brain regions is particularly useful in analysis of tau-PET studies in Alzheimer's disease where pathology follows characteristic Braak staging regions [37] .\nNR's separation of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) uses an intensity-based approach along with a template, similar to other available approaches [38, 39] such as the widely used Automatic Anatomic Labeling (AAL) template [19] . Similar to AAL, NR is highly efficient, with segmentation of an individual case processed in approximately Parcellated, segmented brain images were converted from MGZ to DICOM format using 3DSlicer v4.6 (Boston, MA). Alternatively, NR automatically produced segmented brains in DICOM format for the same MPRAGE scans. Each of the segmentation output files along with source volumetric MRI and pre-processed PET scans were then visualized and quantified using an automated workflow on a multi-modal imaging software -MIM v6.6.13 (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH)."}, {"section_title": "PET Analysis", "text": "MIM is a commercial, FDA-cleared software package designed to help researchers and clinicians quantitatively and qualitatively process multi-modal imaging data. Through a graphical user interface (GUI), MIM allows the user to design customized, automated workflows for processing cases without need for advanced computational skills. Workflows were developed that could use segmentation data from FS or NR as inputs for ROI definition on the PET data sets.\nFor BLAzER, we selected the segmented brain dataset, brain PET, and volumetric brain MRI images for analysis, then ran a user-defined and customizable workflow that registered the images, defined ROIs within the original volumetric MR and PET based on the segmentation, and delivered the quantification in an array of potential outputs while allowing for visual inspection.\nWorkflows were generated and customized to an individual segmentation method and PET radiotracer through a GUI interface where steps in the protocol were simply selected from a dropdown list similar to Porcupine [40] , such that users were not limited by their computational skillset to analyze large, multi-modal image datasets. Once the original protocol had been generated, anatomical tags for brain regions from another segmentation method or radiotracer were incorporated by replacing with the new identifiers with minimal user input, allowing clinicians and researchers alike to implement their customized analyses through BLAzER with minimal training.\nIn summary, in the BLAzER workflow, we 1) segmented the MRI to generate a 3D brain mask using either FS or NR; 2) transferred the segmentation to MIM and selected corresponding\nvolumetric MRI and PET to analyze; 3) automatically co-registered segmented brain mask to volumetric MRI; 4) utilized the segmented brain to delineate the various brain regions based on the pixel intensities for each region defined by FS or NR; 5) performed quality control through visualization and corrected registration, if necessary; and 6) fused PET scan to MRI/brain mask template to extract, visualize, and quantify data (Fig. 1) . The workflow suspended the automated process before transferring the contours to allow the user to verify accurate image registration.\nThe original MPRAGE was used as a quality control measure to assure that the rigid registration method used to align the images had been performed properly and the ROIs are correct. If needed, the user could manually correct the registration and/or ROIs at this step. This review step was employed for all cases but is optional and could be omitted to provide a more automated process."}, {"section_title": "Anatomical Definitions of Brain Regions", "text": "In BLAzER, all SUVRs extracted are automatically weighted by the volumes of the individual subregions comprising each ROI. Amyloid-PET ROIs were normalized to the entire cerebellum to extract SUVRs for all regions that comprised the cerebral cortex: frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and cingulate (BLAzER-FS, as defined by ADNI) or frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes (BLAzER-NR, as defined by Neuroreader). BLAzER-FS matched ADNI-defined cortical regions exactly while BLAzER-NR included the entire cortex. For head-tohead comparisons between BLAzER and ADNI, BLAzER-FS delineation was based on ADNIdefined brain subregions. However, for comparisons between BLAzER-FS and BLAzER-NR, BLAzER-FS anatomical regions were modified to match the NR-based regions of entire cortex.\nWe denote this distinction as BLAzER-FS*. Specific FreeSurfer subregions are detailed below as well as listed in Supplementary Table 1 .\nSpecifically, BLAzER-FS subregions were defined as follows: caudal middle frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, medial orbitofrontal, pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, rostral middle frontal, superior frontal, and frontal pole (frontal); caudal anterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate, posterior cingulate, and rostral anterior cingulate (cingulate); inferior parietal, precuneus, superior parietal, and supramarginal (parietal); middle temporal and superior temporal (temporal). In contrast, BLAzER-FS* regions were defined as follows: caudal middle frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, medial orbitofrontal, pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, rostral middle frontal, superior frontal, frontal pole, paracentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, caudal anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and rostral anterior cingulate, and insula (frontal); inferior parietal, precuneus, superior parietal, supramarginal, postcentral gyrus, and isthmus cingulate (parietal); bankssts, entorhinal, fusiform, inferior temporal, middle temporal, parahippocampal, superior temporal, temporal pole, and transverse temporal (temporal); cuneus, lateral occipital, lingual, and pericalcarine (occipital).\nTau-PET SUVRs were calculated similarly to the amyloid-PET defined ROIs with two main differences. Tau-PET was normalized to the cerebellar gray matter instead of the entire cerebellum [37] and ADNI-defined ROIs for BLAzER-FS workflow followed the pathologic Braak staging regions [41] : entorhinal cortex (Braak 1); hippocampus (Braak 2); parahippocampal, fusiform, lingual, and amygdala (Braak 3); middle temporal, caudal anterior cingulate, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate, insula, inferior temporal, and temporal pole (Braak 4); superior frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, medial orbitofrontal, frontal pole, caudal middle frontal, rostral middle frontal, pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, caudate, putamen, lateral occipital, parietal supramarginal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, pallidum, superior parietal, precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, nucleus accumbens, and transverse temporal (Braak 5) ; pericalcarine, postcentral, cuneus, precentral, and paracentral (Braak 6). As NR's anatomical atlas only includes major cortical and subcortical regions, we defined BLAzER-NR and BLAzER-FS* tau-PET regions the same as for amyloid-PET: frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices.\nThe published ADNI data was used as the reference standard. The reported values in the ADNI data set were based on brain segmentations performed using FS v5.3.0. SUV and SUVR data was extracted using SPM5 (version) after co-registeristration of PET and MR data.

Statistical significance was defined as p<0.002 to account for multiple comparisons.\nUnivariate regression was used to validate measurements between the two methods using Finally, amyloid-PET cases were dichotomized into positive or negative to determine the ability of BLAzER to properly classify cases based on SUVR cutoffs. Dichotomization was performed by 1) directly applying ADNI's autopsy-derived 1.11 cutoff [34, 42] and 2) deriving BLAzER-specific cutoff by using a linear regression to convert \"ADNI units\" to BLAzER units based on the slope and y-intercept."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Efficiency, quality control, and reproducibility", "text": "The BLAzER workflow enabled rapid image analysis. The most time-consuming step was segmentation. NR was considerably faster than FS on a per-case basis (10-20 min/case vs.\n8-12 hours/case, respectively), yet slower than FS for total processing time for the 182 subject cohort (45.5 hours vs. 12 hours, respectively) due to the ability to run FS cases in parallel on a supercomputer environment. After segmentation, FS cases required ~2 min for manual DICOM conversion whereas NR cases were returned in DICOM format. Once the segementation was obtained, the remainder of BLAzER processing took about 5 min per case. Thus, a case could be fully processed, from completion of image acquisition to full regional quantification, in as little as 20 min (when using NR segmentation).\nAlthough the workflow could operate with full automation, the ability to visualize registration provided for quality control and avoiding registration errors. We routinely ran MIM's \"Run Rigid Assisted Alignment\" tool serially to fix minor errors until it provided no further adjustment, which took only a few seconds (Fig. 1) . Only 1 of the 182 scans required manual correction of registration, which was a case with severe brain atrophy. This highlights the usefulness of the visualization step, however, as the incorrect registration would have been missed in a fully automated workflow. We also examined inter-rater reliability by having two independent operators process each scan.

Additionally, the slope of linear regression and y-intercept (y = 1.0012x + 0.01816, R 2 = 0.9844, Table 4 ) showed a near one-to-one correspondence between BLAzER and ADNI. There was a slight systematic difference in global SUVR, which was on average 1.6% higher with BLAzER than in the ADNI dataset (Fig. 3B ). This may be to do a systematic reduction in the reference region mean, which was observed in the cerebellum.\nRegional comparisons across the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal lobes for CN, MCI, and AD subjects showed similar results (r > 0.94, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Table 3) .\nWe also the examined the dichotomous classification of individuals as amyloid-positive vs. -negative based on SUVR cutoffs.

We also demonstrated that the regional brain volumes provided by FS and NR were in close agreement with ROIs defined through BLAzER with less than 2% error between the original volumes and those output by BLAzER. BLAzER and ADNI produced nearly identical dichotomous classification of amyloid-PET participants as positive or negative, especially when using regression analysis to account for systematic differences. It is important to acknowledge that our analysis was completed before the most recent ADNI update, which includes a new partial volume corrected set of values based on modified reference regions. Thus, any partial volume effect (PVE), or inaccuracies that result from low PET spatial resolution [43] , affected both BLAzER and our reference ADNI set similarly. In addition to PVE, off-target-binding in non-specific regions can be problematic for accurate PET quantification. Recent evidence has shown non-specific flortaucipir uptake in the basal ganglia [44, 45] . In the most recent ADNI updates, the caudate and putamen have been removed from the Braak 5 staging regions for flortaucipir. However, we kept our results consistent by comparing BLAzER to the original dataset that included the caudate and putamen. In future work, BLAzER-FS regions can be modified to account for PVE and off-target-binding if desired.\nWe observed slightly larger systematic differences and CIs for flortaucipir-PET compared to florbetapir-PET. As pathological cortical tau distribution is more regionally localized and restricted than pathological cortical amyloid which tends to be diffuse throughout the cerebral cortex [28] , differences in segmentation and image alignment are expected to have a greater effect on PET measures of regional brain tau compared to regional brain amyloid.\nPotential sources of the small differences between BLAzER and the ADNI data set include different FS versions, source volumetric MR images, and registration methods. For our study, FS v6.0.0 was used while v5.3.0 was used for the ADNI data set, which could affect anatomical volume measurements and brain segmentation which in turn would affect ROI definition for PET quantitation [46] . Additionally, the ADNI dataset used two volumetric MR scan input files for FS to produce the segmented brain while we chose to use only one volumetric brain MR to reflect our standard research and clinical workflows. Within ADNI, each subject undergoes two volumetric MR scans during a single scanning session with some subject datasets having slightly different imaging parameters. In order to align the PET and MR images, ADNI utilized SPM to register the images automatically while we used MIM. BLAzER utilizes a rigid-registration algorithm that allows only translation and rotation. Additionally, we utilize a three-step system of registration where the segmentation is first registered with its original, template volumetric MR and then with the PET after the rigid-registration quality control-check. We believe that this visual assessment and option for manual correction minimizes sources of error that can arise from fully automated registration methods (Fig. 1) [2] . Additionally, we believe that our results are generalizable across the ADNI population due to our selection of individuals that represent the range of cognitive statuses and age cohorts from ADNI.\nOur implementation of BLAzER for research studies utilizes a high-throughput, In conclusion, BLAzER is a streamlined image processing workflow for efficient registration, visualization, and extraction of brain PET data. We successfully validated the accuracy and reproducibility of BLAzER using ADNI as the reference standard for amyloid-PET and tau-PET analyses.
