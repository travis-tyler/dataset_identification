[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose of review Dementia is a major cause of disability and institutionalization. Apart from age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, there are currently no established, clinically relevant, noninvasive markers of dementia. We conducted a literature search of recent observational epidemiological studies evaluating the relevance of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoproteins as biomarkers of future and prevalent risk of dementia.\nRecent findings HDL-C and apolipoproteins, such as apoE have been suggested to play important roles in brain function and have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease in observational studies. However, findings have been inconsistent, especially across study designs. In recent years, modern proteomic approaches have enabled the investigation of further apolipoproteins involved in the deposition and clearance of b-amyloid, a determining factor for subsequent neurodegeneration.\nAssociations in cross-sectional studies are not always indicative of a prospective relationship. Large studies find that plasma HDL-C and apoE are inversely associated with dementia. Higher apoJ levels might be a marker of prevalent dementia, but were not associated with risk of future dementia. The investigation of HDL-C and apolipoproteins in relation to dementia represents an area of opportunity. Additional prospective studies that account for potential confounding factors and that explore potential effect modifiers such as APOE genotype and sex are needed to fully investigate the potential of these noninvasive measures in disease prediction."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Dementia is a major cause of disability and institutionalization with a prevalence worldwide that is estimated to increase from 46.8 million people to over 74.7 million by 2030 [1] [2] [3] . Current approved dementia drugs mask cognitive and psychological disease symptoms but don't cure most forms of dementia [4] . Apart from need for additional treatment options, there is an urgent need for the discovery of novel early disease markers of dementia as well as markers to monitor dementia severity, which might be useful as novel treatment targets.\nCholesterol has been suggested to play an important role in brain function. Indeed, of all organs, the highest concentrations of cholesterol are found in the brain, containing 23% of the total cholesterol pool [5] . Apolipoproteins combine with cholesterol to form soluble lipoproteins that serve as transporters in aqueous solutions, including both [10] [11] [12] . In addition, APOE E4 is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease and recently variation in the gene encoding another apolipoprotein; apoJ (aka clusterin), has been identified as an important risk locus in genome-wide association studies (of Alzheimer's disease) [13] .\nPlasma levels of HDL-C have been inversely associated with dementia [14] . As opposed to studies using CSF, the investigation of blood markers is intriguing for the potential to identify novel noninvasive biomarkers for dementia. Plasma levels of HDL are typically indicated by either the cholesterol concentration in HDL or by measurement of plasma apoA-I concentrations, the key protein component in HDL in plasma [9] . Interestingly, even apolipoproteins such as apoA-I and apoC-III that are not expressed in the brain, are also found in CSF, indicating they are able to cross the bloodbrain barrier [7, 8, 15] . As yet, the differences in concentrations of apolipoproteins in plasma and CSF have not been well studied, and it is unclear whether and how strong plasma and CSF levels correlate [6, 8, 16, 17] . Whether plasma-derived apolipoproteins might play a biological role in brain function and neurological disease development or whether plasma levels merely reflect CSF levels is currently unknown. However, regardless of the potential causal role of apolipoproteins, plasma markers represent a promising opportunity to study noninvasive markers of dementia. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine recent observational epidemiological studies evaluating the relevance of HDL-C and apolipoproteins in CSF and in the bloodstream in relation to dementia."}, {"section_title": "IDENTIFICATION OF STUDY REPORTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sources", "text": "A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE database (accession date 11 September 2015) was performed to identify studies that investigated the association of HDL-C and apolipoproteins with dementia.

In the Women's Health and Aging Study II, where 99 women were followed up for 9 years, HDL-C was neither related to incident dementia nor probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, after accounting for age, BMI, and blood glucose at baseline [24] . Similarly, baseline HDL-C levels did not differ between twin pairs in which one twin subsequently developed dementia, whereas the second twin did not develop dementia [20] .\nIn contrast, a recent study using data from 75 708 participants of the Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study, showed that HDL-C levels were significantly lower in participants progressing to dementia or Alzheimer's disease [25 && ]. This observation is further supported by evidence from a study including 1130 individuals randomly sampled from Medicare recipients in US individuals in the highest quartile of HDL-C concentrations who had a significantly lower risk of future probable or possible Alzheimer's disease compared with individuals in the lowest quartile [14] . This association was robust to adjustment for age, sex, educational attainment, ethnic group, BMI, APOE genotype, and several comorbidities and lipid-lowering medication intake [14] .\nThe association between HDL-C and incident dementia or Alzheimer's disease during a 7-year follow-up period was modified by sex in participants of the Three-City study, a multicenter study conducted in France that enrolled 7053 communitydwelling elderly [18] . There was no association between HDL-C and all-cause dementia or Alzheimer's disease in the total sample, however, when the study sample was restricted to individuals without stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, arteritis, and cardiovascular surgery, participants in the lowest quartile of HDL-C had an increased risk for all-cause dementia [hazard ratio (HR): 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-2.23 compared with the quartiles 2 and 3] in men only. Further, adjustment for baseline intima media thickness assessed at the baseline examination strengthened the association (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.66). HDL-C levels were unrelated to Alzheimer's disease in men and unrelated to incident all-cause dementia or Alzheimer's disease in women without vascular comorbidities [18] .\nSix cross-sectional studies were identified that addressed the association of HDL-C in relation to dementia [28] [29] [30] 32, 33, 39] , providing conflicting results ( Table 2 ). Comparing 150 participants with Alzheimer's disease to 197 control individuals from the Texas Alzheimer's Disease Research and Care Consortium, Warren et al. [39] found lower HDL-C levels in participants with Alzheimer's disease. A recent study noted a significant lower HDL-C concentration in participants with late onset Alzheimer's disease compared with participants without Alzheimer's disease, but not early onset Alzheimer's disease [29] . Another recent study of relatively small sample size focused on comparing HDL-C concentrations in: participants with Alzheimer's disease with cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, participants with Alzheimer's disease without cardiovascular comorbidities and risk Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 45)\nFull-text articles excluded, not meeting criteria for:\nStudies included in qualitative synthesis (n = 28) FIGURE 1.

Importantly, only participants with Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors had lower HDL-C levels in comparison with controls but not participants with Alzheimer's disease without cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors [30] . Another study of relatively small sample size including 29 participants with Alzheimer's disease and 19 control study participants found no difference in HDL-C levels [28] . Similarly, investigations in subsamples of the Personalized Medicine Research Project sample including 455 participants [32] and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study including 564 participants [33] revealed no difference in HDL-C concentrations comparing participants with Alzheimer's disease with controls [32, 33] . In summary, recent prospective studies of moderate to large sample size provide evidence for an inverse association between HDL-C level and risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease that is robust to multivariable adjustment. However, future studies that carefully investigate the effect of comorbidities and potential effect modifiers like sex on this association are warranted."}, {"section_title": "Apolipoprotein A-I", "text": "ApoA-I is the major protein component of HDL-C in plasma [9] . Only one prospective study was identified relating apoA-I concentrations to Alzheimer's disease [20] . The Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins compared the concentration of apoA-I in 23 discordant twin pairs (one twin developed dementia over 3 years, the other does not) and found no difference in apoA-I concentrations [20] . Cross-sectional investigations from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study [45] and another small case-control study from Austria found 1.06 and 1.7 times higher plasma apoA-I concentrations, respectively, in individuals with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls [23, 36] . In an age-and sex-matched case-control study, higher apoA-I levels have been associated with prevalent Alzheimer's disease [40] ."}, {"section_title": "Apolipoprotein E", "text": "The recognition of the APOE genotype as a major Alzheimer's disease susceptibility variant has led to efforts to study apoE -the main protein in HDL-C in CSF -in relation to dementia. In a prospective analysis of the ADNI study, in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), higher CSF apoE levels were associated with a lower risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease [16] . Recently, the large Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study confirmed an inverse association between plasma apoE and dementia [25 && ]. Furthermore, the latter study also addressed the question of whether apoE level is associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease independent of apoE genotype. Although apoE4 carriers have the lowest apoE levels, the risk for Alzheimer's disease associated with apoE4 genotype is not solely explained by the apoE plasma level as the magnitude or risk associated with the genotype is far greater than predicted as per the associated difference in apoE plasma level among carriers versus noncarriers of the E4 variant [25 && ]. Interestingly, in the latter study, apoE levels increased with increasing age and age is a strong predictor for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, in parallel, apoE4 carriers tend to have the lowest apoE levels but the highest risk of dementia. Cross-sectional studies on apoE mainly indicated lower apoE levels in participants with dementia compared with controls, but the majority of studies did not adjust for potential confounding factors [21, 22, 33, 38, 44] . Although CSF apoE levels were correlated with plasma apoE levels (r \u00bc 0.23, P \u00bc 0.004) in the ADNI cohort [16] , CSF apoE levels did not differ between participants with Alzheimer's disease and controls in univariate analysis. However, lower CSF apoE levels were observed in participants with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls, when accounting for t-tau levels, age, sex, and APOE genotype [16] . In conclusion, emerging evidence suggests that lower apoE levels are associated with dementia prevalence and incidence [25 && ]."}, {"section_title": "Apolipoprotein J", "text": "As one of the most prominent transport proteins in the brain and also one of the top genetic markers recently related to Alzheimer's disease [13] , apoJ is of particular interest for dementia cause [46, 47] . Investigators of the ADNI cohort reported that plasma apoJ levels did not differ between individuals with MCI progressing to Alzheimer's disease and individuals with MCI not progressing to Alzheimer's disease [19 && ]. Although apoJ levels were significantly positively related to prevalent Alzheimer's disease or all-cause dementia at baseline, apoJ levels did not predict incident all-cause dementia during 7 years of follow-up in the well characterized population-based Rotterdam study [26] . The latter results highlight the importance of prospective studies in the evaluation of apolipoproteins in the pathophysiology of dementia.

In the same cohort, lower plasma apoD and apoA-II concentrations were observed in individuals with MCI progressing to Alzheimer's disease compared with controls in univariate analysis [22] ."}, {"section_title": "DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OF DEMENTIA", "text": "The comparison of study results is challenging because diagnostic criteria for dementia and Alzheimer's disease vary and criteria might be susceptible to subjectivity and misclassification [48] . For example, ischemic vascular disease and dementia are tightly linked, especially at old age, and most dementia at old age includes both mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease pathology [49] . Thus, the distinction between vascular dementia and nonvascular dementia has been questioned and HDL-C and apolipoproteins should be regarded among the important vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia [49] . A recent guideline highlights the importance of reporting study results in the context of varying standards for diagnosing dementia: Standards of Reporting of Neurological Disorders [48] .\nSources of data on the role of plasma markers in relation to dementia originate from mainly two complementary study types. First, register-based epidemiological studies rely exclusively on phenotype information from register data, where only cases that present to the medical system are included [25 && ]. Where available, registers represent a compelling data source for epidemiological studies when caution with regard to validity of the data including change of data quality over time and completeness of data is appropriately noted [50] . It is unclear if the cases included in the large Copenhagen General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study are representative of the study base [25 && ,51] . However, register-based studies can include participants at younger ages and allow for follow-up over many years [50] . In contrast, studies Warren, 2013 based on data collected by researchers that closely follow participants with repeated screening tests and examinations by neuropsychologists are often limited to collection of blood samples from participants at a higher mean age when their disease incidence is highest [18, 26] . The high costs of many years of detailed cognitive tests and adjudication of neurological diseases into late life simply prohibits the longer follow-up duration required for studying younger age groups. Therefore, smaller studies with costly repeated assessments of the outcome mainly include study participants at an advanced age at baseline to ensure sufficient number of cases in relatively short follow-up. However, it is possible that weight loss and other characteristics associated with cognitive decline [52] could lead to changes in cholesterol levels, including HDL-C levels [53] . This phenomenon could cause reverse causation and as such it is possible that these investigations underestimate the true association of HDL-C at a more vulnerable time in life. However, as with neurological disease, the pathological process of atherosclerotic plaque deposition starts many years earlier (i.e., in the third decade of life) and investigation of cholesterol measures in even older individuals (age 65 and above) also confirm an inverse association between HDL-C and coronary heart disease [54] . As yet, only a few studies focusing on the lifespan course of dementia have been initiated [55, 56] . To the best of our knowledge, no large-scale studies exist with blood samples stored since early adulthood from participants followed with many years of detailed cognitive tests and adjudication of neurological diseases into late life. Nevertheless, smaller studies with researcher-collected data are feasible, cost-effective, and can provide insights that could potentially be further expanded in populations of younger adults in the future. In summary, it is important to recognize the considerable heterogeneity across phenotypes presented in the different studies. Furthermore, the well adjudicated, smaller studies and the larger register-based studies likely complement each other."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Studies identified were mostly cross-sectional of small to moderate sample size and mainly unadjusted for potential confounding factors. Larger studies indicate that plasma levels of HDL-C and apoE are inversely associated with dementia risk, which was robust to multivariable adjustment. Higher apoJ might be a marker of prevalent dementia, but was not associated with future dementia. Studies on measures of CSF apolipoproteins are limited, but could not confirm associations observed for apoE. The investigation of HDL-C and apolipoproteins in relation to dementia represents an area of opportunity and prospective studies are needed investigating changes of these markers in relation to incident dementia."}]
