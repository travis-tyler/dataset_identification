By James P. Dixon, 1 Scott D. Stihler, 2 Matthew M. Haney, 1 John J. Lyons, 1 Dane M. Ketner,1 Katherine M. Mulliken, 3 Thomas Parker, 1 and John A. Power 1 Alaska Fairbanks, and the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. AVO initially monitored four volcanoes in the Cook Inlet region (Mount Spurr, Redoubt Volcano, Iliamna Volcano, and Augustine Volcano) and in the following three decades, established seismograph networks on 34 of the 54 historically active volcanoes in Alaska (Cameron and Schaefer, 2016) (fig.1). The primary objectives of the AVO seismic program are the real-time seismic monitoring of active and potentially hazardous Alaskan volcanoes and the investigation of seismic processes associated with active volcanism. Between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, the AVO located a total of 28,172 earthquakes at volcanoes in Alaska. The annual totals are 3, 840, 5,819, 5,297, 6,151, and 7,065 earthquakes, respectively, for the years 2013 through 2017, respectively. This represents an average of 5,634 earthquakes per year, which is comparable to the yearly number of earthquakes AVO located in the previous decade when AVO monitored a similar number of volcanoes. During the reporting period, there was significant seismic activity at 20 of the 34 volcanoes monitored by a seismograph network. The seismically monitored volcano list includes volcanoes with a local seismograph network designed for the location of earthquakes in the vicinity of the volcano and a period of recording exceeding 6 months without prolonged station outages. The 29 monitored volcanoes are shown in figure 1. Five of the 34 historically active volcanic centers with seismograph networks were not on the formal list of permanently monitored volcanoes in the AVO weekly update at the end of 2017. Fourpeaked Mountain was delisted on February 8, 2014, due to the failure of all seismograph stations. Little Sitkin, Mount Cerberus (the active vent on Semisopochnoi Island), and Mount Wrangell (unlisted in 2012) volcanoes remained off the official monitored list. The Little Sitkin and Cerberus subnetworks do not have stable telemetry and the Wrangell subnetwork was too recently reestablished to be listed. Mount Cleveland, with two seismograph stations, does not have a sufficient number of stations to locate most earthquakes that occur in the Islands of the Four Mountains ( fig. 1). Korovin and Ugashik-Peulik Volcanoes were reinstated on the formal list of permanently monitored volcanoes on February 21, 2013, and May 22, 2013, respectively. Between 2013 and 2017, Aniakchak Crater was removed on January 24, 2014,     and added back on October 23, 2015. All three of the subnetworks added back to the formal monitored list had significant maintenance performed to upgrade network infrastructure. This report describes the type and location of (1) seismograph and infrasound instrumentation deployed in the field; (2) earthquake detection, recording, analysis, and data archival systems; (3) seismic-velocity models used for earthquake locations; and (4) a summary of earthquakes located in 2013-17. A summary of earthquake origin times, hypocenters, magnitudes, and location quality statistics (headers described in appendix 7), and a metadata file for the AVO seismograph network (including but not limited to station location, station type, and system-response information) in the format of a dataless Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake Data (SEED) volume (International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks, 2012) are included in a data supplement to this report (available only online at https://doi.org/10.3133/ds1115)."}, {"section_title": "Instrumentation", "text": "The permanent AVO seismograph network is composed of 25 subnetworks with an average of 8 seismograph stations each and 10 regional seismograph stations for a total of 212 stations at the end of 2017 (table 1, fig. 2). In the past 5 years, ten new seismograph stations were established. Six broadband stations were added to the Augustine subnetwork over a 3-year period (two in 2013, one in 2014, and three in 2015). Two short-period seismograph stations were installed on Cleveland Volcano in 2014. The final new installations were within the Iliamna subnetwork-a broadband station in 2015 and a threecomponent short-period station in 2016. Additionally, two station installations were direct replacements for older stations. On Pavlof Volcano, PV6A was established in 2016 north of where PV6 had been located before its destruction in a previous Pavlof eruption, giving it a greater chance of surviving a future eruption. On Mount Wrangell, WAZA was removed in 2016 and reoccupied in 2017. The composition of the AVO network is slowly transitioning from a short-period network to a broadband network ( fig. 2, table 2). As new seismograph stations are installed, broadband sensors are the preferred instrument choice for these new sites. As opportunities present themselves, shortperiod sensors are being replaced with broadband sensors with a dozen short-period stations converted in the past 5 years. As a result, the number of broadband seismograph stations nearly doubled over the past 5 years and the proportion of broadband sites moved from 16 percent in 2012 to 29 percent in 2017. At the end of 2017, the AVO seismograph network consisted of 172 short-period and 62 broadband stations. AVO is increasingly using infrasound sensors to detect eruptive activity. Stand-alone microphones and infrasound arrays are used in the monitoring of volcanoes with and without local seismograph instrumentation. Infrasound sensors have been co-located with seismograph sensors for decades with increasing numbers installed in the last 8 years in the AVO network. Where infrasound sensors are co-located, typically the sensor was a single-channel infrasound station. However, three infrasound arrays are co-located with seismograph stations. The four-element Akutan array is collocated with AKS; the five-element Cleveland array is collocated with CLCO; and the six-element Sand Point array (SDPI) is co-located with the National Tsunami Warning Center seismograph station SDPT. Stand-alone infrasound arrays are located on Umnak Island (OKIF) and in Adak, Alaska (ADKI). OKIF is a four-element array outside the Okmok Caldera, whereas ADKI is a six-element array between Kanaga and Great Sitkin Volcanoes. The use of infrasound arrays as opposed to single stations, allows AVO to use the relative arrival times of acoustic waves on each sensor to determine the source of the infrasound signal. The single-component short-period seismograph stations were equipped with either Sercel L-4 or Teledyne-Geotech S-13 seismometers with a natural period of 1 hertz (Hz). AVO also operated three-component, short-period instruments during 2013-17. Such sites used L-4, Sercel L-22, or S-13 seismometers. The L-22 seismometer has a natural period of 2 Hz. Broadband stations were operated with either a G\u00fcralp CMG-40T seismometer (frequency range: 0.033-50 Hz), G\u00fcralp CMG-6TD seismometer (frequency range: 0.033-50 Hz), Nanometrics Trillium Compact (frequency range: 0.008-100 Hz), or Nanometrics Trillium 40 seismometer (frequency range: 0.025-50 Hz). The Augustine Volcano subnetwork has the only strong-motion station (AU22) in the AVO seismograph network used a Kinemetrics Episensor EST strong-motion sensor (frequency range is 0-500 Hz) and was collocated with a broadband sensor. The majority of short-period stations (88 percent) were digitized at 100 samples per second (sps). The Mount Cerberus and Little Sitkin Island subnetworks were recorded at 50 sps due to limitations in data rates using very small aperture terminal telemetry between the recording hubs located on Amchitka Island and Anchorage. Broadband stations were digitized at 50 sps with the exception of IVE in the Iliamna Volcano subnetwork, which was recorded at 20 sps due to poor telemetry. Infrasound sensors in the AVO network come primarily from the Chaparral Physics brand. Models in use are series M2, M21/25 and M60/64 infrasound sensors. The series M21/25 sensors are used at three of the five infrasound arrays operated by AVO (OKIF, AKS, ADKI). The other two infrasound arrays (CLCO and SDPI) use sensors developed by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory. As short-period stations are upgraded to digital broadbands, hut-mounted single station infrasound sensors (Chaparral model M64) are being added at some sites. These are ultra-high-pressure variations of the M64 and can record as much as +/-1,000 pascal (Pa) on scale, which is useful for recording strong explosions close to the source. Chaparrel M2 series microphones are used in infrasound installations that were established before 2007. Infrasound sample rates typically are 50 sps, although some stations record at 100 sps, including most arrays and CLES in the Cleveland subnetwork. When available, calibration information in the form of poles and zeros, for each seismograph and infrasound sensor is included in the dataless SEED volume that can be found in the data supplement to this report and available from AVO offices and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). A description of how instrument corrections are created for AVO seismograph stations can be found in Haney and others (2012). Instrument specifications are available online from the instrument manufacturers. Data from AVO seismograph stations are increasingly telemetered with digital telemetry. Current analog telemetry links uses voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) to transform the signals generated by the seismometer from a voltage to a frequency-modulated carrier suitable for transmission over a radio link or telephone circuit. AVO uses VCOs developed by McChesney (1999) to modulate signals in the field with one exception-Mount Spurr seismograph station NCG uses an A1 voltage control oscillator (A1VCO) (Rogers and others, 1980). Signals are transmitted by ultrahigh frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF) radio from station sites to communication hubs located throughout Alaska, where the signal is digitized and forwarded to the AVO in Anchorage. Digital telemetry links are accomplished with spread-spectrum radios, taking signals digitized at the field sites to AVO communication hubs. These data were forwarded to AVO offices in Anchorage through high-speed digital circuits. Progress moving from analog to digital telemetry is shown in figure 3. Locations for all AVO stations are shown in appendix 1 with locations tabulated in appendix 2. A measure of each station's operational status for the catalog period is shown in appendix 3 using the IRIS Gap/Overlap Analysis Tool (Stromme, 2000) and in appendix 4 with data-use scores, a normalized measure of the number of P-wave phase arrivals by station in the AVO earthquake catalog developed by Matt Haney (AVO, written commun., 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Data Acquisition and Processing", "text": "Data acquisition for the AVO seismograph and infrasound network for 2013-17 used the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) Quake Monitoring System (AQMS). AQMS is an integrated data acquisition and processing system derived from software developed as part of the TriNet project (Hauksson and others, 2003) that incorporates Earthworm modules (Johnson and others, 1995) for data acquisition and event detection. The Jiggle software package (Hauksson and others, 2003; U.S. Geological Survey, 2018) is used to time phase arrivals and determine magnitudes. Earthquake hypocenters were calculated using Hypoinverse (Klein, 2002). Earthquakes were detected using the Earthworm modules carlstatrig and carlsubtrig, with the carlstatrig parameters set as follows-long-term-average time=8 seconds, ratio=2.3, and quiet=4. Three station triggers from the carlstatrig module are required for an event to trigger carlsubtrig to create an event record. Carlsubtrig was modified such that each triggered record is identified with the triggering network (table 3). If four or more subnetworks triggered on the same event, the trigger was tagged as a regional event. About one third of all triggers are auto located. All data is stored in mini-SEED format (International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks, 2012).

The overall progress is shown in the large circle with the number of sites using digital telemetry (87 sites) and those using analog telemetry (131 sites event detection algorithms, which triggered alarms that prompted AVO staff to determine the source. Each event trigger was visually inspected, and false triggers were deleted. Earthquakes with a P-and S-wave separation of greater than 5 seconds on the closest station were assumed to come from regional sources and typically were not located; however, the trigger was preserved. Each finalized hypocenter meets three minimum parameters-three P-phases, two S-phases, and standard hypocentral errors less than 15 kilometers (km). If on reevaluation, the minimum parameters could not be met, the event was removed from the final catalog listing but retained in the AQMS database. Event picks and location information for events that met AVO minimum parameters were tagged as \"finalized\" and saved in the AQMS database. Waveforms for individual located events were saved in mini-SEED format. The average root-mean-square (RMS) travel-time error for earthquakes located in 2013-17 was 0.14 seconds, and the average vertical and horizontal hypocentral errors were 1.35 km and 0.94 km, respectively. For the earthquakes appearing in the 2013-17 AVO catalog, 95 percent had an average RMS travel-time error less than 0.32. At the time of publication, all hypocentral locations of earthquakes in the AVO seismic catalog have been made available as part of the ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog, ComCat (see https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/), and are added on a daily basis. An effort started in 2016 to relocate the entire AVO catalog with the aim of obtaining more consistent locations was completed in 2019 (Power and others, 2019). Continuous waveform data for the majority of AVO seismograph and infrasound stations, whose availability Data from selected seismograph stations operated by the Alaska Earthquake Center (AEC; formerly the Alaska Earthquake Information Center, AEIC), Global Seismograph Network (GSN), Transportable Array (TA), and National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) were routinely used in event detection and location by AVO analysts. Station parameters for the AEIC, GSN, TA, and NTWC stations used by AVO are available from the respective agencies and IRIS. "}, {"section_title": "Seismic-Velocity Models", "text": "AVO currently uses 13 local volcano-specific seismicvelocity models and a regional seismic-velocity model to locate earthquakes at Alaskan volcanoes. All velocity models are one-dimensional models using horizontal layers to approximate the local seismic-velocity structure. Each model, with one exception, assumes a series of constant velocity layers. The single exception is the Akutan velocity model (Power and others, 1996), which has a velocity gradient in a layer overlying a half-space of constant velocity. One or more vertical cylindrical volumes were used to model the volcanic-source zones for all volcanoes where a local velocity model was used. Earthquakes within these cylindrical volumes were located using a local model, and earthquakes outside of the cylindrical volumes were located using the regional model. The top of each cylinder was set at the summit elevation of the highest volcanic peak located within the cylinder zone, and the bottom was set at a depth of 50 km below sea level. Most cylindrical volumes had a radius of 20 km with the exception of the cylinders centered on Shishaldin and Mount Veniaminof. The cylinder centered on Shishaldin had a radius of 30 km to encompass Fisher Caldera and Isanotski Volcano. The cylinder centered on Mount Veniaminof also had a radius of 30 km because of the large size of the volcanic edifice. The maximum elevation for the regional model was set at 3.2 km, the elevation of the highest volcano in the Aleutian arc. The Akutan Peak, Augustine (Power, 1988), Iliamna (Roman and others, 2001), Makushin (Cheryl Searcy, USGS, written commun., 2010), Okmok Caldera (Masterlark and others, 2010), Tanaga (John Power, USGS, written commun., 2005), Mount Veniaminof (S\u00e1nchez, 2005), and Westdahl Peak (Dixon and others, 2005) velocity models were used to locate hypocenters that fell within cylindrical volumes described above, centered on each respective volcano. Five overlapping cylinders defined the volume in which the Mount Spurr velocity model (Jolly and others, 1994) was used, 4 overlapping cylinders defined the volume for the Redoubt Volcano velocity model (Lahr and others, 1994), and 4 overlapping cylinders defined the volume for the Mount Katmai model (Searcy, 2003). The Andreanof Islands velocity model, modified from that in Toth and Kisslinger (1984), was used to locate earthquakes within a volume defined by three cylinders centered on Kanaga Volcano, Mount Moffet (located near Adak), and Great Sitkin Volcano. The Cold Bay velocity model (McNutt and Jacob, 1986) was used to locate earthquakes that fell within cylindrical volumes centered on Mount Dutton, Pavlof Volcano, and Shishaldin Volcano. Earthquakes located at Fisher Caldera and Isanotski Volcano fell within the cylindrical volume centered on Shishaldin Volcano. Specific velocity models for the remaining monitored volcanoes were not available in the reporting period and the regional velocity model of Fogleman and others (1993) was used to locate earthquakes near these volcanoes. The regional velocity model and volcano-specific models used to locate earthquakes in this report are summarized in appendix 5. The cylindrical model "}, {"section_title": "Seismicity", "text": "Between 2013 and 2017, AVO located 28,172 earthquakes, an average of 5,634 earthquakes per year (3,840 in 2013, 5,819 in 2014, 5,297 in 2015, 6,151 in 2016, and 7,065 in 2017) at 34 volcanic centers with seismograph subnetworks ( fig. 4, appendix 1).

A summary of notable events located in the years covered by this AVO earthquake catalog were presented in past publications (appendix 8). Because a description of the AVO seismograph network is no longer an annual publication, notable seismic activity is included in the AVO annual summaries.

Gaps are shown in red, and continuous data is shown in green. %, percent. Date/time format is year, two-digit month and day Data-use scores developed by Matthew Haney are a normalized measure of the number of P-phases picks on a seismograph station in the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) earthquake catalog. They represent a combination of data availability, data quality, and picking preference of the analyst in the case of co-located instruments at a site. The normalization seeks to remove, as much as possible, the effect of frequency of earthquake occurrence near a particular station. The scores given in the tables 4.1-4.26 are based on an empirical relation derived from the AVO catalog between local magnitude (M L ) and the distance to the farthest P-phase pick (dmax): The relationship quantifies the fact that larger earthquakes register on stations at farther distances and in general are picked to greater range from the epicenter. For example, the above relation predicts that an earthquake with a magnitude of approximately 1.5 should be picked to distances of about 100 km. The regression model consists of three coefficients in the above equation which can be related to average values of geometrical spreading, attenuation, and site conditions in the Aleutian arc. Given the above relation between M L and dmax, whether a station should have been picked or not can be established for a located earthquake in the AVO catalog with a certain magnitude. Thus, the number of times a station should have been picked for the earthquakes in the AVO catalog can be determined, and this quantity can be compared to the number of times the station was actually picked. The ratio of the actual number of P-phase picks to the predicted number multiplied by 100 is the data use score. A score of 100 means a station was picked the same number of times it should have been picked based on the M L -dmax relation. Stations that are picked more often than they should be have data-use scores higher than 100, whereas stations picked less often than they should be have scores below 100.  (Power and others, 1996).
