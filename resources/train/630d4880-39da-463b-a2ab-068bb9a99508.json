There are many different ways to describe how a disease progresses. For example, studies of colorectal and lung cancer have described natural history as a series of transformations from normal to mutated epithelium to malignant clone to adenoma (Moolgavkar and Knudson 1981; Luebeck and Moolgavkar 2002) . Studies of lung and breast cancer have described natural history in terms of tumor size and metastatic status, where the risk of metastasis increases as tumor size increases (Kimmel and Flehinger 1991; Plevritis, Salzman, Sigal, and Glynn 2007) . Other models in cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have taken the concept of natural history to a higher level of abstraction, specifying only that disease progresses from a preclinical or latent state to a clinically apparent or symptomatic state (Louis, Albert, and Heghinian 1978; Walter and Day 1983; DeGruttola and Lagakos 1989) . In both acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer, these models have been extended to describe progression through several clinical stages of disease (Longini et al. 1989; Pinsky 2001) .\nWhy are natural history models of interest? In the case of cancer, they provide critical information about the early stages of disease during which cure is more likely. In particular, knowledge of the transition rate from preclinical to clinical disease provides an assessment of the window of opportunity for early detection. Knowledge of natural history has been used to develop recommendations for breast and colorectal cancer screening schedules (Parmigiani, Skates, and Zelen 2002; Loeve et al. 2000) , and has been used to predict the likely benefits of preventive interventions such as the administration of nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent colorectal cancer (Luebeck and Moolgavkar 2002) . In the case of HIV, natural history models have been of critical importance in projecting the size of the infected population and their likely health resource needs (Taylor 1989; Brookmeyer 1991) . Estimating the parameters of natural history models can be challenging because many of the events that comprise disease progression are unobservable. Serial monitoring, or screening, of asymptomatic individuals can narrow down the interval or intervals during which progression events may have occurred. Indeed, some of the most well-known studies of the natural history of breast cancer have been based on data from a single screening trial that took place in the late 1960s (Walter and Day 1983; Day and Walter 1984) . Similarly, many of the early studies of HIV latency were based on large studies in which asymptomatic individuals were serially tested to determine their HIV seropositivity status (Brookmeyer and Goedert 1989; DeGruttola and Lagakos 1989) .\nIn both cancer and HIV, the availability of biomarkers that indicate the presence or progression of disease can greatly enhance our estimation and understanding of disease natural history. In prostate cancer, for example, serial studies of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels taken prior to disease diagnosis have provided rough estimates of the sojourn time, which is the time from when the disease first becomes PSA-detectable to clinical diagnosis in the absence of PSA screening (Morrell, Pearson, Carter, and Brant 1995; Whittemore et al. 1995) . Similarly, in HIV, serial modeling of longitudinal CD4 counts has provided information on the interval from seroconversion to diagnosis of AIDS (DeGruttola, Lange, and Dafni 1991; Lange, Carlin, and Gelfand 1992; Pawitan and Self 1993) .\nAs more studies have begun to routinely measure marker levels, markers have become a part of the natural history description. New classes of models have been developed that simultaneously model marker growth and disease progression. At the one extreme, disease states may be defined by marker levels (see, e.g., Longini et al. 1989; Jackson and Sharples 2002; Jackson, Sharples, Thompson, Duffy, and Couto 2003) . More generally, marker levels are assumed to be associated with disease progression and to evolve concurrently with transitions between disease states. An early example, by Pawitan and Self (1993) , modeled the longitudinal CD4 trajectory using a random-effects model, but allowed the marker growth to depend on the times of seroconversion and AIDS. Pawitan and Self (1993) used standard survival analysis techniques to deal with censoring and truncation in their data. There now exists a large literature on the joint estimation of longitudinal and failure time data, which, although related to our approach, is not directly relevant to our goal in this article.\nIn cancer, most studies of longitudinal and failure time data pertain to disease progression and marker growth after a cancer diagnosis (e.g., Klein, Kotz, and Grever 1984; Kay 1986; Law, Taylor, and Sandler 2002) . In contrast, this article addresses the estimation of marker growth and disease progression prior to diagnosis. Our natural history model consists of three disease states: healthy, localized, and metastatic. Our goal is to estimate transition rates between these states as well as the rate of transition from preclinical (latent) disease to clinical diagnosis, which may depend on the disease state. Our data consist of longitudinal measurements of a marker that is associated with disease presence and progression. The marker levels are measured for disease cases prior to clinical diagnosis and for a set of controls without the disease, using stored serum. At diagnosis, information is available on the stage of the disease, that is, whether it is localized or metastatic. However, this information is not known at any time prior to diagnosis. Thus, models that require longitudinal data on both marker measurements and disease status (e.g., Craig, Fryback, Klein, and Klein 1999) are not applicable. We assume that the observed stage of disease is correct; in this, our models differ from hidden Markov models, in which the observed disease state is subject to misclassification and the underlying disease state is a hidden process that continuously evolves over time (Jackson et al. 2003; Foulkes and DeGruttola 2003) .\nOur model shares some similarities with models in which the risk of disease progression is assumed to be dependent on tumor size (Kimmel and Flehinger 1991; Bartoszynski et al. 2001) . We replace the tumor size variable in these models by an individual-specific marker trajectory, which we estimate concurrently with the transition rates between disease states. Our approach is advantageous over tumor-size-based models in that it allows for the utilization of serial marker data measured prior to diagnosis, whereas tumor size is generally only available at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, our approach is applicable to cancers for which tumor size is not easily quantified. An example of such a cancer is prostate cancer, which tends to be multifocal and is not always surgically removed.\nIn our application we use the PSA data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging to study the natural history of prostate cancer. Although PSA growth in cancer cases has been well documented, little is known about the connection between PSA growth trajectory and disease progression. Carter, Epstein, Chan, Fozard, and Pearson (1997) hinted at this gap in knowledge when they suggested, without formal justification, that a PSA level of 5.0 ng/ml or more represented a level at which \"cure is less likely.\" Our model allows us to answer questions like, \"What is the distribution of PSA level at the onset of disease and at the transition to an advanced metastatic stage?\" and \"For an individual, what is the probability of a transition to metastatic disease given prior PSA growth and a current PSA level?\" This article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our generic natural history model for disease progression. In Section 3 we specify our model to estimate the connection between PSA growth and the progression of prostate cancer. In Section 4 we present our model fit results. We conclude with a discussion in Section 5. "}, {"section_title": "A NATURAL HISTORY MODEL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": ". , t in i )", "text": ". Let x i denote the clinical stage of the disease in patient i. Without loss of generality, we assume that there are three possible stages of the disease: x i = 0 denotes a normal patient, while x i = 1 denotes a patient with initial stage of the disease and x i = 2 denotes advanced disease. We note that the definition of advanced disease is specific to the disease being studied. For example, in our application to prostate cancer we define advanced disease as metastatic disease. Let t ic denote the age of disease clinical diagnosis. The models we formulate are for symptomatically detected disease. Moreover, we assume that the disease is progressive in that after onset the disease is in an early stage and, left untreated, it progresses to a more advanced stage.\nLet \u03b8 denote the parameter vector that describes the joint distribution of the responses. The likelihood function is given by\nwhere\n, and x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x N ) . We note that for a normal patient, t ic is censored at t in i . Let us examine the contribution to the likelihood function given by the observed data (y i , t ic , x i ) in subject i. We first discuss the likelihood function for patients with disease. Age at clinical diagnosis depends on the age of disease onset and it may also depend on whether the disease transitioned to an advanced stage. Let t i0 and t iA denote, respectively, age of disease onset and age of transition to an advanced stage of the disease in patient i. Both t i0 and t iA are unobserved latent variables that apply to diagnosed cases. We assume that clinical stage of the disease is informative about these ages of transitions. A patient in the initial stage of the disease experienced t i0 , but not t iA by age t ic , that is, the event {x i = 1} corresponds to {t i0 < t ic < t iA }. Analogously, a patient with an advanced stage of the disease experienced both t i0 and t iA , that is, {x i = 2} corresponds to the event {t i0 < t iA < t ic }. In other words, for a patient with disease, stage is an event of the (latent and observed) ages (t i0 , t iA , t iC ). Under these assumptions, for patients in the initial stage of the disease the corresponding factor in the likelihood function (1) is as follows. We use f (\u00b7) to generically denote a probability density or mass function and use I A to denote the indicator function for event A:\nSimilarly, for patients with advanced disease,\nFinally, we assume that the likelihood contribution for normal patients is as follows. For normal patients, we define t iC to be the last observation time, that is, t iC is the censoring time for the unobserved clinical detection,\nwhere S c is the survival function for age at disease clinical detection. For a normal patient, the first term in (4) corresponds to disease onset t i0 before t iC . In this case, the likelihood contribution comes from the longitudinal responses and the censored information that the patient survived detection of the disease to age t iC . The second term corresponds to onset after t iC and thus the likelihood contribution is only through the longitudinal response. We estimate the proposed natural history model under the Bayesian approach. Let \u03c0(\u03b8 ) denote the prior distribution on the model parameters \u03b8 . The posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data (y, t c , x) is given by\nNote that our model has two subject-specific latent variables t i0 and t iA . The likelihood factors for patients with disease formally requires double integration over t i0 and t iA . In general, this integral will not be available in closed analytical form. This also implies that the posterior distribution of the model parameters is not in closed form. To overcome these difficulties, we implement posterior inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with chained data augmentation (Tanner 1996 and t iA denote, respectively, age of disease onset and age of transition to an advanced stage in subject i. Introducing the latent event times t A and t 0 , we find\nMoreover,\nA convenient feature is that by augmenting the data with t 0 and t A , we eliminate the double integrals in (2) and (3). The interval censored information on the onset age and transition to an advanced disease is still accounted for by including the event x in \u03c0(t 0 , t A |\u03b8 , y, t c , x). The chained data augmentation algorithm for posterior simulation consists of three steps:\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 iteratively for k = 1, . . . , K iterations.\nNote that steps 1 and 2 are usual steps in the Gibbs sampler algorithm. Values of (t 0 , t A ) \"augment\" the data. Their role is to facilitate estimation of the model parameters \u03b8 . However, they are not known-they are also \"parameters\" and as such they must be estimated using the observed data. This is accomplished with the iterative simulation procedure described in the preceding text.\nIn the next section we discuss model estimation in the context of a study of the natural history of prostate cancer."}, {"section_title": "PSA AND PROSTATE CANCER", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Data", "text": "We apply our natural history model to PSA data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is an ongoing multidisciplinary study that began in 1958. In addition to describing human physiological changes that occur with age, the study has also been beneficial in helping examine differences between normal aging and disease processes (Shock et al. 1984) . Study participants are volunteers who return to the study center every two years for three days of free biomedical and psychological examinations. In our analyses we use serum PSA levels measured in male BLSA participants using a frozen serum bank for available retrospective samples donated during participant visits. Moreover, we utilize data from men who had at least two PSA measurements. One man had a PSA measurement recorded as zero. In our analyses we replace the zero with the minimally detectable PSA level (equal to .03 ng/ml). Table 1 provides some additional information on this study. Figure 1 shows the longitudinal (log) PSA trajectories in normal and prostate cancer patients. Although PSA levels increase in both groups of men, those who develop prostate cancer show higher growth rates in PSA.\nUsing the general model structure introduced in Section 2, we now define, for each component of the likelihood function, \nWe assume that the residuals are independent and identically distributed, that is, it \u223c Normal(0, \u03c3 2 ) and x + = max(x, 0). In (8) the function \u03c6(\u00b7) describes the true growth of the logtransformed PSA. The growth of log PSA is constant until disease onset at age t i0 , which in turn induces a change in the log PSA trajectory. Changepoint models such as this have been extensively used to describe PSA growth in prostate cancer patients (see, e.g., Inoue, Etzioni, Slate, Morrell, and Penson 2004 and the references therein)."}, {"section_title": "Time to Transition and to Clinical", "text": "Detection.

In this section we introduce several alternative specifications for the hazard functions for t i0 , t iA , and t iC . Table 2 summarizes the alternative model specifications.\nSpecifically, models M 1 and M 2 investigate the appropriateness of the assumption that the hazard of disease onset increases linearly with age. In model M 1 we address this question using a nonlinear function of age. In model M 2 we assume that disease onset t i0 arises from the mixture \u03c0f 1 (t i0 )\nwhere f j is the density characterized by the hazard function \u03bb 0j (t) = \u03b3 0j t, j = 0, 1. The mixture allows representation of a heterogeneous population of men, including subpopulations with early and late disease onset.\nModels M 3 , M 4 , M 4,1 , and M 4,2 allow us to investigate another critical assumption under model M 0 . We consider modifications of the assumed linear hazard function for transition to metastatic disease. Specifically, in model M 3 the hazard for transition is linearly dependent on years from disease onset. In model M 4 we investigate whether transition is dependent on nonlinear functions of both years from disease onset and true PSA levels. Models M 4,1 and M 4,2 , nested within M 4 , are used to assess whether both covariates in M 4 should be included and, if not, which covariate provides a better fit to the data.\nFinally, models M 5 -M 7,2 are alternative models that investigate the assumption, under model M 0 , that detection is linearly dependent on true PSA levels. In words, model M 5 specifies that metastatic patients have higher likelihood to be detected sooner than patients with localized disease. Model M 6 specifies that clinical detection is linearly dependent on years from disease onset. In model M 7 we investigate whether clinical detection is dependent on nonlinear functions of both years from disease onset and true PSA levels. The nested models M 7,1 and M 7,2 are used to assess whether both covariates in model M 7 should be added.\nOther alternative choices for h A and h c were considered, such as those in which the hazard functions were dependent on different functions of the true PSA growth. We considered the functions h A implies a distribution with a linearly increasing hazard function for transition. Similar formulations were considered for the hazard of clinical detection. Models fitted with these alternative formulations for the hazard function, however, were shown to have poor fit and have been omitted from the table."}, {"section_title": "Model Assessment and Comparison", "text": "To assess the competing models, we calculate the posterior predictive density of observation (y i , t ic , x i ) for subject i conditional on all observed data except that from subject i, that is, we compute\nwhere \u2212i indicates the exclusion of data from subject i. This value is known as the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO; Gelfand, Dey, and Chang 1992) and may be used as an outlier diagnostic tool. Observations that have a low CPO indicate poor (predictive) fit of the model. The CPO is also often used for model selection. Models with, on average, higher CPOs are favored over those with lower CPOs.\nWe note that\nThus, the calculation of the CPOs entails reestimation of the model by excluding data from each subject i at a time. That is, one evaluates f (\u03b8 |y \u2212i , t c,\u2212i , x \u2212i ), i = 1, . . . , N, the posterior distribution of parameters \u03b8 conditional on all the data except that from a particular subject i. This would make the computational task challenging in multiparametric models involving a moderate to large number of observations. However, a simplification of the computational efforts is achieved by observing that\nThus we can use importance sampling to evaluate CPOs, using the posterior distribution f (\u03b8 |y, t, x) as the importance sampling density and w(\u03b8) = [f (y i , t ic , x i |\u03b8 )] \u22121 as the weight function. For subject i we compute the weighted average\n, where \u03b8 (k) , k = 1, . . . , K, are samples from f (\u03b8 |y, t, x). We need to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of \u03b8 only once, conditioning on all observations. This makes the calculation of CPOs feasible.\nIn addition to the CPOs, we calculate Bayes factors (Kass and Raftery 1995) to summarize the evidence provided by the data in favor of one model over an alternative. The Bayes factor for comparing models M i and M j is the ratio BF ij = \nf (y, t, x|M i )/f (y, t, x|M j ). We use the interpretation guidelines provided by Kass and Raftery (1995) in which there is positive evidence against model M i when 1 \u2264 log(BF ij ) < 3 and strong evidence when log(BF ij ) \u2265 3."}, {"section_title": "Bayesian Estimation", "text": "Our priors for the PSA growth rate parameters at the population level were centered at the mean value zero. Priors for the hazard rate parameters were centered at the mean value .1 and the remaining parameters were centered at 1. Prior variances for growth rate and hazard rate parameters were set equal to .1. For the remaining parameters, prior variances were set equal to 1. We note that prior variances for the population level growth rate parameters were based on published analysis of PSA growth using other datasets (see Inoue et al. 2004 ). In the next section we report the results from our analysis using the preceding prior and also comment on a sensitivity analysis in which we inflated the prior variances.\nWe estimate the natural history model using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with data augmentation as discussed in Section 2. In particular, we use a hybrid algorithm with Gibbs steps to update population level parameters and Metropolis steps to update the remaining parameters (Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller 1953; Geman and Geman 1984; Gelfand and Smith 1990) .\nTo obtain samples from the posterior distribution of all parameters, we ran our Markov chain for a burn-in period of 10,000,000 iterations, followed by an additional 500,000 iterations from which we stored sampled values at every 20th iteration. Convergence diagnostics were performed with the BOA (Bayesian Output Analysis) package developed by Smith (2005) , using the Geweke (1992) and Raftery and Lewis (1992) diagnostic tests. Under Geweke's diagnostic test, none of the p values was less than .01. Moreover, the Raftery and Lewis convergence diagnostic test gives dependence factors, which measure the increase in the number of iterations needed to reach convergence, of less than 5. These results do not provide evidence against convergence of our chains."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "We calculated the values of log(BF 0j ) for comparing model M 0 with an alternative model M j . The results, shown in Table 3, indicate that model M 0 is superior to most of the alternative models. The comparison with model M 4,1 is less conclusive, but slightly pointing toward the simpler model M 0 . Models M 7 and M 7,1 are both superior to model M 0 . In particular, model M 7,1 is slightly superior to model M 7 .\nTo further compare models and assess the predictive fit in each subject we computed CPOs. Figure 2 shows the logtransformed CPOs for prostate cancer patients computed under models M 0 (which dominated most of the alternative models), M 4,1 (for which no conclusive evidence in favor of model M 0 could be drawn), and M 7,1 (which dominated model M 0 ). The CPOs also favor model M 7,1 . When comparing models M 7 and M 7,1 , the CPOs also favored model M 7,1 (not shown). Comparisons are based on the frequency of subjects i with higher CPO under one versus the other model.\nBased on the foregoing comparisons, there is no strong evidence against the assumption that the hazard of disease onset is linearly increasing with age. Moreover, there is no strong evidence against the assumption that transition to metastatic disease is linearly dependent on the true PSA growth. There is some evidence that the hazard of clinical detection only depends (nonlinearly) on time since disease onset.\nIn subsequent text, we present additional results for model M 7,1 only. Figure 3 shows the marginal posterior distributions of the population level parameters superimposed with the respective priors. The figure shows substantial learning from the data. The marginal posterior distributions show changes in both location and spread when compared with the prior distributions. We estimate a 3.62% annual change of PSA growth before onset with a 95% posterior credible interval (CI) [1.33%, 6.08%], and a post-onset growth of 24.21% with a 95% CI = [4.22%, 47.83%].\nIn Figure 4 we show the posterior probability of disease onset beyond a given age, that is, P (t 0 > t|data). We find, for example, that the posterior probability that a transition occurs after age 70 is 80.63% (95% credible interval = [73.24%, 86.69%]). Thus, we estimate that roughly one out of five men has developed latent disease by age 70.\nSimilarly, Figure 5 shows the posterior probability of clinical detection beyond a given time from disease onset. The figure shows that the posterior probability of clinical detection one year after disease onset is 74.23% (95% CI = [65.42%, 81.40%]). The probability of detection after two years from disease onset decreases to 54.72% (95% CI = [42.46%, 65.83%]). Figure 6 shows the posterior probability of metastatic transition beyond a given age along with the predictive PSA trajectory for subjects with different PSA growth patterns after disease onset at age 70. We assume that, with the exception of b i2 , the subject-specific parameters are at the population median levels (i.e., b i0 = \u22121.39, b i1 = .04). We then consider three different values for b i2 . The solid line represents a case with median post-changepoint PSA growth (i.e., b i2 = .18). The dotted line represents a case with slower growth, while the dashed line represents a case with faster growth, where slower and faster growths are defined in terms of percent decrease/increase relative to the median growth. The figure shows that for a case with median PSA growth, there is approximately a 17.30% chance of metastasis within 5 years from disease onset and a 52.73% chance of metastasis within 10 years from disease onset. The figure also shows that transitions to metastatic disease happen at an earlier age for patients with faster PSA growth, than those with slower growth. Moreover, for patients with faster PSA growth, transitions happen at a higher level of PSA. For a case with median PSA growth, the chance of metastasis by the time PSA reaches a level of 10 ng/ml is 44.27%, and this increases to 70.08% by the time PSA level reaches 20 ng/ml. Figure 7 shows 95% posterior credible intervals for subjectspecific parameters by stage of the disease at clinical detection. To facilitate visualization of the results, we only show credible intervals for prostate cancer patients. The figure indicates that patients with metastatic disease have similar PSA slopes before disease onset, but slightly higher PSA post-onset slopes than patients with localized disease, as shown in Figures 7(b) and 7(c). For localized patients, as specified by the model, metastatic transition happens after diagnosis, while for metastatic patients, the transition happens before. It is noteworthy that in this dataset, metastatic patients are predicted to have had the transition about 2.84 years before diagnosis on average, while localized patients are predicted to transition within 5.88 years from the time of disease diagnosis. We also calculated the 95% posterior credible intervals for subject-specific parameters in normal patients. For normal patients, disease onsets are predicted to occur, on average, 61.49 years after the last follow-up, which implies that they basically only experienced the linear growth of PSA. Moreover, on average, the subject-specific prechangepoint slopes are lower than those observed in prostate cancer patients. Figure 8 shows the fit of six randomly selected patients along with the estimated predictive distributions of disease onset and transition to metastatic disease. The figure shows that our model captures the nonlinear growth in log PSA after disease onset in prostate cancer patients.\nFinally, we note that we performed sensitivity analysis by inflating (doubling) the prior variances. The implied estimates, however, did not change substantially. For example, the posterior median pre-onset growth rate is 3.71% (95% CI = [1. 41%, 6 .17%]), while the posterior median post-onset growth rate is 24.87% (95% CI = [4.86%, 48.17%]).\nTo explore clinical implications of our model results, we simulated a cohort of 500,000 men, setting the population level parameters at the posterior median values estimated under model M 7,1 , but now also accounting for death. We note that survival information is not available in our dataset. Thus, we simulate time to death from other causes using external information from life tables (http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/wilmoth/ mortality/states.html). The simulation generates subject-specific PSA trajectories and events in each man's lifetime by generating disease, onset, transition to metastatic disease and death from other causes. This enables us to compute the likelihood of overdiagnosis, which we define as the probability of prostate cancer detection through PSA testing that would have otherwise not been diagnosed during the patient's lifetime. Table 4 shows overdiagnosis by age at screening and PSA thresholds Figure 4 . Posterior survival probability of disease onset. Circles represent the median posterior probability, while the vertical lines denote the limits of the 95% posterior credible intervals.

As expected, test sensitivity decreases with higher thresholds and increases when screening occurs at older ages. The specificity, on the other hand, increases with higher thresholds and decreases at older ages. The values are within the range of Figure 5 . Posterior survival probability of clinical detection from disease onset time. Circles represent the median posterior probability, while the vertical lines denote the limits of the 95% posterior credible intervals. The posterior probability that clinical detection occurs one year after disease onset is 71% (95% CI = [65%, 81%]); the probability of detection two years after disease onset decreases to 54% (95% CI = [42%, 66%]). Figure 6 . Posterior survival probability of metastatic transition ( ) and posterior predictive level of PSA ( ) by age (t). The figure shows, for example, that in a case with the median PSA growth ( ) with disease onset at age 70, there is an approximately 83% chance of metastatic spread after age 75, with a predictive PSA level of 4.44 ng/ml. The probability drops to 47% at age 80 with PSA level of 13.07 ng/ml. ( percent increase: 20; percent decrease: 20.) those reported in the medical literature. Crawford, Leewansangtong, Goktas, Houlthaus, and Baier (1999) , for example, using the 4.0 ng/ml cutoff, report sensitivity of 33.9% and specificity of 70.4% among 50-59-year-old men. Table 4 also shows that among cases detected by a positive PSA at age 50, about 5% would never become clinical cases in their lifetime across our different choices of PSA thresholds. The overdiagnosis probabilities increase at older ages. At age 80, we estimate that about 55% of cases are overdiagnosed. Our estimates for older men are compatible with those reported by Etzioni et al. (2002) , who estimated that, among 60-84-year-old men, the overdiagnosis rates were approximately 30%."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this article we have proposed a natural history model for disease progression and biomarker growth prior to diagnosis. In the context of our application, the basic premise of our model is that PSA increases with time from disease onset and that disease progresses as PSA increases. The implication is that there is a single population of PSA growth curves with disease status that changes over time as the PSA level changes. Our model explicitly links PSA and disease progression; it is, to our knowledge, the first formal specification of this connection. The model specifies that transitions to metastasis and to clinical detection depend on the level of PSA, which is assumed from other investigations (Morrell et al. 1995; Whittemore et al. 1995) to follow a piecewise exponential form. Our results suggest that for a case with median PSA growth after diagnosis and disease onset at age 70 (see Fig. 6 ), the likelihood of transition to metastasis by the time PSA reaches the 5 ng/ml level is, on\nFigure 7.

(a) Subject-specific intercepts (b i0 ); (b) subject-specific slopes pre-disease onset (b i1 ); (c) subject-specific slopes post-disease onset (b i2 ); (d) subject-specific time to disease onset (t 0i ); (e) subject-specific time to transition to metastasis (t Ai ). average, 19.97%, and the likelihood of transition to metastasis by the time PSA reaches the 10 ng/ml level is, on average, 44.27%. Assuming that localized disease is curable, our results thus indicate that at a PSA level of 5, cure is rather more likely than not.\nIn our model we estimate an average annual PSA increase of 3.62% before disease onset and 24.21% afterward. The postonset rate is within the range of values found in a meta-analysis (Inoue et al. 2004 ) that estimated annual growth rates of 15% for localized disease and 63% for metastatic disease. We note, however, that our sample of cases may represent a relatively aggressive subgroup. Several results support this notion. Average PSA levels at last followup were 8.13 ng/ml for local cases and 69.75 ng/ml for metastatic cases. These levels are extremely high, particularly for metastatic cases. Also, on average, the predictive median time from onset to diagnosis (sojourn time) is less than 5 years (mean = 3.27, 95% predictive credible interval = [.09, 11.58]). Other studies (e.g., Gann, Hennekens, and Stampfer 1995) have estimated the lead time (time from positive PSA to clinical diagnosis) to be roughly 5 years on average (Gann et al. 1995) , which exceeds our average sojourn time. Although this again indicates that our cohort may be weighted toward more aggressive cancers, it also suggests that the changepoint in PSA growth that we have used as a proxy for disease onset may be occurring some time after the true biological onset time, which cannot be estimated from this dataset.\nOur model is fully parametric, which raises the question of adequacy of our model assumptions. We evaluated many parametric choices for describing the hazard functions of onset, transition to metastatic disease, and clinical detection. Our comparisons with alternative models did not indicate strong evidence against the assumption that the hazard of disease onset increases linearly with age. We also did not find strong evidence against the assumption that the hazard of metastatic transition is dependent on a linear function of PSA. There was evidence that the hazard of disease detection is dependent on a nonlinear function of time from disease onset. Finally, we note that instead of considering parametric models, semi-or nonparametric methods could be used for modeling the hazard functions (see, e.g., M\u00fcller and Quintana 2004) . We did not pursue this approach in our application due to the limited number of metastatic patients in our dataset. [Received September 2004 . Revised September 2006 "}]
