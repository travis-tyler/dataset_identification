Th e SLOSH model is not simply a verticall y ave raged tw o-dim en sional model but in stead it is ba sed on a flow st r uct ure assumpt ion. Th e flow structure is primarily controlled by bottom st ress which is not collinea r with depth-a veraged velocity (JE LESNIANSKI, 1970 ). J ENTER a nd MADSEN (1989), (J M hereafter), exa mined the bottom st ress of wind-driven flows in a coasta l sea using a depthresolving model (J M model hereafter). Th ey demonstrated that th e conventional drag formulation would be unlikely to pr edict cor re ctly th e bottom st ress direction given depth-avera ged velocity .

The second assumption of aT! lij 0 is not really supported by measurements (e.g., LENTZ and WINANT, 1986 ). Steady solution requires iteration for both models. We first assumed a value for the cross -shore pre ssure gradient. Th e models then calculated Wand T. With upd ated Q, the mod el calculations were repeated. The convergence criteria was given by U~O. We took one month an emometer data at 19.5-m above the mean sea level from th e US Army Corp of Engineers Field Research Facility (FRF) a t Duck, North Ca rolina (Figu re 4). LENTZ (994) showed that the observed wind near the coast may be lower than th e surface wind in th e deep water because of large gr adi ents in wind stress magnitude near the coast. Thus we ad opted Wu 's (1982 ) surface drag coefficient at lO-m abov e sea sur face (C I O = (0.8 + 0.065 X Uw;nd) X 10-3 where U wind is wind sp eed ) which gives slightly larger dr ag coefficient, Co' For an unsteady flow, JELESNLANSKI et al.

HEAPS (983) al so pointed out that the wind drag coefficient depends on the st ate of development of the sea surface waves thus many surge models us e high er CD va lues than tho se suggeste d by air-sea interaction studies such as Wu (1982). The calculated u -; values were nearly identical in magnitude from both models (Figu re 5). Th e directions of th e bottom stress also we re comparable for th e high winds: The ag re ements between the mode ls a nd th e esti mation from th e log-fit of the observ ation data were reasonably good during th e high wind peri od.

The abrupt shi ft in the flow direction coincide with rapid wind speed changes, which shows that th e st eady flow assumption cannot hold especially for the ra pidly deceler ating wind s. Around the storm peak for 10/16/94, the modeled bottom friction is still dominantly alongshore with weakly offshor e component whereas th e observ ation shows weakly onshore variation. Considering the error of up to 5\u00b0in th e electromagnetic current sensors, we cannot be sure about th e discrepancy between th e modeled and observed directions. Th e underestimation of the modeled value of U ' b is also a ppa re nt during this period . With increased wind s, also wav e activity becomes dominant.

In the JM model, th e constant bottom roughness , Zo = 2 X 10 -5 m based on zoJh = 10-6 with h = 20 m, certainly is an underestimation for a condition of high wave s.
