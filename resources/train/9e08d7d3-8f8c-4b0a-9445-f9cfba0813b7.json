This study analyzes U.S. farm level investment in machinery, equipment and structures between 1996-2013. A synthetic panel is constructed using annual cross-sectional farm level observations from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Cohorts are formed by grouping farms into similar categories based upon farm production type, region and farm typology. This methodology allows the use of fixed effects to control for cohort specific and timeinvariant similarities in investment levels, addresses non-investment in a single period by using cohort average investment rates, and allows links between investment levels and other key determinants across cohorts over time."}, {"section_title": "Appendix Table", "text": "Within farm typologies, farms are classified based on levels of gross cash farm income (GCFI) and operator primary occupation. Commercial farms have GCFI greater or equal to $350,000. Resident farms have GCFI less than $350,000 and a primary operator occupation other than farming. Intermediate farms also have GCFI less than $350,000 but identify their primary occupation as farming. Making these distinctions is important if investment behavior is related both to GCFI levels and primary occupation. Previous studies find differences between in farm capital investment rates and changes in sales or income measurements, tax policy variables, and cash flow measurements based on farm size and levels of off-farm income. To test if these same relationships hold when using the ARMS data and farm typology categories, I develop three hypotheses based upon these three commonly found and/or asserted relationships. The three hypothesis developed are that xv compared to the other farm typologies there is a greater increase in investment rates given: 1) an increase in output prices and returns on investment for commercial farms, 2) changes in tax policy variables for resident farms, and 3) changes in measures of credit constraints for intermediate farms. I test these hypotheses by allowing these key coefficients to vary across farm typologies. Given the results of these tests, I find evidence to support the first two hypotheses, though this varies by commodity type, but little evidence to support the third. Using the estimated model, changes in specific model coefficients are used to explain differences in investment levels in 2013 vs. 1996 and to estimate average farm investment levels in 2024. Changes in farm capital investment in 1996 vs. 2013 can be attributed to changes in output prices, interest rates and year specific impacts. Decreases in net farm incomes on commercial grain and livestock farms, declining output prices for intermediate livestock farms, lower bonus tax depreciation expense limits on resident livestock farms, and rising interest rates for grain farms across typologies lead to large declines in average farm investment in 2024 compared to 2013."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION", "text": "Investment in machinery, equipment and structures by farms in the U.S. grew rapidly over the past two decades. In 1996, U.S. farms, on average, spent $19.6 billion on long-lived machinery, equipment and structures (excluding dwellings). By 2013 annual farm capital investment rose to $37.9 billion (USDA, August 2015). This rise in investment coincided with favorable economic conditions in agriculture, including rising commodity prices and resulting growing farm incomes, generous tax investment incentives, low interest rates, rising farm equity and decreasing debt levels. These favorable conditions are not expected to continue. After declining in 2014, net cash receipts and net cash farm income are expected to again decrease by 9% and 21% respectively (USDA, November 2015). Short and long term farm debt has seen a steady rise over the past year and is expected to have grown by 3.5% in 2015 (USDA, November 2015). While future equipment and machinery tax deduction levels are set to continue at their current levels for the immediate future (Gearhardt, January 2015), loan interest rates are expected to increase in response to the Federal Reserve's increase in the federal funds rate in December of 2015 with further planned in 2016. Given the different and interconnected impacts of changes in each of these on farm capital investment and the capital intensive nature of US agriculture production, those engaged the manufacturing and retailing of farm capital as well as policy makers involved in agricultural loan programs would benefit from obtaining accurate estimates of the potential impacts of said changes on future levels of farm capital investment. An obstacle to obtaining such estimates is that there are few studies examining how investment responds to changes in key drivers of investment which differentiate between farms based upon farm typology, a classification of farms based on Gross Cash Farm Income levels and the primary occupation of the principle operator. I believe that average farm capital investment responds differently to changes in key determinants of investment given differences in farm typologies. Estimated investment responses need to reflect this. Not accounting for these differences, and instead using the average across farms, may mask important fundamental differences between how farms will respond given changes in the key drivers of investment. These differences are important considering the heterogeneity in U.S. farm capital investment levels across farms of different sizes. The US agricultural sector is comprised of small segment of large commercial farms, earning large farm incomes and making large annual capital investments, and many smaller farms accounting for a much smaller portion of total farm capital investment. Examining the investment behavior of large commercial farms as well as smaller farms, and differentiating according to operator occupation, has value. Given that they comprise a greater portion of total production and investment, the behavior of large commercial farms will have a greater impact on total agricultural capital investment in the economy, as well as on the technology employed and environmental impact associated with producing the US food supply. Alternatively, many beginning and disadvantaged farmers do not fall into the large commercial farm category, but instead operate farms with lower farm income levels and/or may have another primary off-farm occupation. Determining what drives investment on smaller farms is a key priority when planning for and evaluating programs to ensure that beginning and/or part-time farm operators have the needed capital and technology to earn a reasonable profit, and the opportunity to grow, if they desire. In this study, I will examine differences in investment levels in response to changes in key drivers of investment across farm typologies. The structure of the paper is as follows: I define farm typologies, examine capital investment levels by farm typology, and review the literature. Next, I develop a fixed effects regression model, explain the methodology for constructing pseudo panels from ARMS survey data, and introduce the three hypothesis I will test using this model. These hypotheses are that investment rates will increase more on A) commercial farms given changes in output rates and/or returns to investment, B) resident farms given changes in tax policy, and C) intermediate farms given changes in liquidity or other measures of credit and financial constraints. After estimating the model separately for farms within the following three categories 1 : 1) grains, 2) fruit, nut, vegetable, and nursery crops (FNV), and 3) livestock farms, I compare my results to other panel data farm capital investment studies and test my hypothesis. Next, I use the estimated model elasticities to calculate the change in average farm capital investment levels between 1996 and 2013 attributed to changes in model variables between these years. Finally, I estimate projected changes in average farm capital investment in 2024 compared to 2013 given projected changes in key model variable. Previous studies have examined the impact of credit constraints on farms according to asset levels (Ariayante and , age (Ariayante and Barry et al., 2000;Bierlen and Featherstone, 1998) and measures of credit worthiness (Barry et al., 2000). They have not differentiated between the impacts of output prices, returns, liquidity levels, and taxes on farms accounting for differences in primary operator occupation. My study is different from others in that I split farms into categories based upon levels of net farm income as well as primary operator occupation and look for differences in investment responses given changes in taxes, liquidity levels, output prices, return, and other measures of financial constraints. Another distinguishing factor is my use of ARMS, a national survey of U.S. farms. Other farm level panel data studies have used a relatively small set of farms within a limited geographical region. In contrast, I utilize survey data from farms within 48 different U.S. states. By employing the provided weights, I am able to obtain estimates representative of the US farm population as well as to distinguish between farms using the detailed production and financial farm business and household level data within the survey. Finally, to account for links between investment levels over multiple time periods I construct a synthetic panel using ARMS observations. This approach has not been utilized to study investment behavior within the ARMS survey in any currently published literature. Research on investment responses to changes in economic conditions which adequately accounts for differences by farm size, operator occupation, and production type can provide useful information on future farm capital investment demand. Having more detailed information on commercial farm capital investment demand in particular can assist the farm manufacturing and retail sector control production levels and coordinate to meet demand within differing regions and commodity specific capital good sectors. Having accurate information regarding future farm capital demand can also assist FSA program administrators in the planning and implication of FSA operating loan programs. Farm loan programs have target participation rates for beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, and limited resource farms. Farms meeting these criteria, on average, have smaller than average levels of farm income and/or a primary occupation other than farming. The knowledge generate in this study will be helpful in meeting these goals. Finally, many of the key determinants of farm investment are also affected by changes in farm policy, farm programs, and general economywide macroeconomic policy. This includes farm income levels and variability, commodity prices, tax rates and interest rates. Knowing the impacts of changes in investment given changes in these variables will be helpful for those involved in decision making within these diverse areas."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: BACKGROUND AND INVESTMENT BY FARM TYPOLOGIES", "text": "In this chapter I describe the ARMS data from which I draw information on farm capital investment and other farm characteristics, explain the farm typology classification system and details regarding the characteristics of farms within each typology, provide an outline of what is included when I speak of farm capital investment, and provide some information of the different levels of investment across farm typologies, regions, and production category types."}, {"section_title": "Arms", "text": "The data on investment and distribution of farms by typology is from the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). ARMS is a national survey jointly conducted by the USDA and NASS. Sampled farms 2 from within 48 states are asked to provide information on farm production processes, financial measurements for the given survey year, , and farm operation and household characteristics. The ARMS is unique in that it is the only national survey to provide such a detailed level of information on farm household income and characteristics on such a large scale (National Research Council, 2008). The information collected is vital to the role of the fulfilling the USDA's mandate to prepare estimates of U.S. farm income and production practices (National Research Council, 2008). ARMS follows an annual, multiphase, multi-frame, stratified, probability sampling design (ERS, ARMS Farm Financial and Crop Production Practices, 2014). The survey is conducted in three phases. Phase one occurs in the spring of the survey year and consists of verifying the farm fits the criteria of the survey in a given year. The phase two occurs in fall and obtains information regarding farm production practices. Phase three occurs in the winter following the survey year. In phase three detailed information regarding revenue and expense data are collected. The list of farms to sample are chosen from within two frames, the list frame and the area frame. The list frame is a list of farms maintained by NASS and updated at a regular basis using different sources. The area frame comes from the NASS June area survey and is obtained by determining farms that appear on the June area survey with those not on the list frame. This attempts to cover any farms missing on the list frame so that all farms are sampled accordingly. There are multiple versions of the survey corresponding to different survey phases and methods of delivery. Versions 2-4 correspond to phase two. These commodity specific phase two surveys are conducted by personal interview. Versions 1 and 5 correspond to phase three. Version 1 of the phase three survey is conducted by personal interview. The data from this version is referred to as the Cost and Returns report (CRR). Version 5 refers to a separate mailin version of the phase three survey. This is called the Core version and contains less questions compared to version 1. Within this study I only use observations from the CRR. ARMS is a stratified sample. This stratified procedure reflects the expected differences in farms given farm size, location and production type. Farms are grouped in stratum based upon the farm's state, gross sales, and commodity type. Farms are randomly sampled from within stratum. Stratified sampling relies on the theory that by grouping farms into samples and sampling within these smaller units, more efficient estimates, with lower sample variances, can be made as compared to random sampling within the whole population (Dubman, 2000). In addition, this reduces the cost of sampling while ensuring that the population in question is adequately covered. Each farm observation has a weight reflecting the probability that they are selected out of the general population. These weights are used to calculate population statistics and when making population inferences. These help insure that estimates for the farm population drawn from the sample results correctly reflect national farm averages. The weights adjust for nonresponse to both individual questions and to the survey as a whole. I take advantage of the weights 3 provided and employ these when estimating population means and when constructing 3 There are different weights provided depending on the versions of the survey used. Within this study I use the weights associated with the CRR when calculating summary statistics for the population and when forming the pseudo panel datasets. These weights were revised in 2012 to reflect 2012 Census of my pseudo panels. This allows my results to correctly reflect the U.S. Farm population over time rather than just the choice of farms sampled that year. The ARMS survey data provides a cross sectional sample of farms where the individual farms and the number of farms sampled differ each year. The ARMS survey began in 1996. Since its inception, the number of surveyed farms has grown. Within this study, I use years 1996-2013. This provides 152,609 initial observations across 18 years. Table 1 lists the number of observations within the survey dataset by year.

Below I provide a description of the typologies as well as characteristics of farms within each typology. Agriculture data on farm numbers and revisions of acreage and production statistics by NASS (USDA, 2016). The weights employed in this study reflect this revision."}, {"section_title": "Defining Farm Typologies", "text": "I separate the farm observations into categories based upon level of annual Gross Cash Farm Income (GCFI) and the primary occupation of the operator. These categories are based upon the 2013 updated ERS farm typologies (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013). Using average measurements across farms of different size and types can mask significant levels of variation and be misleading (Hoppe, 2014). To account for this variation, ERS has developed a set of farm typologies, or classifications. These typologies classify farms into homogenous groupings. These groupings allow for more accurate estimates of average levels of farm revenues, incomes, production expenses, assets, debts, and other key farm and operator characteristics. The first division is between family farms and nonfamily farms. Family farms are any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and/or individuals related to the operator. Nonfamily farms include those organized as cooperatives or nonfamily corporations, those held in trust, and farms with a hired manager. Family farms are further divided into small and large family farms 4 . Small family farms are defined as having GCFI of less than $350,000. Small family farms are further split into resident and intermediate farms. Intermediate farms are small family farms where the primary operator identifies their primary occupation as farming. Resident farms are small family farms in which the primary operator lists a primary occupation other than farming. This includes retired farm operators and those employed in a non-farming primary occupation. Commercial farms, are farms with an annual GCFI of greater than $350,000. This category makes no distinction between the primary operator's occupation and includes nonfamily farms. These farm typology categories are summarized in Table 2 below. 4 Under the ERS farm typologies small family farms include 1) retirement farms, where the primary occupation is retirement and GCFI < $350,000, 2) off-farm occupation farms, where the primary occupation is nonfarm and GCFI < 350,000, 3) low-sales, with farming as the primary occupation and GCFI < $150,000, and 4) moderate sales, where farming is primary occupation and GCFI between $150,000 and $350,000. Commercial farms include the ERS farm typologies 1) mid-sized family farms, with GCFI between $350,000 and 999,999, 2) large family farms, with GCFI between $1,000,000 and $4,999,999, 3) very family large farms, with GCFI of $5,000,000 or more, and 4) non-family farms. Using the ERS conventions, I combine retirement farms and off-farm occupation farms in the resident farm category and low-sales and moderate sales in the intermediate farm category. I combine mid-sized family farms, large family farms, very large family farms and nonfamily farms to form the commercial farm category.  (Hoppe, 2014). 2 Occupation is the task for which the operator spends 50% or more of his or her work time The GCFI threshold for the farm typology definitions are not adjusted for yearly changes in GCFI due to inflation. It is acknowledged that not adjusting the thresholds over time may result in a small number of farms moving between categories due to changes in inflation rather than due to any change in the actual production level (Hoppe and McDonald, 2013). Small farms earning near the $350,000 GCFI threshold within the early years of our sample time period are the most likely to move to the commercial farm category given inflation over time. The impacts of this is an area deserving of future study.  Table 3 lists the percentage of farms within each typology by number and value of production. The majority of US farms are small farms. In 2010, 87.1% of all US farms were small family farms, while only 12.1% were classified as large commercial farms. Over the past two decades the number of resident farms in the U.S. has increased, while the number of intermediate farms has declined. There are many reasons for this change. The increase in the number of retirement resident farms can be associated with an overall increase in the median U.S. farm operator age. Hoppe and MacDonald (2013) link this increase in the median farm operator age with improved health care and advances in farm equipment. Technology changes have also facilitated part-time farming, allowing more acres to be operated in less time and leaving more time for off-time employment (MacDonald et al., 2014). Additional reasons for the expansion in the number of residential farms may include the desire to combine a rural lifestyle with some level of crop or livestock production (MacDonald et al., 2014) and increasing off-farm employment opportunities in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Farms within Typologies over Time", "text": "The majority of US farm production is produced by large commercial farms. In 2010, large family farms produced 83.9% of all US agricultural value of production. Over the last two decades, a larger share of US production has moved to larger farms (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013). This is due to both increases in the total number of and average size of commercial farms. Increases in the average size of commercial farms has been driven by producers taking advantage of economies of scale in the production of specific agricultural commodities (MacDonald and McBride, 2009;MacDonald and Newton, 2014) as well as advances in technology and capital inputs, allowing a single operator to farm more land in less time (MacDonald et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Farms within Typologies by Production Type", "text": "Small farms dominate production within a few specific commodities. While only comprising 26% of the value of production in 2011, they comprised 56.4% of poultry value of production, 51.1% of hay value of production, and 47.7% of other livestock value of production, including horse, sheep and goats. They are 32% of beef calf farms and a significant presence within the category of other field crops 5 (Hoppe, 2014). Within commodities dominated by large farms, such as cash grains and dairy production, small farms have been able to find niches in high value production segments requiring relatively low capital investment and lower labor inputs. This includes local food hubs and farmers markets, the production of artisian cheese and other dairy products, and the breeding of high value calves (Vogel and Low, 2015;MacDonald and Newton, 2015). In contrast, cash grain, dairy and hog farms are dominated by larger commercial farms, where larger capital costs and initial investment levels create barriers to entry. Large farms, while comprising 60% of US farm production make up 60% of cash grain, 66% of hog, 76% of high-value crop, 70% of dairy, and 82% of cotton value of production (Hoppe, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Farms within Typologies by Region", "text": "The above differences in farm size by commodity specialization are related to differences in the distribution of farm typologies across US regions. Figure 1 provides a map of the ERS Production Regions and Table 4 provides the average number of farms by farm typology type within each Production Region over the 1996-2013 time period.  Resident farms form a larger share of farms in the East Coast and interior Southeast regions. Intermediate farms form a large share of farms in the interior sections of the US. The largest share of commercial farms is located in the Northern Plains, the Heartland, and Western and Southern Seaboard regions, corresponding to areas of cattle, cash grain, fruit, nut and vegetable production."}, {"section_title": "Investment", "text": "In the next section I provide details on my measurement of investment as well as a summary of the different investment patterns by farm typology."}, {"section_title": "Defining Investment", "text": "Farm Capital Investment in this study is the sum of expenditures by a farm in a given calendar year on buildings, structures, improvements, office equipment placed on a depreciation schedule, vehicles, tractors, farm machinery, and farm equipment less the costs of trade-ins, rebates and discounts. If applicable, these were adjusted for their portion of use in the farm business over the course of that survey year. Improvement include improvements to structures as well as to land. The expenditures on buildings and land improvements include those paid by operators as well as by landlords and contractors."}, {"section_title": "Treatment of Farmland", "text": "Farmland investment is not included in the measure of farm capital investment. Data on farmland purchases within ARMS is only available 2004 onward. Very few producers in the ARMS survey made an investment in farmland in a given survey year compared to investments in other capital items. Table 5 gives the average percent of farms within the ARMS survey between 1996-2013 making expenditures on different types of capital items. Farmland investment data is only available in ARMS starting in 2004. As a result, farmland investment is the average of observations using survey years 2004-2013. Only 1% and 2% of resident farms and 6% of commercial farms made a farmland purchase in a given year. This is in contrast to 32% of resident farms, 40% of intermediate farms and 66% of commercial farms making a purchase in machinery and equipment, and 23% of resident farms, 25% of intermediate farms, and 39% of commercial farms investing in buildings, structures or improvements. Another reason why farmland is excluded from investment is that the decision to invest in farmland is different from that of capital, machinery, equipment and livestock. There are different economic and tax depreciation characteristics and motivations for purchasing farmland compared to machinery and equipment. Farmland is subject to potential capital gains taxes at the time of sale. Capital gains seldom apply to machinery or equipment sales. These are explained further in section 6.10."}, {"section_title": "Treatment of Breeding Livestock", "text": "Investment does not include investment in breeding livestock unless specifically stated and only in that instance for farms specializing in livestock production.

These studies employed aggregate economy wide data time series datasets and the neoclassical approach proposed by Jorgenson (1963), where farm machinery demand is solved by optimizing a production or cost function. Most of these early studies assume perfect capital markets (Fuzzari et al., 1988). Under this scenario, real firm decisions are independent of financial factors. All farms have equal access to capital and are able to purchase the optimal level of farm machinery to maximize profits so that external funds are a perfect substitute for internal capital (Fuzzari et al., 1988). This assumption was first relaxed by Hubbard and Kashyap (1990) using Euler equations on aggregate US farm investment data from 1914-1987 to model the impact of changes in cash flows on farm capital investment. Further extensions to this model have been employed in subsequent panel data studies and are covered below."}, {"section_title": "Early Literature and Changes in Tax Policy", "text": "In particular, one early addition to the literature and relevant to my study was incorporating the impact of taxes. These examined the impact of taxes and the difference in predicted vs. actual investment and capital stocks via the change in the implicit price, or user cost of capital caused by a change in either tax rates or depreciation tax policy, as outlined by Hall and Jorgenson (1967) for non-agricultural capital. This wave of literature was prompted by significant changes in the tax code in the 1980's under the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA). Examples include Halvoresen (1991), Hanson and Bertelsen (1987), LeBlanc and Hrubovcak (1986), LeBlank et al (1992). Overall they find that changes in the tax code have significant impacts on the level of implicit prices and capital stocks and the level and timing of investment, though the impact varies by farm size, production type and asset type (Hansen and Bertelsen, 1987), the level of asset fixity assumed (Halverson, 1991), and if one allows for time varying coefficients or not (Conway et al., 1987). In contrast to the econometric methods used in the prior studies, Smith (1990) and Mauer and Ott (1995), examined the impact of investment tax credits, depreciation rates, and marginal tax rates on investment timing for agricultural and non-agricultural machinery using asset replacement models and numerical analysis.

Taking advantage of these datasets, further capital investment studies have addressed the impacts of cash flows (Jensen et al., 1993) and farm credit constraints (Ariyaratne and Featherstone, 2009;Barry et al., 2000;Bierlen and Featherstone, 1998;H\u00fcttel et al., 2010;;Serra, 2003), tax policy (Gustafon et al. 1988;Hadrich, 2013;Venzetti and Quiggin, 1985), and adjustment costs (Micheels et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Cash Flow", "text": "Drawing on the work of, Hubbard and Kashyap (1990), whom estimated statistically significant relationships between cash flow and U.S, farm investment using aggregate data over the period of 1910of -1978of , Jensen et al.

When profits are low than the cost of internal funds are expensive/probative and investment goes down. A common exercise has been to compare the behavior of credit constrained farms with farms judged a prior to be non-credit constrained. Extensions for this model include controlling for the impact of outliers (Hart and Lence, 2004), differences in credit constraints across countries (Benjamin and Phimister, 2002;H\u00fcttel et al., 2010), and risk (Bokusheva et al., 2007;Sckokai and Moro, 2006) "}, {"section_title": "Adjustment Costs and Real Options", "text": "Credit constraints are one reason for lags in adjustment in investment (Berlien and Fetherstone, 1998;Hubbard and Kashyap, 1992;Jensen et al., 1993).

They utilize a tobin q model, where the fundamental return to investment is estimated and distinguished from cash flows available to the firm.

First, this study examines how the factors driving farm investment differ across farm typologies, accounting for both differences in gross cash farm income levels and primary operator occupation type. None of the prior studies has examined how differences in the primary occupation of the farm operator could influences differences in farm investment. I believe that occupation type has an impact on investment, and that by distinguishing farms earning smaller farm incomes by occupation type, I can obtain more accurate estimates of investment. Utilizing the ARMS data to study farm capital investment is another unique aspect of my research. The ARMS is currently used to develop congress mandated: estimates of commodity costs and returns for specific commodities, estimates of net farm income for commercial producers across specific farm types, an index of prices paid by farmers, and a report on demographic and structural information and trends for family farms (Kuethe and Morehart, 2012). While the ARMS has been utilized by researchers to study a variety of issues, including but not limited to technology adoption, structural change in agriculture, the economic health of and trends within the farming sector, and to comparisons of farm household and non-farm households across different measurements (Kuethe and Morehart, 2012), it has not been utilized to study farm capital investment, with the exception Stutzman and Williamson (to be published). The majority of the farm capital investment literature utilizes either aggregate time series data or state/region wide farm panel datasets. Compared to the ARMS, these state/region wide farm panel datasets, have fewer observations, cover a limited geographic region, and/or provide less detailed farm business and household financial data. The ARMS is the only annual national survey of US farms to provide detailed information regarding farm level production practices, financial performance and household information (Kuethe and Morehart, 2012;National Research Council, 2008). It provides information on a wide range of the business and farms making up the farming sector, included many small part-time and limited resource operations as well as large farms with sales in the millions (Kuethe and Morehart, 2012). By utilizing the ARMS I am able to provide a unique and necessary picture of the farm capital investment behavior of farms across the whole U.S. as well as distinguish between differences among farms according to key production, financial, and farm household characteristics."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4: THEORETICAL INVESTMENT MODEL", "text": "In this section, I derive a theoretical model from a dynamic optimization problem solved for the optimal long run level of capital stock, explain my choice of variables included in the model and specify the reduced form model that I will estimate."}, {"section_title": "Deriving the Flexible Accelerator Model", "text": "A model of investment based upon the flexible accelerator theory can be derived by solving a profit maximization problem. Under the profit maximization problem, a firm makes an investment in machinery to maximize the net present value of expected cash flows from the investment. Using a dynamic model, this can be written as: where (V0) is the net present value of cash flows over the life of the investment, based on Rt, the returns from investment in year t, the discount rate r, and the life of the asset L. Rt is the difference between a long-run unit-output profit maximization function, Gt (Wt,Xt,Kt) and a short run-capital cost adjustment function, C(dK/dt). Both the profit maximization function and the capital cost adjustment function are normalized by output price, Pt. Profits are a function of the chosen level of a quasi-fixed level of capital stock (Kt), other variable inputs, Xt, and variable input prices, Wt. This is reduced by the costs involved in adjusting the level of capital stock. This is represented by the cost adjustment function, C(dK/dt), which states that the cost of adjusting to a new level of capital is a function of the change in capital between time periods, dK/dt. This assumes that the marginal cost of existing capital stock is constant between time periods and changes in the marginal cost of capital occur only when the capital stock level is altered. Reasons for changing marginal costs include financing concerns, additional training, or equipment downtime. An equation of motion, dK/dt, links capital stock levels between periods. The equation of motion states that the change in capital between periods is equal to gross investment, It, less economic depreciation of capital stock, \u22121 . I assume that economic depreciation is equal to a fixed portion, , of the previous period's capital stock, Kt-1. In each period, the firm chooses the capital stock, Kt and other inputs, Xt, given the equation of motion governing the change in capital over time, , to maximize the net return to investment 0 . Assumptions include myopic or stationary real input and output price levels, other variable inputs are completely flexible, and firms are price takers in the input and output markets. LeBlanc et al., (1992) outline how by choosing a profit and cost function and solving the Hamiltonian one obtains a numerical solution for the short-run demand for capital, Kt. This is equivalent to the approximate solution to the demand for K*, which is the steady state or long-run profit maximizing demand for capital. K* is the optimal capital level or the capital level the firm would choose given no barriers, time lags, financing constraints, or other delays in adjusting the capital stock given changes in economic conditions or other factors affecting the demand for capital. The long-run solution to K* using dynamic programing obtained by LeBlanc et al. (1992) and Weersink and Tauer (1989) is equivalent to the long-run demand for capital as expressed by accelerator theory. From this the demand for gross investment is derived. This is referred to as the flexible accelerator theory of investment. Gross investment becomes the change in the capital stock between periods. This can be expressed in discrete time as: where Ii,t is gross investment, NIi,t is net investment, and is the rate of economic depreciation. Gross Investment (Ii,t) is proportional to the difference between desired capital, , * , less capital stock levels in the prior period, , \u22121 , times an adjustment factor, alpha. Net Investment (NIi,t) is equivalent to gross investment less the portion of the previous capital stock that needs to be replaced due to wear or tear ( , \u22121 ). Adjustment is instantaneous under neoclassical theory. Changes in factors affecting the long run level of capital, K*, are fully manifest in a change in investment in the given period. This is equivalent to stating that the value of alpha equals one. If alpha does not equal 1, than within a given time period the capital stock does not fully adjust to the long-run level. Full capital adjustment instead takes multiple time periods. This means that changes in previous economic conditions have impacts on investment beyond the current period. Following in the footsteps of Jensen et al., (1993) and others I start directly from the flexible accelerator theory and obtain a reduced form model for capital investment. Economic theory and previous literature provides a basis on the choice of variables to proxy * , and adjustment costs. Different methods for modeling the adjustment factor and desired farm machinery stock have been suggested by Conway et al (1987), Girao et al. (1974), Jorgenson and Seibert (1968), Trevena and Keller (1974), and Weersink and Tauer (1989). Treveno and Keller (1974) compared the results from solving the dynamic optimization problem with estimating the reduced form flexible accelerator model and found that they performed similarly. Using a reduced form accelerator, one does not have to specify a specific functional form for profits or costs. Additionally, utilizing this model allows the incorporation of factors affecting investment beyond the prices and quantities of outputs and inputs and including lagged independent variables to represent linkages between internal funds and investment levels over multiple periods."}, {"section_title": "Representing Changes in the Optimal Level of Capital Stock", "text": "Economic factors driving changes in the optimal level of capital stock included in the model are outlined below.

This follows from the accelerator theory of investment. Under this theory, increases in the demand for output lead to increases in output prices. Producers respond to higher output prices by increasing production and output levels."}, {"section_title": "Net Cash Farm Income (NCFI)", "text": "Under the profit theory of investment, the optimal level of capital stock is influenced by the returns earned from investment. This follows from the initial profit maximizing equation above. Firms choose a level of capital to maximize the returns from investment, or the income earned per unit capital stock. A change in output prices and/or input prices leads to direct changes in the quantities produced and/or shifts among either outputs and/or inputs to maximize expected returns to investment. Greater potential returns to investment are expected to increase firm investment level. I measure the returns to investment as net cash farm income per unit capital stock. Net cash farm income is gross cash farm income less operating expenses. Gross Cash farm income includes revenues from the sale of farm productions, inventory adjustments, government payments, custom work income, incomes from land rented to others, incomes from livestock or crops removed under production contracts, and payments from royalties and leases for energy production. Expenses include labor, land rental, hire custom work expenses, capital equipment leasing fees, and others. This measurement does not include non-cash labor expenses, depreciation expenses, or the returns to operator's time and management. The expense items included to calculate net cash farm income, such as labor, land rental, hire custom work expenses, and capital equipment leasing fees, are highly correlated with investment. Unfortunately, within the ARMS dataset, these items are also strongly correlated with each other and with net cash farm income levels, leading to multicollinearity and other estimation problems. Utilizing a single measure of net cash farm income to capture the impacts of these different cost items minimizes the number of additional variables in the regression model and multicollinearity issues. Unfortunately, it limits my ability to discern the individual impact of each item separately."}, {"section_title": "Depreciation Expenses (DEP) and Marginal Tax Rates (MTR)", "text": "According to Jorgenson's neoclassical theory of investment, changes in the user cost of capital impact the level of capital demanded by the firm. The user cost of capital is determined by equating the marginal value product of capital with its user cost. The marginal value product of capital is the extra revenue earned by a unit of capital while the user cost is a function of the asset's purchase price adjusted for interest expenses and the tax benefits of owning capital. These tax benefits include depreciation tax deductions and reductions in total farm household tax levels. An increase in allowable depreciation expenses and a larger farm marginal tax rate will decrease the after-tax cost of capital. This makes capital relatively less expensive and should lead to increases in investment. In theory, the user cost of capital should reflect the individual cost of each specific unit of capital. Different individual purchase prices, interest rates, and depreciation rates will result in very different implicit prices for different capital units and resulting impacts on investment. Unfortunately, the ARMS survey does not consistently collect data on the number and specific type of capital unit per farm across survey years. The survey does not ask producers to provide information on prices of individual capital items nor their use within different farm enterprise production activities. As a result, it is not possible to link revenues, output prices, interest payments, nor depreciation deductions with individual physical units of capital. As a result, I capture the impact of taxes on farm investment by utilizing the farm's total annual tax depreciation expense and marginal tax rate. Interest expenses are accounted for in the measurement of net cash farm income."}, {"section_title": "Farm Size (Acres)", "text": "The annual capital replacement level is directly related to the number of acres operated. Larger farms will require greater investment levels to maintain existing capital stocks. An increase in the number of operated acres should lead to an increase in investment in the current period as well as in future periods. The degree of which capital needs change as farm acreage increases will differ across farms depending on commodity type, regional geography, and returns to scale.

Adding additional crops to the farm's crop mix is expected to increase capital investment. The degree to which gains to or disadvantages to scope are present will influence how much additional investment is needed. If specialization in fewer crops results in more efficient use of current machinery, then investment per unit of output will decrease as specialization increases. If instead diversification allows the farm to reduce total capital required per acre, for example by reducing machinery downtime and taking advantage of different crop planting and harvest schedules, then diversification will result in reduced investment per acre."}, {"section_title": "Technological Change", "text": "Over time, changes in technology alter the profit maximizing level and type of capital. The impact of technological change on annual investment is proxied by dummy year variables. The use of individual year variables allows the impacts of technological change to vary differently depending on the year. In addition, these dummy variables capture other unobserved year specific impacts. Using a linear time trend assumes a constant marginal impact of technological change on investment over the given sample period. Considering diversity of commodities produced and geographic regions within the ARMS data, as well as changes in US farming over the 18-year sample period, assuming non-constant technological change is the most logical choice. In practicality, a linear time trend is often insignificant while individual time dummy variables are statistically significant and different across years."}, {"section_title": "Representing Changes in the Adjustment Rate", "text": "Under the theory of perfect capital markets, firm financing is irrelevant in the investment decision. If markets are not perfect than the level of internal funds becomes an important factor determining farm investment levels. This is due to either constraints in the amount of funds firms can borrow or increasing costs as a function of firm borrowing levels. If imperfect capital markets are assumed, farm investment may increase or decrease depending on changes in internal measures of cash flows. Previous studies have found internal cash flow variables have a significant impact on farm investment levels (Ariyarante and Bierlen and Featherstone, 1998;Hadrich, et al., 2013;Jensen et al.;1993;and Weersink and Tauer, 1989).

Following the example of Ariyaratne and Featherstone (2009) and Barry et al. (2000) relevant variables, which included investment, net cash farm income, depreciation expenses, acres and working capital, were normalized by the level of farm capital, , . This reduces the level of heteroscedasticity that would be otherwise caused by differences in revenue and expense levels between farms related to differences in farm sales. The interpretation of these variables alters slightly due to this normalization. Investment is no longer the dollars invested per year but instead the rate of replacement of the gross capital stock, income is income earned per unit of capital, depreciation expenses is the average depreciation taken on a unit of capital that year, working capital is the level of working capital per unit capital stock, and acres is no longer total farm acres but the average acres operated per unit capital. This model is estimated using pseudo panels constructed from the ARMS survey data. In the next section I provide background on pseudo panel theory, construction, and estimation methodology. CHAPTER 5: PSEUDO PANELS AND DATA SOURCES In this section I provide a description of pseudo panels, the literature supporting their usage, my methodology for constructing pseudo panels from the ARMS data and compare the resulting pseudo panel measurements with the survey data."}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Construction", "text": "The cross sectional nature of ARMS provides information only on the decision of a single producer to make a capital purchase in a given year. There is no way of knowing from the data if the same producer made an investment last year or will make an investment next year. This prevents the linkage of investment behavior over multiple time periods. In addition, there is no way to connect changes in the levels of the model variables in prior periods with investment choices today. Believing that I will attain more accurate estimates by examining the investment behavior of similar farm types over multiple time periods rather than individual farms at a single point in time, I construct a synthetic panel using the ARMS data. My methodology is based upon established theory developed for construction and estimation using synthetic panels constructed from survey data. These panels are often referred to as pseudo panels. Deaton (1985) introduced pseudo panels as a means to construct panel datasets from balanced or unbalanced survey datasets. He outlines the conditions for which one can utilize pseudo panels to consistently estimate population effects. These conditions were further tested and expanded upon in by Verbeek and Nijman (1993), Moffitt (1993), Vera (2005), andMcKenzie (2004). Utilizing these findings, authors have explored economic relationships using pseudo panels constructed from large surveys such as the US Census (Russell and Fraas, 2005). Previous studies have constructed pseudo panels using ARMS data. For example , Blank et al. (2004) constructed pseudo panels to examine differences over time in risk attitudes for corn and soybean producers using ARMS data from 1996-2001. O'Donoghue and Whitaker (2010) examined farm payments and acreage planting decisions using pseudo panels constructed from ARMS data for survey years 2000-2001 and 2003-2004. To look at the impact of production contracts on productivity, efficiency and scale economies Morrison-Paul et al. 2004formed pseudo panels using 1991-2002 ARMS survey data. Finally, to determine if marginal rates of consumption differ by type of government payment, Whitaker (2009) formed pseudo panels using ARMS observations from survey years 1998-2004. ARMS data has many advantages over other farm management panel data sets. The ARMS dataset is geographically more representative of the U.S. farm population, covers a greater number of farms, and is more detailed than most existing farm panel data sets available. By constructing pseudo panels from cross sectional data much of the attrition bias found in panel datasets is eliminated. Using ARMS data to study farm behavior overtime would allow us insights into many questions concerning the impacts of different policies. Unfortunately, currently many important policies are not studied using ARMS data due to the inability to track farms over time (Featherstone et al., 2012). The results of my work into pseudo panel data can assist others in utilizing ARMS data to estimate dynamic panel models of farm behavior."}, {"section_title": "Construction of Pseudo Panel Dataset 1", "text": "Creating pseudo panels involves grouping farms with similar characteristics into groups, referred to as cohorts. The mean values of observations are calculated within each cohort and for each year. Estimation is performed on these mean values. An important decision when forming pseudo panels is the categories to use to split individual farms into groups. There are two main considerations. The first is forming time invariant groupings. This requires that the probability of the same farm being placed in a given cohort is independent of the survey year. The second is making sure that the groupings are heterogeneous enough to determine different impacts from changes in the dependent variables while making sure that they still reflect the true population means. I choose categories to maximize the heterogeneity between cohort observations and maximize the homogeneity of observations between farms in the same cohort (Whitaker, 2009). I group farms according to commodity type, geographic region, and typology. These categories are summarized in Table 7 and described in more detail below. Previous studies using ARMS data have used similar categories such as: geographic region (Blank et al., 2004;Morrison-Paul et al., 2004;O'Donoghue and Whitaker, 2010), revenue or sales levels (Blank et al., 2004;Morrison-Paul et al.,2004;Whitaker, 2009), and production specialty (O'Donoghue and Whitaker, 2010;Morrison-Paul et al., 2004). These categories are similar to the ARMS stratified sampling divisions of state, farm type and farm size. Using categories that take into account the ARMS sampling design should provide more accurate cohort estimates. In addition, farm investment and other variables such as revenues, expenses, asset and debts differ according to region, commodity type, and typology. By taking cohort means within these categories the cohort means will reflect important distinctions within the sample data. The next consideration is how many categories to utilize. In compiling the data, ERS researchers split farms into 19 commodity groups depending on the share of farm revenue earned by commodity. Farms are then grouped into smaller commodity categories by combining similar commodity groups. When choosing the number of commodity types there is  Figure 6. I am fairly confident that these categories are relatively time invariant. It is unlikely that more than a few farms will move geographically between regions over the sample period. On the other hand, the regions are different enough to capture significant regional variations between farms. Finally, I use three typology categories to reflect differences in farms according to farm size. Using economic size categories to take advantage of the stratified ARMS sampling was suggested by Featherstone et al. (2012). Blank et al. (2004) and Morrison-Paul et al. (2004) constructed cohorts using farm typologies. Technically, this category is not completely time invariant. While there may be some switching between the resident and intermediate categories as farmers retire and either leave or enter farming full time, the greater concern may be farms moving between the commercial category and either resident or intermediate categories based on annual fluctuations in farm income. Fluctuations in farm income will be due to fluctuations in both aggregate level agricultural price cycles and farm level yields. This will most likely be an issue for larger intermediate or resident farms and smaller commercial farms. The alternative, not splitting farms into categories based upon typologies, would result in cohort means being averages of farms within these different categories. This is problematic. Average values within these categories are very different. Taking means across these categories creates cohort means not reflective of the true underlying sample values. To account for the potential of farms moving between cohorts due to using farm typologies, the estimates obtained using this cohort formation will be compared with cohort formations that do not split farms based upon farm income levels. This is explained in more detail later. The final decision is to employ the ARMS weights or not when forming cohort means. Whitaker (2009) and Blank et al. (2004) also employed ARMS expansion weights within their analysis. Other studies choose not to apply the weights. This reflects the overall mixed opinion in the literature regarding using survey weights when constructing subsamples from stratified larger samples. If the cohort formation process is reflective of the stratum category division, using the weights should provide better estimates of the means within cohorts. This is particularly important as ARMS does not sample the same farms or even the same composition of farms each year. They rely on the sample weights to make sure that all farm types are accurately accounted for. Using the sample weights ensures that farm estimates in each year are more likely to represent the true population mean values in a given year. Using sample weights also alleviates the problem of heterogeneity within cohort means due to unequal sample sizes across survey years. On the other hand, if only the behavior of the sample is of interest the weights may distort the estimates (Dubman, 2000). A benefit of stratification is to reduce the variance of estimates. Categorizations not correlated with strata categories may not reflect the benefits of stratification (Dubman, 2000). After considering the tradeoffs, I decide to apply the ARMS weights. My decision is further supported by the resulting sample estimates. Within the different typology categories, the cohort sample means are similar to the weighted sample means and reflect important differences between resident, intermediate and commercial farms. Similarly to using the weights when calculating mean and standard error estimates for survey mean values, employing the weights when taking the cohort means results in lower overall mean and standard error estimates. I take the weighted mean of the relevant variables across farms within the same region, production type, and typology category. This creates an unbalanced panel dataset of 2,341 total cohort observations. Within each region, production type and farm typology over time and within time between cohorts the number of observations used to construct the cohort means vary, as seen in Table 8-Table 10.  annual output prices for a set of 18 different commodity and livestock categories. These categories correspond to a set of 18 commodity types into which farms in the ARMS are divided. The division is based upon revenue levels. If farms receive more than 50% of their yearly sales from commodity(s) within a given category they are classified as under that category. The \"other crop\" or \"other livestock\" category is used for farms for which less and 50% of revenues fall under one of the specific crop or livestock categories. Within each year for each cohort, the index price for each commodity category was multiplied by the portion of sales within that category. A list of the commodity types and price data used is provided below in Table 11.  Includes sheep, goats, goat products, equine, and aquaculture 1 An average price per year was created by multiplying the wholesale price times the portion of sales from each of the following crops: Carnations (cents/stem), Chrysanthemums ($/bunch), lilies (cents/stem), orchids (cents/bloom), roses (cents/stem), geranium flats ($/flat), inpatients ($/flat), pansy/viola flats ($/flat). Interest rates (IR i,t ) are the fourth quarter loan rates for farm machinery loans per each of the 10 USDA Production Regions. These were obtained from the Board of Governors Federal Reserve System Agricultural Finance Databook. ARMS data on farm income, off-farm income, and IRS federal tax rates and exemption limits obtained from IRS publications were used to construct a farm household federal marginal tax rate (MTR i,t ). Beginning with farm income, I adjust for social security and Medicare taxes on self-employment and social security income, and subtract from total household income estimated deductions for social security payments, domestic production activities credits, health insurance premiums, and other deductions. From this we subtract the larger of the standardized or itemized tax deduction that year to arrive at an estimated farm household federal taxable income. Based upon married or single status, number of dependents, and federal taxable income levels, the federal marginal tax rate of each farm is determined."}, {"section_title": "Summary Statistics for Pseudo Panel Dataset", "text": "In this section I examine the summary statistics for the constructed model variables in the pseudo panel dataset.

This is followed by a discussion of the overall summary statistics and differences between farm typologies and production types.   For the sample as a whole, on average, each dollar of capital generated $0.155 of net cash farm income. The range is between -$2.40 to $4.20 in income generated per each unit of capital stock. While most farms earn a modest return on capital, there are some farms that earn extremely low or high returns on capital. Some portion of this is explained by farms which earn very large positive or negative incomes. The rest is due to farms which own very small levels of capital stock and either employ other inputs, are involved in labor intensive activities, or rent these items or services. This low level of capital stock in relationship to net cash farm income results in extreme negative or positive estimates for return on assets. On average, commercial farms are highly profitable with FNV farms earning the largest return on assets and grain farms earning the lowest return on assets. The average return on assets was 0.39 for commercial grain farms, 0.58 for FNV farms and 0.27 for livestock farms. In contrast, the average return on assets was -0.001 for resident FNV farms and -0.004 for resident livestock farms. These negative estimates are due to average negative net cash farm incomes. It is not uncommon within the ARMS survey data for a large portion of farms to not earn enough from the sale of farm commodities and receipts to cover expenses (Hoppe, 2015). The share of such farms is higher among farms with retired operators, operators having primary occupations other than farming or having annual GCFI less than $100,000. These farms often rely on offfarm income for livelihood and to cover expenses and make investment (Hoppe, 2015). The average tax depreciation expense as a percent of capital assets is larger for commercial farms compared to resident and intermediate farms. Resident farms had smaller rates of tax depreciation per unit capital assets than intermediate farms. There is a wide degree of variation among these estimates between farms and over the survey period. While the average estimates within typologies are similar to each other and the sample mean of 0.054, the range of the estimates are between 0.00 to 1.24. Part of this variation may be due to differences in annual allowable depreciation tax levels as well as producers adjusting depreciation tax expenses in a given year depending on the level of total farm income to minimize total tax expenditures. Most farm households are in the middle to upper echelon of US income levels (Hoppe, 2014). According to the US Census Bureau, median U.S. household income in 2013 was $52.25 thousand (Noss, 2014 Table 16 lists the level of within, between and overall variation in the pseudo panel variables. To adequately estimate a fixed effects regression, exogenous variables must exhibit cohort specific variation (Koksal and Wolgenant, 2013). This includes variation within cohorts over time and between cohorts in a given time period. A sample variable that fails to adequately reflect the true population level of variance in both of these dimensions will produce biased estimates. One potential issue in using pseudo panels is that forming panels by taking averages over groups of similar farms may result in a reduction in the level of within variation in the panel data compared to the initial sample population within variation. This could result in small and/or statistically insignificant estimates for these variables.  There is an adequate level of variation both within cohorts over time and between cohorts in a given time period. In general, the level of variation within cohorts over time is greater than the level of variation between cohorts over time. This is indicative of the cyclical nature of agriculture resulting in large variation in key variables over time."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Cross Sectional Survey Data with Pseudo Panel", "text": "To make sure that my pseudo panel is reflective of the actual survey data I compare the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the model variables in the survey dataset with those obtained by constructing pseudo panels. As seen in Table 17, the mean values of the variables within each typology for the pseudo panel dataset are almost identical to those of the survey dataset.  The similarity between the means across typologies for the two datasets indicates that the cohort observations are representative of the underlying typology variable values in the original survey dataset. By taking means across similar farms, the variables in the pseudo sample dataset have a lower variance than the original observations in the survey dataset. This is demonstrated in Table 18..   Table 21 provide the minimum and maximum value as well as the range of observations in the survey dataset and in the pseudo panel dataset by farm typology. In general, taking cohort means greatly reduces the range of most of the variable values. This is because by using averages across similar farms many of the extreme values that occur within the original survey dataset are removed. These extreme values come from both extreme values of the observations themselves and by normalizing by farms having either very large or small levels of capital stocks.   Taking the cohort averages has the largest impact on revenue and asset variables such as investment, capital stock, income, depreciation, working capital levels and off-farm income levels. The impact on working capital levels is very staggering, reflecting a large degree of variation between actual working capital levels in the survey population and those across farms by cohort. Unsurprisingly, there is little impact on marginal tax rates, entropy variables, interest rates and price index variables. These variables would tend to have less variation in their absolute level across farms. In addition, the last two are measured using regional vs. farm specific data which already accounts for outliers. The range of acre estimates is reduced by taking farm means, even by taking into account differences in farm sizes. It appears that within farm typologies the acres per unit capital can vary widely."}, {"section_title": "Construction of Alternative Pseudo Panel Datasets", "text": "The above pseudo panel dataset 1 was one of 8 initial pseudo panel datasets constructed.

ARMS divides producers into 48 individual states, 10 farm production regions, 9 ERS farm production regions, or 5 NASS US regions. Farms are classified using 19 commodity types, which can further be aggregated into either 7 or 9 commodity categories. Using these different categories, I explored constructing pseudo panels using the 3 farm typologies as well as 19 commodity types and 10 production regions. I refer to this as panel dataset 2. I use this additional constructed panel to test the robustness of my results obtained using panel dataset 1 to differences in the number of regions and commodity types. Panel dataset 2 provides an unbalanced panel dataset of 6,913 observations total. Unfortunately, the average number of farm observations per cohort mean is only 51 in this dataset. This is below the minimal 100-200 observations for consistent estimators recommended by Verbeek and Ninjam (1992). Other measures of economic size I explored to create alternative pseudo panels included: A) 4 categories created by the interaction of high and low sales values with high and low asset values giving a measure of household economic well-being, B) 4 farm acre size quartiles, C) 4 asset values quartiles, and D) 5 operator age categories. Each of these was interacted with ERS production regions to differentiate between farms by region. The ERS production regions were chosen as they are constructed to reflect both physical location and differences in production type due to physical location of the farm. Unfortunately, any category including a measure of economic size will not be completely time invariant. Categories involving sales values are most likely to create issues with time invariability while categories involving measures such as age in a base year or acres are more likely to be stable over time. For this reason, age has been used in other pseudo panel studies (Russel and Fraas, 2005;Whitaker, 2009). In addition, age has been found to be correlated with investment and is a significant variable explaining investment behavior when the cross sectional survey dataset is used.  where the subscript c indicates that the observation is the cohort mean, Rc,t and Ic,t are cohort dummies for resident and intermediate farms, Tt are individual year dummies, uc represents time invariant differences in investment across cohorts, and ec,t is the idiosyncratic error term for each cohort at time t. Income is square to reflect the changing impact of an extra dollar of income on investment at different income levels. The regression model in (4) can be written as: where Xc,t is a vector of cohort means of the k dependent variables in the model and Bk is a vector of coefficient values for each dependent variable in the model."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Effects", "text": "The pseudo panel regression model developed by Deaton (1985) treated estimated population effects using cohort level observations as measurement error issue. Measurement error arises when constructing cohorts from cross sectional sample data. The cohort sample means can be considered estimates of the true cohort population means. The difference between the true population estimates and the sample cohort means include differences between the population estimates and the population cohort means as well as between the population cohort means and the sample cohort means. Deaton treats the measurement error between the sample and population cohort means as a cohort fixed effect. He shows, using a fixed effect model and the between estimator, that as the number of observations per cohort approaches infinity and the number of cohorts remains fixed, the measurement error disappears and the model collapses to the fixed effects within estimator. The fixed effects estimator assumes that the cohort time invariant differences, uct, are correlated with the values of the independent variables. If this is the case, then estimating the model using OLS will result in biased estimates. Instead, the data must first be transformed to remove these cohort time invariant differences. One method to transform the data is to take the difference between the observation in time t and the average value of the observation separately by cohort for each variable. This results in the following between estimator model: \u0308, \u0308, and \u0308 are the deviation of the cohort observations in time t from their average value over the sample period. The regression above can be estimated using pooled OLS with the standard error corrected for degrees of freedom. If the cohort unobserved effects are correlated with the regressors, the fixed effects estimated coefficients will be unbiased while estimates using the alternative, a random effects model, will be biased. Downsides of using a fixed effects model include the inability to include time invariant dependent variables and the sensitivity of the estimates to the relative level of between and within variation. This model will be less accurate in estimating marginal impacts of changes in variables that exhibit little relative variation within a given cohort over the time period."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Fixed and Random Effects Models", "text": "If the unobserved effects are not correlated with the regressors, then a fixed effects model will be unbiased but not efficient. In that case, a random effects model would be the appropriate model to use, as it would be both unbiased and the most efficient. The random effects model treats the cohort differences as a random error term and incorporates this into the regression composite error term . The random effects model would be: In practice this is estimated using a weighted combination of the within estimator, which is equivalent a pooled OLS estimator, and the between estimator in the fixed effects model. The random effects model is estimated as follows: is a weighted average of the variance of and and referred to as rho.  Hoechle (2007) and Cameron and Trivedi (2010). According to Hoechle (2007), a Wald test of =0 for all k variables in the regression model below is equivalent to performing the Hausman test and allowing for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelated error terms. The regression model is as follows: \u0305 and \u0305 are the cohort mean values over time for the dependent and independent variables, is the cohort fixed effect which has a variance of 2 , and is the idiosyncratic error term which has a variance of 2 . To perform this test I followed the steps outlined in Hoechle (2007). I first ran a random effects regression of my model assuming homoscedastic errors. Then I calculated , \u0305 and \u0305 . I next calculated the difference between the variables and the group means times for the independent and dependent variables separately. These are the terms \u2212 \u0305 and -\u0305 in the above model and represent the random effects. Next I calculate the difference between the variables and the group means by cohort. These represent the fixed effects and are the terms -\u0305 in the above model. The model was then re-estimated including both the fixed effects and random effects terms and clustering the standard errors. An F test was performed to see if it was possible to reject the null hypothesis that =0. This is equivalent to stating that the fixed effects in the model are statistically insignificant from zero. If the null hypothesis that =0 can be rejected, than one can conclude that significant fixed effects are present in the model. Estimating the model using a random effects model will result in biased coefficient values. If I cannot reject the null, than I can use the random effects model concluding that both the random and fixed effects models are both consistent but the random effects model is more efficient. The results of this test for each of the three commodity types are provided in Table   22. "}, {"section_title": "Other Model Forms Explored", "text": "Early on I compared using the fixed effects and random effects models with either 1) OLS model with clustered standard errors, 2) a maximum likelihood random effects model, 3) a feasible generalized least square model for panel data allowing for heteroscedasticity between panels and serial autocorrelation within panels, 4) fixed effects model, and 5) a differenced GMM model. The results were similar across the models, with the main differences being that the magnitude of the coefficients decreased and the coefficients were less likely to be statistically significant using a fixed effects model vs. an OLS model. The maximum likelihood model returned very similar coefficient values as the fixed or random effects models with the main difference being the significance of the coefficients, which were higher under the maximum likelihood model. While this model was promising in that it allows for heteroskedastic and correlated errors, it rests on the assumption that the errors are normally distributed. In graphing my errors, I find that even after normalizing by capital stock levels and taking averages across pseudo panels the errors appear normally distributed except for at the tail ends of the distribution. On the whole I cannot guarantee that I have normally distributed errors. For this reason and given my rejection of the random effects model in general, I do not report the maximum likelihood results. The generalized least squares model also returned similar results in terms of the signs of the coefficients as the fixed effects model and an OLS model with clustered standard errors, though the coefficients were more likely to be significant and the magnitude of the coefficients slightly larger under this model compared to the fixed effects model. The results under this model (which was tested initially before I choose to use interaction terms and allow for different coefficients across farm typologies) returned similar results to those obtained by running a survey reg model in the cross section. Given that I find evidence of fixed effects, the generalized least squares model was rejected in favor of a fixed effects model. I also explored using a first difference model instead of a between estimator to remove the fixed effects. Using a first differenced model, the fixed effects are removed in this case by taking differences between variable values over subsequent periods. This model would be preferred if the fixed effects are related to differences in the levels of variables between subsequent periods vs. the average level of the variables over the sample period. The model assumes that changes in the error terms across time are uncorrelated with the changes in the independent variables. This is a weaker form of erogeneity compared to the between estimator, which assumes that the level of the errors is uncorrelated with the level of the independent variables. This method corrects for potential unit root behavior and rules out spurious regressions. Using a first difference estimator requires that the change in the level of the variables between subsequent time periods exhibits variation, both within and between cohorts, and assumes that changes in the error term between periods are serially uncorrelated. The results obtained using the first difference estimator were similar to the fixed effects model, though the overall coefficient values and significance levels were different. My choice to use the fixed effects model vs. a first difference model was based on the belief that differences in farm investment across time periods, production type, and farm typology are more likely to be related to differences in the average level of model variables vs. to changes in these variables between time periods. The final model I attempted to use was the Arellano-Bond estimator. This is a differenced GMM model for fixed effects equations which include lagged dependent variables. This model is commonly used in the business finance and agricultural economics literature. It addresses the fact that with the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable the between estimator to control for fixed effects is no longer valid. Taking the difference between variable levels and the mean each period leads to correlation between the average value of the error term and the lagged dependent variable. To correct for this, the model uses the difference (as well as levels in the system version of the model) of past lags of independent variables as instrumental variables. I attempted to use this model but found that the resulting signs for my coefficients were largely insignificant and/or did not conform to economic theory. This leads me to conclude that the lagged differences of the independent variables and of lagged investment are poor instruments for changes in the level of the variables in the current periods. Given the poor model results and overall lack of statistical significance for the lagged dependent variable this model is rejected in favor of the fixed effects model where time dummies are used to capture differences in adjustment behavior over time. While I would like to conclude that the insignificance of the lagged dependent variable in my model supports the idea that agricultural investment adjusts relatively quickly over time, given the overall results of this model I cannot reject either of the following two opposite conclusions. The first is that my results are due to the use of pseudo panels. Taking averages over different cohort samples each period may weaken the ability to identify links between current and lagged variables and hence the ability to link farm investment behavior over time. While this does not mean that it is not beneficial to use pseudo panels, it does mean that certain variables, such as changes in incomes, may be easier to link across cohort samples over time compared to lagged values of variable and that identifying adjustment behavior may be more difficult. The second alternative conclusion is that my results are due to the use of initial survey data which does not account for disinvestment. In theory a producer could be a net seller of farm capital in a given period. The survey data only records zero investment or positive investment levels. Creating pseudo panels from such data could further limit the ability to capture error adjustment behavior over time."}, {"section_title": "Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation", "text": "I suspect that heteroscedasticity will be an issue in my model. Heteroscedasticity arises in cross sectional datasets where the scale of the dependent variable and its explanatory power differs across observations (Woodridge, 2005, p.191). A large portion of the heterogeneity within the constructed pseudo panels is due to the nature of the ARMS cross-sectional data. Farm financial measurements differ widely between farms across different size and production type categories. These differences lead to large standard errors and inflate the residual estimates when estimating within the cross-sectional dataset. Creating the pseudo panel data by clustering farms on similar characteristics further magnifies these differences. In addition, equipment, machinery and structures are bought in discrete vs. continuous units. This creates a greater degree of variance between different size investments than otherwise would be seen. Panel datasets may suffer from both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Differences in sample means linked to cohort difference and differences in sample measurement error between different cross sections over time could lead to heteroscedasticity between panel estimates within the same time period or autocorrelation between error terms within cohorts over time. The latter is referred to as group-wise heteroscedasticity. These differences could also lead to contemporaneous serial correlation, which consists of homoscedasticity within certain cohort groupings but heteroscedasticity between these distinct groups of cohorts within a single time period. Forming cohorts in which the number of cross-sectional observations used to construct the cohort mean differs, either between cohorts in the same time period or in same cohort over multiple time periods could introduce heteroscedasticity, even if the initial cross sectional dataset was homoscedastic (Koksal and Wohlgenant, 2011). This is an issue in my pseudo panel dataset. The number of available cross sectional observations within the ARMS dataset varies over time. The portion of farms sampled each year within the categories used to construct pseudo panels, farm production type and region, also varies by year in the ARMS. Within the ARMS survey weights are used to correct for this when compiling population estimates. If heteroscedasticity and/or autocorrelation is present the fixed and random effects coefficient estimates will still be unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, but the standard errors and tests statistics may be biased. Weighting each cohort estimate by the square root of the number of cohort observations is one means in which previous studies have addressed this issue (Koksal and Wolgenant, 2013). Instead, I rely on the ARMS weights when constructing my cohort means and use heteroscedasticity robust estimation methods to solve this issue."}, {"section_title": "Clustering Standard Errors", "text": "To address the heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation present in the standard errors, I choose to cluster the standard errors across cohorts. This corrects for heteroscedasticity between cohort error terms in a given time period and correlation between errors terms within cohorts over time. Clustering standard errors when using ARMS survey data takes advantage of the stratified nature of the survey process as well as reduce the variance of estimates when the clustering categories are representative of the survey design (Weber and Clay, 2013). My clustering categories, commodity type, region, and typology, are representative of the ARMS survey sampling categories of region, farm size and commodity type. The only assumption made when clustering errors is that no contemporaneous serial correlation exists. To address this potential, the model was re-estimated using a technique that takes into account serial correlation. The estimates were unchanged compared to using the fixed effects model and clustering standard errors on cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Checking for Multicollinearity", "text": "When I was initially working with the survey data and choosing the variables to include in my model I carefully checked for multicollinearity by first comparing the correlation coefficient matrixes and testing for the presence of multicollinearity using the STATA VIF 13 command after running the regressions. These results informed my choice of model variables. These tests also led to the exclusion of certain expense category variables that while highly correlated to investment were also highly correlated with farm revenues/income measurements. Table 23 23 provides the correlation coefficients between revenues and expenditures on different items with both investment, measured as the total level of investment as well as the rate of investment for the survey data in columns 1 and 2 and for the pseudo panel dataset in columns 4 and 5. This is contrasted with the correlation coefficients between revenues and these same expense categories for the survey data in column 3 and the pseudo panel dataset in column 6. This points out that while certain key expense categories are correlated with investment they are also, or to a greater degree, correlated with farm sales/income levels.

These "}, {"section_title": "Specifying Three Hypothesis", "text": "I use the above model to test three main hypotheses regarding differences in the rate of farm capital investment between typologies given equivalent changes in key model variables. The hypotheses are: 1) commercial farm investment rates will increase to a greater degree given increases in output prices and the returns to investment, 2) resident farms increase investment rates more given favorable changes in tax policy variables, and 3) intermediate farm investment rates increase to a greater degree given decreases in the level of credit and financial constraints. These hypotheses are related to previous literature findings that farm size investment differs by farm size measurement (Ariayante and Barry et. al., 2000;Bierlen and Featherstone, 1998) where farm size could be defined by sales value, income level, number of acres, or livestock units. In particular, hypothesis two tests the common literature finding that small farms are more responsive to changes in cash flow measurements (Ariayante and Barry et. al., 2000;Bierlen and Featherstone, 1998), hypothesis one the assertion that farms with higher off-farm incomes will be more responsive to changes in tax policy (Durst, 2009;Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013), and hypothesis one that larger farms are more responsive to changes in sales levels. By using the farm typologies, I link differences in farm occupation type with differences in off-farm income levels. This allows the difference in primary occupation, rather than just differences in off-farm income levels, to explain differences in investment rates given differences in farm typologies. Finally, all three hypotheses allow me to either reject or verify the statistical significance of key differences I see within farm typologies regarding the impacts of different variables on farm capital investment."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 1", "text": "Hypothesis one flows from hypothesis two and three as well as the nature of commercial farming. Commercial farms generally highly profitable (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013), operate on a large scale, and may face tight profit margins. They generally have positive return on asset and operating profit margins, compared to small farms where the median farm operating profit and rate of return on asset is negative and fall within the critical zone (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013). Part of this may be explained by the fact that for many resident farms, the profitability of the farm may be secondary to other reasons to farm such as lifestyle choices (MacDonald et al., 2014). These resident farms rely on outside farm income to supplement farm income and invest (MacDonald et al., 2014). For other small farms, credit and financial constraints may be a greater issue. Compared to these farms, commercial farms will have a greater ability to take advantage of positive investment opportunities and expand production given increases in output prices or the returns to investment. Additionally, the measure of the returns to investment utilizes net cash farm income, which includes government payment and other income from farming activities. Moderate, mid-sized and large-scale family farms are more likely to receive government payments than smaller farms (Hoppe, 2014). The overall level of NCFI earned by commercial farms is, on average, significantly larger for commercial farms compared to intermediate farms.

Increases in tax depreciation expenses taken, either due to an increase in the allowable tax depreciation rate or an increase in total investment expenditures that period, decreases total farm income and as a result total household income levels. The benefit from such a deduction should be greater for farms earning higher off-farm incomes. An increase in the marginal tax rate should also provide a greater incentive for farms with higher off-farm incomes to invest in farm capital and thus decrease total household income levels.

On average, a one percent increase in output prices leads to a $150 increase in investment for commercial grain farms and a $108 increase for resident grain farms. My results for grain farms are similar to Serra et al. (2009). They also estimate that an increase in the value of an index of agricultural output prices results in a positive and statistically significant increase in farm capital investment using data from the Kansas Farm Management Association database over the period of 1997-2001. Unlike Serra et al. (2009 the coefficients are not statistically significant for livestock farms. One reason why I obtain insignificant coefficients for livestock farms and on commercial FNV farms may be the greater level of heterogeneity within the FNV and livestock farms in my sample compared to that of Serra et al. Serra et al., used  to be a wide variety in the type of FNV crops and livestock products produced across the U.S., leading to a greater variation in average farm investment responses given changes in output prices. The wide range of responses across farms given changes in output prices is illustrated when one examines the large confidence intervals obtained for the FNV and livestock output price partial investment elasticities. In contrast, within grain farms the confidence intervals on output price partial investment elasticities are smaller. One could draw the conclusion that within the ARMS sample there is a greater level of homogeneity in across grain farms in response to changes in output prices compared to that found across different FNV and livestock production types. This results in a greater ease in quantifying the impacts for changes in output prices across grain farms compared to FNV and livestock farms. I can accept hypothesis one for commercial grain farms. Investment rates for commercial grain farms respond to a greater degree given a change in output prices compared to commercial and resident grain farms. This is indicated by the negative and statistically given the negative estimated interaction terms and lower partial investment elasticity estimates for resident and intermediate livestock farms compared to commercial livestock farms. Unfortunately, due to lack of statistical significance, I must reject hypothesis one for commercial livestock farms. I reject hypothesis one with regards to output prices for FNV farms. There is a statistically significant and positive coefficient on the interaction term for resident FNV farms, indicating that the rate of investment increases more given an increase in output prices for resident FNV farms compared to commercial FNV farms. The large resident FNV farm output price partial investment elasticity estimate indicates that resident FNV farms are extremely responsive the changes in output prices. On average, a one-percent increase in output prices  1973-1988, Ariyarante and Featherstone (2009 using the same dataset over the period of 1998-2007 for the rate of investment in farm machinery and equipment, and Barry et al. (2000) for investment in land and non-land assets using the Illinois Farm Management Association database for years 1987-1994. Similar to these studies, my estimated coefficients are statistically significant and positive for commercial grain and FNV farms. On average a 1% increase in the returns to investment income results in a $158 increase in commercial grain farm investment and a $216 increase in commercial FNV investment. Looking only at livestock farms, Ariayante and  obtain negative and statistically significant coefficient estimates on beef farm income. Similarly, Weersink and Tauer (1989) estimate that an increase in income for New York Dairy Farms leads to statistically significant decrease in machinery, equipment, and livestock investment. In contrast to these studies, the coefficient estimates and partial elasticity estimates on the returns to investment for commercial livestock farms are positive but not statistically different from zero. I cannot reject that changes in the returns to investment have no impact on commercial livestock investment. There are multiple reasons why my results for livestock farms may differ from those of Ariayante and  and Weersink and Tauer (1989). One reason could be the greater level of heterogeneity between livestock producers within my sample. Since my dataset covers the whole US rather than a single state, it includes a greater variety of animal production systems. Believing that that the response to changes in net farm income differs according to animal production type, it is logical that having a greater variety of animal production types in the sample may lead to a greater range of estimates and difficulty in finding statistical significance. To address this issue, I estimate the regression for dairy and poultry separately. I obtain similar results for poultry farms as I do for livestock farms as a whole. For dairy farms my results now match those of other studies. There is a statistically significant and negative coefficient on the returns to investment and a smaller but positive statistically significant coefficient on investment returns squared. It appears that the rate of investment is negatively correlated with increases in the returns to investment. This may be related to the livestock production cycle, where changes in prices and income levels encourage producers to either build or reduce herd sizes. I can accept hypothesis one for grain and FNV farms. investment given higher initial farm income levels while they have a greater impact on commercial farms at lower initial farm income levels. As a result, the response to a change in the returns to investment will be the most similar for farms in the middle of the income distribution range. In general, very low income intermediate and resident farms will be the least responsive to a change in the returns to investment. Hypothesis one is more difficult to interpret for livestock farms given the lack of statistical significance on commercial farm coefficients and the squared income term I use. I obtain a statistically significant and negative interaction term on resident farms when breeding livestock is included but a positive interaction term for intermediate farms when breeding livestock is not included. When I look at dairy separately, I obtain no difference between resident and commercial responses to a change in the returns to investment but that intermediate dairy farms increase the rate of more given an increase in returns. For poultry farms both the commercial farm and the interaction term coefficients are statistically significant, indicating that an increase in investment returns has no impact across any of the farm typologies. Looking at the estimated partial investment elasticities, it appears that commercial livestock, dairy, and poultry farm investment increases to a greater degree given a change in returns, but this could be mainly due to the large levels of capital stock on commercial farms vs. higher rates of investment."}, {"section_title": "Results for Hypothesis 2: Marginal Tax Rates", "text": "A change in marginal tax rates has a statistically significant impact only commercial farms within the grain farms production category. There is a negative relationship between commercial grain farm investment and marginal tax rates. A one percentage increase in the marginal tax rate leads to a $375 decrease in commercial grain farm capital investment. My results for commercial grain farms are similar to that of Jensen et al. (1993). They estimate that an increase in the calculated farm marginal tax rate results in a statistically significant decrease in investment. Unlike Jensen et al. (1993), I obtain statistically insignificant coefficients on marginal tax rates for commercial farms in all other production types. This difference in statistical significance for FNV and livestock farms may be linked to differences in estimated levels and variation of farm marginal tax rates. The mean and standard deviation of marginal tax rates for farms in Jensen et al.'s Kansas Farm Management Dataset sample is larger than those estimated for cohorts in the ARMS dataset. Jensen et al. (1993) estimate that during the 1973-1988 time period the average marginal tax rate for farms in the Kansas Farm Management Dataset was 0.30 with a standard deviation of 0.223. The average marginal tax rate for cohorts within the sample is 0.16 with a standard deviation of 0.07. These differences could be due to differences in federal tax rates during the different sample time period, differences in farm crop and livestock production choices and related farm income levels, or the use of pseudo panels vs. true panel data. Regardless, at lower tax rates an increase in the marginal tax rate could have less of an impact on investment then at higher marginal tax rates. At these lower rates a change in the marginal tax rate could have a smaller impact on investment. In addition, Jensen et al. (1993) uses a Bisquare OLS estimation methodology while this study uses a fixed effects methodology. His methodology accounts for outliers in the data while mine focuses on fixed effects related to differences in farm size, production region, and production type. These differences in estimation methodologies may lead to differences in coefficient estimates. Hypothesis two is supported for grain farms, though different than what I expected. An increase in investment leads to a slightly larger increase in investment for resident farms compared to intermediate farms. Compared to commercial farms, the impact of an increase in marginal tax rates on resident farm investment is not \"larger or stronger\" as much as it is \"different\". On average, an increase in the marginal tax rate leads to a $375 decrease in commercial grain farm investment and a $83 increase in resident farm investment and a $35 increase in intermediate grain farm investment. Higher levels of investment reduce total taxable income. Taking advantage of this tax benefit should be more attractive as off-farm income levels increase. This explains the larger impact of marginal tax rates on resident grain farms compared to intermediate grain farms. One would expect the same relationship for commercial grain farms, as the summary statistics show that they also earn high levels of offfarm income. One explanation for this negative relationship could be when the marginal tax rate increases, either due to increases in the tax bracket percentages or because higher farm incomes push the farm into a higher tax bracket, the impact of a reduction in total income available for investment is greater than the benefits of reducing off-farm taxable income through investment. The overall result is a decrease in investment given an increase in marginal tax rates. It appears that the same relationship holds for FNV farms, livestock farms (including breeding livestock), and poultry farms. Unfortunately, given the lack of statistical significance on these coefficients for the other farm production types, I cannot reject that changes in marginal tax rates have no impact on resident farm investment within these categories. A one percent increase in the depreciation tax rate results in a $198 increase in commercial dairy investment and $33 in commercial poultry investment. The estimated coefficients are 17 The level of tax depreciation expenses is also related to the level of investment as seen in Table 23. Unfortunately, the link between larger farms having on average larger levels of revenues, expenditures, income, and asset levels makes using depreciation expenses without adjusting for differences in farm size problematic. By normalizing by capital expenses I minimize multicollinearity between model variables. Another way to address this would be to instead use a measure of allowable tax depreciation rates. This methodology along with pseudo panels constructed from ARMS data was used in a soon to be published article by Williamson and Stutzman in the Agricultural Finance Review. This methodology minimizes multicollinearity and deals with potential endogeneity due to greater depreciation expense levels caused by larger capital stock levels as a result of greater investment that period. This method does not take into account the actual level of depreciation taxes taken that period. Given generous tax depreciation expensing limits and bonus depreciation expense rates in the later part of our sample period, many farms expensed the majority of capital purchases in the given purchase period (Williamson and Stutzman). As a results, allowable and actual tax depreciation rates may differ substantially in the later sample time period. statistically insignificant for commercial grain and FNV farms. A change in depreciation tax expenses have no statistically significant impact on commercial grain and FNV investment. In comparison, Ariyarante and  obtain statistically significant estimates for machinery and equipment depreciation, vehicle depreciation and structure depreciation across the whole sample and within specific constructed farm quartiles. They estimate that an increase in lagged machinery and vehicle tax depreciation expenses results in an increase in investment, while an increase in lagged structure depreciation expenses results in a decrease in investment. Smaller but also positive and statistically significant increases in investment per dollar of lagged tax depreciation expenses were obtained by Jensen et al. (1993). In contrast, Hadrich and Olson (2013) estimate a statistically insignificant coefficient on the lagged log value of tax depreciation expenses for farms which made an investment in the given period. One reason for the difference in statistical significance and smaller coefficients I and Across all of the farm production types, the coefficient on working capital for commercial farms is not statistically different from zero, nor are the majority of the interaction terms on resident or intermediate farms. These results are similar to that of Hadrich and Olson (2013). They also obtain a small and statistically insignificant coefficient on the log of working capital. To verify these results, I examine the impact of other measures of financial constraints on farm capital investment, including lagged net worth, lagged debt, and lagged debt to asset measurements. For grains, FNV and poultry farms I find no statistically significant impacts on the rate of commercial farm capital investment from a change in any of these variables. Lagged debt levels have no statistically significant impact on the rate of commercial farm capital investment, except for dairy farms. Within dairy farms, there is a statistically significant and negative relationship between lagged debts and commercial farm investment. A higher level of debt in the prior period on commercial dairy farms is linked with a reduction in investment in the current period. This appears logical though the nature of the cause is uncertain. Increases in debt over the prior periods may reduce available credit levels this period. The reduction could be imposed externally in the credit markets or by the producer themselves unwilling to take on higher investment. The link between investment and higher prior credit levels could also just reflect the fact that, given the lumpy nature of capital and if it is assumed that some portion of the investment is financed through debt, a large investment yesterday could mean that needed investments will be lower in the current and subsequent periods. My results for all but dairy farms are different from those obtained by other farm investment studies such as Serra et al., who obtains a positive and statistically significant coefficient on assets, or Weersink and Tauer, whom obtain a positive and statistically significant coefficient on changes in liabilities and assets. One reason may be my sample time period. Farm incomes rose and total debt levels of producers fell during the latter portion of my sample period. Many producers were able to invest out of current earning and hence the level of debts and net worth will have less of an impact in influencing investment levels. For livestock and dairy farms, I obtain positive and statistically significant coefficients on lagged debt to asset coefficients for commercial farms. A higher level of debts relative to assets last period is associated with greater investment this period. A similar coefficient value was obtained by Micheels et al. (2004)  Given these conflicting results, that the impact of credit and financial constraints on investment is different even in similar farm production types depending on the measurement used, further work is needed to be certain regarding the exact relationship between increases in liquidity and financial constraints across farm production types and typologies.  1996. Jensen et al. (1993 utilized the earlier time period of 1973-1988. Reasons for these differences may be that in the earlier time period either: off-farm incomes varied more in general and/or in comparison to farm incomes, off farm incomes were much higher in comparison to farm incomes, or a larger portion of farms did not earn off-farm income. A lower level of variation within off-farm income levels overall and compared to farmincome levels during the sample time period, less of a difference between off-farm and farm income levels, or a greater number of farms now earning off-farm incomes would result in smaller and potentially statistically insignificant impacts on investment from a change in the level of farm off-farm income during the 1996-2013 time frame, supporting the lack of statistical significance obtained in my and Ariyarante and Featherstone's estimates."}, {"section_title": "8.9: Results for Other Model Variables: Farm Acres", "text": "The impact of a change in farm acres on investment differ across production types. There are no statistically significant impacts on investment from a change in farm acreage for grain or FNV farms. For livestock farms (excluding breeding livestock), an increase in farm acres results in a statistically significant decrease in investment rates. These results differ from that of Micheels (2004), who estimated a positive and statistically significant relationship between farm capital investment and farm acres using Illinois Farm Business Management data. Unlike Micheels, I normalize by the value of farm capital stock. This removes any spurious correlation between larger investment levels on large farms and acres due to the sole fact that large farms operate a greater number of acres. In addition, Micheels does not differentiate between crop and livestock production when estimating the impact of farm acres on investment. By separating grain, FNV and livestock farms I remove any spurious relationships between acreage and investment that are due to differences between different crop and livestock production systems. In contrast to the findings of Micheels (2004), Weersink and Tauer (1989), find no statistically significant relationship between dairy farm investment and farm size. They utilize work units to measure farm size. This measurement is a more accurate reflection of farm size for livestock farms given that it takes into account physical livestock units produced and is not solely based on physical farm size. When I estimate the regression for dairy farms separately I also obtain a statistically insignificant coefficient on farm acres. Given these conflicting relationships, further work is needed to determine the exact relationship between investment across different livestock production types and physical farm size. Those for incomes and tax depreciation rates for resident farms are statistically significant, supporting hypothesis 2 and to some degree hypothesis 1. These impacts are similar for dairy and poultry farms as to livestock farms when using pseudo panel 3, further adding credence to these hypotheses. I overall find no statistically significant differences in working capital levels across any of the farm typologies or farm types, further supporting my results for hypothesis 3. Similar results are obtained in terms of coefficient signs with regards to output prices, income levels, depreciation levels and marginal tax rates when using pseudo panel 3 compared to using pseudo panel 1. One difference is that statistical significance of the coefficients obtained using pseudo panel 3 is lower compared to those obtained when using pseudo panel 1. This supports my thought that by not grouping farms specifically into farm typologies I am less able to clearly identify differences between the responses to key variables among farm typologies. The results obtained in panel 3 support hypothesis 1 for output prices when comparing commercial and resident farms and hypothesis 2 with regards to marginal tax rates when comparing resident and intermediate farms. where my results are very similar to those obtained for grain farms using pseudo panels 1 and 2. These comparisons both lend credence to my earlier results, support the need to taking into account differences in farm size and owner occupation when forming cohorts, as well as the difficulty of obtaining statistical significance when estimating using fixed effects models and pseudo panels constructed from highly heterogeneous survey data. Statistically significant impacts for panel 1 in general appear consistent across panel construction while similar but statistically insignificant results in other panels may be statistically significant in panel 1. This is similar to the findings comparing using different models, including random effects and feasible least squares, to a fixed effects model.        "}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "To estimate the change in average farm investment between 2013 vs. 1996 I first multiply the difference in the average level of the independent variables between these two years 18 This can be expressed as: , where 2013 and 1996 denote the average value of investment in 2013 and 1996, 2013, and 1996, the average value of each of the K independent variables (including the time dummy for 2013 and that for 1996) in 2013 and 1996, and 2013 and 1996 the error term in 2013 and 1996. The difference in investment is the sum of the difference in each of the model variables times the estimated coefficient plus the difference in the error terms between the two periods. All fixed effects terms or typology dummy variables present in the original regression specification are removed by taking the difference between two time periods. 19 This is an approximation. The true difference in the rate of investment is - ,1996 1996 . Instead this is proxied by 2013 -1996 = ,2013 \u2212 ,1996 \u0305 where \u0305 is the average level of capital stock. The residual now includes differences in the rates of investment between 2013 and 1996 due to changes in the level of capital stock not accounted for by the model variables.    and 1996. Of the change in average commercial grain farm investment between these years, $34,399, or 85%, of the increase is in commercial grain farm investment and $10,170, or 65%, of the decrease in commercial livestock farm investment is accounted for by changes in the model variables. Changes in the model variables between 1996 and 2013 do a poor job explaining changes in average farm investment for commercial FNV farms and commercial livestock farms (including breeding livestock). The estimated coefficients and changes in the model variables indicate that average farm capital investment should be lower in 2013 vs. 1996 for commercial FNV farms and commercial livestock farms (including breeding livestock). Instead, both are larger in 2013 vs. 1996. These differences can be accounted for by large negative estimated coefficient values on output prices for FNV farms and depreciation expenses for livestock farms (including breeding livestock). The majority of the difference between 2013 and 1996 average farm capital investment levels on commercial grain and livestock farms in 2013 vs. 1996 can be explained by increases in output prices, decreases in interest rates, and 2013 year dummy variables. Changes in output prices, interest rates, and other factors specific to 2013 explain $10,600, $11,887 and $11,235 of the increase in average farm investment levels on commercial grain farms in 2013 vs. 1996. Reductions in interest rates and the 2013 year dummy variable explains $7,881 and $9,367 of the decrease in average investment levels on commercial livestock farms. Increases in output prices, all else held constant, indicate that commercial livestock farm capital investment should be $8,037 higher in 2013 vs. 1996. The year dummy variable represents factors unique to 2013 but common across all farm production types and typologies and not accounted for by specific variables within the model. These could include weather conditions and changes in export demand. A smaller portion of the difference in commercial farm investment between these two years can also be explained by changes in net farm income, off-farm income, acres, and depreciation tax expenses. Changes in net farm income explain $1,437 of the increase in investment for commercial grain farms and $818 of the decrease in investment for commercial livestock farms. For commercial farms, an increase in average off-farm income levels explains $783 of the increase in average farm investment while a decrease in average farm acreage would predicts a $1,086 decrease in investment. For commercial livestock farms, the decline in Given each of these has an impact on farm capital investment, one interesting question is what will average farm capital investment look like in 2024 given the expected changes in economic conditions between now and then? To answer this question, in the next section I utilize my model to estimate future changes in investment over the 2014-2024 time period given projected changes in output prices, net farm income, tax depreciation levels, marginal tax rates, working capital levels, and interest rates. I utilize the estimated grain and livestock (not including breeding livestock) investment models only. I do not use the FNV and livestock (including breeding livestock) investment models given their lower ability to accurately estimate changes in investment over the sample period.\nI calculate the projected change in average farm capital investment due to changes in each variable separately within farm types and typologies. First I calculate the total percentage change in each variable between 2014-2024. This is done by taking the sum of the annual continuous percentage changes in the variable over these years. This is then multiplied by the partial investment elasticity. This results in an estimate of the average change in farm capital investment in 2024 compared to 2013 given a change in the specified variable."}, {"section_title": "Projection Data 2014-2024", "text": "Projected changes in output prices for crop and livestock farms, net farm incomes, and interest rates are estimated using data from the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) 20 10-year baseline estimates. For changes in crop and livestock output prices, I utilize the FAPRI estimates for annual gross crop and livestock receipts. For changes in net farm income I use the FAPRI projections for net farm income earned by the agricultural sector. Changes in interest rates are represented as one third the projected change in prime interest rates. FAPRI nominal crop receipts, livestock receipts, and net farm incomes were converted to real net farm incomes using the FAPRI CPI estimates. This is in order to be consistent with my model, which uses real output and net farm income levels. Estimates of annual changes in tax depreciation expenses, marginal tax rates, and working capital levels are my best estimates.  Grain farm real output prices decrease 12% in 2014, 7% in 2015 and 2% in 2016. Livestock prices increase by 11% in 2014 but then decrease by 11% in 2015, 5% in 2016 and 4% in 2017. For the remainder of the 2018-2024 time period crop and livestock prices are projected to remain close to these new 2017 levels, either increasing or decreasing by 0-3% annually. Real net farm income levels will drop severely between 2014 and 2017. Net Farm incomes fall by 15% in 2014, 21% in 2014, 9% in 2016 and 4% in 2017. For the rest of the time period, nominal net cash farm income continues to increase slightly, but less than inflation leading to decreases in real cash farm income of between 1-3% over the 2018-2024 time period. I assume that the current depreciation tax laws remain intact until 2018, and hence there is no change in the average rate of tax depreciation per unit capital until 2018. This is based on the \"Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015\" (PATH Act) passed on December 18, 2015 (Gearhardt, January 2016). Under this act, the Section 179 depreciation expensing limit for new capital purchase was extended indefinitely at its current value. The current bonus depreciation percentage limit was extended at its current 50% level though 2017, after which it decreases to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019. To account for these declines I estimate a 10% reduction in the rate of tax depreciation each of these years. I assume that bonus depreciation remains constant at 30% after this point, leading to no change in tax depreciation expenses beyond 2019. These projections assume that rules governing current depreciation tax lives and normal deduction percentages remain consistent at their 2013 levels. I estimate the projected annual rate of change in marginal tax rates as one-third of the annual percentage change in net cash farm income each year. The smaller reduction in tax rates compared to that of farm income takes into account that the model estimates a federal tax rate using total household income. Reductions in total household income may be less than the reduction in farm incomes depending on levels of off-farm income and other taxable income sources and actions on the part of the household. These estimates assume that federal tax rates, standardized and itemized deduction levels, and the rates and limits for individual tax line items remain at their 2013 levels. I estimate a 10% decline in working capital in 2014, a 25% decline in 2015, and an additional 10% decline in 2016. These estimates are based upon documented increases in farm debt levels and declines in farm asset levels in 2014 and 2015 (USDA, November 2015) and my expectations that this pattern will continue in 2016 given further expected declines in farm income levels. After 2016, I assume that working capital remains constant at its 2017 level as farm incomes stabilize."}, {"section_title": "Projected Change in Investment", "text": "The results are summarized in table 50 for grain farms and table 51 for livestock farms.   Given the projected change output prices, net farm incomes, marginal tax rates, depreciation tax rates and working capital levels, average farm capital investment is expected to decline for all but intermediate grain farms. The largest decline in investment occurs on commercial grain and livestock farms. Average farm capital investment will decline by $7,218 on grain commercial grain farms and by $9,955 on commercial livestock farms. Resident farm investment will fall significantly as well. Resident grain farm investment will be $4,537 lower for grain farms and $2,515 lower for livestock farms in 2024 compared to 2013. Intermediate farm investment is the least impacted given projected changes in model variables. When projected changes in interest rates are included in the total projected change, the decline in farm capital investment is larger across all farm typologies. The largest decline in commercial farm capital investment arises due to falling farm income levels. A projected 59% decrease in real net cash farm results in an $8,815 decrease in average commercial grain farm investment and a $4,414 decrease in average livestock farm investment. The second largest decline in commercial farm investment is due to increasing interest rates. Other important impacts on commercial farm investment include a $4,534 increase in commercial grain farm investment due to a decline in marginal tax rates, an average $2,879 increase in commercial grain farm investment levels due to falling output prices, and a $2,683 decline in commercial livestock investment due to a decline in output prices. For resident grain farms and intermediate livestock farms falling output prices have a significant and larger impact on overall average farm investment relative to declines in net farm income. Falling output prices reduces resident grain farm investment by $2,075 and intermediate livestock farm investment by $1,308. Also, projected future declines in depreciation expenses will have the largest impact on resident farms and commercial crop farms. A projected 26% decrease in tax depreciation expenses results in a decrease in average farm capital investment of $2,031 for commercial livestock farms, $1,971 for resident grain farms and $1,029 for resident livestock farms."}, {"section_title": "132", "text": "CHAPTER 10: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE STEPS Below I summarize the research undertaken, draw conclusions and outline future steps."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "In this study, I examine U.S. farm expenditures on machinery, equipment and structures by farm enterprise type and farm typology, a classification of farms based on farm income and primary occupation of the operator.

I can accept my first hypothesis, that commercial farm investment is more responsive to changes in output prices and returns compared to intermediate farms for commercial grain farms only. I can accept this hypothesis with regards to returns for FNV farms but not for output prices. I can accept my second hypothesis, that resident farms are more sensitive to tax policy variables compared to commercial farms, for grain farms with regards to marginal tax rates and for livestock farms with regards to tax depreciation expense rates. I can accept the third hypothesis, that intermediate farms exhibit credit constrained behavior and increase investment to a greater degree compared to commercial and resident farms given increases in farm liquidity, for FNV farms, but not for grain or livestock farms. Changes in output prices, interest rates, and year specific impacts explain the majority of the difference in average grain and livestock farm investment levels in 2013 compared to 1996. Within individual farm typologies, a large portion of the increase in average investment levels on commercial farms between these years is explained by higher returns in 2013 compared to 1996. For resident and commercial livestock farms declines in the average tax depreciation expense rate explain a significant portion of the change in investment between these years. Calculating projected average farm capital investment in 2024 given expected changes in key variables over the 2014 to 2024 time period highlights the importance of the following: net farm income levels and marginal tax rates on projected commercial farm investment, changes in tax depreciation policy on resident and commercial livestock farm and resident grain farm investment, and livestock output prices for intermediate livestock farm investment. My research both sheds light on the differential impacts of changes in the factors driving the demand for investment across different farm typologies as well as the importance of accounting for both microeconomic and macroeconomic factors when estimating projected agricultural investment. The literature on agricultural investment has tended to put a large emphasis on microeconomic factors, such as prices and returns, while placing a smaller emphasis on macroeconomic factors. My analysis indicates that macroeconomic factors may have an equally as important impact as microeconomic factors on determining farm capital investment. In this light, upcoming anticipated changes in the interest rate may have significant impacts on farm investment, both to the degree to which proposed changes in interest rates set by the Federal Reserve impact farm loan rates and the cost of borrowing money, as well as the degree to which changes in interest rates impact exchange rates, the value of the dollar, and agricultural commodity prices and export/import levels. Given the current lackluster economic activity in Europe and Asia and a dearth of high yielding alternative investment options, the Federal Reserve's proposed actions may have little impact on actual loan rates and/or the value of the dollar. In that case, there would be little impact on farm capital investment from changes in the Federal Reserve loan rates. On the other hand, if these measures are successful and lead to both an increase in interest rates and trigger an appreciation of the dollar, leading to lower agricultural export demand and falling net farm incomes, declines in investment may be even more severe than anticipated."}, {"section_title": "Future Steps", "text": "Further work is needed in this area. While interest rates explain a large portion of the change in investment (2013 vs. 1996) and are projected to have a strong impact on future farm investment, the coefficients are statistically insignificant. This could be due to either: the measurement I use for interest rates, the use of a fixed effects model, or the use of pseudo panels. Future work in this area may involve finding data for or calculating average interest rates at the state and production type level, or constructing a measure of farm interest expenses paid on current farm loans which takes into account both the large number of farms with no current interest rate expenses and addresses issues of multicollinearity between farm size, investment levels, net farm income levels, and total interest rate expenditures. The above step would correspond with another step I plan to undertake, which is the creation of an input cost index. Such an index would allow me to examine the impact of changes in input costs on farm investment demand. It may also shed additional light on the large portion of the difference in investment in 2013 vs. 1996 explained by the dummy year variable in the model. Important relationships to model using this index include investment and energy and variable input prices on grain farms, labor prices on FNV and livestock farms, and feed costs for livestock and dairy farms. In conjunction, the measure of working capital I use needs to be updated to account for raised breeding livestock. This involves returning to the original survey dataset and re-creating the pseudo panel datasets. This is something that I am unable to do currently. This may shed greater light on the factors driving livestock investment as well differences between the investment behavior within livestock vs. grain farm investment. Knowing these differences is key when looking to meet the investment demand for producers within these different sectors. Finally, I can utilize the alternative pseudo panels I created to see if my results differ utilizing interaction terms based upon farm size or asset value levels. In particular, this would allow me to further examine the impact of changes in working capital and debts on farm investment. This would also allow for further analysis of the impact of farm size on investment. By separating resident farms within this sample, I may be able to obtain more finite results for intermediate farms than I currently have been able to within my sample. These additional results will be invaluable as the agricultural sector seeks to understand, anticipate and plan for changes in future farm capital investment in a period of declining farm prices and incomes.
