[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: Perceived discrimination has been associated with poor physical and psychological health. There is limited research examining perceived discrimination in older adults, and its effects on health in later life. The aim of this study is to extend research in this area by examining longitudinal associations between reported everyday discrimination and physical and cognitive function in older adults. Method: The present study uses a national sample of 4,886 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Perceived discrimination was assessed at baseline by asking participants about the frequency with which they experienced 5 everyday discriminatory situations. Cognitive functioning, comprising tests of recall and a test of verbal fluency, and physical functioning, comprising a timed walk test, were measured identically at baseline and follow-up. Multiple regression analyses were performed, adjusting for sociodemographic and health status variables. Results: At baseline, 39.3% of participants reported being discriminated against at least a few times a year. After adjusting for demographic variables, health status, and depression, baseline discrimination was associated with poorer recall (B \u03ed \u03ea0.26, 95% CI [\u03ea0.44, \u03ea0.08]) and slower gait speed (B \u03ed \u03ea0.02, 95% CI [\u03ea0.03, \u03ea0.004]) at follow-up. Discrimination was not associated with poorer verbal fluency (B \u03ed \u03ea0.12, 95% CI [\u03ea0.45, 0.22]) at follow-up. Conclusions: The experience of discrimination is common among older adults and is associated with poorer physical and cognitive functioning. Addressing issues around discrimination in older adults may contribute to maintaining functioning in later life."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Declines in physical and cognitive function are common in older age. As individuals age, the risk of developing conditions such as dementia increases, with estimates suggesting that dementia risk doubles for every 5-to 6-year increase in age after the age of 60 years (Prince et al., 2013) . Likewise, sarcopenia (characterized by decreased muscle strength and function) and mobility limitations are more common in older adults (Brown & Flood, 2013; CruzJentoft et al., 2010) . With a rapid increase in the aging population worldwide, these issues are of major public health significance, and understanding factors other than natural aging that have an effect on older adults' physical and cognitive function is of primary social and economic significance.\nDiscrimination refers to unfair or unjust treatment based on personal characteristics such as gender, race, age, or sexual orientation (Banks, Kohn-Wood, & Spencer, 2006; Pascoe & Richman, 2009) . Perceived discrimination is a common social phenomenon.\nMore than 60% of U.S. adults report having experienced some type of everyday discrimination in their lives, and more than 30% report having experienced major lifetime discrimination (Kessler, Mickelson, & Williams, 1999) . The experience of discrimination is believed to act as a chronic stressor leading to physiological and psychological dysregulation and ultimately poor physical and mental health outcomes (Pascoe & Richman, 2009; Williams & Mohammed, 2009) . Perceived discrimination has been found to be significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and reduced well-being (Schmitt, Branscombe, Postmes, & Garcia, 2014) ; risky health behaviors (Sims et al., 2016) ; hypertension (Dolezsar, McGrath, Herzig, & Miller, 2014) ; inflammation (Goosby, Malone, Richardson, Cheadle, & Williams, 2015; Lewis, Aiello, Leurgans, Kelly, & Barnes, 2010; Sutin, Stephan, Luchetti, & Terracciano, 2014) ; poor self-care (Dawson, Walker, Campbell, & Egede, 2015) ; and adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular events (Everson-Rose et al., 2015) and mortality (Barnes et al., 2008) .\nThere is limited research examining the effects of perceived discrimination on physical and cognitive function. The findings with regard to physical function have been equivocal. Harris and colleagues examined the experience of racism among individuals aged 15 years and over in New Zealand and found in their cross-sectional analysis that experience of unfair treatment was associated with poorer physical functioning (defined as the lowest quartile of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale; Harris et al., 2006) whereas a cross-sectional study of Chinese Americans aged 18 -65 years examining both institutional-and individual-level discrimination found no association between either measure of discrimination and scores on the SF-36 (Gee, 2002) . A longitudinal study of women aged 47-62 years in the United States found that experience of discrimination in the workplace was associated with greater functional limitations such as difficulties in standing, lifting heavy objects, and so forth at a 7-year follow-up (Pavalko, Mossakowski, & Hamilton, 2003) , whereas an analysis of data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), with participants aged 53 years and older, found that neither everyday discrimination nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with change in the number of difficulties with activities such as walking up a flight of stairs, moving a chair, and so forth over a 2-year period (Luo, Xu, Granberg, & Wentworth, 2012) .\nThe findings with regard to cognitive function have been more consistent. In a cross-sectional study of older African Americans (mean age of 72.9 years), perceived discrimination was found to be associated with poor episodic memory and perceptual speed (Barnes et al., 2012) . A study of Americans aged 65 years and older found that perceived racial discrimination moderated the association between diabetes and cognitive decline among African Americans over a 4-year period, such that diabetes was significantly predictive of decline only among participants who reported discrimination (Crowe et al., 2010) . Using data from the HRS, Sutin and colleagues found that discrimination based on physical disability was associated with a decrease in recall over a 4-year period (Sutin, Stephan, Carretta, & Terracciano, 2015) . No other type of discrimination (race, ancestry, sex, age, weight, appearance and sexual orientation) was associated with a change in memory.\nThus, it is clear that most previous work on discrimination and health has focused on specific types of discrimination, usually racial discrimination. Such an approach is unable to account for exposure to multiple forms of discrimination. Individuals are commonly exposed to more than a single type of discrimination (Everson-Rose et al., 2015; Grollman, 2012; Luo et al., 2012) , and it has been shown that nonrace/ethnicity-based forms of discrimination are also harmful to health (Alvarez-Galvez, 2016; EversonRose et al., 2015) . Furthermore, little is known about older people's exposure to discrimination or the associations between health outcomes and perceived discrimination for this age group because research has mostly concentrated on young and middle-aged adults (Sutin et al., 2015) .\nTypically studies examining health effects of perceived discrimination have separately focused on mental health and physical health outcomes. However, these effects may not be completely independent (Forsyth, Schoenthaler, Chaplin, Ogedegbe, & Ravenell, 2014; Schunck, Reiss, & Razum, 2015) . There is considerable evidence linking perceived discrimination to increased depression (Britt-Spells, Slebodnik, Sands, & Rollock, 2016; Schmitt et al., 2014) . Depression has been associated with poorer physical functioning, disability, and frailty (Demakakos et al., 2013; Rozzini et al., 1997; Vaughan, Corbin, & Goveas, 2015) as well as with cognitive impairment and dementia (Byers & Yaffe, 2011; da Silva, Gon\u00e7alves-Pereira, Xavier, & Mukaetova-Ladinska, 2013; Wang & Blazer, 2015) . In fact, in the Barnes et al. (2012) study quoted earlier, perceived discrimination was no longer significantly associated with cognitive function once depression was included in the model, suggesting that depression may represent a pathway through which perceived discrimination affects cognitive function.\nThe present analysis aimed to extend work in this area by examining associations between reported everyday discrimination and physical and cognitive function in older adults. Cognitive function was assessed using tests of recall and verbal fluency, which have been shown to be associated with outcomes important to this population, including health literacy (Bostock & Steptoe, 2012) , investment decisions (Banks & Oldfield, 2007) , and survival (Batty, Deary, & Zaninotto, 2016) . Physical function was assessed using the walking speed test, an important predictor of well-being, disability, and mortality (Abellan Van Kan et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2014; Studenski et al., 2011) . To overcome limitations of previous research in this area, changes in functioning over a period of 4 years were examined, adjusting for a range of demographic and health factors. Most studies in the area of perceived discrimination and physical/cognitive function do not control for other comorbidities, which may be particularly important in older populations. Finally, the analyses were adjusted for depression to examine if effects are independent of depression. It was hypothesized that participants who reported experiencing discrimination would show poorer physical and cognitive function over a 4-year period. (Steptoe, Breeze, Banks, & Nazroo, 2013) .

Outcomes were assessed 4 years later (Wave 7; because this is the latest wave available. At baseline, 9,090 participants completed the main interview in person. Because the measure of physical function (timed walk test) was administered only to participants aged 60 years and older (N \u03ed 7,122), we restricted the analysis to participants in this age group who had a valid value on the timed walk test and on at least one cognitive function measure at baseline (N \u03ed 6,129).

Participants were asked \"In your day-to-day life, how often have any of the following things happened to you?\" followed by five scenarios: \"You receive poorer service than other people at restaurants or stores,\" \"You are treated with less courtesy or respect than other people,\" \"People act as if they think you are not clever,\" \"You are threatened or harassed,\" and \"You receive poorer service or treatment than other people from doctors or hospitals.\" Response options included almost every day, at least once a week, a few times a month, a few time a year, less than once a year, and never. Participants who reported being discriminated against a few times a year or more on any of the above were classified as \"discriminated\" whereas those who reported experiencing discrimination less than once a once a year or never were classified as \"not discriminated\" (Rippon, Kneale, de Oliveira, Demakakos, & Steptoe, 2014) . Perceived discrimination was measured at baseline. Physical and cognitive function was measured identically at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive function was measured using two memory tasks (immediate and delayed recall) and one test of executive function (verbal fluency). For the memory tests, a list of 10 words was read out by the computer at a steady rate. After this, participants were asked to recall as many words as they could (immediate recall). After a short interval during which participants performed other cognitive tasks, they were asked to recall these 10 words again (delayed recall). The sum of the number of words correctly recalled in each test (immediate recall \u03e9 delayed recall; range 0 -20) was taken as a measure of memory. The measure forms part of the adapted Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (Brandt, Spencer, & Folstein, 1988) used in the HRS (Ofstedal, Fisher, & Herzog, 2005) . For the verbal fluency task participants were asked to name as many animals as they could in 1 min. The total number of animals named was used an indicator of executive function. The verbal fluency test was initially developed by Thurstone as a written task; oral versions including animal naming form part of various tests including the Western Aphasia Battery and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia examination (Tombaugh, Kozak, & Rees, 1999) .\nPhysical function was assessed using the timed walk test (gait speed). Participants were asked to walk a distance of 8 ft (2.44 m) twice and timed as they did so. Participants were required to start with both feet at the start line and instructed to walk as normal and not race. Timing commenced when the participant's foot was placed over the start line. If the participant normally used a walking stick or a Zimmer frame, then s/he was allowed to use this for the test. The walking test was not administered if the participant needed help from another person, if the interviewer judged it unsafe, or if there was no suitable space for the test. The mean speed of the two walks (m/sec) was taken as the measure of physical function. If only a single walk was completed without any problems, then the speed for this walk was used.\nSociodemographic and health status covariates, measured at baseline, were included in the analysis. Age and gender were assessed in the main interview. Total (nonpension) wealth divided into quintiles for the entire baseline sample and educational level classified as having no formal qualifications versus at least O-levels (equivalent to high school in the United States) or higher were used as measures of socioeconomic status. Because the final analytical sample included only part of the baseline sample, there are unequal numbers in each of the five wealth groups. Marital status/cohabitation was classified as married or cohabiting versus not. Because the ELSA population is predominantly White, ethnicity was classified as White or non-White. Analyses of cognitive function were adjusted for the following health status variables: CVD (including arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina, heart murmur, diabetes, and stroke) and Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. The analysis of gait speed was adjusted for CVD as previously discussed, lung disease, asthma, osteoporosis, and arthritis. All health status variables were self-reports of doctor-diagnosed conditions. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the eight-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Participants were required to respond yes or no to eight statements. Responses were summed, and scores ranged from 0 to 8 such that higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. Validity and reliability of the scale has been established elsewhere (Steffick, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Missing data on covariates and outcomes were imputed using the multiple imputation procedure in SPSS (for items imputed, mean percentage missing \u03ed 2.5%, median \u03ed 0.4%, maximum \u03ed 11.8%).

Because participants who were unable to do the gait speed test due to health reasons were excluded at baseline, we ran a sensitivity analysis. At baseline and at follow-up, individuals were categorized into five groups on the basis of gait speed as follows: unable to carry/complete out the walking speed test due to health reasons or because the interviewer felt it would be unsafe for them to do the test; gait speed up to 0.4 m/sec; and gait speed \u03fe0.4 to 0.8 m/sec, \u03fe0.8 to 1.2 m/sec, and \u05461.2 m/sec.

This perceived discrimination was associated with poorer recall and gait speed over a 4-year period. The associations were independent of socioeconomic status, baseline health status, and depressive symptoms.\nStudies in the United States have found higher levels of perceived discrimination among older adults (Ayalon & Gum, 2011) . The lower figure in the current analysis is possibly due to the way the discriminated category was defined because this did not include participants who reported relatively infrequent experiences of discrimination (i.e., less than once a year). In the context of racism, incidents of everyday discrimination have been termed as acts of microaggression (Franklin & Boyd-Franklin, 2000) . Such microaggressions are believed to lead to defensive anxiety and a state of chronic stress, compromising the individual's psychological and physical health over time (Britt-Spells et al., 2016; Franklin & Boyd-Franklin, 2000; Williams & Williams-Morris, 2000) . Relatively infrequent experiences of such events may not adequately capture exposure to these stressors; hence, we did not consider these in our analyses. Perceived discrimination was associated with poorer gait speed and recall over the 4-year period. Depression attenuated but did not completely eliminate the effect of perceived discrimination on outcomes. This suggests that depression may be a partial mediator of the perceived discriminationfunctional decline relationship. However, this would need to be assessed using formal mediation analyses.\nThere are also other pathways through which perceived discrimination affects health. The stress associated with frequent experience of discriminatory events may lead to a range of behavioral and biological changes. For instance, discrimination has been associated with risky health behaviors such as smoking (Purnell et al., 2012; Sims et al., 2016) and cardiovascular risk factors such as higher levels of adiposity (Hunte, 2011; Lewis, Kravitz, Janssen, & Powell, 2011) , inflammation (Lewis et al., 2010; Sutin et al., 2014) , and allostatic load (Brody et al., 2014) . These risky behaviors and biological changes have also been implicated in declines in cognitive function (Gustafson, 2006; Kanaya et al., 2009 ; Kar- Table 2 Cognitive Function (Recall and Verbal Fluency) at 886) Step 1 B (95% CI)\nStep 2 B (95% CI)\nStep 3 B (95% CI)\nStep 4 B (95% CI) Note.\nStep 1: Adjusted for age, gender, and baseline cognitive function.

These may represent potential mechanisms through which perceived discrimination affects functioning in older age. Individuals who have experienced discrimination may be particularly vulnerable to stereotype threat, in which being in a situation in which their performance may serve to reinforce existing stereotypes about the particular group(s) they belong to might lead to underperformance in that domain (Steele & Aronson, 1995) . Previous research using the ELSA data shows that approximately one third of participants report experiencing discrimination due to their age (Rippon et al., 2014) . A meta-analysis of experimental studies found that older adults performed more poorly on cognitive tests when age-based stereotypes were activated (Lamont, Swift, & Abrams, 2015) . One of the ways in which stereotype threat may affect performance may be through the depletion of working memory because resources are directed toward monitoring performance and suppressing negative thoughts (Spencer, Logel, & Davies, 2016) . This in particular may have important implications for cognitive function tests. Only a small number of studies of age-based stereotype threat have examined physical performance, and the overall effect size was not significant in the meta-analysis (Lamont et al., 2015) .\nAn alternative explanation relies on Levy's stereotype embodiment theory, in which the experience of discrimination and exposure to stereotypes leads individuals to internalize negative stereotypes held about their group (Levy, 2009 ). In the context of aging, individuals holding more negative self-stereotypes or selfperceptions have been found to perform more poorly on cognitive and physical function tests in laboratory situations (Levy, 2003) . Observational data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging showed that negative aging stereotypes were associated with declines in cognitive performance over 38 years (Levy, Zonderman, Slade, & Ferrucci, 2012) as well as changes in biological markers of Alzheimer's disease such as greater declines in hippocampal volume and more accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Levy et al., 2016) . Data from the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement also show that older adults who had more positive perceptions of their aging had slower declines in physical functioning (measured as the ability to do tasks around the house, socialize, work full time, etc.) over a 20-year period (Levy, Slade, & Kasl, 2002) .\nRecent evidence suggests that perceived discrimination may be associated with changes in personality over time, including increases in neuroticism and decreases in conscientiousness (Sutin, Stephan, & Terracciano, 2016) , both of which have been associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia (Low, Harrison, & Lackersteen, 2013) and chronic diseases (Sutin, Zonderman, Ferrucci, & Terracciano, 2013) . Cross-sectional studies also suggest an association between neuroticism and poor physical functioning and disability (Chapman, Duberstein, & Lyness, 2007; Jaconelli, Stephan, Canada, & Chapman, 2013; Suchy, Williams, Kraybill, Franchow, & Butner, 2010) .\nPerceived discrimination was associated with poorer recall but not verbal fluency over time. Barnes and colleagues suggest that this is in line with the view of discrimination as a social stressor, given findings on the deleterious effects of stress on episodic memory (Barnes et al., 2012) . As noted earlier, findings from previous work on the effects of discrimination on physical function have been mixed. This may be due to cross-sectional designs, relatively short follow-up periods, and the choice of outcomes. Previous work has shown that there may be a lag in the experience of discrimination and poor health outcomes (Pavalko et al., 2003) . Although longer follow-ups may be necessary to observe changes in disability levels, changes in gait speed may be apparent earlier.\nDeclines in gait speed may be indicative of subclinical disease (Cooper et al., 2011) , and it has been shown to be a powerful predictor of later disability and mortality (Guralnik et al., 2000; Studenski et al., 2011) . Thus, using such measures may help identify the harmful health effects of discrimination at an earlier stage."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "This analysis uses data from a large, nationally representative, multidisciplinary cohort study, which makes it possible to adjust for a range of sociodemographic and health status covariates. We were also able to obtain multiple measures of cognitive function and an objective measure of physical functioning using a standardized protocol. The measures of health status were self-reports of doctor-diagnosed conditions; hence, they may be subject to bias. At baseline there were several differences in health status between individuals who had experienced discrimination and those who had not; hence, the possibility that poor health or functioning may have led to the experience of discrimination cannot be ruled out. However, the 4-year follow-up ensured that we were able to examine functioning over time. Furthermore, previous research has not found support for the pathway from poor health to perceived discrimination (Pavalko et al., 2003; Schunck et al., 2015) . One of the main limitations of this analysis is the dropout between waves. Individuals who dropped out were likely to be in poorer health, from a lower socioeconomic status, and have poorer functioning. Thus, our findings may underestimate the associations between perceived discrimination and physical and cognitive function. However, it must be noted that declines in recall were very small, and it is unclear to what extent these declines are likely to affect daily activities or be indicative of more severe memory ailments. In a minimally adjusted model, discrimination was associated with a decrease of 0.03 m/sec in gait speed. Among community-dwelling adults, a change of 0.03-0.05 m/sec in walking speed would be regarded as clinically meaningful (Kwon et al., 2009; Perera, Mody, Woodman, & Studenski, 2006) . Hence, addressing discrimination may have clinically meaningful effects on physical function.\nOur measure of perceived discrimination assessed exposure to everyday discrimination. The focus of these analyses was on the association between the experience of discrimination and functioning in later life, without reference to individuals' attributions. Similar approaches have been used elsewhere (e.g., Everson-Rose et al., 2015; Friedman, Williams, Singer, & Ryff, 2009 ). Naturally, it is possible to measure other dimensions of discrimination (Pascoe & Richman, 2009) , and a consideration of these dimensions may provide a fuller picture of an individual's experiences (Williams & Mohammed, 2009 ). Most past research has focused on racial discrimination in relation to physical and cognitive function, and future work might usefully consider associations with different This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nattributions (e.g., Sutin et al., 2015) . It is also valuable to reiterate that this study examines perceptions of discrimination rather than observed discrimination. This refers to a subjective, interpretative process (Major & Kaiser, 2008) . There are naturally concerns associated with using such measures, such as incorrectly attributing certain acts to discrimination or failing to report acts for various reasons (Major & Kaiser, 2008; Quillian, 2006) . However, the individual's perception of being discriminated against remains important to his or her health (Luo et al., 2012; Pascoe & Richman, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The experience of discrimination is common among older adults and is associated with poorer functioning over time.
