Scans from NAPLS 2 were collected from January 15, 2010, to April 30, 2012.\nDiscrepancy between neuroanatomical-based predicted age (hereafter referred to as brain age) and chronological age.\nThe PING-derived model (460 females and 493 males; age range, 3-21 years) accurately estimated the chronological ages of the 109 healthy controls in the NAPLS 2 (43 females and 66 males; age range, 12-21 years), providing evidence of independent external validation. The 275 CHR individuals in the NAPLS 2 (111 females and 164 males; age range, 12-21 years) showed a significantly greater mean (SD) gap between model-predicted age and chronological age (0.64 [2.16] years) compared with healthy controls (P = .008). This outcome was significantly moderated by chronological age, with brain age systematically overestimating the ages of CHR individuals who developed psychosis at ages 12 to 17 years but not the brain ages of those aged 18 to 21 years. Greater brain age deviation was associated with a higher risk for developing psychosis (F =3.70;P = .01) and a pattern of stably poor functioning over time, but only among younger CHR adolescents. Previously reported evidence of accelerated reduction in cortical thickness among CHR individuals who developed psychosis was found to apply only to those who were 18 years of age or older.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results are consistent with the view that neuroanatomical markers of schizophrenia may help to explain some of the heterogeneity of this disorder, particularly with respect to early vs later age of onset of psychosis, with younger and older individuals having differing intercepts and trajectories in structural brain parameters as a function of age. The results also suggest that baseline neuroanatomical measures are likely to be useful in estimating onset of psychosis, especially (or only) among CHR individuals with an earlier age of onset of prodromal symptoms.\nJAMA Psychiatry. 2018;75(9):960-968."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "B oth early (prenatal and perinatal) and late (adolescent) neurodevelopmental disturbances are hypothesized to play a role in the abnormalities of brain structure and function associated with schizophrenia. 1, 2 Disturbances originating earlier in life (eg, resulting from the interplay of genetic factors and obstetric complications) would be expected to affect brain integrity from birth onward and could therefore help to explain children with subtle motor, cognitive, and social-affective deficits during childhood and earlier ages at onset of full psychosis (ie, early to mid-teens).\n1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In contrast, disturbances that emerge during late adolescence and early adulthood (eg, via abnormal neuromaturational events and/or environmental factors) could help to explain individuals with normal premorbid psychological health and a more acute onset of psychotic symptoms and functional impairment in the late teens and early 20s.\n1, 2, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Although these 2 sets of processes likely co-occur in at least some cases, in isolation they lead to differential estimations concerning the extent to which neuroanatomical measures can aid in the detection of risk for psychosis prior to onset ( Figure 1 ). 1,2,18,19 Specifically, individuals who are relatively more affected by early neurodevelopmental disturbances would be expected to manifest greater neuroanatomical deviation relative to age-matched peers prior to onset of psychosis, 5, 6 while those who are relatively more affected by later neurodevelopmental disturbances would be expected to be neuroanatomically similar to age-matched peers throughout most of the premorbid period but to show a rapidly increasing deviation prior to the onset of psychosis.\n1, 2, 14, 17 Consistent with the theoretical framework just outlined, prior work has observed a general pattern of greater neuroanatomical compromise among patients with schizophrenia who have a history of early-life risk exposures (eg, obstetric complications) and/or an earlier age at onset of schizophrenia. [5] [6] [7] 9, 20 However, these cross-sectional case-control studies cannot comment on the timing of the appearance or course of the neuroanatomical changes or their potential relevance to estimation of onset of psychosis. To address these questions more definitively, prospective longitudinal evaluation is required.\nHere, we relied on the early vs late neurodevelopmental influences model to guide our set of hypotheses, given that this model makes differential estimations related to the timing of onset of psychosis in association with different trajectories of neurodevelopmental disturbances. To quantify deviation from a normative neuromaturational trajectory on an individual basis, we sought a computationally efficient method to capture variance in a comprehensive set of neuroanatomical measures most sensitive to age-related differences using a machine learning approach. Prior studies using this method have yielded \"brain age\" estimates based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that closely track with the true chronological ages of typically developing individuals. 21, 22 Such a metric has been shown to be highly replicable, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] heritable, 23 and robust to confounders, such as scanner-related noise 24,26 and head motion. 24 Prior studies of adult samples of patients with schizophrenia have applied this framework to show a pattern of accelerated brain aging in the patient groups compared with controls. 25, 27 However, it remains unknown whether greater deviation in neuroanatomical maturity is associated with clinical outcomes in adolescents and young adults with a risk of psychosis. In this study, we generated a neuroanatomicalbased age prediction model using the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study MRI data set, which consists of scans from typically developing individuals across a wide age range from childhood to early adulthood. 21, 30 We then validated the PING-derived model in application to the baseline MRI scans of the healthy controls (HCs) and individuals at clinically high risk (CHR) at the baseline evaluation in the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS 2) sample.\n14,31\nWe hypothesized that the PING-derived model would accurately predict individuals' chronological ages when applied to the scans from the healthy cohort in the NAPLS 2, providing evidence of independent external validation.

However, given the results of the present investigation and the predictions of the neurodevelopmental framework (Figure 1 ), 1,2,18,19 it may be more informative to evaluate age as a moderator in such analyses. To do so, we revisited the longitudinal data 14 and plotted annualized rates of change in these neuroanatomical structures as a function of age at the time of the baseline scan. As shown in Figure 4 , 14,42,43 the differential rates of change in structural brain parameters among those who converted to psychosis apply only to those who were 18 years of age or older at baseline. In contrast, among younger individuals (12-17 years of age), the groups did not differ in the rate of prefrontal cortical thinning or third ventricle expansion.

By design, the fitted model parameters are data driven, characterizing the regularized maturation pattern among brain structures that tracks with variations in chronological age among typically developing individuals. In other words, this composite metric is not optimized for detecting risk of schizophrenia per se and would presumably be sensitive to any condition in which individuals deviate from the normal pattern of age-related neuroanatomical change during childhood or adolescence. However, the regional brain measures that contribute heavily to estimating chronological age in a typically developing population (ie, our top 25 hits as shown in eTable 2intheSupplement) show considerable overlap with key regions in which prior studies have shown gray matter differences between CHR individuals who convert to psychosis and those who do not. 17,48 These overlapping regions include regional gray matter volume measures, including the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, as well as hippocampal and amygdala volume. Training models to predict conversion to psychosis as a categorical outcome seems like an intuitively appealing approach, but we were not successful in building such models using our data set. The performance of such models may be limited by the difficulty in adequately accounting for the backdrop of variation in normative adolescent brain development and the likelihood of heterogeneity in the pathways leading to full psychosis among individuals at CHR. However, it may be possible to increase the sensitivity to outcomes on the schizophrenia spectrum by constraining the spatial topologic parameters of brain age classifiers to brain regions previously associated with risk of psychosis and by incorporating neuroimaging parameters from other modalities. Eventually, the brain age and outcome-based machine learning approaches may be combinable with other clinical predictors 49,50 to provide added traction on the problem of predicting the onset of psychosis among CHR individuals. To further validate whether our findings are in accord with the neurodevelopmental model, additional investigation is required to confirm whether neuroanatomical abnormality among younger CHR individuals is in fact affected by exposure to early neurodevelopmental risk factors (eg, obstetric complications) and/or present with an insidious onset in terms of premorbid functioning."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The brain age approach used in this study captured neuromaturational deviation associated with risk of psychosis only among younger CHR adolescents.

This process greatly reduced the numbers of scans with artifacts and the number of subjects with unusable scans compared to a protocol involving only one high resolution sequence per scan session. Quality assurance checks were performed to verify all steps in the processing stream. Briefly, this process included visually inspecting the scans for ghosting artifacts, \"fuzzy\" gray and white matter boundaries intruding into the cortex, and \"ringing\" artifacts due to motion in the raw images. For post processing quality control, images were excluded based on automated reconstruction for skull strip errors, intensity normalization failures, segmentation errors, white and pial surface misplacements, and topological defects. Images were viewed in coronal and sagittal view for all processing steps. Nearly all scans passed quality control tests without additional intervention, and there were no differences in the rate of passing quality control checks by diagnostic group. For scans with surface inaccuracies, manual edits (i.e., remove, add, or clone voxels; add \"Control Points\") were applied via tkmedit, FreeSurfer's volume editing tool. Total of 13 subjects were excluded due to failing quality control protocol (n=2 converters, n=9 nonconverters, and n=2 controls subjects).

The included measures were: 1) all Desikan regional parcels of cortical gray matter volume (both right and left hemisphere); volume measures were used because they reflect both cortical thickness and area information and show significant age-related trajectories that vary by region; 2) subcortical volumes; and 3) global measures including total cortical volume, mean thickness, and total surface area by hemisphere and intracranial volume (ICV) for global adjustments. See eTable 1 for complete list of predictors.\nApplication of machine learning tools and all statistical analyses were performed within the R software package, version 3.3.2 (R Core Team). For model training, R package 'glmnet' (URL: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v33/i01/) was used. 10 We used penalized regression with L 2 norms (ridge regression), a regularized linear approach, to avoid overfitting. This method incorporates a shrinkage penalty ( ) in model fitting to substantially reduce the variance of the prediction, at the expense of a slight increase in the bias. In the discovery phase, a repeated nested cross-validation (CV) method (10 repetitions X 10 folds each for inner and outer cycle) was utilized to search for optimal tuning parameter Lambda ( ) and to derive unbiased estimates of model performance. 11 For assessing model performance in the discovery phase, estimated age produced by all models generated were averaged. The best performing model was determined based on minimizing mean absolute error (MAE). For the purpose of assessing generalizability and the possibility of overfitting, the final model was trained using the entire PING cohort, with the tuning parameter that was most frequently selected during CV ( = 2)."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Considerations", "text": "Although there are many possible machine learning strategies to consider for building a brain-age model, testing and implementing an exhaustive list of approaches is beyond the scope of this study. However, in deciding which set of machine learning approaches to implement for the purpose of this study, we considered a-priori that a parsimonious model with superior performance in generalizability to external datasets while maintaining interpretability as desirable key features. While computational efficiency and interpretability are clear advantages of a linear-based machine learning method, we also implemented a non-linear method to ensure that use of parametric modeling is not too constraining to explain non-linear trajectories of brain maturational processes over this developmental period. Support vector regression with radial basis function kernel (SVR-R) was implemented as a non-linear machine learning strategy.\nIn terms of feature selection, use of vertex-wise data was also considered to examine whether including Desikan parcellation for characterizing regional cortical information is a limiting factor for capturing the full pattern of age-related variance. In order to reduce high-dimensionality of the vertex-wise data, the brain surface representing cortical volume at each vertex was decimated (down-sampled from 163842 to 642 vertices) per hemisphere and smoothed with 10-mm Gaussian kernel. Consistent with the main methods, subcortical volumes and global brain measures (total surface area, mean thickness, cortex volume by hemisphere, and ICV) were also included in both ROI-based and vertex-wise set of predictors. Pre-processing steps were identical with the main method described in this study. Bias adjustment (eFigure 2) was not applied to fairly compare the results. The results of the tests are summarized in the table above. Based on the internal cross-validation results within the PING sample, using vertex-wise data and SVR-R method yielded the lowest error term. However, when the best performing model for each combined approach was tested on the external validation sample (NAPLS2 HC), incorporating atlas derived predictors (Desikan ROIs) with the regularized linear approach outperformed the other tested models, albeit by a small margin. This suggests that incorporating all vertices may not be necessary to optimally explain age related variance in this age range, probably because each vertex is highly correlated with its neighbors. These results are also consistent with the notion that a high-degree of redundant information in the predictor set could cause the model to over-fit and negatively impact generalizability. In addition, use of pre-defined gyral-based neuroanatomical ROIs (or any other atlas of choice) is preferred over a model that includes all vertexwise information for interpretability and parsimony.\nTo ensure that that increased brain age gap in younger CHR adolescents is not due to an artifact of using the linear method we implemented, we compared the mean absolute error and mean error from the external validation test results (NAPLS2 healthy controls) between the younger group (under 17) and the older group (over 17). As indicated in the table below, the error index with direction preserved (i.e., brain age gap) and absolute error between younger (age 17 and under) and older adolescents (over age 17) were not significantly different from each other. This result suggests that the age prediction model using a linear approach is not biasing the results as a function of age. "}, {"section_title": "Brain Age Classifier Performance", "text": "In this study, we successfully reproduced a neuroanatomical based age-prediction model using a typically developing cohort 2 and externally validated it in an independent sample. The mean absolute error for our age prediction model was less than 2 years in both the discovery and external validation datasets, which surpasses performance of prior models that were applied to schizophrenia patients. 12, 13 The superior performance is likely due at least in part to the relatively large sample size of the dataset used in model training, systematic bias adjustment, and to a narrower age interval focusing on childhood through early adulthood."}, {"section_title": "Predicting conversion to psychosis using neuroanatomical data.", "text": "In the interest of completeness, we also attempted to use baseline T 1 -MRI data to build a multivariate model that predicts conversion to psychosis among the NAPLS2 CHR sample (converters: n = 71, non-converters: n = 436). While building such a prediction algorithm with full consideration of different methodologies is beyond the scope of this study, we utilized several methods that are commonly considered as standard for building classification models with binary outcome labels. We utilized both ROI and surface-based vertex-wise information processed with the Freesurfer software, along with several different pre-processing steps. For the ROI approach, the Desikan atlas was used to extract regional thickness, area, and volume information. Global measures, such as hemispheric mean thickness, total area, cortex volume and intracranial volume, were included. Automatic subcortical segmentation of brain volumes (i.e., ASEG) derived using the Freesurfer software were also included. Please see eTable 1 for the full list of the cortical gray matter ROIs and subcortical structures. For the vertex-wise approach, the cortical volume measure was decimated from 163842 to 642 vertices per hemisphere and smoothed with a 10-mm Gaussian kernel. We did not include vertex-wise surface area or thickness information to avoid the high-dimensionality problem and given that volume is a product of area and thickness (thus both features were already represented). For all models, we controlled for scanner, age, and sex effects in the pre-processing steps. Models with these co-variates were fitted in the healthy control group and then applied to the CHR group to compute residuals. For the vertex-wise approach, principal component analysis (PCA) was optionally implemented as an attempt to reduce dimensionality and discard redundant information. As an attempt to alleviate the severe class imbalance problem (many more non-converters than converters), we also tried applying greater weights to the Converter data points (Weighting) to give more emphasis to the minority class in the model training phase. Support vector machine(SVM) was implemented. As described in the methods, repeated nested cross-validation (CV) method was utilized to search for optimal tuning parameters and to derive unbiased estimates of model performance. An external validation sample to test generalizability of prediction of conversion to psychosis was not available to us. See below for different strategies utilized in the model training phase and balanced accuracy yielded for each approach. The results summarized above are from the discovery phase using the cross-validation method, so it likely that the results have benefitted from over-fitting, yet the models perform poorly. Given that the structural brain changes that are related to psychosis onset occur against the backdrop of the gradual gray matter decline that is part of normative adolescent brain development, including CHR subjects with wide age variation could create a signal to noise problem for this analysis. In addition to this complexity, there is a strong likelihood of heterogeneity in the pathways leading to full psychosis among those at CHR; such heterogeneity would work against the accuracy of machine learning algorithm trained on conversion, which treats all converters as exemplars of a unitary outcome class.\nAdditional challenges of building a predictive model for conversion per se include a severe class imbalance problem (i.e., the number of converters is substantially smaller than the number of non-converters; such imbalance is a notorious problem in machine learning) and lack of external validation sample for testing generalizability of the model developed during the learning phase (independent validation is generally considered a requirement for such discovery science approaches given their propensity for overfitting models in the discovery dataset). All of these eTable 1. List of Factors for Brain Age Estimation Model. We included all available Desikan atlas based regional cortical volume measures, subcortical volume measures, and global brain measures (e.g., mean thickness, total surface area, intracranial volume, total cortex volume) by hemisphere as predictors. As part of our strategy to avoid the high dimensionality problem and for better generalizability (see discussion in the Supplementary Methods: Methodological Considerations), we tried to minimize the number of predictors by including all cortical parcels with volumetric indices as a representation of regional morphometric information, as volume is a product of area and thickness. Age-related differences at a behavioral level were examined between younger (under age 17) and older (over age 17) CHR cases at the time of ascertainment. Compared with the younger group, the older group had a higher average IQ estimate by 6 points (estimated by Wecheler Abbreviated Scale of intelligence), but in both groups, mean scores were within the average range. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical symptoms and global assessment of functioning (GAF) measures assessed at baseline. However, there could be potential differences between younger and older subjects in their route to ascertainment, and there may be potential implications of those differences for their symptoms and developmental trajectories. Parents are more often the route to referral for minors, whereas older CHR participants are more likely to be self-referred. "}, {"section_title": "Predictor Weight", "text": ""}]
