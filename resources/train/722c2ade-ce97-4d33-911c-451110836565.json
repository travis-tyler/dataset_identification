[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In his examination of the salaries and appointments of men and women in academia, the Director of Research at the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) observes: \"Substantial disparities in salary, rank, and tenure between male and female faculty persist despite the increasing proportion of women in the academic profession.\" (Benjamin, 1999) While the evidence presented by AAUP is striking, the gender comparisons of salaries do not control for characteristics that contribute to pay differentials such as academic field or publication record. Likewise, the AAUP combines part-time and full-time academics in its analysis of rank, implicitly no gender differences in preferences for full-time employment. Furthermore, characteristics that affect salaries including publications, field of study, and employer characteristics will likely affect both academic rank and salary. Disentangling the causes of gender disparities in salary and promotion requires an in-depth examination of the relationship between the two. Most studies of gender differences in academic employment outcomes consider only salaries. In a recent survey of that literature, Ransom and Megdal (1993) indicate that the salary gap has fallen considerably pre-and post -1972. Studies using national surveys and including publication information in the analysis, (Ferber and Kordick (1978), Barbezat (1987Barbezat ( , 1989aBarbezat ( , 1989b, Ransom and Megdal (1993)) find that the pre-1972 gap ranges from 12 to 17 percent. The post 1972 gap is narrower, 5 to 12 percent. The literature contains far fewer studies of gender differences in academic promotion. Long, Allison, and McGinnis (1993) examine the promotion of biochemistry doctorates working in academia, who receive their Ph.D. between 1956 and1967. Using a discrete time proportional hazards model, they find that women are 10 percent less likely to be promoted than men. Kahn (1993Kahn ( , 1995 uses the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to compare promotion of academic economists by gender, finding that women take longer to be promoted than men. A study by Broder (1993) explicitly models the endogeneity of rank, department affiliation, and publications. Using data from National Science Foundation Economics Program grant proposal applications, she reports significant gender difference among older cohorts. The gender gap is not evident for her sample of assistant professors. Ziliak (1999, 2001) examine the promotion probabilities of academic economists, finding that women are less likely to be promoted than comparable men. However, they also find evidence that promotion probabilities for women are improving over time. Finally, Ginther and Hayes (1999) evaluate the career paths of academics in the humanities, showing the majority of the gender salary differential in 1993 can be explained by academic rank. Their analysis also shows significant differences in the duration to promotion to tenure by gender. This study uses data on individuals in the humanities from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients in order to evaluate gender differences in salaries and promotion probabilities over time. Our study focuses on academics in the humanities for a number of reasons. First, academia is the largest employer of humanities doctorates; in 1995 80 percent of humanities doctorates were employed by educational institutions compared to 49 percent of science and social science doctorates Henderson 1998, Ingram and. Second, women are more likely to receive their doctorate in the humanities than in the sciences; in 1995 35 percent of humanities doctorates were women compared to 22 percent of science doctorates Henderson 1998, Ingram and. Third, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients contains detailed information on academic productivity (publications) in the humanities. These data are not consistently available for the sciences. Finally, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients contains detailed information on demographic and employer characteristics, along with measures of promotion, and salaries, allowing the researcher to compare academic salary and promotion differentials. Our study finds differences in salary and promotion outcomes by gender using three methods: a salary decomposition is used to examine gender pay differentials. Binary choice models and duration analysis are used to estimate the probability of promotion to tenure. Over time, gender salary differences can be explained by academic rank : the gender salary gap is not significantly different from zero within all academic ranks in 1995. However, substantial gender differences in promotion to tenure exist after controlling for productivity and demographic characteristics. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that gender discrimination for academics in the humanities tends to operate through differences in promotion. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section two describes the data, section three details the empirical methodology, section four evaluates the empirical results and section five concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. The Data", "text": "This study uses data from the 1977-1995 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a biennial, longitudinal survey of doctorate recipients from U.S. institutions conducted by the National Research Council. The SDR collects detailed information on doctorate recipients including demographic characteristics, educational background, primary work activity, employer characteristics, and salary. The SDR has undergone substantial changes between the 1977 and 1993 waves (Mitchell, Moonesinge, and Cox 1998). Technical reports provided by the National Science Foundation have allowed us to construct cross sectional and longitudinal samples with consistent variable definitions over time. 1 We have selected two samples of doctorates in the humanities in order to examine salary and promotion differentials by gender. The first data we analyze, the Cross Sectional Samples, are repeated cross sections of tenured individuals or those on the tenure track for each survey year from 1977 to 1995. To qualify as being tenured or on the tenure track, individuals in this sample must report consistent tenure status and rank (assistant, associate, or full professor). 2 In addition, these individuals must be employed at an institution classified as research, doctorate granting, comprehensive, or liberal arts by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. We also select individuals working full-time with salaries greater than $10,000. We impose these restrictions in order to evaluate changes in the gender salary gap for permanent academic employees. Our second data set, the Longitudinal Sample, includes individuals who receive their Ph.D. between the years of 1975 and 1989 and who meet additional restrictions. This sample is restricted to individuals who at some point are observed on the tenure track while also being in the survey at least seven years after receiving their Ph.D. Individuals are excluded from the sample if they are not observed more than once in the SDR or if they skip more than three surveys and do not report the year they received tenure. This sample is used to evaluate promotion to tenure. Ideally, when using this sample we would estimate the duration until promotion conditional on starting with a tenure-track academic job. However, this is not possible given the biennial design, changes in the survey questionnaire, changes in the sampling frame, changes that eliminate individuals from the survey, and the numerous individuals who skip survey years. We modify the data and analytical approach in order to account for these problems. We construct the Longitudinal sample using information from every year that an individual has a valid survey. Since we do not observe the exact year an individual enters the tenure track, we estimate the duration until promotion to tenure after receiving the doctorate. Using the 1977 through 1991 surveys, we observe the exact tenure year. After 1991, we impute tenure year as the year an individual first reports being tenured in the subsequent surveys. Even though we have to impute tenure year for the later surveys, this is a better measure of promotion than changes in rank because we can only observe rank changes every other year. Time-varying covariates such as employer characteristics, marital status, and primary work activities are measured as the proportion of time an individual is observed in the sample meeting a given condition. For example, the variable proportion of time employed at a top college is defined as the number of times we observe an individual working at a top-tier Carnegie ranked four year or liberal-arts college divided by the total years this person is observed in the survey. Our study focuses on the humanities because the SDR contains detailed measures of professional productivity in these fields, and women with doctorates are more prevalent in the humanities than the sciences. 3 Academic disciplines in the humanities are grouped into the following fields: history, performing arts, philosophy, English, languages, and other humanities. Even though academic productivity is available for those in the humanities, it is measured with error for the purposes of the promotion estimates. When individuals receive tenure, their cumulative publication record is evaluated. We do not observe an individual's cumulative publication record because the SDR only began collecting productivity information for individuals in the humanities starting with the 1983 survey, allowing us to quantify productivity for individuals between 1981 and 1995. 4 In order to estimate the effect of productivity on promotion, we use these limited observations on publications to create average measures of productivity over an individual's career, obtained by dividing the sum of the observed productivity measure by years of experience in the last year observed. In doing so, we assume that an individual's productivity is roughly constant over their career. These average measures of productivity are measured with error and will potentially bias estimates of the effect of productivity on promotion. 5 In addition, assuming constant productivity over an individual's career is likely erroneous. In the humanities, books are weighted more heavily than articles in promotion decisions, and books are more likely to appear early in an academic's career because of promotion considerations. Furthermore, academics in the performing arts tend to exhibit or perform their work and this activity is included in a category for 'other publications.' The other publications category is available starting with the 1987 survey. Although there are problems with the accurate measurement of productivity, omitting this information from promotion estimates will also cause problems, resulting in omitted variable bias. Given the need to 'publish or perish' in academia, controlling for publications and productivity is crucial to our understanding of the promotion process; thus average productivity variables are included in these estimates. Table 1 lists the descriptive statistics for the variables used in the pooled Cross Sectional Samples. Comparing the natural logarithm of real salaries, men earn 10 percent more on average than women. 6 Women are less likely to be married or have children, they have fewer children as well. Women have fewer years of experience and are more prevalent in the lower ranks; they are also less likely to be tenured than men in the humanities. Women are less likely to be employed at universities while being more likely to receive government support. Both men and women report primary work as teaching in the humanities. Men and women are evenly matched in terms of productivity with the exception of reviews, where men write more reviews than women. The three most prevalent fields for men and women are the same: English, languages, and performing arts. Women in the sample take longer to be promoted and are less likely to be promoted than 5 In OLS estimates, coefficients on productivity will be biased towards zero; the effect of measurement error on multivariate probit and duration model estimates is difficult to determine. 6 Nominal salaries are deflated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure implicit price deflator with 1992 as the base year. men in the sample, while having the same number of years experience. As mentioned previously, productivity is averaged over the individual's career. We find a small gender gap in average productivity consistent with that reported recently in The Chronicle of Higher Education (Schneider, 1998). In order to evaluate changes in promotion by gender over time, the Longitudinal Sample is divided into two cohorts defined by the year an individual received their Ph.D."}, {"section_title": "III. Empirical Methodology", "text": "The study begins with an evaluation of the gender wage structure. Wage regressions are estimated as a function of demographic characteristics, academic background, employer characteristics, and academic productivity. The analysis continues by evaluating salary differentials using a salary decomposition developed by Oaxaca (1973) where the salary gap can be characterized as follows: be the difference in average endowments and \u2206\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 = \u2212 m f be the differences in estimated coefficients (salary structure), the term that accounts for the effect of discrimination. In order to interpret coefficient differences as discrimination the researcher assumes that in the absence of discrimination, the coefficients would be the same for men and women and the model must contain all relevant explanatory variables. In equation 1we implicitly assume that the male coefficients are representative of the underlying salary structure. 7 The study continues by evaluating gender differences in promotion using the Longitudinal Sample and two empirical methods. First, we estimate probit models in order to determine whether significant differences exist in the probability of promotion by gender. Second, duration models are used to estimate the conditional probability of promotion to tenure given the individual has survived untenured. Duration to tenure is modeled using the proportional hazards model. The hazard function gives the instantaneous risk that promotion to tenure will occur at year t, where the hazard of promotion h i (t) is a function of the baseline hazard \u03bb o (t) and covariates, x in equation 2. The baseline hazard function is left unspecified and can be interpreted as the hazard function for an individual whose covariates all equal zero. The covariates in equation 2influence the scale of the hazard rate and are not a function of time. Additional covariates used in this analysis include demographic and employer characteristics, employment background, primary work activity, and productivity."}, {"section_title": "IV. Empirical Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Estimates of the Gender Salary Structure in the Humanities", "text": "Our analysis begins by estimating the underlying gender salary structure in the humanities using the Cross Sectional Samples. The data for each year of the Cross Sectional Samples are pooled in order to evaluate the effect of demographic and employer characteristics and academic productivity on wages. We estimate three specifications that progressively add more controls in order to evaluate whether significant gender differences in the coefficients exist, and the relative contribution of these coefficient differences to the pay gap. We take this approach in order to account for the various factors that influence academic salaries. By having a comprehensive list of controls in the salary regressions, we are better able to interpret differences in coefficient estimates by gender as resulting from discrimination. The parameters of interest are reported in Table 3. 8 Model 1 in Table 3 investigates the effect of demographic characteristics on salaries in the humanities. This specification serves as a baseline estimate of the gender salary difference with variables that are not subject to the preferences or performance of the individual. 9 However, the baseline specification omits important factors than 8 All specifications include dummy variables for Ph.D. cohort, survey year, and humanities field. In Model 1 the natural logarithm of real wages is regressed on a constant, age in the survey year, dummies for African American, other race, and a quadratic in work experience since Ph.D. Model 2 includes all the variables in Model 1 with the addition of rank, doctorate quality, employer quality, employer type, government support, and primary work activity. Model 3 includes all of the variables in Model 2 plus marital status, children, and productivity. Model 3 is estimated on a subsample of the data from the years 1989-1995 because children, marital status, and productivity are not available in all survey years. Standard errors are clustered on individual because the data contains multiple observations on some individuals. contribute to salary differences such as the quality of doctorate and employer, variables that proxy for productivity such as primary work activity and government support, and variables that are affected by productivity such as rank and tenure status; these factors are influenced by the preferences and performance of individuals. Model 2 includes controls for the Carnegie ranking of the doctoral institution and employer, academic rank, employer type, government support, and primary work activity because they have a significant impact on salaries. In addition, some important variables are not included in every survey year such as fertility, marital status, and productivity. Model 3 includes these variables, allowing us to evaluate the effect of these demographic characteristics and productivity on the gender salary structure. This model is estimated using those years of the survey that contain all of these variables (1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995). We will compare coefficient estimates across specifications in Table 3 to highlight gender differences in the salary structure. Coefficient estimates for demographic characteristics including age, race, and experience are remarkably similar for men and women across the three models and have the expected signs. When additional variables are added in Models 2 and 3 we continue to see little difference in coefficient estimates. If there are gender differences in these estimates, they are small in magnitude. Both men and women earn less in the lower ranks and earn more after reporting tenure. However the tenure premium is higher for women once productivity is incorporated in Model 3. In Model 2, women gain significantly by working at a top college; once productivity is included in Model 3, working at a top college or university improves the salaries of both men and women by similar amounts. In Model 2 men have a five percent salary penalty for working at a private institution while the penalty for women is 3.5 percent. When productivity is incorporated in the model, the private institution penalty reverses itself for women, who earn three percent more, and is not significantly different from zero for men. Both men and women earn less at liberal arts colleges, however the penalty is three percent larger for women. Women's salaries increase more than men's when they receive government support. Primarily working as a teacher lowers the salaries of men and women by equal amounts in Model 3, while women earn slightly more when working in management. Model 3 includes controls for marriage, children, and productivity. The coefficients on marriage and children are not statistically significant for either men or women. The coefficients the productivity variables are positive, statistically significant, small in magnitude, and quite similar for men and women. Women have slightly larger coefficients on articles and books, while men have a larger coefficient on chapters in books. The estimates presented in Table 3 indicate small differences in the salary structure by gender. Adding controls for academic rank and the Carnegie ranking of the doctorate and employer have similar effects on salary by gender. Productivity has a similar impact on the salaries of both men and women. In the next section the analysis considers changes in the gender salary differential over time."}, {"section_title": "B. Estimates of the Changes in the Gender Salary Gap over Time", "text": "Previous research shows significant changes in the gender earnings differential in academia over time (Ransom and Megdal 1993). We examine these salary differentials by estimating separate models for each survey year using the salary decomposition in equation 1to examine trends in the salary differential over time. We use the specification given in Model 2 and add controls for children and marital status in the years they are available. 10 The average salary gap, along with the salary decomposition weighted by male and female coefficients and standard errors are reported in Table A percent more on average than similarly employed women. This salary differential decreased to a low of 11.3 percent in 1993 and increased to 13.7 percent in 1995. Figure   1B shows the salary decomposition as a function of endowments (differences in average characteristics) and coefficients (often interpreted as discrimination). Between 1977 and 1995 most of the gender salary gap can be explained by differences in endowments. After 1991, differences in coefficients become negative, favoring women relative to men and decreasing the observed gender salary gap. 10 The specification used is similar to Model 2 in Table 3. The natural logarithm of real wages is regressed on a constant, age in the survey year, a quadratic in work experience since Ph.D., and dummies for field of study, African American, other race, doctorate quality, employer quality, employer type, primary work activity, and government support. Variables for number of children and an indicator for children under six are included in the years available. The text indicates whether rank is controlled for using dummy variables or whether models have been estimated separately by rank. Productivity is not included because the data are missing from four of the nine survey years. These estimates are available from the authors upon request. Previous research by Ginther and Hayes (1999) Figure   1A to a high of only five percent for assistant professors in Figure 1C.  Figure 1H shows the decreasing effect of coefficients on the gender salary differential over time. After 1985, the coefficients become small and are not statistically significant. Male full professors have higher average endowments, explaining two to seven percent of the gender salary differential from 1985 to 1995. 12 Similar to previous results reported in Ginther and Hayes (1999) average, if gender discrimination exists in for academics in the humanities it is not operating through salaries. We now consider another source of gender difference in academic employment outcomes."}, {"section_title": "C. Estimates of the Probability of Promotion to Tenure", "text": "The importance of rank in explaining the gender salary gap leads us to examine whether differences in the probability and duration of promotion exist by gender. We begin by estimating probit models of the probability of being promoted to tenure using the full Longitudinal Sample. Our basic specification is similar to that in Model 3 of Table 3 because we assume the variables that affect salaries will also affect promotion. There are some differences in the specification: variables for Ph.D. institution are omitted because preliminary estimates show these variables are not statistically significant in promotion models. We add variables to control for number of employers, and the proportion of time unranked, unemployed, and in non-academic jobs because these variables are likely to have a significant impact on promotion and they allow us to control for breaks in service. 13 These estimates are presented in column one of Table 4. Being African American, working at a private institution, having many employers, being unranked or unemployed, or having non-academic jobs have a negative and significant effect on the probability of being promoted. Being older with more experience, having children, working at a liberal arts college, publishing articles, reviews, books, and other publications over one's career have positive and significant effects on the probability of being promoted. Finally, being female decreases the probability of being promoted by almost seven percent, a result that is significant at the one percent level. In the cohort analysis of Table 4,  The penalty for number of employers, unranked, and time spent unemployed is larger in the most recent cohort. The importance of these variables in the most recent cohort most likely reflects the changing market conditions for humanities doctorates. As competition for permanent jobs has increased, labor market attachment and productivity have increased in importance. Table 5 reports the estimated probability of promotion by gender. The first column of Table 5 reports the difference in the predicted promotion probability between males and females in the full sample and by cohort, using the probit estimates. The promotion gap is eight percent in favor of men in the full sample. This gap is as high as 8.7 percent in favor of men in the 1975-79 cohort and decreases to 7.3 percent in the 1980-89 cohort. The second column in Table 5 reports the linear probability estimates government support; time spent unranked or unemployed. All specifications include additional controls for field of study. The first specification includes controls for cohort."}, {"section_title": "The remaining columns of", "text": "using the same empirical specification given in Table 4. These estimates are quite similar to the probit estimates and can be decomposed using equation 1. These results appear in the remaining columns of Table 5. Using the male promotion structure, differences in coefficients explain the majority of the gender promotion gap, providing some evidence that gender discrimination in the humanities may be operating through the mechanism of promotion. The effect of gender falls by almost two percent between the earlier and later cohorts. However, the analysis in Tables 4 and 5 indicates that differences in the probability of promotion by gender remain."}, {"section_title": "D. Estimates of the Duration of Promotion to Tenure", "text": "Given the importance of promotion as a mechanism for unequal treatment, we now consider whether differences in the hazard rate of promotion exist by gender. We continue to use the full Longitudinal Sample and the two cohorts for our duration analysis. We take an initial look at gender differences in the hazard of promotion using two hypothesis tests in Table 6. Our analysis begins with an estimate of the empirical survival functions for men and women working full-time in academia. The first row of Table 6 presents the test statistics for the log-rank test on the Kaplan-Meier survival curve estimate. We reject the null hypothesis that the survival functions are the same for men and women at less than a one percent level of significance for the full sample, the 1975-79, and 1980-89 cohorts. Thus, without controlling for covariates, the hazard of not being promoted differs by gender. As a second test of differences in promotion, we estimate a proportional hazards model of promotion regressed on a dummy variable for gender. We can interpret the risk ratios in the second row of Table 6 as the effect of being female on the hazard of promotion relative to being male. The risk ratio on gender is less than one and significant using the full sample, indicating that the likelihood in any given year of female promotion is 78.7 percent of their male counterparts. The disadvantage for women is largest in the first cohort; the female hazard is only 76.7 percent of the male hazard--an estimate significant at the one percent level. However, risk ratio estimates improve somewhat for women in the most recent cohort: the female hazard is 82 percent of the male hazard. The above estimates do not account for differences in academic field, demographic and employer characteristics, and productivity. We use the same specification in Table 4 in order to examine the differences between men and women in the duration to promotion to tenure in Table 7. 14 The first model in Table 7 pools both genders and includes controls for demographic characteristics, marital status, children, employer characteristics, primary work activity, and average productivity. In the pooled model, age, children, working at a college, primary work as a teacher, average books and chapters published have positive and significant effects on being promoted. Foreign born, years married, employment at a private institution, number of employers, having unranked positions, being unemployed or employed in a nonacademic job decrease the hazard of promotion. The risk ratio on gender is less than one and significant, indicating that in any given year the female chance of promotion is 20 percent lower than that of their male colleagues after controlling for these characteristics. Controlling for productivity, demographic and employer characteristics only reduces the gender difference in promotion by just over one percent. The second and third models in Table 7  Estimates for the female sample differ sharply with few similarities: the coefficients on age, college, and unemployment are similar in magnitude and direction of the effect for both men and women. However, the coefficients have a larger negative effect for women working at a private institution, the number of employers, being unranked, or having a nonacademic job. Women are rewarded relative to men for teaching and management and for publishing books and reviews. Most notably, having children decreases the hazard of promotion for women. These differences in estimated risk ratios indicate that the hazard of female promotion is not proportional to male promotion. To understand how these different estimates affect the hazard function of being promoted, we estimate a smoothed version of the baseline hazard function for men and women separately. These results are presented in Figure 2. The hazard of promotion is regressed on the covariates in Table 7. Each baseline hazard is evaluated at the average characteristics of men and women in the sample. The estimated hazard function is then smoothed using a nonparametric kernel density estimator given in Allison (1995). In Figure 2 we again note that the male and female hazard functions are not proportional in the full sample. The peak of the male hazard function occurs at 9.5 years after the completion of the doctorate where men have a 0.19 hazard of being promoted. The peak of the female hazard function occurs a year earlier at 8.5 years after the completion of the doctorate, where women have only a 0.14 hazard of being promoted. Even though the hazard rate peaks a year earlier for women, it lies below the male hazard rate in every year. Differences in the peak of the hazard rate may be a result of differences in the quality of men and women who are promoted; promoted women may be of higher average quality than promoted men, resulting in a shorter peak duration to promotion. We can decompose gender differences in promotion as a function of differences in average characteristics and coefficient estimates between men and women in Figure 3. Graph A in Figure 3 shows the baseline hazard estimated using the average male characteristics and the male and female hazard function coefficients. The solid line in Graph A is the same estimate presented for men in Figure 2. Holding male characteristics constant and using the female coefficients lowers the hazard of male promotion by 0.01 at the peak of the function. We perform the same thought experiment in Graph B where baseline hazard is estimated as a function of average female characteristics. The dashed line in Graph B corresponds to the estimate presented for women in Figure 2. Using the male coefficients to estimate the hazard of female promotion increases the hazard 0.01 at the peak of the function. Thus, using the estimated female coefficients lowers the average male hazard of being promoted while using the male coefficients increases the average female hazard of being promoted. Finally, we consider whether the same differences in the hazard of promotion are evident for the two cohorts. Estimates of the hazard of promotion to tenure by cohort are presented in Table 8. We can examine the effect of gender after controlling for covariates in each cohort by returning to the bottom row of Table 6. In the 1975-79 cohort the female hazard is only 80 percent of the male hazard-a result that is significant at the one percent level. In the most recent cohort, the female hazard improves to 82 percent of the male hazard. Controlling for covariates increases the female hazard of promotion by one percent. Results in Table 8 indicate significant differences in coefficient estimates for men and women across cohorts. Coefficient estimates on age, number of employers, unemployment, private institutions, nonacademic jobs are similar for men and women and across cohorts. However, children have a positive and significant effect on the promotion of men while having a negative and insignificant effect for women in both cohorts. Young children have a negative and significant effect for men and a negative and insignificant effect for women. Teaching is positive and significant for women in the most recent cohort. In the 1975-79 cohort chapters in books is the only productivity variable that has a positive and significant effect in the pooled and women samples. Having no publications is positive and significant for men in the earliest cohort. Productivity matters more in the most recent cohort with articles, books, and reviews having a positive and significant effect in the pooled estimates. The increasing importance of productivity is most likely the result of increased competition for permanent academic positions in the humanities. The coefficient on articles and reviews is greater in magnitude for women than for men; the coefficient on books is larger for men than for women, and it statistically significant for men. The top row of graphs in Figure 4 show the baseline hazard estimated using the average male characteristics and the male and female hazard function coefficients. Holding male characteristics constant and using the female coefficients lowers the hazard of male promotion by about 0.02 at the peak of the hazard for each cohort. The bottom row of graphs in Figure 4 show the baseline hazard estimated using the average female characteristics and the male and female hazard function coefficients. Holding female characteristics constant and using the male coefficients increases the hazard of female promotion by 0.01 at the peak of the hazard for each cohort."}, {"section_title": "E. Accounting for Gender Differences in Promotion", "text": "Although gender salary differences in the humanities are explained by academic rank, significant gender differences in the probability and duration to promotion persist and remain unexplained by observable characteristics. If discrimination is a problem for faculty in the humanities, it operates through promotion differences. In order to examine the factors that account for gender differences in promotion, we evaluate differences in the linear probability coefficients and their relative contribution to the explained and unexplained promotion differential in Table 9. 15 One potential explanation for gender differences in promotion is women's preferences for children. Most women are the primary care givers of children, and these choices could affect productivity and promotion. In both the linear probability and duration models estimates presented in Table 9, coefficient estimates on children and young children differ in sign and significance between men and women: men have positive coefficients while women have negative coefficients. Both men and women have negative coefficients on the proportion of time spent with young children, however, the coefficient is larger for men. The total effect of children on the promotion probability is obtained by adding these effects together in the explained and unexplained columns of Table 9. 0.8 percent of the 2.9 percent explained promotion difference is due to children and young children; while at most 4.2 percent of the 5.9 percent unexplained difference (using female coefficients) is due to children. Although the presence of children reduces the probability and increases the duration to promotion for women, it does not entirely explain gender differences in promotion. The bottom panel of Table 9 compares estimates of the gender difference in promotion for the full sample to gender differences in the promotion probability for all men and women without children. Women without children are six percent less likely to be promoted compared to the eight percent difference for the full sample. Children decrease the overall promotion rate of women by two percent. Productivity differences provide another explanation for why women are less likely to be promoted. It is widely reported that women publish less than men (Schneider, 1998). Estimates in Tables 2 and 9 allow us to examine the effect of productivity differences on promotion. When we examine average productivity in Table  2, differences between men and women are small at best. Men in the sample author on average more books, reviews, and other publications, but the average difference never exceeds 0.2. In addition, the duration and linear probability coefficient estimates in Table   9 are larger for women relative to men. Women's promotion probabilities are enhanced relative to men's for each book, chapter, and review published. Using female coefficients in Table 9, differences in publication add 1.3 percent to the explained promotion difference while reducing unexplained differences by 3.1 percent; these effects are smaller if we use the male coefficients. It is important to keep in mind that publications are measured with error in this study, and coefficient estimates in the linear probability model are biased towards zero for both men and women. Thus, productivity will likely have a larger impact on promotion than indicated in this study. However, our results suggest that the promotion rewards to publishing are higher for women than for men. Table 9 includes additional variables that significantly contributed to the explained and unexplained gender promotion difference. Age favors women, reducing the unexplained promotion difference by 15 percent. However, experience is the single largest factor contributing 34 percent to the unexplained promotion difference. The male coefficient is almost twice that of the female coefficient. 16 Women are also penalized relative to men by being employed at private institutions or having a larger number of employers. It could be that women spend more time in adjunct positions prior to entering the tenure track; as a result they would have more employers and work experience. However, Table 2 indicates no significant gender differences in years of work experience or number of employers. Women spend slightly more time in unranked positions, an indicator of adjunct status. The results in Table 9 show that even though women have on average the same years of experience and the same number of employers, they are treated less well than their male colleagues. Presence of children explains at most two percent of the gender promotion difference while differences in productivity have little net effect."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "In their study of faculty salaries and appointments, the AAUP claims that \"substantial disparities in salary, rank, and tenure between male and female faculty persist\" (Benjamin 1999). A cursory examination of the data shows a persistent salary gap between male and female humanities academics over time. However, our examination of gender salary and promotion differences clarifies this finding and calls some of the AAUP claims into question at least in the humanities. We examined gender salary differences between 1977 and 1995. By 1995, the average gender salary difference for tenure-track assistant, associate, and full professors is not significantly different from zero. These results stand in stark contrast to gender salary differences in the sciences. A recent study by Ginther (2001) uses the SDR to examine gender salary and promotion differences in the sciences. Ginther finds large salary differences: in all ranks, men earn more on average than women. This difference is especially pronounced for full professors; female full professors in the sciences earn 14 percent less than their male colleagues in 1995. Why have women in the humanities fared better than women in the sciences? First, there are more women in the humanities. In 1995, 32 percent of humanities academics with tenure or on the tenure track were women, while women continue to be underrepresented in the sciences (Ingram and Brown 1997). It could be that by achieving a critical mass in the humanities, women have also achieved earnings parity with their male colleagues. This explanation is substantiated by the decrease in the humanities gender salary gap over time while the number of women has increased. Second, academics in the humanities earn less than academics in the sciences. Thus, it costs less to pay men and women the same in the humanities. Although the gender salary gap in the humanities is negligible in 1995, the large gender salary disparities reported by the AAUP are most likely the result of grouping all academic ranks and fields together. Men are more likely to have a higher rank and to work in the sciences-both factors that contribute to the gender salary gap. Given the importance of academic rank in salary determination, we examined gender salary differences in the probability and duration to promotion. Our results are consistent with the AAUP's findings. We found small and persistent differences. Probit and duration model estimates indicate that women are less likely to be promoted and take longer to be promoted than men. Separate analysis by cohort shows a slight decline in the gender promotion gap over time. These gender promotion differences are somewhat larger than those reported for academics in the sciences. Thus, if gender discrimination is significant problem for academics in the humanities, it operates through the mechanism of promotion, which in turn has a direct effect on salaries. Although we have pinpointed the variables that contribute to the unexplained promotion differences, it is not clear what factors explain the underlying cause of these differences. Market conditions for academics in the humanities alone do not provide an adequate explanation of the gender promotion gap. In the humanities, there are few employment opportunities outside of educational institutions combined with an oversupply of humanities doctorates. In 1995 4.4 percent of female and 1.7 percent of male recent humanities doctorates were unemployed. These market forces would combine to keep salaries and promotion rates low for humanities doctorates. However, market structure does not explain why women are less likely to be promoted than men. Concluding that discrimination is the underlying cause of the promotion gap requires assuming that we have controlled for all the variables related to promotion, and we cannot do so. For example, we cannot control for the quality of the book publisher or the number of citations an author receives. If women produce lower quality work, this may explain part of the promotion gap. However, limited evidence contradicts this conjecture. Even though women tend to publish less than men, their work tends to be more widely cited (Schneider 1998). Although we cannot control for every possible factor that could explain the promotion gap, in turn, we cannot rule out discrimination as an underlying cause of the gender promotion differences. Taken together, these results suggest a shift in focus on the part of researchers and academic administrators. Researchers need to examine salary differences within the context of promotion instead of quantifying the salary gap alone. In addition, several academic institutions conduct periodic reviews of gender pay differentials. The research presented in this paper suggests that these energies are perhaps misplaced. If salary differences are largely explained by rank-as the results from this sample of humanities doctorates demonstrates-then a thorough investigation of the promotion process is called for. Given limited resources, researchers and administrators should continue to monitor these trends by examining how institutions promote faculty. Furthermore, academic institutions should evaluate the effect of parental leave policies on the promotion of women. To the extent that trends in gender salary and promotion differentials are similar in non-academic labor markets, continued research on the glass ceiling confronting women is warranted."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX 1: Evaluating the Impact of Changes in the Design of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients on Estimates and a Description of Variable Definitions", "text": "The Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is a biennial, longitudinal survey of doctorate recipients from U. "}, {"section_title": "A. Changes in the Sampling Frame", "text": "The SDR is a stratified random sample of the Doctorates Records File (DRF) a census of earned doctoral degrees granted by U.S. academic institutions since 1920. Over time, the SDR survey instrument was redesigned to gain additional information on doctorates in the sciences and humanities. The SDR sampling frame creates challenges in estimating gender differences in salaries and promotion probabilities. The SDR is a biennial survey, thus we only observe an individual's characteristics every other year. This sampling frame poses problems for using time-varying covariates and estimating the duration of promotion. For example, we observe the year an individual received their doctorate and the year they were promoted to associate professor. Since we do not observe the exact year an individual enters the tenure track, we can only estimate the duration until promotion conditional on working full-time in academia after receiving the doctorate. In 1991, the SDR sampling frame was redesigned because of changing policy interests, advances in survey methodology, and changes in funding for the survey (Mitchell, Moonesinghe and Cox, 1998). The sampling frame was redefined to include fewer strata and to impose similar sampling rates across the strata (Brown, Pasquini, and Mitchell, 1997). The sample size was cut in half in 1991 and resources from this reduction were reallocated towards increased response rates. As a result, survey response rates increased from 55 percent in 1989 to 80 percent in 1991 (Brown, Pasquini, and Mitchell, 1997). Given the significant changes in the 1991 sampling frame: \"Analysts are therefore cautioned against forming trend lines by combining 1973-1989 data with 1991 data.\" (Brown, Pasquini, and Mitchell, 1997, p. 8). We take three strategies to address these changes in the sampling frame. First, for the Longitudinal Sample, we choose individuals who receive their doctorates prior to the sample redesign in 1989 and who remain in the sample through 1995. Thus, our estimates of the probability of promotion and duration until promotion are unaffected by the sample redesign. Second, the subsample we select from the 1977-1995 SDR is consistently sampled across the sample redesign. Third, for the Cross Sectional Samples, we evaluate how changes in the sample composition affect the estimates of gender salary differentials reported in this research. We select individuals with valid surveys for each of the cross sectional samples. Table A.1 shows the changes in the composition of the cross sectional samples over time. Table A Next, we consider whether weighting the data are warranted given the changes in the sampling frame of the SDR. Because of the added strata and the changes in response rates pre-and post-1989, the survey samples and survey weights are not entirely consistent across time. We address this problem as follows. First, we select a subsample of U.S. academics that have always been included in the SDR sampling frame. Second, we consider whether ignoring sample weights will bias the estimates presented in this research. Wooldridge (1999) addresses the effect of stratified sampling on linear regression and maximum likelihood M-class estimators. When stratification is based on exogenous variables (as is the case in our analysis of the SDR), \"estimators that ignore stratification are consistent and asymptotically normal, and the usual variance matrix estimators are consistent (Wooldridge 1999(Wooldridge , p. 1386. Third, a simple method that accounts for the effect of stratification on estimates is to include indicator variables for the strata. The SDR is stratified based on field of degree, sex, and demographic variables based on race, foreign-born, and disability status. We include indicator variables for all of these strata with the exception of disability status. Thus, parameter estimates using the unweighted cross sectional samples will be unbiased. Finally, we examined the data to see whether weighting the data makes a difference in the estimated gender salary gap. Figure A.1 plots the unweighted mean and median gender salary gap and the weighted mean salary gap. Between 1979 and 1991 the weighted mean is significantly higher than the unweighted mean and median. In addition, the unweighted mean is significantly affected by the survey redesign between 1989 and 1991. For these reasons, we use the survey weights in calculating the gender salary difference in Figures 1A-1H. For completeness, we include the unweighted gender salary decompositions in figures A.2A-A2H. The weighted and unweighted salary decompositions tell a similar story, however, the unweighted salary gap tends to be smaller than the weighted version.  1987--1995 In order to estimate the effect of productivity on promotion, we impute average productivity as follows; it is obtained by dividing the sum of the observed productivity measure by years of experience in the last year observed."}, {"section_title": "B. Variable Definitions", "text": "Time-varying covariates such as employer characteristics, marital status, and primary work activities are measured as the proportion of time an individual is observed in the sample meeting a given condition. For example, the variable proportion of time employed at a top college is defined as the number of times we observe an individual working at a top-tier Carnegie ranked four year or liberal-arts college divided by the total years this person is observed in the survey. Information on marital status and children also changed during the sample time frame. These inconsistencies in the data make it difficult to control for the effects and timing of fertility on promotions and salary. After 1991, the SDR no longer asked for the year an individual was promoted to tenure. We impute the year of promotion for the 1993 and 1995 surveys when individuals report having tenure. We also impute tenure year for those individuals in the 1977-1991 survey waves when tenure year is prior to receiving Ph.D."}, {"section_title": "Table 1", "text": "Descriptive Statistics: Means andStandard Deviations, 1977-1995 Table 8 Duration of Promotion to Tenure in the Humanities, 1977-1995Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Longitudinal Cohort Samples 31 1975-79 1975-79 1975-79 1980-89 1980-89 1980 Table 8 Duration of Promotion to Tenure in the Humanities, 1977-1995Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Longitudinal Cohort Samples 32 1975-79 1975-79 1975-79 1980-89 1980-89 1980   Years after Ph.D. Years after Ph.D.      1979-1981 1985, 1989-1995 1977-79, 1983, 1993. 1977-1995 Ph  1983, Chapters in Books Chapter in a scholarly book during past two years. 1983, Reviews Book review in a refereed journal during the past two years. 1983, No Publications Indicator for no publications during past two years. 1983, Humanities, 1977-1995Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Longitudinal Cohort Samples Estimated by Discrete Probit Hazard 37 1975-79 1975-79 1975-79 1980-89 1980-89 1980 Humanities, 1977-1995Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Longitudinal Cohort Samples Estimated by Discrete Probit Hazard 38 1975-79 1975-79 1975-79 1980-89 1980-89 1980 Humanities, 1977-1995Survey of Doctorate Recipients, Longitudinal Cohort Samples Estimated by Discrete Probit Hazard 39 1975-79 1975-79 1975-79 1980-89 1980-89 1980 "}]
