Every 5 years, the agricultural census collects information from farm operators on acres operated, product sales and volumes, operator characteristics, and farm finances . The 2007 census contains the latest available data on all farms at the time this research was completed, and it provides comprehensive details on production by SA farms . ARMS, an annual survey sponsored by USDA's Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service, generates a representative national sample of 20,000-22,000 farms and provides additional farm and farm household financial information that is not collected in the census .   "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Is it possible to successfully operate a farm on 10 acres or less? According to the U .S . Census of Agriculture, roughly 294,000 U .S . farms reported operating on 10 acres or less in 2007, the latest year for which data were available for this analysis . For purposes of this report, these farms are referred to as small acreage (SA) farms . USDA defines a farm as any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products (crops and livestock) were produced or sold or normally would have been sold during the year under consideration . USDA's definition does not specify a minimum amount of acreage needed to qualify as a farm, but local government zoning ordinances and State farm support programs may implicitly or explicitly target farms based on the amount of farmland they operate . And for many individuals, a \"small farm\" may be defined more by the physical size of the operation rather than its financial status . While the amount of crops and livestock that can be produced is a function of the amount of land available to produce it on, the relationship depends on the type of product and choice of farming practices applied . Most SA farms generate very little, if any, farm production in a given year . However, based on the Census of Agriculture, 50,000 SA farms reported gross sales of at least $10,000 in 2007, and 3,600 reported sales of $500,000 or more . This report examines the characteristics of SA farms and the operators and households running them, with a particular focus on SA farms with gross sales of $10,000 or more in a given year . USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) has ongoing research that focuses on farm viability . In recent years, ERS has reported on the growing consolidation of production on larger farming operations and the economies of size pushing that trend (MacDonald et al . , 2013;O'Donoghue et al . , 2011), the aging farm population and trends in numbers of young, beginning farmers (Ahearn, 2013), and the role that small (sales) farms play in the agricultural sector  . This report seeks to further this research by examining the role that small acreage farms play in agricultural production, specifically looking at farms that reported having operated on 10 or fewer acres of total farmland devoted to crop and livestock production in 2007 . Increasing farmland prices in recent decades (Nickerson et al . , 2012) have raised the cost of owning and renting a farm of any appreciable size, meaning some beginning farmers with limited access to land and capital may need to start small . At the same time, farm business viability is a function of production and sales, putting pressure on beginning farmers who want to make farming their primary occupation to find ways of increasing production . This report explores how some SA farm operators have successfully managed their farming business on a limited land base . "}, {"section_title": "Farm Characteristics: General and Small Acreage Farms", "text": "Over the last three decades, the size distribution of U .S . farms has changed significantly . Whether farm size is measured by sales or acreage, there has been an increase in the number of smaller and larger farms and a corresponding decline in midsized farms . Production has shifted steadily from midsized to larger farms . Between 1982 and, the number of farms with less than $10,000 in sales (measured in 2007 dollars) in a given year and those with $250,000 or more increased while the number of farms in the middle-those with annual sales between $10,000 and $250,000declined (table 1) . 1 Like sales, acreage has also shifted over time . Between 1982 and, the number of farms with less than 50 acres and the number with more than 2,000 acres increased, while the numbers of farms in all intermediate classes declined . The numbers of farms with 50 to 179 acres and 500 to 999 acres declined roughly 2 percent or more over the period . Among all farm size classes, the largest decline was in farms that had 180 to 499 acres (table 2) . Several factors contributed to this general shift in farm size distribution . Large farms have better financial performance, on average, than small farms MacDonald et al . , 2013) . This provides a strong incentive for farms to become larger and for production to shift to larger farms . Technological advances have increased farm productivity (O'Donoghue et al . , 2011;Fuglie et al . , 2007) . Farms have benefited from productivity-enhancing technologies, such as more efficient 1 The adjustment for inflation is done because farm prices received have risen over time, so a farm with the same quantity of production would have higher sales in 2007 than in 1982 when measured in nominal (current) dollars . The inflation adjustment aims to correct for price changes so that we measure changes in real sales growth over time . According to the Producer Price Index for Farm Products, farm prices rose by 43 percent between 1982 and 2007 . farm machinery and advanced scientific disease and pest control, and more efficient use of productive resources, such as allowed by the use of production contracts . Scientific and organizational improvements enable farms to manage more acres and animals effectively . At the same time, the number of very small farms, those with less than $10,000 in annual sales and/or with fewer than 70 acres of farmland, is increasing (Hoppe and Banker, 2010) . A growing number of people who prefer a rural lifestyle have evidently found ways of acting on their preferences, including acquiring ownership of (or otherwise controlling) small amounts of cropland or livestock . However, the trend also reflects two methodological elements of farm surveys, which contribute to the increasing number of small farms as reported in the 2007 Census of Agriculture . First, the farm definition, set at $1,000 in annual farm sales in 1975, is not adjusted for inflation, so more very small operations qualify as farms over time as commodity prices rise (see box \"What Is a Farm?\") . The Producer Price Index for Farm Products increased by 86 percent between 1975 and 2007 . An operation that had $600 in sales in 1975 would not be defined as a farm in that year, but commodity price inflation would have boosted that same place over $1,000 in sales by 2007, qualifying it as a farm that year . Second, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), USDA's primary data collection agency, has made substantial efforts in recent years to improve its coverage of small farms, and success in this endeavor has led to increasing numbers of small farms in its counts (NASS, 2011) . NASS prepared for the 2007 Census of Agriculture by partnering with community-based organizations and producer groups to improve survey responses from smaller sales farms, including minority farms ."}, {"section_title": "The Small Acreage Farm Landscape", "text": "Farming does not always require much land to generate significant sales . Some farms operate on few acres yet have substantial sales . Almost one-sixth of all U .S . farms in 2007 were small acreage farms with 10 or fewer acres (table 3) . As a group, SA farms controlled approximately 1 . 7 million USDA defines farms very broadly in its statistical programs. Since 1850, when minimum criteria defining a farm for census purposes were first established, the farm definition has changed nine times as the Nation has grown. A farm is currently defined, for statistical purposes, as any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products (crops and livestock) were produced or sold or normally would have been sold during the year under consideration. This definition has been in place since August 1975-by joint agreement between USDA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Bureau of the Census-and the per year sales amount has not been adjusted for inflation. According to the most recently available (2007) Census of Agriculture, just over 2.2 million farms operate in the United States. Approximately 689,000 farms (31.3 percent) sold less than $1,000 of agricultural products in 2007. These operations were defined as farms, even with sales under $1,000, because they received government farm program payments sufficient to put them over the sales threshold, or because they had cropland or livestock assets sufficient to generate sales of $1,000 had the farms produced and sold commodities from those assets. 1 1 If a place does not have $1,000 in sales, a \"point system\" assigns values for acres of various crops and head of various livestock species to estimate a normal level of sales. Point farms are farms with fewer than $1,000 in annual sales but with points worth at least $1,000. Point farms tend to be very small. Some, however, may normally have large sales but experience low sales in a particular year due to bad weather, disease, or other factors. Both the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and the Census of Agriculture use the point system to help identify farms meeting the current definition.    Since access to land is important in farming, farm tenure-how land is held-is a major issue . The majority of SA farm operators in 2007 were full owners (90 percent), while about 4 percent indicated that they were part owners, owning part of the land they operate and renting the rest . The remaining SA farmers were renters ."}, {"section_title": "Small Acreage Farm Sales", "text": "For some products, an operator cannot generate much in sales on a small land base . Indeed, most SA farms generated very little, if any, farm production in 2007 . Approximately 122,000 operations, or 42 percent of all SA farms, reported sales under $1,000 in 2007, compared with 31 percent of all farms ."}, {"section_title": "Women-Operated Small Acreage Farms", "text": "Women are much more likely to be principal operators of small acreage (SA) farms than all farms combined (see figure 1 on page 5). In both the Census of Agriculture and USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (sponsored by ERS and the National Agricultural Statistics Service, or NASS), information is collected on the person identified as the principal farm operator. NASS defines a principal operator as the person primarily responsible for the onsite, day-to-day operation of the farm or ranch business. This person could be an owner, hired manager, cash tenant, share tenant, and/or a partner. Data by gender for principal farm operators was first collected in the 1978 Census of Agriculture. And since the 2002 Census of Agriculture, NASS has also collected data on up to three operators per farm, recognizing that in some cases farming responsibility is shared even though the second and third parties may not be responsible for day-to-day farm operations. Women farmers play a critical role in many farm operations. Most women farmers work with their husbands to help operate the farm. However, some women are principal farm operators. Unless otherwise indicated, this report focuses on the characteristics of the principal operator. Because women are often classified as secondary operators, secondary women farm operators are added to the total count of principal women farm operators as part of the analyses. Women were principal operators of 24 percent of all SA farms in 2007, compared with 14 percent of all farms. They were the principal operator on 19 percent of SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more, compared with 8 percent of all similar sales farms. When principal and secondary women farm operators are counted, women-operated farms accounted for 58 percent of all SA farms in 2007 and 28 percent of all farms in general. Women-operated farms also accounted for 38 percent of all SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more in 2007 and 29 percent of all similar sales farms. In every sales class, there were higher shares of women farm operators on SA farms with $10,000 or more sales than on all similar sales farms (see figure 2 on page 5). Most women operators of SA farms were in the lowest referenced sales class ($10,000-49,999). Similar to all SA farms, women-operated SA farms tended to produce specialty crops such as vegetables, fruit, tree nuts, and floriculture and raise beef cattle and other livestock such as horses, goats, and sheep. Yet, approximately 50,000 (17 percent) SA farms reported sales of at least $10,000 in 2007 (see  table 3), with 3,600 SA farms exceeding $500,000 in sales . To earn over $10,000 in gross sales in a given year, a farm operator has to commit significant resources to farming . For example, in 2007, a livestock farmer would need to have sold 22 feeder cattle at 500 pounds each, at the average 2007 price per animal of $462, to gross over $10,000 . The time and effort needed to handle 22 feeder cattle is significant even on a part-time basis . An avocado producer in South Florida would need to sell more than 27,000 pounds of produce, requiring 3-5 acres of bearing trees at recent yields, to get a minimum of $10,000 in gross sales (Evans and Nalampang, 2012) .

When a farm does not have one product or one related group of products that makes up 50 percent of the total value of production, it is classified as an \"other crops\" or \"other livestock\" operation . The NAICS product group labels are paired with corresponding sales estimates to identify the products of SA farms with annual sales of $10,000 or more, grouped by sales classes . Some SA farms had fairly high sales in 2007 . Approximately 3,600 SA farms, or 7 percent of all SA farms, had sales of at least $500,000 . SA farms with sales of $500,000 or more in 2007 averaged about $1 .6 million in gross sales . SA farms in the intermediate sales classes (from $100,000 to $499,999) averaged roughly $200,000 in annual sales, and those with sales ranging from $50,000 to $99,999 averaged about $68,000 . Not surprisingly, SA farms with $10,000 or more in sales accounted for most SA farm sales but just a small share of total SA farms ( fig . 5) . The 46,000 SA farms with sales between $10,000 and $500,000 in 2007 were primarily active in floriculture, tree nurseries, and fruits and vegetables, while the 3,600 SA farms with at least $500,000 in sales were primarily active in confined livestock production . More than half of all SA farms specialized in three broad product groups-\"other animals\" (primarily horses), cattle, and fruit and tree nuts ( fig . 6) . However, these farm groups combined accounted for only one-fifth of SA sales in 2007 . Most SA sales (75 percent) were in three other product groups-poultry and eggs, hogs and pigs, and greenhouse/nursery-though these products were produced on only 15 percent of SA farms . Farm counts and sales were low for SA farms producing grains and oilseeds-field crops that require acreage and input use not typically associated with small farms .

Floriculture and mushrooms are high-value specialty products (see box \"Selected NAICS 2007 Definitions\" for products referenced in this section) . Floriculture production ranked number one in all SA sales classes except for the largest ($500,000 or more) . Small-acreage floriculture farms can yield high sales because of their high-value products .

Bees can be kept on small acreages because bee colonies are contained in small, portable structures . Farm-raised catfish and other aquaculture are produced in ponds that do not require large amounts of land . As with SA livestock operations, the feed for fish is generally purchased or provided by the integrator/contractor . Livestock dominated production among SA farms in the $500,000 or more sales class in 2007 . SA livestock operations tend to be highly specialized single-stage producers . The animals are typically in confined feeding areas . Feed is produced offsite and is delivered to the farm by the integrator or parent company . All the animals produced under contract are returned to the parent company . Manure is also usually moved offsite and sold or shared with local farmers or the community . Beef cattle in feedlots are also in the midsized and lower sales classes . Stockers may raise calves on seasonal pasture, but some farms feed calves from harvested forages in confined or semi-confined settings . In the latter case, some stocker farms use very little land if they confine the animals and rely on purchased forages .

About one-quarter of all horse and pony farms sold animals in 2007, compared with over 30 percent of SA farms specializing in horses and ponies . Horses and other equine animals are bought and sold for a variety of purposes, including farm work, breeding, and competitive and recreational riding (AHP, 2009-10) . The census data account for riding stables and other equestrian recreational facilities that sell horses and operate like a farm (Offutt and Korb, 2006) . Noticeably absent from the two largest sales classes are SA farms producing \"Other Noncitrus\" fruit . Fruit in this category are produced seasonally and require seasonal labor and substantial initial capital investments, which could be problematic for many SA farm operators . In summary, SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more in 2007 produced a broad array of products, including various livestock such as beef cattle, chickens, rabbits, horses, goats, and sheep . However, the majority of sales were primarily from specialized livestock operations with contracts via a parent company . SA farms also produced floriculture, nursery and tree products, and specialty products such as mushrooms, fish, shellfish, and bees and bee byproducts, such as honey . Because of land and equipment constraints, SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more in 2007 did not produce peanuts, rice, dry peas and beans, and oilseeds and other traditional field crops in combination ."}, {"section_title": "Small Acreage Farm Production and Farm Sector Changes", "text": "SA farm production is influenced by farm sector changes and the subsequent opportunities available to some small farmers because of the growing importance of production contracts in the livestock industry . Structural changes such as larger farm sizes, improved technologies, increased specialization, and vertical coordination between production stages have enabled some SA farmers to carve out profitable niches with certain products, particularly through the use of production contracts and other organizational arrangements . These changes apply to animal and specialty crop production . Production contracts are widely used by SA farms that raise hogs, poultry, or replacement dairy heifers, and by fed-cattle operations . Most hog and broiler production is now done in specialized stages . Hog production can be sorted into four distinct stages-breeding and gestation, farrowing, nursery, and finishing . Females are bred and maintained during the first stage . Birth to weaning takes place in the farrowing stage . In the nursery stage, pigs are cared for immediately after weaning until they reach about 30-80 pounds, when they are sent to the finishing stage as feeder pigs . There, the animals are fed to a finishing or slaughter weight of 225-300 pounds (McBride and Key, 2013) . Traditional hog farms, known as farrow-to-finish, engage in all four production stages and also raise much of their feed . While most specialized hog finishing operations today raise crops and, hence, have substantial acreage, many finishing operations and most operations that specialize in earlier production stages forego feed crop production for onfarm use and have limited land needs . Traditional livestock operations use land to raise feed crops for their animals and often use additional land for grazing and pasture . They raise animals from birth until they are ready to be sold for meat . In contrast, specialized operations focus on a single stage of the production process, typically under a production contract . The production contract is an agreement between a farm operation and a firm (or integrator) that sets the terms for transfer of the products from the farm to the integrator or to the integrator's next production stage, such as raising pigs only from farrowing to weaning, feeding yearling cattle to slaughter weights, or raising broiler breeders for eggs to go to hatcheries (the chicks will then be raised for meat on other farms) . In each case, the animals are typically kept in enclosed areas such as open-air pens, if cattle, or in grower houses if broilers and hogs . SA livestock farms with sales of $10,000 or more in a given year often use contracts to link to a larger, more complex operation . Broiler production complexes include hatcheries, processing plants, and feed mills that are typically owned by firms called integrators . The integrators contract with farmers to \"grow out\" chicks to market weight for meat, produce eggs for chick production in hatcheries, and raise replacement hens for egg production . The integrator provides contract growers with feed, chicks or hens, and veterinary services . Broiler operations almost always specialize in a single stage . While some are large, diversified crop and livestock operations with extensive acreage, small broiler operators may require only a limited land base for two to three broiler houses and storage facilities for feed and manure if the manure is removed from the operation for use elsewhere as fertilizer . Under production contracts, the contractor typically provides feed and young animals to farmers, who raise the animals and are paid a service fee . Because feed is typically produced offsite, animals are typically confined rather than grazed, and manure is removed from the site, single-stage livestock operations do not require much land (MacDonald and McBride, 2009) . Most dairy farms have crop acreage, but a few purchase all their feed . In that case, it is possible to run a dairy farm with less than 10 acres for cow housing, feed and manure storage, and milking facilities . As in other concentrated feeding operations with no cropland, the manure must eventually be removed for use elsewhere, including as a fertilizer and soil amendment on other farms . Not all stages of livestock production are conducive to small acreage farming . Beef cattle production includes cow-calf, stocker, and fed-cattle stages . Cow-calf operations consist of a breeding herd, often including a small number of bulls . Most cow-calf operations are land intensive, with cow herds fed from grazing on extensive pasture and hay land . Stocker operations purchase weaned calves from cow-calf operations and raise them until they are moved to feedlots . Stockers may raise calves on seasonal pasture, but some operations feed calves from harvested forages in confined or semiconfined settings . Some stockers may therefore use very little land if they confine the animals and rely on purchased forages, but most use a considerable amount of land for pasture and for feed production . On fed-cattle operations, feeder cattle are placed in pens with groups of like cattle where they are given grain and special concentrates until they reach a specific size and grade . Most feedlots purchase their feed instead of growing it, so they use land for pens and for feed storage and processing . Small feedlots, with a limited number of pens, need very little land ."}, {"section_title": "Small Acreage Farm Financial Performance", "text": "A farm's financial performance can be gauged by looking at its net farm income and rate of return on equity . This analysis uses data from USDA's 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) instead of the census data used elsewhere in this report . ARMS gathers complete financial information needed for measures of farm financial performance, which is unavailable in the census data . Though small farms in general have negative net farm income, most SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more in 2007 had positive net farm income . Net farm income, however, does not give a complete picture of the profitability of a farm since the expense measure used includes only cash expenses and depreciation and omits the opportunity costs of unpaid farm labor and capital investments . In particular, these omissions can complicate comparisons of financial performance between large and small farms . Large farms are more likely to use hired labor and to incorporate and pay salaries to family members, each of which are recorded as cash expenses . Family labor in farms that are not incorporated does not generate a cash expense; as a result, labor tends to be recorded as an expense in large farms but not in small farms, and failure to recognize this distinction can give a misleading impression of financial performance . Farmers can often earn money by working off the farm-that is the opportunity cost of the hours that they spend working on their farms . Unless a farm is incorporated and the farmer is paid a salary, the opportunity cost of farm labor is not included as an expense when net farm income is calculated . But more complete measures of farm financial performance are available that account for the costs of using farm operator and other unpaid labor . The rate of return on equity-a commonly used profitability measure-is net farm income adjusted to account for unpaid labor costs relative to the equity or net worth (assets minus debts) of the farm (see box \"Calculating Net Farm Income and Rate of Return on Equity\") . It measures the gross rate of return on the farm's invested capital, after accounting for cash expenses and unpaid labor costs . Average rates of return on equity for SA farms varied widely among sales classes in 2007 . Typically, SA farms and all farms with sales of less than $100,000 had negative rates of return-their returns after cash expenses did not cover the opportunity costs of their operators' labor expended on the farm (table 6) . Similarly, both types of farms with sales of $100,000 and over in 2007 had positive median rates of return, although SA farms in the $100,000-$499,999 sales class had a higher median rate of return on equity than did all farms in that size class . Given the negative rates of return on equity faced by many farmers, why do they continue to farm? Farmers may continue-despite low rates of return-if they have a positive net farm income and undervalue their labor and management time or if they derive noncurrent income benefits from their farms (eventual capital gains from holding the farm for years) . Also, they may receive off-farm income that enables them to continue farming, even if their net farm income is negative . "}, {"section_title": "Small Acreage Farm Operator Household Income", "text": "Most farm households receive substantial off-farm income from wage-and-salary jobs, self-employment, pensions or Social Security, dividends, interest, and rent . Combined, these off-farm income flows provide the primary source of income for households operating small farms (those with gross annual sales of less than $250,000), as a group . Only as the farm grows in size (as measured by annual sales) does income from the farm business (farm income, including income from miscellaneous farm-related activities, 2 minus expenses) typically add positively to total farm household income . For all U .S . farm households, median total household income was about $54,000 in 2007 (compared with approximately $50,200 for all U .S . households)  . In comparison, the median farm household income for the principal operators of all SA farms was $51,670-less than the median for all farms but above that for all U .S . households . Though median incomes vary when comparing SA farms and all farms with sales of $10,000 or more in 2007, median SA farm household incomes were higher in all sales classes except the largest (table 7) . Median household income among principal operators of the largest farms was more than twice as high as median household income among SA farms in the $10,000-49,999 sales class . Nonetheless, households operating SA farms in the $10,000-499,999 sales classes had median incomes substantially higher than those of all U .S . farm households with similar levels of farm sales .

It can be viewed as a measure of statistical reliability of the estimate. Any estimate with a coefficient of variation of 25.1 percent or more is indicated in the tables and figures. Note, however, that estimates close to zero-fairly common among financial ratios-have high coefficients of variation because the denominator of the coefficient of variation is small. In such cases, it is misleading to consider the estimate as unreliable (Ahrendsen and Katchova, 2012 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Implications", "text": "Farms can operate as viable businesses on small acreage, but much depends on farm product choices and strategies . Analysis of small acreage farms in this report shows that production strategies, such as contracting, play an important role in livestock production, enabling farmers to operate on limited acreage by specializing in a single production stage . A similar strategy also holds for some specialty crop production, such as floriculture . SA farms with sales of $10,000 or more in a given year produce a broad array of livestock such as beef cattle, hogs and pigs, dairy, chickens, rabbits, horses, goats, and sheep . They also produce floriculture; nursery and tree products; and specialty products such as mushrooms, fish, shellfish, and bees/bee byproducts such as honey . SA farms of this size are not generally able to produce peanuts, rice, dry peas and beans, and other traditional field crops such as wheat as their primary activity because of the land and equipment needed to generate significant sales of such products . Four of the top five specializations for SA farms (ranked by sales) are in livestock production, and the fifth is in floriculture . SA livestock operations typically produce under contracts with larger companies (referred to as contractors or integrators), with SA farmers being paid for raising animals provided by the contractor, often with feed and veterinary services provided by the contractor as well . Despite a nationwide shift in agricultural production to larger farms, small acreage farms with sales of $10,000 or more in a given year are a significant part of the farm landscape . While the majority of small acreage farms do not appear to be operating viable farm businesses, those that do have applied specific production and marketing strategies to achieve at least a modest amount of annual sales, and some produce in excess of $500,000 worth of farm products annually on 10 acres or less . --continued"}]
