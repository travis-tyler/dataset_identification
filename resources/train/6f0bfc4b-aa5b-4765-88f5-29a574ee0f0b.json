[{"section_title": "", "text": "were detected in Wuhan province in China. The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work, we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia. We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome. Our work contributes to global information about transmission dynamics and the importance to take control measures to stop the spread of the infection. reported cases at the time of this report. 1 Near 286 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses, has been submitted to the GISAID database (www.gisaid.org/ CoV2020) collecting genetic information of the outbreak worldwide. The genomic sequences of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from patients share a sequence identity about a 99.9%, 7 suggesting a recently zoonotic infection, originated most probably from bats. 5, 6, 8 As the information appears daily, new insights and concepts are being adopted and implemented. Recently Tang et al 9 and GISAD database in the SARS-CoV-2 portal defined three subtypes: S, G, and V, according to nucleotide variants that produce amino acid changes.\nThese changes are located in ORF8 L84S; S (spike protein) D614G and nsp3 G251V, in the nucleotide position 28144, 23403, and 3471, respectively, for S, G, and V, according to the reference sequence NC_045512.2.\nChile was the fourth country in South America after Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina to report COVID-19 in the region. In this report, we present the sequence analysis for the first four complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Chilean patients. Also, a phylogenetic study was performed with worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences and the full genomes from Chilean isolates, to identify their genetic similarity."}, {"section_title": "| Epidemiological information", "text": "The four cases presented in this report have contracted the infection abroad, either in Southeast Asia or Europe.

SARS-CoV-2 assembly was performed with IRMA v0.9.3 using as reference NCBI sequence ID NC_045512.2. Sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT. The phylogenetic tree was built with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 considering a bootstrap of 1000. We consider 218 full complete genome sequences available in the GISAID platform plus the full genome sequences from the first four Chilean cases.\nwhere the presence of the virus was confirmed and with an increasing number of cases.\nWe identified the SNPs that generates amino acid changes in all four Chilean genomes (Table 1) A maximum-likelihood phylogeny tree was constructed using 218 complete genome sequences plus the four Chilean cases. Our first two samples, the married couple, mapped together (100% nucleotide identity) and with strains from Wuhan, China and Taiwan.\nThe third sample groups in a well-defined clade with Spanish isolates.\nThe fourth Chilean strain, groups in a European clade with samples from Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany. In this same clade, we can identify one of the Brazilian and Mexican isolates, representing isolates from Latin America. In addition, the complete genomes were colored according to the variant groups, defined by specific mutations (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "In this early stage of the epidemic, sharing data and information is crucial and the efforts of the scientist worldwide are admirable. After a few weeks since the outbreak started in Wuhan province, the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was available, and this information paved the way for the development of better detection protocols "}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors are thankful to Mar\u00eda Iba\u00f1ez and Jorge Lobos for their valuable technical assistance."}, {"section_title": "CONFLICT OF INTERESTS", "text": "The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "CAE participated in conceptualization, study design, interpreting the data analysis, methodology design, visualization, and wrote the whole manuscript.
