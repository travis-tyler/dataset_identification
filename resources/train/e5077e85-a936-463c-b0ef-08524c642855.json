[{"section_title": "Overview of TIMSS Advanced 2015", "text": "The study of mathematics and science in primary school and secondary school prepares students to become knowledgeable, productive individuals and contributing members of society. TIMSS is an international assessment of the mathematics and science achievement of students at the fourth and eighth grades in more than sixty countries. Now entering its twentieth year of data collection, TIMSS provides countries with a measure of how well they are preparing their students with the mathematics and science knowledge they need to become effective citizens. However, it also is critical for countries to ensure that capable secondary school students receive further preparation in advanced mathematics and science, so that they are ready to enter challenging university-level studies that prepare them for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This group of students will become the next generation of scientists and engineers who will drive innovation and technological development in all sectors of the economy; thus, it is important for countries to understand the mathematics and science achievement of these students as they begin their university-level education. First conducted in 1995, and then again in 2008, TIMSS Advanced is the only international assessment that targets this specific group of students and provides essential information about their advanced mathematics and physics achievement. TIMSS Advanced assesses these students in their final year of secondary school or, as an option offered in 2015 for the first time, at the start of their STEM coursework in universities. Each country that participates in TIMSS Advanced 2015 gains valuable information on the following: \u2022 The numbers of students and the proportion of the overall student population who are participating in advanced mathematics and physics study at the end of secondary school;"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "\u2022 The achievement of these students based on international benchmarks (advanced, high, and intermediate); and \u2022 A rich set of contextual data on curricula, teaching and learning strategies, teacher preparation, school resources, and student preparation and attitudes that can be used to guide education reform and policy planning in STEM fields. Thus, countries that participate in TIMSS Advanced 2015 can obtain data to help them understand how successful they are at preparing the future generation of scientists and engineers, and what policies can be implemented to support and expand the pipeline of students who enter STEM careers. TIMSS Advanced 2015 continues the series of international assessments in mathematics and science conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The IEA is an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of crossnational achievement since 1959. IEA pioneered international comparative assessments of educational achievement in the 1960s to gain a deeper understanding of effects of policies and practices across countries' different systems of education. As a program of the IEA, TIMSS Advanced has the benefit of drawing on the cooperative expertise provided by representatives from countries all around the world. TIMSS Advanced is directed by the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College.\n"}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Trends and Progress across Grades", "text": "TIMSS Advanced 2015 provides countries that participated in the prior assessments in 1995 and 2008 the opportunity to continue the trend line that shows achievement in advanced mathematics and physics over time.

Across the assessment, each topic receives approximately equal weight in terms of time allocated to assessing the topic. The items in each TIMSS Advanced assessment also cover a range of thinking processes as described within three cognitive domains: knowing, applying, and reasoning. These cognitive domains also are described in Chapters 1 and 2. In general terms, items assess students' abilities to demonstrate their knowledge, apply what they have learned, solve problems, and reason through analysis and logical thinking. The knowing, applying, and reasoning cognitive domains describe the thinking students should be doing as they engage with the mathematics and science content, and are parallel for mathematics and science and across grades, but with different levels of emphasis depending on the subject and grade.

These updates keep the frameworks educationally relevant, create coherence from assessment to assessment, and permit the frameworks, the instruments, and the procedures to evolve gradually into the future. For TIMSS Advanced 2015, the advanced mathematics and physics frameworks were updated to better reflect the curricula, standards, and frameworks of the participating countries. Consideration also was given to current international research and initiatives in mathematics and science education. These updates were discussed by the TIMSS Advanced National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from the participating countries at their first meeting. Each participating country identifies an NRC to work with the international project staff to ensure that the TIMSS Advanced assessments are responsive to the country's concerns. Following the discussion at the first NRC meeting, the NRCs consulted with their national experts and responded to a topic-by-topic survey about how best to update the content and cognitive domains for TIMSS Advanced 2015. Next, the TIMSS 2015 expert group, the Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee (SMIRC), conducted its own in-depth review of the frameworks and worked with the international project staff to use the countries' survey results to further refine and update the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Assessment Frameworks.

These practices include skills from across mathematics and science coursework that students use in a systematic way to conduct scientific inquiry. Five science practices that are fundamental to scientific inquiry are represented in TIMSS Advanced 2015: 1. Asking questions based on observations-Scientific inquiry includes observations of physical phenomena with unfamiliar characteristics or properties, and studying existing data sets in detail. These observations, together with existing knowledge of physics concepts, lead to questions, which are used to formulate testable hypotheses to help answer those questions. 2. Generating evidence-Answering research questions and testing hypotheses requires designing and executing systematic investigations and controlled experiments (including identifying independent and dependent variables). Scientists must use their knowledge of physics concepts and physical phenomena to determine the appropriate approach to an investigation, including deciding on the evidence to be gathered, understanding what instrumentation and procedures are appropriate to use in data collection, and knowing the level of precision and accuracy needed in the data collection. 3. Working with data-Once the data are collected, scientists summarize the data in various types of visual displays. They describe and summarize trends in the data, recognize patterns in the data, interpolate and extrapolate from the data, explore relationships between variables, and determine which patterns and relationships may be worth exploring further.

Therefore, some items in TIMSS Advanced-Physics will assess one or more of these science practices as well as content specified in the content domains and thinking processes specified in the cognitive domains. Because the global community's prosperity and welfare depend on technological development and scientific discovery, it is crucial that the world's educational systems provide students with advanced skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Future leaders in science and technology need to be fully prepared to produce innovative ideas that can spark economic and human development. Recognizing this, countries across the world invest tremendous resources in specialized programs to ensure that at least some students study STEM subjects at the high level through the final years of upper secondary school and have the skills to excel in STEM fields at the tertiary level. The degree of selectivity and intensity of these programs varies across countries, as does the advanced nature of the content. Given the importance that countries place on these specialized programs, TIMSS Advanced collects detailed data on student achievement in advanced mathematics and physics, particularly in relation to system structure, school organization, curricula, teacher education, and classroom practices. These data can inform educational policy makers of key predictors of student learning and point them toward effective strategies for improving the educational system in scientific and technological areas. The TIMSS Advanced 2015 Context Questionnaire Framework establishes the foundation for the background information that will be collected by TIMSS Advanced. The context questionnaires are administered to the students participating in TIMSS Advanced, as well as to their teachers and school principals, and provide a wide array of policy relevant information about the home and school contexts for teaching and learning advanced mathematics and physics. The student questionnaires also ask about attitudes toward learning advanced mathematics and physics. In addition, countries participating in TIMSS Advanced 2015 each contribute information about their provision for advanced mathematics and physics education in their country's chapter of the TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia. Contexts for student learning in the final year of secondary school typically include community, school, classroom, and home environments. Reflecting this situation, the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Context Questionnaire Framework encompasses four broad areas: \u2022 National and community contexts; \u2022 School contexts; \u2022 Classroom contexts; and \u2022 Student characteristics and attitudes toward learning."}, {"section_title": "National and Community Contexts", "text": "At the national and community level, key policy decisions about how to nurture students into STEM careers are made in the context of the cultural, social, political, and economic situation of the country.

Financial resources also provide the opportunity to invest in programs that promote mathematics and physics education and incentivize students to enter these fields, such as special science schools with cutting edge technological equipment or partnerships with researchers in high-tech industries."}, {"section_title": "Organization and Structure of the Educational System", "text": "Some countries have highly centralized educational systems in which most policy-related decisions are made at the national or regional level. In these systems, there is typically a high-level of educational uniformity across the system, in terms of curriculum, textbooks, and general policies. National policy makers can ensure that the curriculum reflects what the national government deems to be essential for the formation of young scientists and mathematicians. In addition, a centralized system allows countries to structure the educational system so that the quantity of students in the STEM pipeline matches the expectations and projected needs of the national economy. Other countries have more decentralized systems in which many important decisions are delegated to local governments and schools. A decentralized structure can result in greater variation in the curriculum, how schools operate, and how students are taught. Likewise, schools and school districts may have more autonomy to decide the number of students admitted to advanced mathematics and physics programs, or the students themselves may have more curricular choices. TIMSS Advanced 2008 showed that differences exist across countries in the number of students in the STEM pipeline. In many countries, there is concern that not enough students are choosing to enter STEM programs (Ainley, Kos, & Nicholas, 2008;European Commission, 2004;National Research Council, 2011; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2008), and there also is concern that women and minority groups are underrepresented in STEM fields (National Research Council, 2010;National Research Council, 2011;OECD, 2008). In this context, some countries have national strategies to promote educational opportunities in these fields. National initiatives include the installation of STEM centers to improve STEM teaching and develop STEM culture, and competitions and campaigns to make science more appealing across society (Kearney, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Admission or Recruitment into Specialized STEM Programs", "text": "TIMSS Advanced examines the educational achievement of the relatively small proportion of a student cohort that participates in specialized programs of study in advanced mathematics and physics. In this context, it is important to understand how students are selected to participate in these STEM programs. In some countries, the number of students studying advanced mathematics and physics is linked to system-level tracking that assigns students to academic or vocational pathways. In the context of TIMSS Advanced 2015, understanding the timing and extent of the selection process is important to interpreting the results. Some countries track students with aptitude in mathematics and physics into elite secondary institutions. In other countries, the top mathematics and physics students attend schools with other students who are on a more general track."}, {"section_title": "Intended Advanced Mathematics and Physics Curricula", "text": "At the senior secondary level, compared to earlier grades, there is considerable differentiation between countries regarding the curricular goals for advanced mathematics and physics, both in how subject mastery is defined and how the curricula specify that mastery should be achieved. For advanced mathematics, countries vary in how much they emphasize advanced content, such as calculus, as well as high-level algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. There are differences between countries on how much weight is placed on expressing mathematics theories, results, and problems in numerical, analytical, and graphical form. There also is variation between countries in the relative emphasis that is placed on communicating and reasoning mathematically, developing mathematical models to describe real situations, and the degree to which various digital computing devices are used and relied on in the problem solving process. For physics, countries emphasize to varying degrees the TIMSS Advanced content domains of mechanics and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics. Some countries stress the practice of physics more than other countries. The use of inquiry in physics teaching also varies across curricula. Other teaching strategies that are implemented to varying degrees include student involvement in planning and carrying out investigations, student involvement in developing and using mental models, and the extent to which students analyze and interpret data. The relative emphasis on communicating scientific theory, constructing explanations, and engaging in arguments from evidence varies across countries, as does the use of technology to support student work."}, {"section_title": "Teachers and Teacher Education", "text": "Considering the complexity of the advanced mathematics and physics subject matter, many educational systems struggle to develop and retain a sufficient number of advanced mathematics and physics teachers to fill the needs of secondary schools (American Association for Employment in Education, 2010; National Committee for the Mathematical Sciences of the Australian Academy of Science, 2006;Schleicher, 2012). The pathway to becoming a STEM teacher differs between countries, but generally the pathway includes advanced coursework in mathematics and/or physics in lower and upper secondary school as well as a university qualification in mathematics and/or physics."}, {"section_title": "Administration of High-stakes Summative Examinations", "text": "Because TIMSS Advanced 2015 assesses students at the end of their secondary school careers, a country or educational systems' employment of summative assessments can be an important educational factor to take into account when interpreting TIMSS Advanced results. These high-stakes assessments, which can be used to determine student graduation and honors as well as placement in post-secondary institutions, may be the focal point for students at this stage in their academic career."}, {"section_title": "School Contexts", "text": "A school's environment and organization can influence the ease and effectiveness of fostering the education of students in STEM fields. Accepting that an effective school is not simply a collection of discrete attributes, but rather a well-managed integrated system where each action or policy directly affects all other parts, TIMSS Advanced focuses on a set of well-researched school quality indicators: \u2022 School composition by student socioeconomic background; \u2022 Instruction affected by resource shortages; \u2022 Teacher career satisfaction and teacher retention; \u2022 Principal leadership; and \u2022 School climate."}, {"section_title": "School Composition by Student Socioeconomic Background", "text": "The collective socioeconomic status of the students in the school can be a strong predictor of the achievement of individual students (Martin, Foy, Mullis, & O'Dwyer, 2013;Rumberger & Palardy, 2005;Sirin, 2005). Attending a school with many students from advantaged backgrounds can have a beneficial effect over and above the effects of a student's own home background. Furthermore, the relationship between advantaged schools and achievement may be influenced by other school factors. For example, in some countries, schools with many students of lower socioeconomic status have difficulties recruiting highly qualified teachers (Akiba, LeTendre, & Scribner, 2007;Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor, 2010;Schleicher, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Instruction Affected by Resource Shortages", "text": "As a means of promoting STEM subjects and attracting students to enter and remain in the pipeline, many countries heavily invest to ensure that STEM schools and subjects are well-resourced. Research has shown that the extent and quality of school resources are critical for quality instruction (Greenwald, Hedges, & Laine, 1996;Lee & Barro, 2001;Lee & Zuze, 2011). These may include resources as basic as well-trained teachers, or adequate classroom space and school facilities (Schneider, 2002). Results from TIMSS 2011 at the fourth and eighth grades indicate that students in schools that are sufficiently resourced generally have higher achievement than those at schools where resource shortages affect the capacity to implement the curriculum. Subject-specific resources for advanced mathematics and physics may include availability of a variety of computing devises (e.g., tablets and graphing calculators), software for educational games and simulations, and laboratory equipment for physics experiments."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Career Satisfaction and Teacher Retention", "text": "TIMSS Advanced 2008 results revealed that, in some countries, a high percentage of teachers were nearing retirement age and that there were concerns about having enough teachers qualified in these advanced subject areas to replace them. From a school leadership perspective, it is important to encourage qualified teachers in advanced mathematics and physics to stay in the profession by providing good working conditions and fostering teacher career satisfaction. The transition from university to a school teaching position can be difficult for teachers. Consequently, in many countries a large percentage of new teachers leave the profession after only a few years of teaching (Australian Primary Principals' Association, 2007;Guarino, Santiba\u00f1ez, & Daley, 2006;Hancock & Scherff, 2010). The extent to which schools take an active role in the acculturation and transition of new teachers may be important for maintaining a stable teaching force. Mentoring programs, modeling of good teacher practice by peers, and induction programs designed by experienced teachers within the school may be important aids to the beginning teacher (Moskowitz & Stephens, 1997;Tillmann, 2005). Nevertheless, because there may be only one physics teacher in a small or medium-sized school, the implementation of subject-specific physics mentoring programs, as well as other subject-specific collaboration programs, may not be possible in many schools (Tesfaye & White, 2012). Providing good working conditions for STEM teachers also is essential to teacher retention. A manageable workload, adequate facilities, and the availability of instructional materials are important ingredients to fostering productive working conditions and promoting teacher satisfaction (Johnson, 2006;Johnson, Kraft, & Papay, 2012). Important social factors in a school that can affect teacher career satisfaction include a positive school culture, collaboration among teaching staff, and the leadership of the principal (Johnson et al., 2012). Teacher collaboration, in particular, has been found to be associated with increased student learning (Goddard, Goddard, & Tschannen-Moran, 2007;Wheelan & Kesselring, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Principal Leadership", "text": "A characteristic of a successful principal is being able to articulate the mission of the school (Witziers, Bosker, & Kr\u00fcger, 2003). As such, a principal makes important decisions about the relative emphasis that is placed on STEM education within the school. Principals can foster a culture that emphasizes STEM education by hiring well-qualified teachers in advanced mathematics and physics, promoting their professional development, offering an advanced curricula in technological areas, and organizing activities such as contests and exchanges that promote student interest in studying STEM subjects. In addition, successful principals often are involved in guiding the teaching process as instructional leaders and ensuring that teachers receive the necessary training and development to produce high achievement among the students (Robinson, Lloyd, & Rowe, 2008). Within the constraints of the educational system, it is often the principal's responsibility to ensure that instructional time, and in particular the time devoted to advanced mathematics and physics, is sufficient for the purposes of curriculum implementation."}, {"section_title": "School Climate", "text": "One of the principal's central duties is maintaining a safe, orderly, and disciplined school. Results from TIMSS Advanced 2008 showed that there was not much concern about discipline or safety problems at schools for students in these specialized programs. Respect among individual students and teachers as well as constructive interactions among administrators, teachers, parents, and students, all contribute to this positive school climate and lead to higher student achievement (Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, & Pickeral, 2009;Konishi, Hymel, Zumbo, & Li, 2010). A socially welcoming school environment and friendships with classmates also can foster a sense of belonging (Goodenow & Grady, 1993;Hamm & Faircloth, 2005;Juvonen, 2007). Teachers can promote a sense of belonging for students by fostering supportive teacher-student relationships (Cornelius-White, 2007;Marzano, Marzano, & Pickering, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Contexts", "text": "Because most of the teaching and learning in school takes place in the classroom, STEM learning is influenced by the classroom environment and instructional activities. TIMSS Advanced 2015 focuses on the following factors that impact teaching and learning: "}, {"section_title": "Teacher Preparation and Experience", "text": "The preparation and competence of teachers is critical (Darling-Hammond, 2000;Hill, Rowan, & Ball, 2005), especially given the advanced content knowledge and pedagogical training required to teach advanced mathematics or physics. Prospective teachers need coursework to gain advanced content knowledge in these subjects, to understand about how students learn, and to develop and implement pedagogy for engaging students in the learning process. With appropriate coursework, teachers can gain the competence necessary to teach these subject areas confidently and spark student interest in them (OECD, 2006). Content-focused professional development is especially important for fostering student achievement in advanced mathematics and physics. Professional development through seminars, workshops, conferences, and professional journals can help teachers increase their effectiveness and broaden their knowledge (Blank & de las Alas, 2009;Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, & Shapley, 2007), as well as expose teachers to recent developments within the STEM fields (OECD, 2008). In addition to preservice education and training, teaching experience is essential, and the first years of teaching experience are especially important for teacher professional development (Harris & Sass, 2011;Leigh, 2010). However, research also has found that teachers continue to develop after five years of experience, and that this development can positively affect student achievement (Harris & Sass, 2011). With education, training, and experience, teachers should feel prepared and confident to teach advanced mathematics and physics topics. Research has shown teachers' confidence in their teaching skills to be associated with increased student motivation and student learning (Bandura, 1997;Caprara, Barbaranelli, Steca, & Malone, 2006;Henson, 2002;OECD, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS Advanced 2015 Mathematics and Physics Topics Taught", "text": "A major focus of the implemented curriculum is the extent to which the advanced mathematics and physics topics in the TIMSS Advanced 2015 frameworks are covered in the classroom. TIMSS Advanced addresses this question by asking advanced mathematics and physics teachers of the participating students to indicate whether each of the topics tested has been covered in class in current or previous years, as well as the percentage of time in class devoted to each of the TIMSS Advanced 2015 content domains."}, {"section_title": "Classroom Instructional Resources and Technology", "text": "Improvements in the functionality and availability of a wide range of computing devices (e.g. tablets, calculators, and smartphones) have increased the potential for incorporating technology within advanced mathematics and physics instruction. Teachers' decisions to use technology in the classroom can result from their beliefs, attitudes, and comfort levels, as well as access to training and materials (Mueller, Wood, Willoughby, Ross, & Specht, 2008;Russell, Bebell, O'Dwyer, & O'Connor, 2003). How best to incorporate technology into the classroom and what role technology should have in advanced mathematics and physics instruction continue to be questions of importance to advanced mathematics and physics curricula specialists and teachers. For example, in TIMSS Advanced 2008, calculator use in advanced mathematics and physics instruction varied widely among, and even within, countries, as did the type of calculators that were used. Research on graphing calculators has concluded that these devices aid students in gaining conceptual understanding of the content, and the gains from using a graphing calculator are maximized when calculators are employed both in instruction and testing (Ellington, 2006). However, with the increasing functionality and accessibility of digital devices such as computers, tablets, and smart phones, the use of handheld graphing calculators may be decreasing as students increasingly use applications to perform the calculations once done only on a calculator. Computers, including tablets such as iPads, and the Internet provide students tools to explore physics and advanced mathematics concepts in depth. Computers are used in a variety of ways, including tutorials, simulations, and educational games. Applications for modeling and visualization can aid students in grasping the abstract concepts of advanced mathematics and physics. Computer applications also can aid students in conducting simulations. For these various technologies to be integrated effectively into instruction, teachers must feel comfortable using them and receive adequate technical and pedagogical support. Nonetheless, research has confirmed the positive effects of computer technology use in the classroom on student learning (Li & Ma, 2010;Liao & Chen, 2007;Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami, & Schmid, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Instructional Time", "text": "At the school level, the relative emphasis and amount of time specified for advanced mathematics and physics can affect students' opportunities to learn. Results from TIMSS Advanced 2008 show that there is variation between countries in the intended instructional time prescribed by the curriculum and the actual time of implementation in the classroom. In some countries, the advanced mathematics or physics programs of study are highly specialized, and students receive almost exclusive instruction in these subjects and related fields. In other countries, students take advanced mathematics and/or physics in addition to a general course load that includes instruction in the arts, humanities (national language(s), foreign language(s)) and social sciences (government, social studies), among other subjects."}, {"section_title": "Instructional Engagement", "text": "In order to learn the complex concepts in subjects like advanced mathematics and physics, students need to actively engage with the content. According to McLaughlin et al. (2005), student content engagement focuses the student's \"in-the-moment\" cognitive interaction with the content. \"Learning occurs through the cognitive engagement of the learner with the appropriate subject matter knowledge\" (McLaughlin et al., 2005, p.5). Engagement can take place when students listen to the teacher, conduct lab experiments, or solve a mathematics problem. Engagement has been conceptualized as the idea that a student's \"in-the-moment\" mindset is torn between meaningful involvement with instruction and distractions that are unrelated to the topics in the class (Yair, 2000). The challenge for the teacher is to use effective methods of instruction to maintain student engagement in the content, activating the students cognitively Lipowsky et al., 2009). Although lectures can be an integral part of advanced mathematics and physics instruction, effective teachers also ensure that students are actively involved in their own learning process. Active involvement can occur when students are working individually or with their peers (Shernoff, Csikszentmihalyi, Schneider, & Shernoff, 2003;Yair, 2000). Peer-tutoring, smallgroup work, and peer mentoring are effective strategies that promote student engagement and are linked to achievement (Hattie, 2009;Springer, Stanne, & Donovan, 1999). In order for advanced mathematics and physics students to grasp difficult content, it is important that teachers link the new material and concepts to the students' prior knowledge and understanding (Kleime et al., 2009;McLaughlin et al., 2005). Students also are more engaged when they are challenged and face greater cognitive demands (Shernoff et al., 2003;Yair, 2000). However, with the complexity of the content covered in these advanced subjects, it is important that the teacher conveys to the students that the challenges of the tasks are attainable. In this respect, effective teaching is setting challenging yet attainable goals for each student and supporting the students in reaching the goals (Hattie 2009;Klein, Wesson, Hollenbeck, & Alge, 1999). In setting goals, it is important that students understand the process of achievement, what outcome is expected, and why the goal is important for the learning process (Hattie, 2009;Martin, 2006). STEM teachers have an important role, not only to foster student learning in the classroom, but also to act as ambassadors for these career paths (OECD, 2006(OECD, , 2008. Many countries face the problem that students decide to leave STEM fields to study other subjects during their upper secondary or undergraduate education. An inspiring teacher who can model enthusiasm for STEM fields of study can convey the idea that STEM careers can offer interesting and fruitful career options."}, {"section_title": "Student Characteristics and Attitudes Toward Learning", "text": "In order to better understand the factors that support and motivate students studying advanced mathematics and physics, it is important to collect information about the students' background characteristics and their attitudes toward mathematics and physics.

Students participating in these specialized programs tend to have a high level of motivation to excel in school, although their intent to continue on toward careers in STEM fields varies considerably. The source of academic motivation and how it can be facilitated within the school, classroom, and home have been recurrent areas of research (Bandura, 1997;Csikszentmihalyi, 1990;Deci & Ryan, 1985). Intrinsic motivation is an \"energizer of behavior\" (Deci & Ryan, 1985, p.32), and as such tends to be strongly related to student achievement and career choice. Students who are intrinsically motivated to learn mathematics or physics find the subject to be interesting and enjoyable (Deci & Ryan, 1985). Nevertheless, not all students have a penchant for studying advanced mathematics or physics. A common strategy to recruit students into these fields is to instill motivation into students by advising them of the career options available for engineers, scientists, and mathematicians. Extrinsic motivation refers to the drive that comes from external rewards like praise, career success, money, and other incentives. However, while extrinsic rewards can entice students to study and even excel in STEM fields, research shows that intrinsic motivation is more closely related to achievement than extrinsic motivation (Becker, McElvany, & Kortenbruck, 2010;Vansteenkiste, Timmermans, Lens, Soenens, & Van den Broeck, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Expectations for Educational Attainment", "text": "Students who excel in highly quantitative subjects, such as advanced mathematics and physics, generally have high expectations for their educational attainment, and these expectations drive them to persist through the rigors posed by challenging mathematical and scientific content.

In addition to being predictors of student achievement, socioeconomic characteristics provide important insight into the factors influencing students entering the STEM pipeline, and to issues of access to STEM programs generally within countries. Because these students are in a specialized educational program, identifying their home background characteristics can facilitate countries in identifying underrepresented subpopulations in the STEM pipeline as well as achievement gaps among students taking these advanced courses."}, {"section_title": "Home Use of Language(s) of Instruction", "text": "Language fluency can be an obstacle to participation in STEM pipeline programs (Airey & Linder, 2006;Gasbarra & Johnson, 2008).

Some students enroll in these programs to keep pace with the class, and they find the support provided to be critical for understanding the complex material covered in these courses (Baker, Akiba, LeTendre, & Wiseman, 2001). Students also enroll in shadow education programs with the goal of mastering the curriculum in order to excel in school or to do well on a high-stakes examination (Bray, 2007;Buchman, Condron, & Roscigno, 2010), especially in circumstances where students compete for limited opportunities in select educational programs (Baker & LeTendre, 2005).

The assessment comprises written tests in advanced mathematics and physics together with sets of questionnaires that gather information on the educational and social contexts for achievement at the end of secondary schooling. First administered in 1995 and again in 2008, TIMSS Advanced 2015 continues this trend line for those countries that participated in prior assessments, with each assessment linked to the next. Significantly in 2015, and for the first time since 1995, TIMSS Advanced will be administered in the same year as the fourth and eighth grade TIMSS assessments of mathematics and science; this will enable countries participating at all three levels (the fourth grade, the eighth grade, and at the end of secondary school) to collect data on student achievement in mathematics and science spanning the entire primary and secondary education system. As described in the advanced mathematics and physics assessment frameworks (Chapters 1 and 2, respectively), the TIMSS Advanced assessments are wide ranging in their coverage of these subjects; the assessments are designed to provide valid and reliable information on the full range of student proficiency in each subject, as well as in the major content and cognitive domains. A consequence of the TIMSS Advanced reporting goals is that the assessments require more assessment items than can reasonably be given to a student in the available testing time. Accordingly, TIMSS Advanced 2015 uses a matrix-sampling approach that assembles the pool of achievement items in advanced mathematics and physics into a set of 12 assessment booklets-6 advanced mathematics, and 6 physics booklets-with each student completing one booklet only. Each item appears in two booklets, providing a mechanism for linking the student responses from the various booklets. Booklets are distributed among sampled students so that the groups of students responding to each booklet are approximately equivalent in terms of student ability."}, {"section_title": "Student Populations Assessed", "text": "TIMSS Advanced assesses the advanced mathematics and physics achievement of students in the final year of secondary schooling. This is the twelfth year of formal schooling in most countries. The target populations for the TIMSS Advanced assessments are defined as follows: For advanced mathematics, all students in the final year of secondary schooling who are taking advanced mathematics courses. For physics, all students in the final year of secondary schooling who are taking physics courses. Student eligibility is determined in terms of the courses the student has taken and, in countries with tracked educational systems, the track to which the student belongs. The decision as to which mathematics or physics courses should be included in defining the target population is determined by each participating country. In general, the courses included should be those taken by the most advanced students, typically those students planning further study in mathematics or physics at university or other institutes of higher education. Courses should cover most of the advanced mathematics and physics content topics specified in Chapters 1 and 2 of the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Assessment Frameworks. Depending on their course experience, students in the final year of secondary schooling may belong to the advanced mathematics target population, the physics target population, or both. Students who belong to both populations will be randomly assigned either an advanced mathematics booklet or a physics booklet. Reporting Student Achievement TIMSS Advanced 2015 will provide a detailed picture of the achievement of advanced mathematics and physics students in the final year of secondary school in each participating country. This will include achievement in each of the content and cognitive domains (as defined in Chapters 1 and 2) as well as overall advanced mathematics and physics achievement. Consistent with the goal of providing valid and reliable information on the full range of student proficiency in each subject, the complete TIMSS Advanced 2015 assessment consists of a large pool of advanced mathematics and physics questions, known as items. However, in order to keep the assessment burden on any one student to a minimum, each student is presented with only a sample of the items, as described in the next section. Following data collection, student responses are placed on common advanced mathematics and physics scales in order to provide an overall picture of the assessment results for each country. One of the strengths of TIMSS Advanced is its measurement of trends over time in advanced mathematics and physics achievement. The TIMSS Advanced achievement scales provide a common metric on which countries can compare the progress of their student populations in advanced mathematics and physics from assessment to assessment. The TIMSS Advanced achievement scales were established in 1995, separately for advanced mathematics and physics, so that 100 points on the scale was equal to one standard deviation across all of the countries that participated in TIMSS 1995, and the scale midpoint of 500 was equal to the international average across those countries. Using items that were administered in both 1995 and 2008 assessments as a basis for linking the two sets of assessment results, the TIMSS Advanced 2008 data also were placed on the scale so that countries could gauge changes in students' advanced mathematics and physics achievement since 1995. Using similar procedures, the data from TIMSS Advanced 2015 will be placed on the TIMSS Advanced scales, enabling TIMSS Advanced 2015 countries that have participated in previous assessments to have comparable achievement data from 1995, 2008, and 2015, and to plot changes in performance over this 20-year period. As previously mentioned, in addition to the achievement scales for advanced mathematics and physics overall, TIMSS Advanced 2015 includes scales for reporting relative student performance in each of the advanced mathematics and physics content and cognitive domains. Specifically, in advanced mathematics there are three content scales, corresponding to three content domains: algebra, calculus, and geometry. Similarly, in physics there are also three content scales, corresponding to three content domains: mechanics and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and wave phenomena and atomic/nuclear physics. The TIMSS Advanced 2015 Assessment Frameworks specify three cognitive domains-knowing, applying, and reasoning-which span the content of both advanced mathematics and physics, and for which reporting scales are constructed."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS Advanced 2015 Student Booklet Design", "text": "A consequence of the ambitious reporting goals of TIMSS Advanced is that many more items are required for the assessment than can be answered by any one student in the available testing time. In order to address this challenge, TIMSS Advanced 2015 uses a matrix-sampling approach: the entire assessment pool of advanced mathematics and physics items are packaged into a set of 6 advanced mathematics booklets and 6 physics booklets, with each student completing just one booklet. Each item appears in two booklets, providing a mechanism for linking together the student responses from the various booklets. Booklets are distributed randomly among students in participating classrooms so that the groups of students completing each booklet are approximately equivalent in terms of ability. TIMSS Advanced uses item response theory scaling methods in order to assemble a comprehensive picture of the achievement of a country's student population by pooling individual students' responses to the booklets that they are assigned. This approach reduces to manageable proportions what otherwise would be an impossible student burden, albeit at the cost of greater complexity in booklet assembly, data collection, and data analysis. In order to facilitate the process of creating the student achievement booklets, TIMSS Advanced groups the assessment items into a series of item blocks, with each item block consisting of approximately 10 items and requiring 30 minutes of assessment time. As far as possible, within each block the distribution of items across content and cognitive domains matches the distribution across the overall item pool. TIMSS Advanced 2015 consists of 18 item blocks in total: 9 blocks of advanced mathematics items, and 9 blocks of physics items. This represents an increase of 4 blocks over the 14 blocks that formed the basis of TIMSS Advanced 2008. The additional item blocks were added in order to provide more extensive coverage of the content and cognitive domains. Student booklets for advanced mathematics and physics are assembled from various combinations of these item blocks. Following the 2008 assessment, three of the advanced mathematics item blocks and three of the physics blocks were retained and kept secure for use in measuring trends in 2015. The remaining 8 blocks (4 advanced mathematics, and 4 physics) were released into the public domain for use in publications, research, and teaching, to be replaced by newly-developed items for the TIMSS Advanced 2015 assessment. Accordingly, the 18 blocks in the TIMSS Advanced 2015 assessment comprise 6 blocks of trend items (3 advanced mathematics, and 3 physics) and 12 blocks of items newly developed for 2015. As presented in Exhibit 3, the TIMSS Advanced 2015 advanced mathematics blocks are labeled M1 through M9, and the physics blocks P1 through P9. Students are expected to spend, on average, 30 minutes on each item block. Consequently, the 9 blocks of advanced mathematics items are estimated to contain 4\u00bd hours of testing time, and the physics blocks a further 4\u00bd hours. From past experience with TIMSS Advanced, National Research Coordinators from participating countries agreed that the testing time for any one student should not be increased from previous assessments; thus, as in the past, the assessment time for each student booklet (advanced mathematics or physics) must fit into 90 minutes. An additional 30 minutes for a student questionnaire also is required. In choosing how to distribute item blocks across student achievement booklets, the major goal was to maximize coverage of the framework while ensuring that every student responded to sufficient items in order to provide reliable measurement of trends in both advanced mathematics and physics. A further goal was to ensure that achievement in the advanced mathematics and physics content and cognitive domains could be measured reliably. In order to enable linking among booklets while keeping the number of booklets to a minimum, each item block appears in two booklets. As presented in Exhibit 4, the 18 assessment item blocks are distributed across 12 student achievement booklets. Booklets 1 through 6 contain advanced mathematics items, and Booklets 7 through 12 contain physics items. Each student booklet consists of three item blocks. Countries participating in TIMSS Advanced aim for a sample of approximately 3,600 advanced mathematics students and the same number of physics students in order to ensure that there are enough respondents for each item. In classes where all students belong to both the advanced mathematics and physics populations, all 12 student booklets are distributed among the students according to a predetermined random order, so that approximately equal proportions of students respond to each booklet. In classes containing only students from the advanced mathematics population, only the six advanced mathematics booklets are distributed. Similarly, in classes with physics students, only the physics booklets are distributed."}, {"section_title": "Question Types and Scoring Procedures", "text": "Students' knowledge and understanding of mathematics and science are assessed through a range of questions in each subject. As described in the TIMSS 2015 Item Writing Guidelines , two question (i.e., item) formats are used in the TIMSS Advanced assessments: multiple-choice and constructed-response. At least half of the total number of points represented by all of the items will come from multiple-choice items. Each multiple-choice item is worth one score point. Constructed-response items generally are worth one or two score points, depending on the nature of the task and the skills required to complete the item. In developing assessment items, the choice of item format depends on the mathematics or physics being assessed as well as the format that best enables students to demonstrate their proficiency."}, {"section_title": "Multiple-choice Items", "text": "In TIMSS, multiple-choice items provide students with four response options, of which only one is correct. These items can be used to assess any of the behaviors in the cognitive domains. Multiple-choice items allow valid, reliable, and economical measurement of a wide range of content in a relatively short testing time. However, because they do not allow for students' explanations or supporting statements, these items may be less suitable for assessing students' ability to make more complex interpretations or evaluations. In developing the multiple-choice items, it is important that the questions and response options are written clearly and concisely in order to minimize the reading load of the question. The options that are incorrect are written to be plausible, but not deceptive. For students who may be unfamiliar with this test question format, the instructions given at the beginning of the test include a sample multiplechoice item that illustrates how to select and mark an answer."}, {"section_title": "Constructed-response Items", "text": "For this type of test item students are required to construct a written response, rather than select a response from a set of options. Because these items allow students to provide explanations, support an answer with reasons or numerical evidence, draw diagrams, or display data, constructed-response items are particularly well-suited for assessing aspects of knowledge and skills that require students to explain phenomena or interpret data based on their background knowledge and experience. The scoring guide for each constructed-response item describes the essential features of appropriate and complete responses. The guides focus on evidence of the type of behavior the item assesses. They describe evidence of partially correct and completely correct responses. In addition, sample student responses at each level of understanding provide important guidance to those who will be rating the students' responses. In scoring students' responses to constructed-response items, the focus is solely on students' achievement with respect to the topic being assessed, not on their ability to write well. However, students need to communicate in a manner that will be clear to those scoring their responses. In addition, scoring guides are designed to enable, for each item, identification of the various successful, partially successful, and unsuccessful approaches. Diagnosis of common learning difficulties in advanced mathematics and physics as evidenced by misconceptions and errors is an important aim of the study. Because constructed-response items constitute an important component of the TIMSS Advanced assessment and are an integral part of the measurement of trends, it is very important for scoring guides to be implemented consistently in all countries and in each data collection year. In order to ensure consistent application of the scoring guides for trend items in the 2015 assessment, IEA has archived samples of student responses to the TIMSS Advanced 2008 assessments from each country; these are used in order to train scorers in 2015 and to monitor consistent application for those items appearing in both assessments."}, {"section_title": "Score Points", "text": "In developing the assessment, the aim is to create item blocks that each provide, on average, about 15 score points. Item blocks contain a variety of item types, including multiple-choice items (1 point each) and constructed-response items (1, 2, or more points) that allow for partial as well as full credit. The exact number of score points and the exact distribution of question types per block varies somewhat. Releasing Assessment Material to the Public TIMSS Advanced 2015 is the third in the TIMSS Advanced series of studies, and provides data on trends in mathematics and science achievement over a 20-year period, from 1995 through 2008 to 2015. It is envisaged that, in the future, TIMSS Advanced will be administered on the same four-year schedule as TIMSS (i.e., in 2019, 2023, and so on into the future). With each assessment, as the international reports are published, a selection of items are released in order to provide the public with as much information as possible about the nature and contents of the assessment. At the same time, the measurement of trends is safeguarded by keeping secure a substantial proportion of the items. As items are released, new items will be developed to take their place. According to the TIMSS Advanced 2015 design, 4 of the 9 assessment blocks in each subject will be released when the assessment results for 2015 are published; the remaining 5 will be kept secure for use in later assessments. The released blocks will include one block containing trend items from 1995, one block of trend items from 2008, and two blocks of items used for the first time in 2015. The released items will be replaced with new items before the next survey cycle, in 2019."}, {"section_title": "Background Questionnaires", "text": "An important purpose of TIMSS Advanced is to identify the procedures and practices that are effective in improving students' learning in advanced mathematics and physics. In order to better understand the contextual factors detailed in Chapter 3 that affect students' learning, TIMSS Advanced administers background questionnaires to students, their teachers, and their school principals. TIMSS Advanced also administers curriculum questionnaires to specialists in order to collect information about educational policies and the national contexts that shape the content and implementation of the advanced mathematics and physics curricula across countries. Finally, the TIMSS Encyclopedia provides a more qualitative description of mathematics and science education in the participating countries."}, {"section_title": "Student Questionnaire", "text": "A student questionnaire is completed by each student who takes the TIMSS Advanced assessment. This questionnaire asks about aspects of students' home and school lives, including basic demographic information, their home environment, school climate for learning, and self-perception and attitudes toward advanced mathematics and/or physics. The student questionnaire requires about 30 minutes to complete."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Questionnaires", "text": "A teacher questionnaire is completed by the teachers of the advanced mathematics and/or physics classes sampled to take part in the TIMSS Advanced testing. This questionnaire is designed to gather information on teacher characteristics, the classroom contexts for teaching and learning advanced mathematics and physics, and the topics taught in these subjects. In particular, the teacher questionnaire asks about teachers' backgrounds, their views on opportunities for collaboration with other teachers, their job satisfaction, and their education and training, as well as professional development. The questionnaire also collects information on characteristics of the classes tested in TIMSS Advanced, instructional time, materials, and activities for teaching mathematics and science and promoting students' interest in the subjects, use of computers, assessment practices, and homework. Although the general background questions are parallel across advanced mathematics and physics versions of the teacher questionnaire, questions pertaining to instructional and assessment practices, content coverage, and teachers' views about teaching the subject matter are tailored toward advanced mathematics or physics. Many questions, such as those related to classroom activities, are specific to the classes sampled for TIMSS Advanced. This questionnaire requires about 30 minutes of teachers' time to complete."}, {"section_title": "School Questionnaire", "text": "The principal of each school participating in TIMSS Advanced is asked to respond to this questionnaire.

Countries participating in TIMSS 2015 at the fourth and/or eighth grades each contribute a chapter to the encyclopedia. Those countries participating in TIMSS Advanced 2015 also will include information about advanced mathematics and physics curricula and instruction.  As an assessment of the achievement of students with advanced preparation in mathematics and physics at the end of secondary school, TIMSS Advanced is designed to complement the fourth and eighth grade mathematics and science assessments of TIMSS, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. TIMSS and TIMSS Advanced are undertakings of IEA, an international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of cross-national achievement since 1959. With more than 60 member countries, IEA has a Secretariat in Amsterdam and a large Data Processing and Research Center in Hamburg. The TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, led by Executive Directors Ina V.S. Mullis and Michael O. Martin, is responsible for the direction and management of TIMSS, TIMSS Advanced, and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study). To carry out these ambitious international studies, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center works closely with the IEA Secretariat in Amsterdam and the IEA Data Processing and Research Center in Hamburg. Also, Statistics Canada is responsible for school and sampling activities, and Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey provides guidance on psychometric methodology. Of fundamental importance, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center relies on the National Research Coordinators designated by the participating countries to be responsible for the complex tasks involved in implementing the studies in their countries. With each new assessment cycle of a study, one of the most important tasks is to update the assessment frameworks. Updating the TIMSS Advanced assessment frameworks for 2015 began in September of 2012, and has involved extensive input and reviews by individuals at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center, the IEA, the TIMSS Advanced 2015 National Research Coordinators, and the two TIMSS expert committees: the TIMSS 2015 Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee, and the TIMSS 2015 Questionnaire Item Review Committee. Of the many individuals around the world who help make TIMSS Advanced a success, the intention here is to specifically acknowledge some of those who had particular responsibility and involvement in developing and producing the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Assessment Frameworks.
