[{"section_title": "", "text": "As part of the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR), the U.S. government began paying farmers Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments, also called Production Flexibility Contract (PFC) payments, designed to be ''decoupled'' from current production decisions. AMTA/PFC payments are lump-sum income transfers that do not depend on current production choices, input use, or market prices. Eligibility for AMTA/PFC payments is based on past participation in commodity programs. Hence, AMTA/PFC payments are viewed as decoupled payments from current year conditions, in contrast to the traditional U.S. farm programs that were clearly linked to current year production choices. 1 The U.S. motivation for introducing AMTA/PFC payments is to minimize the trade-distorting impacts of traditional coupled farm commodity payments. Coupled payments can attract additional resources into agricultural production and distort trade, in contrast to decoupled payments, which are presumed to lead to minimal trade distortions. In fact, decoupled payments are not currently constrained by international trade rules for members of the World Trade Organization. However, it is a major policy challenge to successfully design a decoupled payment scheme. Such a scheme must be politically acceptable, must be truly decoupled from current year production, and must be perceived as such by the participants. Agricultural transition payments (AMTA/PFC) are being continued with the more recent 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (and now referred to as direct payments). In 1996, the first year of the FAIR Act, the AMTA/PFC payments were more than 80% of the total payments of $7.2 billion (Table 1). Soon after the FAIR Act became law, there was a decline in world commodity prices. The U.S. response to this decline, through an automatic feature of the farm legislation, was to increase the use of marketing loans and to provide ad hoc government support in the form of emergency payments. In the year of this study, 2001, payments amounted to $20.7 billion, and AMTA/PFC payments were about 20% of the total. In that same year, loan deficiency payments were 26% and emergency assistance was 41% of the total. The remaining payments were mostly conservation payments. The much-reduced payments received by farmers in 2002 (of $13.1 billion) came from a mix of programs under the previous and current legislation. This 2002 reduction in the level of payments is in part the result of the phasing out of emergency assistance, as a result of higher crop prices. The 2002 calendar year was the first year that AMTA/ PFC payments were the largest source of program payments since 1998. Table 1. Government Payments, 1991, 1996, 1999, and 2001 Obviously, the transfers to the agricultural sector are sizeable. They are even more sizeable on a per-farm basis when one considers that only about one-third of farm households receive any commodity-related payments. 2 Eligibility for AMTA/PFC payments in the year (2001) of the study was open to farmers who had certified acreage or land enrolled in the acreage reduction programs for at least one of the years from 1991 through 1995. In addition, land was eligible if it had been in the Conservation Reserve Program during the 1991-1995 period, but had a program base under previous programs. The program crops from the 1991 to 1995 period were wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, rice and upland cotton. 3 Farmers who chose to participate, enrolled eligible land in a contract during an enrollment period in 1996, covering 1996-2002. The contract explicitly stated which land was in the program. Program payments were made based on the product of a farm's payment quantity and per-unit payment rate, but with some upward limits on the size of the payment. 4 The significantly new feature of this policy was that participants could plant their enrolled acreage to any crop or even idle it in a conserving practice, except there were some limitations on cropping of fruits and vegetables. A major concern of U.S. trading partners is the potential of agricultural transition payments to lead to increased agricultural supply in the future, notably through increased farm investment. A recent USDA report found no evidence that agricultural transition payments resulted in increased onfarm investment at the aggregate level (USDA, ERS 2003a). The major impact of AMTA/PFC payments, like the traditional commodity-related payments, is likely on the increasing value of farmland. However, because a large share of the land eligible for payments is owned by landlords who do not operate the farms, farm operators do not retain all of the benefits of the programs because some of the benefits are captured by the land owner through higher rents. 5 In spite of the partial benefits that are captured by non-operating land owners, the agricultural transition payments have led to an improved financial well-being of farm operators and their households. Payments have likely led to increased consumption, savings, and/or investment, as well as income. Of interest in this paper, agricultural transition payments may have also led to changes in the labor allocations of farm operators and households. If agricultural transition payments are decoupled from production, then they will have an unambiguous impact on labor supply. For example, the receipt of decoupled payments will cause farm households to work less, on and/or off the farm, and enjoy more leisure time. 6 Given the importance of off-farm work to the well-being of farm households, any analysis of how a government policy affects labor allocations of farm families must consider both farm and off-farm work. Most farm families in the U.S. have a family member working in a non-farm occupation and most farm households earn most of their income from off-farm sources. For example, the income earned off the farm for farm households receiving commodity payments in 2000 was four times that of their income from farming (USDA, NASS, 2001). Previous evidence of coupled payments has shown that receipt of government payments decreases the likelihood of farm operators working off the farm (Hisham El-Osta and Mary Ahearn, 1996;Ashok Mishra and Barry Goodwin, 1997). According to farmer surveys, the only significant change in labor allocations during the 1990s was an increase in the average hours worked off the farm by farm operators and spouses (Mary Ahearn et al., 2002). 7 This was especially true from 1996 to 2000, and was true for those receiving subsidies as well as those who did not (Table 2). Farm households receiving payments did not, on average, significantly change their time spent working on the farm during the 1990s as the payment scheme changed to include decoupled payments. Ahearn et al. (2002), concluded that although work off the farm changed during the 1990s, there weren't differing impacts from coupled and agricultural transition payments. In contrast, Joe Dewbre and Ashok Mishra (2002), found evidence that farm households reduced their agricultural labor and consumed more leisure as a result of receiving payments, some of which were decoupled from production. Generalizing the results of the evidence thus far regarding the impacts of decoupled payments on labor allocations has been problematic. The weakness in the simple statistics of labor allocations based on farmer surveys is that the independent impacts of government payments, whether coupled or decoupled, may be masked by the multiple effects of all variables, particularly if the impacts of payments are small. And the weakness in the indepth empirical analyses in the literature is that it is piecemeal, in that farm and off-farm labor were not consistently and jointly considered for a consistent farmer population. Consequently, there are some gaps and even inconsistencies in implications of the previous literature regarding the residual claimant on time, namely leisure. This paper will extend the earlier analysis by providing a higher level of consistency in the research design and, hence, less ambiguous results. Specifically, it considers the impacts of the AMTA/PFC payments and other government payments on both farm and off-farm labor allocations for the relevant farmer population. This is done by estimating on-farm, off-farm, and total labor supply models for a consistent Source: Ahearn et al. (2002). Note: The 1996-2000 increase in off-farm hours were statistically significant for both operators and spouses. Other year-to-year changes were not statistically significant. sample of farm operators. In the next section the theory of time allocation is presented and following that the empirical specification, data source, and computational issues are described. After this a description and discussion of the results follow. 1. Farm work, off-farm work, and leisure choices: theoretical model The conceptual model combines the decisions of agricultural households relating to producer, consumer, and labor supply into a theoretically consistent model (Inderjit Singh, Lyn Squire, and John Strauss, 1986;Wallace Huffman, 1991;J. Edward Taylor and Irma Adelman, 2003). The individual is assumed to allocate time to farm work, off-farm work, and leisure in such a fashion that the optimal allocation is achieved when the marginal values of time devoted to the activities are equal. In this paper, the analysis is simplified by ignoring many of the possible complexities of the model. Specifically, the theoretical development and the empirical model of the paper ignore the interdependence of the allocation decision between operator and spouse (although the spouse's off-farm work is considered directly), the utility of others in the household, non-farm home production, commuting costs to off-farm jobs, possible psychic income from farming, and household savings. The farm operator household is assumed to have the optimization problem: subject to: where superscripts o and s indicate ''operator'' and ''spouse'', respectively; p y denotes the price of consumption goods y ; L is the time allocated to leisure, C is human capital, and s represents other factors such as life stage, number of children; T is the total time endowment, H is time allocated to off-farm work, and F is time allocated to farm work; w is the off-farm wage rate; p f are farm output prices, Y f are farm output quantities; w f are farm input prices, X f are farm input quantities, V signifies other household non-labor income and R describes location specific characteristics (e.g., local climate and soils). Equations (4) and (5) are budget (cash income) and production technology constraints, respectively. After substituting (5) into (4), the budget constraint can be written as: The utility function and the production function are assumed to be concave, continuous, and twice differentiable. The first-order conditions for the above model provide many useful results, including the optimality conditions for estimating onfarm labor demand and off-farm labor supply for the operator and the spouse. Considering the case of the farm operator, for example, optimality conditions dictate that the farmer will work on the farm as long as the marginal utility per dollar earned from additional farm work exceeds the marginal utility per dollar earned from additional off-farm work as in: The strict equality in 7indicates that the farmer is indifferent between farm and offfarm work (Wayne Simpson and Marilyn Kapitany, 1983). With the superscript o being dropped for simplicity, the following summarizes the supply function for offfarm time which is determined based on the optimal levels of leisure hours (L * ) and of farm work hours (F * ) based on the optimization problem described above as in: The demand function for the optimal hours worked on the farm by the operator is described as in: The above model allows us to identify the differing impacts of coupled and decoupled payments on labor allocation in the household. A coupled payment has the potential to increase hours allocated to farm work and lead to increased agricultural production, whereas a decoupled payment does not. To see this, consider the effect of a coupled payment on the p f , the price of farm output, in Equation (4). Because coupled payments are based upon the quantity of specific commodities produced in the current year, they are effectively a supplement to farm output prices. However, a coupled payment could have both a substitution and wealth effect in determining farm hours worked, so the empirical outcome on labor allocation is dependent on which effect dominates. The effect of a decoupled payment will be manifested through V, other household non-labor income, in Equation 4, because decoupled payments are presumed to be lump-sum payments. A decoupled payment would have only a wealth effect in Equation (8). Hence, the a priori expectation is clear in the case of decoupled payments; one would expect less time to be allocated to labor time and more time to be allocated to leisure time. Now, consider where a lump-sum-payment-recipient working two jobs (farm and off-farm) will reduce work time in order to consume more leisure. If a farmer is in equilibrium between farm and off-farm work allocations (as provided for in Equation 7), it is not clear a priori where labor hours will be reduced at the margin, from farm or off-farm activities. Moreover, there are a complex set of exogenous factors that are likely to prevent a farmer from attaining equilibrium between farm and off-farm labor allocations. One reason for this is the result of less than perfect labor markets, especially in some isolated rural areas. Census and survey data of farmers has shown that operators and spouses do, indeed, allocate their time to off-farm work in a lumpy fashion. In addition, because farm businesses are usually owner-operator family firms, there are a variety of family lifecycle considerations that come into play when farmers consider changes in labor allocation to the farm. In recognition of these complexities and rigidities, it is prudent to empirically examine the effect of AMTA/PFC payments on labor supplied to off-farm work activities, total work activities, as well as to farm activities. To clearly focus the primary research question, it is restated in the form of a hypothesis, null and alternative: H o : The AMTA/PFC payments provided under the 1996 FAIR Act are perceived by participants to be decoupled payments. Hence, receipt of payments will result in greater consumption of leisure and less work time. H a : The AMTA/PFC payments are not viewed as decoupled by program participants. They are viewed as coupled payments and will result in participants working more on the farm."}, {"section_title": "Econometric specification", "text": "The econometric representation delineating the operator's optimal decision rules with regard to labor allocation includes three components: a combined model that captures the decision to work off-farm and that estimates the amount of off-farm labor hours supplied to the market, an on-farm labor demand model, and a total work-hours model. With regard to the discrete decision to participate in the off-farm labor market and the continuous decision of how many labor hours to supply to this market (H j ), a representation of these decisions can be defined using the following Tobit model (James Tobin, 1958;J. Scott Long, 1997;William Greene, 1997): where H \u00c3 j is a latent variable that is observed for values greater than 0 and is censored for values less than or equal to 0; x is a vector of variables believed to influence the amount of hours worked off-farm, b is a vector of Tobit coefficients to be estimated, and l is a normally distributed stochastic disturbance term \u00bdl % N\u00f00; r 2 \u00de: The expected value (E) given x for the latent variableH \u00c3 j and the corresponding marginal effect for the kth variable (with all other variables held at their means) are expressed in the following (see Greene, 1997;Long, 1997): Let the amount of hours worked off-farm (H j ) by a particular farm operator be drawn randomly from a population representing the hours worked off-farm by all operators, where this population may or may not be censored, the expected value of H j given x is then: where where r is the standard deviation of l, and /\u00f0:\u00de and U\u00f0:\u00de are the standard normal probability density function and the standard normal cumulative density function, respectively. For the hours worked off-farm by the operator (H j ), the marginal effect for the kth variable given the censoring is: where Pr is a probability indicator, also known as the marginal effects' scale factor. In Equation 12, E\u00bdH j x j is non-linear in x. Therefore, using weighted least squares (WLS) procedures to estimate the regression of H j on x j will yield inconsistent estimates of the parameters for the regression of H \u00c3 j on x j as in Equation 10 (see Long, 1997). To circumvent this adverse outcome since the offfarm labor supply model to be estimated in this paper is based on the censored dependent variable H j , a Tobit model, which has the following log-likelihood function, is estimated instead: where ln is natural logarithm, and where the vector of parameters \u00f0b\u00de is estimated using weighted maximum likelihood procedures. The model for estimating on-farm labor hours is written as: where z is a vector of exogenous variables including, among others, those describing levels of government payments received by the farm operation; a is a vector of parameters to be estimated using WLS procedures; and e is a normally distributed error term \u00bde % N\u00f00; r 2 \u00de: The model describing the total on-and off-farm work hours (A) by farm operators is delineated in the following equation: where g is a vector of explanatory variables, c is a vector of parameters, and where d is a normally distributed error term. Since total hours worked as described in vector A are observed for all farm operators, Equation 16 is estimated by means of WLS."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The farm household data are from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The ARMS, since its inception in 1996, is USDA's primary vehicle for collecting and disseminating data on a wide range of issues about resource use and costs and farm financial conditions (USDA, ERS 2003b). As did its predecessor the Farm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS), the ARMS, which has many versions, performs many functions. Specifically, it is used to gather information about the relationships between agricultural production, resources, and the environment. It also helps in the determination of production costs and returns of agricultural commodities and in the measurement of net-farm income of farm businesses. Yet another aspect of ARMS' important contribution is the information it provides on the characteristics and financial conditions of farm households, including information on management strategies and off-farm income. The sample used in the analysis considers only those farm households with married couples and whose farm businesses received AMTA/PFC, emergency assistance, disaster assistance, and loan deficiency payments in 2001. A few observations were further eliminated due to erroneous coding of information by enumerators or due to respondents' refusals. A small number of additional observations were eliminated from this study if the operation was a non-family corporation or a cooperative. The final sample count was 731. The study also utilizes some auxiliary data. Specifically, the local area characteristics in commuting zones are based on county level data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis income files for 2000, the Bureau of Economic Analysis employment files for 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the 1990 Census of Population, STF-3 file."}, {"section_title": "Computational issues", "text": "Since the primary data underlying the three regression models described above are from the ARMS, which is a multiphase survey with its attending pre-and postsampling complexity, any inference based on estimated parameters from classical statistical algorithms become suspect. This is because the estimation of the variances of these parameters when the structure of the sampling process is complex becomes more involved than in the case when the variances of these estimates are based on simple random samples. To demonstrate, take the case of the on-farm labor hours model which is to be estimated using weighted least squares regression procedures as depicted in Equation 15. The weighted least squares estimators for this model are described below: 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 : \u00f017\u00de Under the assumption of simple random sampling procedures, the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the these estimators is: where r 2 is proxied by its mean sum-squared-errors (see John Neter, William Wasserman, and Michael Kutner, 1985). Because of the sampling structure of the ARMS survey, and to assure reliable statistical inference, variances of estimated parameters would need to be computed under a more complex formulation than is shown in (18). To simplify these potentially complicated measurements while attending to the complexity of the survey design, this paper, based on standards established by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), uses the delete-a-group jackknife variance estimator (see Phil Kott, 1997;Robert Dubman, 2000). Under this method, the original sample of surveyed farms representing all farms in the 48 contiguous states is divided by NASS into 15 nearly equal and mutually exclusive different parts. In addition, fifteen estimates of the statistic, called ''replicate weights,'' are then created by NASS. This re-sampling method eliminates with replacement, in turn for each ''replicate'' estimate, one of the 15 parts. The next step involves the utilization in this paper of the full sample weight (W) and the 15 vectors of ''replicate'' weights, as provided by NASS, in 16 regressions based on Equation 15. The first regression is based on W which yields the full sample estimate\u00e2, and the remaining 15 regressions are based on the 15 vectors of ''replicate'' weights which, in turn, result in 15 vectors of\u00e2 q \u00f0q \u00bc 1; . . . ; 15\u00de: The final step involves the derivation of the Jackknife variance-covariance matrix of regression coefficients as in the following: where S is a scalar representing the degrees of freedom for the jackknife procedure in the context of NASS' replicate weights (here, S = 14/15), and _ a is a (k+1, q) matrix whose elements are the resultants of the difference of the kth parameter estimate based on the qth ''replicate'' weight and the corresponding kth parameter estimate based on the ''full-sample'' weight. The square roots of the elements of cov (\u00c1) along the diagonal provide the appropriate standard errors to use in hypotheses testing when data has the type of complex survey-design structure as in ARMS."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results", "text": "The study's null hypothesis is that agricultural transition payments (AMTA/PFC) are perceived as decoupled and result in more leisure being consumed by the farmer. Many U.S. farmers work both on the farm and off the farm, and it is possible that additional leisure hours could be consumed by reductions of either off-farm or farm work hours. Hence, this section describes the empirical results associated with estimating an off-farm labor model for Equation 8, a farm labor model for Equation 9, and a total labor model. The definition of variables used in the labor allocation models and their means are presented in Table 3. Although there is not a consistent view in the literature, one could argue that the choice to participate in government programs should be modeled endogenously with choices about labor allocations. Historically, farm businesses' participation in government programs varied by year and commodity. Somewhere in the range of 60-90% of eligible acres were generally enrolled in the program. Since the passage of FAIR, however, nearly all eligible acres have been enrolled in the program. Because there is some question about the potential endogeneity of the participation decision and because impacts of government programs are the focus of this paper, two treatments for government payments are considered. To address the concern about the possibility of endogeneity of the decision, the study's first treatment of government payments in the labor models is to use a predicted value for total government payments. Expected government payments is the predicted value of government payments (the sum of the three major agricultural programs defined in Table 3). Expected government payment is predicted from a model based on seven explanatory variables, largely following Goodwin and Featherstone (1995). 8 The variables, x 1 -x 7 are values of sales of eligible commodities ($1000), proportion of acres rented, ratio of value of production to variable costs, farm debt load ($1000), farm asset level ($1000), non-farm asset level ($1000), and being located in the Midwest (=1; 0 otherwise). The description of the model is: expected government payments = 28.69 + 0.19x 1 + 7.01x 2 ) 0.81x 3 + 0.03x 4 + 0.02x 5 ) 0.01x 6 ) 25.52x 7 . The results for the operator labor models using the expected government payment variable, are presented in Table 4. The study's second treatment of government payments in the labor models does not predict government payments. It allows for the three major classes of government payments to enter the models individually. Given the main interest in identifying any potential differing impacts among the three government programs, allowing the programs to enter the model separately was essential. However,  The marginal effect for the kth variable, given the censoring in the off-farm labor supply model, is computed as (see Equation 13): The variable ''Expected government payment'' is the predicted payments from three types of government program payments: agricultural disaster payments, loan deficiency payments, and transition payments. The following is a description of the model: Expected government payment = 28.69 + 0.19x 1 + 7.01x 2 ) 0.81x 3 + 0.03x 4 + 0.02x 5 ) 0.01x 6 ) 25.52x 7 , where x 1 -x 7 are explanatory variables as described in the text. (All coefficients except those corresponding to variables x 3 , x 5 , and x 6 are significant at the a = 0.05 or better; Adj. R 2 = 0.60)."}, {"section_title": "LABOR SUPPLY BY FARM OPERATORS", "text": "technically it was not possible to predict the three payment types individually. This is because they would need to have unique model specifications and realistically the models could not be independently specified. 9 Table 4 presents the first set of results (where government payments entered as total predicted government payments) for off-farm, on-farm, and total hours worked for the operator. The sign and significance of operator's age and operator's age squared in the off-farm-work-hours model indicate that off-farm-work-hours by the operator tended to increase with age, but at a decreasing rate. Operator's education had a negative impact on off-farm hours, on-farm hours, and on-total hours worked, but surprisingly, its coefficient was not significant in any of the three models. Most of the variables were common across the models. Three of these common variables were significant in all three models: age (squared) was negative in all three models, whether or not the farm was a dairy was negative in the off-farm model and positive in the farm labor and total labor models (plus in all models the magnitude of the dairy coefficients were very large), and the variable of interest in this paper, expected government payments was significant. All of the operators worked on the farm, by definition, but not all of the operators worked off the farm. To mitigate any endogeniety concerns, a variable denoting the expected off-farm work hours, which was estimated based on Equation 12, is included in the on-farm hours and in the total work-hours models. It was, as expected, negative and significant in the on-farm work-hours model. Findings indicate that with each additional hour of off-farm work, the on-farm work hours by a farm operator would decrease by 0.42. The sign of expected off-farm work hours was not easy to predict in the total hours model because it is known that full-time farm operators often report high farm work hours. In fact, the sign of the coefficient of expected off-farm work hours in the total work-hours model was positive, indicating that associated with each additional hour in off-farm work was a lesser increase (0.69), perhaps due to commuting time, in total hours worked. In the on-farm work-hours model, the sign of the coefficient on expected government payment was positive. The coefficient of this variable indicates that for every additional $1000 in expected payment received, the farm operator will work an additional 4.77 hours on the farm per year. Recall that if a payment is viewed as an effective increase in farm wages, the payment can have two confounding effects, a substitution and a wealth effect. Given the positive sign, we find that the gross positive substitution effect outweighs the gross negative wealth effect on net. In the off-farm model, in contrast, expected government payments had a negative impact on off-farm hours worked. As payments tend to increase farm hours worked, some of those farm hours came from decreases in off-farm work. Furthermore, expected government payment is positive in the total labor model indicating that farm operators work more in total as a result of receiving payments. Hence, some of the additional hours worked on the farm as a result of receiving payments come from leisure hours. The results regarding government payments in the off-farm model are consistent with previous literature; however, the authors are not aware of other literature that examines the impacts of payments on-farm hours or total hours worked. The positive impact of on-farm hours worked implies that payments, in total, are viewed as synonymous with an increase in the farm wage rate, rather than as a decoupled lump-sum subsidy. And, the strong positive impact of payments onfarm hours outweighs the negative impact on off-farm hours, so that operators work more in total and consume less leisure as a result of payments. The impacts of individual government farm programs on labor allocations are examined next. Table 5 presents the second set of results (where government payments entered the models as three separate programs) for off-farm, on-farm, and total hours worked for the operator. Not surprisingly, the results were very similar to those presented in Table 4 and summarized above, hence, discussion of the Table 5 results will be limited to those associated with government payments. The ARMS data source has three major categories for the government programs considered, including agricultural transition payments. If farmers' response to agricultural transition payments is just through a wealth effect, one would expect total labor hours to either remain the same or decrease. If their response includes a substitution effect, then one cannot predict the direction of the net effect because the substitution effect works in the opposite direction of the wealth effect. A positive coefficient would imply that the substitution effect dominates the wealth effect. Where the Table 4 results showed that payments in total had a positive impact onfarm hours worked, the impacts differ somewhat across the three programs. The agricultural transition payments (AMTAP/PFC) and the agricultural disaster payments were both positive and significant (at the 10% level) in the on-farm model. Loan deficiency payments were not significant at the 10% level. In trying to assess whether the results were sensitive to the assumption about endogeniety of the participation decision, loan deficiency payment was entered in the model as a predicted variable rather than as an observed variable. The fact that the coefficient of the predicted loan deficiency payment remained positive and insignificant shows that endogeniety was not an issue. The critical inference to be made from these results is that agricultural transition payments has a positive impact on-farm hours (significant at the 10% level), indicating that agricultural transition payments are not viewed by farm operators as lump sum transfers, in the classic economic theory sense. In fact, the magnitude of the agricultural transition payments, while small, is greater than the impact of the other two categories of farm payments that were examined. The coefficient indicates that for every additional $1000 in agricultural transition payment received, an operator will work an additional 4.38 hours on the farm per year. The average agricultural transition payment recipient received just over $9000 per year in 2001, so the result of Table 5 translates into about 1 work week per year. While significant (at the 10% level), clearly this small impact of on-farm labor hours worked would not be expected to have a great impact on agricultural output. The impact of the three government programs on off-farm labor hours differed somewhat from each other. The signs of the coefficients were all negative, but only loan deficiency payment and agricultural transition payments were significant (at the 1 and 5% levels, respectively). For total work hours, none of the coefficients were significant when the three programs were considered individually. This result is consistent with equal and opposite wealth and substitution effects, but is in contrast to the significant impact that the three programs combined had on total labor hours worked (as reported in Table 4). * Significant at 10%., ** Significant at 5%., *** Significant at 1%."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The ideal farm program from a fair trade perspective would be one that had no impact on labor allocations, other input use, or farm investment that would lead to increases in agricultural output. Virtually all of the recent economic literature on labor allocations of farm operators and their households has focused on their offfarm labor participation, the dramatic development of the past 40 years (e.g., Milton Hallberg, Jill Findeis, and Daniel Lass 1991). Consequently, there has been little empirical work from which to draw implications regarding the impacts of the newly structured farm programs on-farm labor allocations of farm households. The majority of labor on U.S. farms participating in government farm programs is provided by farm operators. The analysis reported in this paper indicates that government payments tend to increase the hours operators work on their farm and decrease the hours they work off the farm. This is true whether the payments come from programs which tie payments to current year production, or from programs that do not. However, the impacts of payments on labor allocation are quite small in magnitude. As a result of this small impact, the results of the very recent literature had been somewhat mixed because of variation in model specification and delineation of the sample. Hopefully, the consistent treatment of these issues in this paper, and various tests of model sensitivities, have contributed to a clearer conclusion about labor impacts. It is worth noting that payments have generally worked against the major farm and off-farm labor trends, though their impacts have been dwarfed by the main trends. That is, average labor allocated to the farm has been relatively constant for farm households (though declining significantly long-term for the sector) and payments have tended to increase hours worked on-farm for operator households. Conversely, average labor allocated to off-farm work has increased for decades in the U.S., and payments have tended to dampen this trend. Theory provides an unambiguous prediction of how lump sum payments affect total work time. Lump sum payments are expected to decrease work time. However, the paper's results relating to AMTA/PFC payments are not consistent with the theoretical prediction for lump sum payments. We offer three possible explanations for this result. The first explanation relates to the challenge of designing a real world decoupled payment program. Perhaps, no realistic payment scheme can be fully decoupled. As noted, eligibility for AMTA/PFC payments was tied to past production yields. And, farmers may expect that future payments will also be tied to past yields and production choices. In fact, the 2002 law allowed farmers to ''rebase,'' i.e., update their commodity yields for the purpose of computing future payments, so this explanation has some basis in reality. The farm community has more than 60 years of experience with various government farm programs, and hence, has very informed expectations about the design of programs. So, the fact that the study did not find empirical evidence that the new payments were decoupled may be because they were not perceived as effectively decoupled by farmers. A second explanation for the finding that AMTA/PFC payments increased hours worked on the farm is simply that farmers may need time to adjust to the changing policy scenario. Management strategies, machinery complements, and other investments may need adjustments and these adjustments are not feasible immediately. Perhaps the 5-year period between the enactment of the FAIR Act and the analysis considered in the study was an insufficient period to allow for adjustment to the new policies. Finally, farm families have shown a noteworthy reluctance to exit farming in spite of low farm incomes. This is in part the result of in-kind income from farming, which makes them less sensitive to cash incentives such as government payments. Regardless of the explanation for the study's empirical findings, the theoretical possibilities will continue to encourage policy makers to explore and refine decoupled payment schemes, as a means of lessening the distortion of signals in the global marketplace. Notes 1. For further information on the distinction between coupled and decoupled payments in the U.S. context see Lin, et al. (2000), USDA, ERS (2003a), and OECD (2000) for a more general discussion. 2. According to the Agricultural Resource Management Survey, 33.8% of farms received commodityrelated payments in 2001, and some of these also received conservation payments. Another 7% of farms received only conservation-related program payments in 2001 (USDA, ERS 2003b). 3. Soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts were added in 2002. 4. A payment quantity was equal to 85 percent of a farm's contract acreage times its 1995 program yield for that commodity. A per-unit payment rate for each contract commodity was determined annually by dividing the total annual contract payment level for each commodity by the total of all contract farms' program payment quantity. 5. How much of the payments received by farm operators that are passed on to their landlords in the form of higher rents is an empirical question. The maximum pass-through (100% of payments) would be approximately half of the payments since that is the share of land operated by farmers who receive payments that they rent in from landowners (USDA, NASS 2001). Michael Roberts, Kirwan Barnett, and Hopkins Jeffrey (2003) have estimated that about one-third of payments pass-through to landlords. 6. However, a greater consumption of leisure by the farm household does not necessarily imply a lowered agricultural supply because hired labor can substitute for household labor. 7. Analysis was contributed by Robert Hoppe, David Harrington, and Penelope Korb. 8. Expected government payments is deemed to be a good instrument since it was highly correlated with government payments (Pearson correlation (PC) \u00bc 0.685) and not with on-, off-, or total work hours (with PC levels of )0.164, 0.166, and 0.051, respectively.) 9. In fact, we satisfied ourselves that the research design choices associated with the endogeniety issue did not affect our qualitative results regarding government payments and labor allocation. We did this by also estimating labor models where total government payments were actual, not predicted and compared these results to those of Table 4. We also estimated labor models where loan deficiency payments entered as predicted values, not actual, because those could be argued to be more like coupled payments and hence be more endogenous. We then compared these results to those of Table 5. In both these sensitivity analyses, we found that the qualitative results between payments and labor allocations held.
