Currently, these infants have little or no developmental follow-up. Additional investigations are required to identify potential points for intervention to improve long-term outcomes.\nConcerns about longer-term outcomes arise because significant brain development occurs between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Economic disadvantage is a well characterized risk factor for preterm birth, and, independently, poorer cognitive and behavioral outcomes. [10] [11] [12] [13] Late preterm infants also experience increased morbidity compared with term infants in the neonatal period. [14] [15] [16] Combined, these factors suggest that the late preterm infant is at increased risk for poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes from both biological and environmental factors.\nData suggest that late preterm infants have worse neurodevelopmental outcomes and academic performance at school age and require special education more frequently. [17] [18] [19] However, substantial data has accumulated that early educational intervention can prevent these adverse school-aged outcomes, and this group of infants may be likely to have sustained long-term benefits from such early programs. 20, 21 Thus, it is important to know whether this group of infants can be identified before school age, permitting them to have earlier interventions to limit the need for later special education.

Compared with term infants, late preterm infants had increased odds of having more severe mental delay (52%), milder mental developmental delay (43%), severe psychomotor developmental delay (56%), and milder psychomotor developmental delay (58%). In our analyses, the most important single contributor to severe mental developmental delay was male gender, whereas the most significant contributor to severe psychomotor developmental delay was being a late preterm infant.\nThe observed increased risks to late preterm infants could be because of brain immaturity and its vulnerability to injury. At 34 weeks' gestation, the brain weighs 65% of term brain weight, leaving 35% more growth to achieve its term weight. 3 Quantitative MRI data indicate that total brain volume increases linearly with increasing gestational age. 3 In the last half of gestation are major organizational events in the development of neurons and glia at the cellular and molecular level. 4 The cerebellum is also actively growing and developing, with \u03f325% of its growth occurring after late preterm gestations. 5 One could hypothesize that brain growth is altered or damaged by preterm delivery and/or complications known to adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes such as respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and apnea. 14, 31, 32 Evidence from animal models reveals that these factors can promote or precipitate neuronal cell death in the immature brain. 33 Our results reveal that mental delay is more closely associated with modifiable social factors (including socioeconomic factors) that could improve outcomes.

Chyi et al 17 noted increased rates of learning difficulties in late preterm infants at school age. Morse et al 18 demonstrated increased risk for late preterm infants to have developmental delay or disability, and school suspension. Petrini et al 19 found that decreasing gestational age was associated with increased incidence of cerebral palsy and developmental delay/mental retardation for those born at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation. A group in the Netherlands found that preterm children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation have cognitive and emotional regulation difficulties that affected their functioning at school age, including slightly lower IQ scores and an increased incidence of attention, behavioral, and school problems when compared with term-born children. 35 This group also reported that twice as many moderately preterm born children attend special education schools compared with the general population. 35 Our study expands the current literature in several ways. First, we focus on actual measures of the outcome as opposed to specific diagnoses, distinguishing us from Petrini et al. 19 This is an important difference because diagnoses can be affected by diagnostic practices in a way that administering a standardized assessment tool in a standardized way will not be. Second, unlike some other studies, our study is a nationally representative sample. Third, Chyi et al 17 also had a nationally representative sample and a similar study design, but they used school assessments and special education. Although these are important outcomes, the assessments across schools may not have been standardized nor was the criteria for special education likely to be consistent across all settings. Finally, the strength of our study is that assessment at 24 months allows for earlier identification of a problem and may permit prompt intervention potentially reducing the subsequent need for special education.\nThere are, however, limitations to our study. Data on birth events were obtained solely from the birth certificate. 36, 37 Thus, we are unable to assess severity of illness at the time of birth, duration of neonatal hospitalization, or other neonatal complications and morbidities to further risk stratify our late preterm infant population. However, on the basis of other evidence, the prevalence of complications is likely to be low. 38 A second limitation affects the interpretation of the significance of infant developmental testing. The parent instrument, the BSID-II, has been criticized as having limited predictive validity for future development. 39 However, designed to sample a wide array of emerging developmental abilities and inventory developmental milestone attainment, the BSID-II is meant to be a general indicator of functioning at the time of testing and remains a useful tool for relative comparisons between different populations within the same cohort.\nIn addition, the research form of the BSID-II used in this study characterizes \u03f36% to 20% of the infants in this cohort as having severe mental and psychomotor delays, a much higher proportion than would be expected on the basis of the BSID-II normative population. 23 There are several possible reasons for this difference. First, the BSID-II normative sample may be less representative than the ECLS-B. Our study has several major strengths, including the large numbers of participants, a nationally representative sample, impressive follow-up after 2 years (92%), and wide socioeconomic and racial backgrounds of the participants. This database also is rich with multiple data sources.\nAlthough preterm infants born at \u03fd28 weeks' completed gestation are at highest risk for severe adverse outcomes, their numbers are relatively small and stable. Late preterm births constitute 9% of all live US births and account for \u03fe70% of all preterm births. 1 Because of the large number of potentially affected infants, a small derangement in neuro-developmental outcome could put a larger strain on the educational and medical systems. For example, it has been shown that late preterm infants accumulate more health care costs throughout the birth hospitalization, 43 are rehospitalized more frequently, 16 and have more costs during the first year of life. 43 Late preterm infants merit closer observation and developmental followup. These data support reorganization of services with more resource allocation to late preterm infants. "}]
