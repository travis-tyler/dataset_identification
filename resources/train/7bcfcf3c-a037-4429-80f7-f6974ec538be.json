Collaborative imaging genetics studies across different research institutions show the effectiveness of detecting genetic risk factors.

In this study, we propose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the large-scale imaging genetics studies across multiple institutions. To speed up the learning process, we propose a family of distributed group Lasso screening rules to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization. Then we select the relevant group features by performing the group Lasso feature selection process in a sequence of parameters. Finally, we employ the stability selection to rank the top risk SNPs that might help detect the early stage of AD.

GenomeWide Association Studies (GWAS) [2] achieved great success in finding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD. Some large-scale collaborative network such as ENIGMA [8] Consortium consists of 185 research institutions around the world, analyzing genomic data from over 33,000 subjects, from 35 countries. However, processing and integrating genetic data across different institutions is challenging. The first issue is the data privacy since each participating institution wishes to collaborate with others without revealing its own data set. The second issue is how to conduct the learning process across different institutions. Local Query Model (LQM) [3, 13] is proposed to perform the distributed Lasso regression for large-scale collaborative imaging genetics studies across different institutions while preserving the data privacy for each of them. However, in some imaging genetics studies [2] , we are more interested in finding important explanatory factors in predicting responses, where each explanatory factor is represented by a group of features since lots of AD genes are continuous or relative with some other features, not individual features. In such cases, the selection of important features corresponds to the selection of groups of features. As an extension of Lasso, group Lasso [12] has been proposed for feature selection in a group level and quite a few efficient algorithms [5, 1] have been proposed for efficient optimization. However, integrating group Lasso with imaging genetics studies across multiple institutions has not been studied well.\nIn this study, we propose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the large-scale imaging genetics studies analysis across multiple research institutions. Our framework has three components. In the first stage, we proposed a family of distributed group lasso screening rules (DSR and DDPP GL) to identify inactive features and remove them from the optimization. The second stage is to perform the group lasso feature selection process in a distributed manner, selecting the top relevant group features for all the institutions. Finally, each institution obtains the learnt model and perform the stability selection to rank the top risk genes for AD. The experiment is conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) GWAS data set, including approximately 809 subjects with 5.9 million loci. Empirical studies demonstrate that proposed method the proposed method achieved a 35-fold speedup compared to state-of-the-art distributed solvers like ADMM. Stability selection results show that the proposed DFSF detects APOE, GRM8, GPC6 and LOC100506272 as top risk SNPs associated with AD, demonstrating a superior result compared to Lasso regression methods [3] . The proposed method offers a powerful feature selection tool to study AD and its early symptom."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Problem Formulation", "text": "Group Lasso [12] is a highly efficient feature selection and regression technique used in the model construction.
