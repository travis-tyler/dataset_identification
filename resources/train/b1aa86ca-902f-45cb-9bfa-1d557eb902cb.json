Chronology of BPS 1990-2017   The Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) is a nationally representative survey study fielded every 8 years that tracks a cohort of first-time beginning (FTB) undergraduate students for a 6-year period. The purpose of BPS is to monitor the educational and early workforce outcomes of FTB students. Students in the BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts began postsecondary education (PSE) in academic years (AYs) 1995-96 and 2003-04, respectively. 1 The cohorts were initially contacted during those academic years as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). BPS first followed up with these cohorts 3 years after entry (i.e., through BPS:96/98 and BPS:04/06) and followed up for the second time 6 years after entry (i.e., through BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09). The BPS studies include data from multiple interviews and administrative components, but the FSA Supplement is a single-source administrative follow-up to BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09. This report only includes information about the administrative matching procedures to link NSLDS data to BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09 study participants. 2 The FSA Supplement offers two types of data, source data pulled directly from NSLDS and aggregate derived variables.

The target population for each BPS cohort is all FTB undergraduate students enrolled in postsecondary institutions within a given base year. Beginning with the BPS:96 cohort, NCES has interviewed FTB students at three points in time: in the first year they entered PSE (through the NPSAS student interview) and in BPS follow-up interviews 3 and 6 years later. 4 In addition to the interviews, BPS staff collected postsecondary transcripts from all the institutions that BPS:04 cohort members attended between July 1, 2003, andJune 30, 2009, as part of the 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). 5 Using these studies, analysts can study topics such as postsecondary persistence and attainment, employment during enrollment, financial aid and borrowing, education and career expectations, and early employment after exiting PSE. The 6-year period for BPS follow-ups has limited utility for research on federal student loan repayment because standard repayment plans are based on a 10-year period beginning after the borrower leaves school. The FSA Supplement expands the available period for BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts by appending long-term federal aid data from NSLDS to BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, thus offering a more comprehensive assessment of federal student loan repayment outcomes. The FSA Supplement serves as a 20-year follow-up for the BPS:96 cohort and a 12-year follow-up for the BPS:04 cohort. Figure 1 shows the data collection timeline for each BPS cohort to date.

NPSAS staff asked these institutions to provide a list of all NPSAS-eligible students enrolled between July 1 and June 30 of the respective NPSAS year. 7 NPSAS-eligible students must have been o at least one course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree; or o an occupational or vocational program that required at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate or other formal award; \u2022 not concurrently enrolled in high school; and \u2022 not enrolled solely in a GED\u00ae 8 or other high school completion program. To ensure that BPS had a sufficient sample of FTB students, the NPSAS:96 and NPSAS:04 survey statisticians oversampled students thought to have enrolled in PSE for the first time during the NPSAS year. For both NPSAS:96 and NPSAS:04, FTB students were restricted to those who \u2022 were undergraduate students; \u2022 were classified by the institution as freshmen or first-year students at the time of first enrollment; and \u2022 had no transfer credits from another postsecondary institution (excluding credits earned when a student was in high school). Unlike during NPSAS:96, NPSAS:04 staff divided the sample of FTB students into two groups: pure and effective. Pure FTB students enrolled in PSE for the first time after high school between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004. Effective FTB students were students who had previously enrolled but never completed a postsecondary course for credit prior to July 1, 2003. Both pure and effective FTB students were considered for BPS:04 cohort sampling.   Table 2 provides interview and study response rates for the BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09 study participants in the first and second follow-ups. The number of students determined eligible before the beginning of data collection. 2 The overall response rate is the product of the institution response rate and the student interview response rate. 3 For BPS:4/09, a study respondent was defined as any sample member w ho was determined to be eligible for the study, w as still alive at the time of the BPS:04/09 data collection, and had the requisite valid data from any source to allow construction of his or her enrollment history. 4 For BPS:04/09 PETS, the study response and overall study response rates are unweighted.

National Student Loan Data System Matching and Processing", "text": "Data provided in the FSA Supplement were obtained or derived from NSLDS, ED's central repository for administering and tracking federal financial aid. NSLDS was authorized by the 1986 amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 and was initially populated with loan data in October 1994. At the time of the amendments, federal loans originated with private lenders and were administered by guaranty agencies on behalf of the federal government. NSLDS was designed to serve the administrative needs of the many entities involved in student lending. As federal aid programs have evolved and expanded over time, so has NSLDS. Today, it improves the quality and accessibility of federal financial aid data, reduces the administrative burden of financial aid programs, and minimizes errors and abuse by accurately tracking funds and protecting aid recipients' privacy. NSLDS contains more than 200 data tables that are populated by various sources, such as postsecondary institutions, lenders, loan servicers, collectors, and other government offices both inside and outside ED. These tables have largely been used to produce administrative reports and informational summaries for the contributing parties, as well as other government agencies such as the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Over time, NSLDS has expanded to provide information on all stages of the loan life cycle from disbursement through repayment (or default) and closure. The FSA Supplement capitalizes on this expansion by processing and restructuring NSLDS data so data users can analyze all stages of the federal loan life cycle and histories of federal grant awards. Specifically, information is available for Stafford Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), Direct Loans, Perkins Loans, and Consolidation Loans, as well as Pell Grants and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants. Because the network of parties involved in updating NSLDS is extensive, updating and validating data across NSLDS is a cumbersome process. To allow ample time for NSLDS data to be updated and verified, NCES typically waits 6 months after the end of the latest academic year of interest before extracting NSLDS data. Because BPS staff extracted NSLDS data in April 2016, the latest full academic year of updated and validated data was 2014-15. This chapter discusses the results of matching data for BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09 study participants to loan and grant data from NSLDS.

Data were aggregated for fields where the number of cases was small. Variables related to conditions that occurred infrequently (e.g., loan forgiveness), which increases the likelihood of individual identification, were excluded. Finally, the data were subject to perturbation procedures to minimize disclosure risk. The NCES Disclosure Review Board reviewed and approved the perturbation procedures used. Data swapping and other forms of perturbation, implemented to protect respondent confidentiality, can lead to minor inconsistencies. Methods for perturbation of data are developed to preserve central tendency estimates, but can result in minimal increases in nonsampling error."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Error", "text": "While NCES strives to collect and deliver the highest quality data, sources of error inevitably exist and must be considered by researchers and policymakers when reporting findings and making inferences. One source of error is nonresponse bias. For the FSA Supplement, a nonrespondent is a study participant who did not have a valid SSN for extracting NSLDS data. If BPS study participants who did not have a valid SSN available (0.5 and 4 percent of the BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09 study participants, respectively) differ in a meaningful way from study participants who had a valid SSN, their missing data can cause nonresponse bias. Participants whose identifiers were sent to NSLDS and did not match do not have missing data; rather, it is known that these participants did not receive any federal aid because NSLDS data are examined, audited, and vetted by numerous stakeholders, including students, institutions, lenders, servicers, collectors, and the office of Federal Student Aid at ED. It is unknown whether participants who did not have identifiers to send to NSLDS received aid; therefore, their records are truly missing data. The rates of missing data for these studies fall below the 15 percent threshold at which NCES requires bias analysis to determine the effect of missing data on estimates. Therefore, no nonresponse bias analyses were conducted for the FSA Supplement variables. During the production of BPS:96/01, BPS staff evaluated study nonresponse at the student level. An individual was required to respond to the interview to be considered a study respondent. See table 2 for BPS:96/01 study response rates. BPS staff evaluated student-level nonresponse bias across 77 demographic characteristics. For example, before nonresponse adjustments, the percentage of BPS:96/01 interview respondents age 19 or younger was significantly different from the percentage of nonrespondents age 19 or younger. Of the 77 demographic characteristics examined, 12 had significant bias between respondents and nonrespondents before weighting. Only two characteristics had significantly biased distributions after weighting, specifically the percentage of prior interview respondents and the percentage of prior interview nonrespondents. BPS staff also examined item-level nonresponse on interview items with more than 10 percent nonresponse rates. The following seven interview items were examined: \u2022 cumulative undergraduate GPA (17 percent missing); \u2022 lifetime learning tax credit in 1999 (10 percent missing); \u2022 gross annual salary for current job (23 percent missing); \u2022 gross annual salary for 2000 (15 percent missing); \u2022 gross annual salary for first post-enrollment job (27 percent missing); \u2022 spouse's gross salary for 2000 (23 percent missing); and \u2022 total balance due on all credit cards (15 percent missing). For BPS:04/09, study respondents were defined as sample members who were eligible for the study, were alive at the time of data collection, and had available enrollment history from any source. Study respondents were not required to respond to the interview. See table 2 for BPS:04/09 interview and study response rates. BPS staff evaluated study nonresponse at the student level. Of the 78 demographic characteristics used to evaluate student-level study nonresponse bias, 53 characteristics had significant bias before weighting. One characteristic had a significantly biased distribution after weighting, specifically the percentage of the students whose NPSAS institution enrolled fewer than 1,822 undergraduate students. BPS staff also examined item-level nonresponse on interview items with particularly high levels of nonresponse. In BPS:04/09, BPS staff examined 18 interview items because of a nonresponse rate higher than 5 percent: \u2022 intensity of enrollment in 2008 at school 3 (7 percent missing); \u2022 currently enrolled in postbaccalaureate program 2 (8 percent missing); \u2022 type of postbaccalaureate degree or certificate program 2 (7 percent missing); \u2022 enrollment intensity in postbaccalaureate program 2 (6 percent missing); \u2022 enrolled for any other postbaccalaureate degrees or certificates 2 (6 percent missing); \u2022 primary major string (9 percent missing); \u2022 secondary major string (6 percent missing); \u2022 job duties (15 percent missing); \u2022 industry string (21 percent missing); \u2022 years in same or similar job (7 percent missing); \u2022 months in same or similar job (14 percent missing); \u2022 respondent income in 2008 (8 percent missing); \u2022 respondent income estimate for 2008 (18 percent missing); \u2022 spouse's income for 2008 (8 percent missing); \u2022 spouse's income estimate for 2008 (43 percent missing); \u2022 balance due on all credit cards (5 percent missing); \u2022 spouse's total student loan amount (9 percent missing); and \u2022 amount of spouse's loans still owed (6 percent missing). Another more prominent source of error is missing data within NSLDS. Individual tables within NSLDS were created at various times. When tables were created, historical information was sometimes, but not always, added for prior years. As a result, tables added after study participants began postsecondary education do not always provide complete data for those study participants. Details on the specific limitations of each source table are provided in the corresponding section in chapter 4. Although exact levels of missing data cannot be determined, the individual limitations of each table were considered before variables were derived from information within that table. Specific rules were developed to ensure that derived variables were based on complete information for each borrower. That is, some variables were excluded from the FSA Supplement because BPS staff could not be confident in the coverage the variable provided; some students have been given a reserve code when records were not available due to the timing of the creation of the table; and some variables involved complex designs to ensure additional validations before derivation. Finally, any population estimates that are calculated using a sample-based dataset, including all datasets associated with BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, are subject to sampling error because different samples will produce different estimates. See section 3.1 for more on calculating population estimates using the available analysis weights. Standard errors should be calculated to measure the difference between the sample-based estimates and the expected population value. See section 3.2 for information on the variables and methods available for calculating variance estimates for analyses using the FSA Supplement data."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3. Weighting and Variance Estimation", "text": "Each study associated with the BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts (i.e., NPSAS, first and second BPS follow-ups, and PETS) contains multiple analysis weights for the respective study respondents. The weights are designed to account for multistage, complex sampling designs, study nonresponse, and post-stratification. When applied, the weights yield nationally representative estimates from data available for particular subgroups of study participants. These subgroups are identified based on participants' study response patterns. No new weights were created during the production of the FSA Supplement. Data users should treat FSA Supplement data as additional administrative data for the second follow-up studies and apply the weights originally created for BPS:96/01 or BPS:04/09. This application will produce nationally representative estimates of federal financial aid outcomes for students who began their postsecondary education in AY 1995-96 and AY 2003-04, respectively. The FSA Supplement was designed to allow data users to compare federal financial aid data across BPS cohorts in concurrent analyses. However, the weights were designed for use with data from their respective studies. Users should be aware that weights are similarly named across the BPS second follow-up studies and should account for this when concurrently analyzing data for the two studies. Specifically, weights designed for BPS:96/01, the second follow-up study for the BPS:96 cohort, cannot be used to weight analyses using participants from the BPS:04 cohort, and vice versa. This section summarizes information on the available weights for both BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, provides guidance to users in choosing the weight most suited for their analyses, and discusses variance estimation techniques.

Blank cells in table 5 indicate that the subgroup's response was not required for that study. For example, of the 9,130 study participants who responded to the BPS:96/01 interview (and thus have a value for the analysis weight WTB000), 9,000 also responded to the NPSAS:96 interview (and thus have a value for WTD000).

However, for users who desire an analysis weight specific to their research design, BPS staff included weight components on the BPS:04/09 data files. 13 These include \u2022 NPSAS:04 institution weight components (WT1-WT4); \u2022 NPSAS:04 student weight components (WT5-WT8); \u2022 BPS:04/06 student weight components (B6A_WT1-B6A_WT4); \u2022 analysis weight WTA000 components (B9A_WT1 and B9A_WT2); \u2022 analysis weight WTB000 components (B9B_WT1 and B9B_WT2); \u2022 analysis weight WTC000 components (B9C_WT1 and B9C_WT2); and \u2022 analysis weight WTD000 components (B9D_WT1 and B9D_WT2). To create an analysis weight specific to a particular design, data users can multiply components associated with the studies relevant to their research. For example, users comparing NPSAS:04 and BPS:04/06 interview responses could calculate a new analysis weight as follows: (NPSAS:04 institution weights) \u00d7 (NPSAS:04 student weights) \u00d7 (BPS:04/06 student weights) = (WT1 \u00d7 WT2 \u00d7 WT3 \u00d7 WT4) \u00d7 (WT5 \u00d7 WT6 \u00d7 WT7 \u00d7 WT8) \u00d7 (B6A_WT1 \u00d7 B6A_WT2 \u00d7 B6A_WT3 \u00d7 B6A_WT4)."}, {"section_title": "Variance Estimation", "text": "Applying analysis weights to BPS data generates nationally representative estimates, but in order to properly calculate the variances associated with those estimates, researchers must use additional procedures.

For software that is unable to produce bootstrap variance estimates, BRR estimation techniques can be used. As with BPS:96/01, BPS staff also conducted the Taylor series linearization procedure. This procedure assumed institutions were sampled with replacement. The PSUs and variance estimation strata associated with BPS:04/09 analysis weights are provided in appendix B. In addition to this procedure, BPS staff also conducted the Taylor series linearization procedure for BPS:04/09 assuming institutions were sampled without replacement, thus accounting for the FPC. When calculating variance estimates using this alternate procedure, analysts need the PSUs and secondary sampling units (SSUs) along with the variance estimation strata and count of the PSUs.  In order to identify individuals and loans across the various source datasets included in the FSA Supplement, a person-level analysis identification number (ID) unique to the individual and, where applicable, a loan identification number (LOANID) unique to the loan are included.

Each record contains information on the loan's program, total amount dispersed, interest rate, status (e.g., paid in full or in deferment), balance (i.e., principal and interest), pertinent dates, and the postsecondary institution associated with the loan. Analysts should be aware that the entity granting a deferment or the entity reporting a default is not always the same entity that reports the loan's status. Therefore, statuses on the NSLDS_LOAN dataset that are associated with default or deferment may not be accurate. Official deferment and default statuses are located in the respective source datasets (i.e., NSLDS_DFR, NSLDS_DEF_STAFF, and NSLDS_DEF_NONSTAFF), also available on the restricted-use files. Loans are considered closed when the borrower repays the outstanding balance, the remaining balance is written off by the lender (or other managing entity), or the loan is consolidated. Upon closure of a loan, the entity tracking the balance should set the outstanding principal and interest balances to zero dollars. In rare instances, the entity has set the loan's status to closed but did not set the remaining balance to zero. Therefore, users should consider both a loan's balance and status when identifying closed loans. Data users should also be aware that it is not always possible to track consolidated loans within NSLDS. Consolidating loans involves transferring the total remaining balance (i.e., principal and interest) from an underlying set of loans (known as \"child loans\") to the principal balance of a new Consolidation Loan (known as the \"parent loan\").

Each record provides the balance and date when that balance was considered current. The entity managing the loan (e.g., servicer, lender, or collection agency) is required to update both the principal balance and interest balance quarterly, although updates can occur more frequently. In 2005, when ED began tracking and storing outstanding principal and interest balances on federal loans, every loan (i.e., closed or open) was added to NSLDS and the current balance was recorded. Therefore, for loans that were closed before 2005, the balance datasets contain one record with an associated balance of zero dollars; for loans that were open in 2005, the balance datasets contain balance histories from 2005 forward; and for loans that were disbursed in or after 2005, the balance datasets contain complete balance histories. The principal balance on most loans originates when the loan is first disbursed and may increase until the total amount of the loan is disbursed to the borrower. Principal balances can also increase due to capitalized interest (i.e., interest that has been removed from the interest balance and added to the principal). Interest can be capitalized for many reasons. For example, when an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan enters repayment, the interest accrued while the participant was in school is typically capitalized. Or, in the case of default, the outstanding interest balance at the time of default is usually capitalized. The principal balance of a Consolidation Loan is equal to the total remaining balance (i.e., principal and interest) of its child loans. Upon closure of a loan, the entity tracking the balance should update the outstanding principal and interest balance records to reflect a balance of zero dollars. In rare instances, the entity updated the data contained in the NSLDS_LOAN dataset, but not NSLDS_OPB and NSLDS_OIB.

In particular, Stafford Loan, Direct Loan, and FFEL loan defaults are recorded separately from other federal loans. As a result, default data for the FSA Supplement were compiled from multiple NSLDS tables and recorded in two separate datasets: one for the Direct Loan and FFEL loan programs (i.e., Stafford Loans) (NSLDS_DEF_STAFF) and one for all other loan types, namely Perkins Loans (NSLDS_DEF_NONSTAFF). Currently, a Direct Loan or FFEL loan is typically considered to be in default if the borrower fails to make a payment for 270 days. Before October 1998, these loans were considered to be in default if the borrower failed to make a payment for 180 days. In contrast, a Perkins Loan is considered to be in default if the borrower fails to make a payment when due. Users should note that student loan defaults are not automatically recorded; that is, a default record is not generated within NSLDS exactly 270 days after a borrower's latest payment. Differences in the amount of time a student was delinquent before a default occurrence was reported may exist across servicers. A defaulted loan can be rehabilitated, or brought out of default, if the borrower makes a predetermined number of payments of a particular amount within a specified period, as agreed upon with the lender. Currently, rehabilitation agreements for all loan types require nine payments over a period of 10 months. Before July 1, 2006, a borrower was required to make 12 consecutive monthly payments to rehabilitate a defaulted loan. Default data within NSLDS are designed for reporting purposes, such as cohort default rates. The arrangement of these data is not easily restructured for analytic purposes. As a result, BPS staff, with the help of ED's Federal Student Aid office, combined information on defaults, rehabilitations, loan statuses, deferments, and balances across multiple NSLDS tables to create a history of default occurrences. Because loans can be rehabilitated, it is possible for loans to have multiple default occurrences. 17 For Direct Loans and FFEL loans, the source dataset NSLDS_DEF_STAFF contains the reason the default occurrence ended, if applicable, as well as start and end dates for the occurrence. A default occurrence can end because the loan has been rehabilitated, paid in full, consolidated, or discharged. Data from each record can also be used to determine if the loan was still in default at the time of the NSLDS match in April 2016. For all other loan types, exact default end dates are not available, and it is not possible to identify multiple occurrences of default on the same loan. As a result, the source dataset NSLDS_DEF_NONSTAFF contains the latest known status of the loan, the date the loan first entered default, and the date the loan entered its latest known status."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5. Federal Student Aid Supplement Derived Variables", "text": "In addition to the NSLDS datasets described in chapter 4, the FSA Supplement also provides a set of derived variables to assist researchers with analyzing the data. Derived variables for the FSA Supplement have been appended to the derived variable restricted-use files for BPS:96/01 (BPS01DERIVED) and BPS:04/09 (BPS09DERIVED); they are also all publicly available via NCES DataLab tools. The derived variables summarize and, in some cases, synthesize information from NSLDS for each BPS cohort. Most variables exclude Parent PLUS loans because these are the responsibility of the parent, not the student. This exclusion is documented for the relevant variables in the codebooks. For information on specific variable derivations, the SAS code the BPS staff used to derive each variable is available on the restricted-use files. A full list of the available variables and their labels is provided in appendix D. Three naming conventions were used for the derived variables created for the FSA Supplement. First, in order to allow restricted file users to quickly distinguish the FSA Supplement variables from all other BPS second follow-up variables, all FSA Supplement variables are designated with the prefix \"S15.\" Second, variables created using data from one academic year end in the last two digits of that academic year. For example, the derived variable for the total amount borrowed during AY 2000-01 is named \"S15FEDCUMY01.\" Third, BPS staff designated derived variables for the BPS:96 cohort that cover the 20-year period from July 1, 1995, through June 30, 2015, with the suffix \"_20Y.\" Similarly, BPS staff designated variables for the BPS:96 cohort that cover the 12-year period from July 1, 1995, through June 30, 2007, with the suffix \"_12Y.\" The same \"_12Y\" suffix applies to variables for the BPS:04 cohort that cover the 12-year period from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2015. The derived variables are designed for two types of analyses, panel and trend. Panel analyses examine one cohort over time. For example, analysts can use the BPS:04/09 variables T4XOWE06, T4XOWE09, and S15FEDCUM1_12Y to identify the total amount of principal and interest owed on undergraduate federal student loans 3, 6, and 12 years after entering PSE. See figure 4 for a study timeline across academic years. Trend analyses compare multiple cohorts at comparable points in time. Because the BPS:96 cohort is observed over a longer period of time (i.e., 20 years) than the BPS:04 cohort (i.e., 12 years), FSA Supplement data for the two cohorts are not immediately suited for trend analysis. To facilitate trend analyses, BPS staff restricted information from the BPS:96 cohort to the first 12 academic years (1995-96 through 2006-07) and created comparable derived variables, designated with the \"_12Y\" suffix. Note that the variables share the same name for both cohorts. Appendix D provides an indication of whether a comparable variable is available across studies. For example, analysts interested in comparing the total amount of principal and interest owed on federal student loans for individuals in the BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts should use the derived variable S15OWEAMT_12Y, which provides the total amount owed on all federal student loans 12 years after participants entered PSE.

Derived variables for both cohorts indicate whether a study participant ever received a Pell Grant, the latest year a Pell Grant was received, the total number of academic years a Pell Grant was received, and the total amount awarded in Pell Grants by academic year and overall. Note that yearly maximum Pell Grant awards have increased from $3,662 in 1995-96 to $5,775 in 2015-16. The derived variable dataset also includes information about individual loan amounts disbursed to borrowers with varying levels of specificity. Total loan amounts are available by academic year, by academic program level (i.e., undergraduate, graduate, or overall), and by loan program (e.g., Graduate PLUS, Direct, Unsubsidized Stafford). Variables indicating the total number of loans received and the total number of years loans were received, as well as indicators of the first and last years the individual borrowed, are available.

The FSA Supplement offers derived variables that capture information on three specific options: deferment, forbearance, and consolidation. Derived indicator variables on the FSA Supplement identify borrowers who ever postponed payments due to a deferment or forbearance. The derived variable dataset includes counts of deferment occurrences overall and by reason for deferment. An additional variable indicates the most common reason for deferment. See section 4.4 for information on source data for deferment records. Note that each deferment occurrence is identified by a specific point in time, regardless of the number of loans entering deferment at that time. For example, if a borrower has three undergraduate loans and enrolls in graduate school, all three loans will be deferred while the student is enrolled. The derived variables count this as one deferment occurrence due to postsecondary enrollment, even though three loans entered deferment. Counting deferment occurrences as opposed to deferred loans prevents the number of deferment incidences from being artificially inflated when more than one loan enters deferment at the same time for the same reason. While deferments require formal agreements, forbearances are more informal postponements of payments, typically for a short period of time. In some cases, a borrower may ask his/her lender for a temporary delay in payments; in others, the lender may issue a forbearance due to administrative reasons. For example, when a borrower changes payment methods or repayment plans, the lender may issue a short forbearance to prevent a record of a missed payment. NSLDS reliably indicates when a loan has entered forbearance; however, detailed records of why a loan entered forbearance or the duration of the forbearance period are not available, as they are for deferments. Derived variables on the FSA Supplement indicate the total number of forbearances, calculated in the same manner as deferments. The FSA Supplement also provides an indicator of whether a borrower ever consolidated a loan. Consolidation is typically used to simplify payments or obtain a lower interest rate. Borrowers can also use it as a way to get out of default. The FSA Supplement provides variables distinguishing whether the borrower consolidated a loan with or without a prior default. Additionally, derived variables that capture the total amount a borrower consolidated are available. However, because NSLDS data do not always allow for the perfect matching of child to parent loans, only the amount attributed toward the second loan is included in the total amount the borrower consolidated; this prevents double-counting of amounts consolidated."}, {"section_title": "Final Loan Statuses", "text": "Throughout the repayment process, student loans can enter many statuses before being closed. An open loan is a loan with a remaining balance; open loans can take on statuses such as repayment, deferment (see section 5.3.1), or default (see section 5.4). A closed loan is a loan with no remaining balance; loans are closed because the borrower paid the remaining balance in full, the remaining balance was discharged, or the balance has been consolidated. A loan's final status represents the reason the loan was closed. The FSA Supplement derived variables dataset contains variables identifying whether a borrower has ever had a loan with a particular closed status, as well as aggregate statuses for all of a borrower's loans. Dates associated with these statuses are also available. Because defaulting on a student loan can have a significant impact on repayment outcomes, many status variables distinguish between previously or currently defaulted loans and loans that were never in default. For example, the FSA Supplement provides derived variables that identify participants who have paid off any loan, paid off a loan without defaulting, or paid off a loan after defaulting. See section 5.4 for more information on derived variables for student loan defaults. When a borrower pays the remaining balance on a loan, the loan is considered paid in full. Loans are discharged if borrowers die, become permanently and totally disabled, can prove undue hardship in a bankruptcy court, or their school closes. Borrowers can also have loans discharged if they can show that the school falsely certified their eligibility, falsely approved their loan, or did not pay a refund. Discharged loans also include loans that were written off by the lender."}, {"section_title": "Federal Loan Default", "text": "In addition to derived variables on defaulted loan amounts, the FSA Supplement also contains derived variables that can be used to study the occurrence and timing of defaults.

In contrast, a Perkins Loan is considered to be in default if the borrower fails to make a payment when due. The derived variables dataset contains indicators of whether a borrower defaulted, the individual years during which a default occurred, first and latest dates of default, as well as the latest date a default ended and the reason why it ended. An indicator of whether the borrower ever rehabilitated a federal loan is also available. A default occurrence can end because the loan was paid in full, consolidated, discharged, or rehabilitated. Paying off a loan that has been in default can be achieved through deliberate payments (with or without rehabilitation), wage garnishing, treasury offset, or other mandatory seizure of funds. See section 5.3 for more information on derived variables for loan consolidation and discharge. A defaulted loan can be rehabilitated (brought out of default) when the borrower makes a predetermined number of payments of a particular amount within a specified period, as agreed upon with the lender (9 months for most federal loans, though this period has changed over time). Loans rehabilitated on or after August 14, 2008, may not be rehabilitated more than once."}, {"section_title": "External Validity and Comparisons to ED Default Rates", "text": "Analyses based on the FSA Supplement data are not readily comparable to the metrics that ED uses to calculate default rates. The paragraphs below describe the metrics used by ED and explain the differences between those metrics and the data available in the FSA Supplement. Table 9 presents a comparison of details for the ED and BPS default rates. The cohort default rate is a well-known measure of default used by ED as an accountability metric for all postsecondary institutions receiving Title IV aid. Since 2012, only 3-year cohort default rates have been released. This rate is defined as the percentage of Stafford Loan borrowers who entered repayment in a given fiscal year and defaulted at the end of 3 fiscal years (FYs). 18 For this percentage, the denominator is the number of borrowers who had at least one federal loan enter repayment during a specific fiscal year. The numerator is the number of those students who had at least one of those loans in default at the end of the third fiscal year after the year the loan(s) entered repayment. The latest available 3-year cohort default rate, for FY 2013, was 11 percent. This means that 11 percent of borrowers who had at least one loan enter repayment between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, were in default on at least one of those loans as of September 30, 2016. The budget lifetime default rate is the percentage of Stafford Loan dollars originating within a given fiscal year that are projected to be in default during the projected 20-year repayment period for the loan cohort. 19 The latest budget lifetime default rate, for FY 2011, was 18 percent. The cumulative lifetime default rate is the known percentage of Stafford, Parent PLUS, Graduate PLUS, and Consolidation Loans that entered repayment during a given fiscal year and entered default through the end of the most recent fiscal year. The latest cumulative lifetime default rate, for FY 2011, was 10 percent. The most important difference between the ED metrics and the calculations that are possible with FSA Supplement data is that ED defines its cohorts for cumulative lifetime default rate based on when loans originate or when they enter repayment, and BPS cohorts are students who enter PSE during the same academic year. Since BPS is based on students' start dates in PSE and not loan origination dates, two BPS study members within the same cohort can have loans on significantly different repayment plan timelines. Additionally, measures of default in the FSA Supplement include all available federal loans, while most ED metrics are based on a particular loan program. BPS weights are designed to create nationally representative estimates of students beginning their education during AY 1995-96 and AY 2003-04, for the BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts, respectively, but these estimates are not always immediately comparable to other ED sources. For example, consider the FSA Supplement variable S15EVRDEF_20Y from BPS:96/01. It indicates whether a borrower ever defaulted on a federal student loan within the 20-year period for which data are available. Although this may seem similar to a cumulative lifetime rate, it is actually a much broader measurement of default because it includes a wider variety of loan programs, multiple repayment cohorts, and drastically extended default periods. Therefore, default rates created using S15EVRDEF_20Y are expected to be higher than any of the default rates published by ED. In fact, the weighted percentage of borrowers who ever defaulted on a federal student loan 12 years after entering PSE is 23 percent and 27 percent in the BPS:96 and BPS:04 cohorts, respectively. The weighted percentage of borrowers in BPS:96/01 who ever defaulted on a federal student loan 20 years after entering PSE is 30 percent. The source data provide users the flexibility to analyze student loan default for any subset of students; however, researchers should be aware of the impact that study design and weighting procedures have on analyses before comparing estimates to external default rates.

Any additional interest, collection fees, court costs, attorney's fees, and other costs associated with the collection process are added to the amount due. The borrower is no longer entitled to any deferments or forbearances and may be subject to a treasury offset or lottery winnings, as well as administrative wage garnishment. The loan holder might take legal action to force repayment, and credit bureaus are notified, potentially affecting the borrower's credit ratings for years. Finally, students who are in default on any Title IV student loan are not eligible for additional Title IV student Aid until they have made payments of an approved amount for a specified time period. Default rate-The ratio of defaults to all student loans can be measured in loans, dollars, or borrowers; are calculated for various time periods; and can include different mixes of loan types. FSA regularly publishes different types of default rates. Deferment-A deferment is a sanctioned temporary cessation of payments on the principal balance of the loan. To enter into deferment, borrowers must meet certain conditions (e.g., enrollment in postsecondary education, durations of unemployment, Peace Corps participation). If the loan is not subsidized, the interest payments still accrue and may be added to the payments later. Delinquency-A delinquency occurs 1 day after a scheduled payment on a loan is not fully paid. Disbursement-Disbursed federal student aid funds are paid to the student or to the school on behalf of the student for education costs. Federal student aid funds are usually paid in two or more disbursements. The funds are usually used first to pay tuition and fee charges to the school, and any remaining funds, termed \"a refund,\" are then given to the student for living expenses. Expected Family Contribution (EFC)-Used to determine a student's eligibility for need-based federal financial aid, this number represents how much the student, or their family in the case of dependent students, is expected to contribute toward college expenses. This determines the amount of aid for which the student is eligible. It is calculated from the financial information provided by the student in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Financial need-The difference between the cost of attendance at a postsecondary institution and the amount that the student can afford as calculated by their EFC. Forbearance-A forbearance is a temporary cessation of loan principal payments under agreement with the loan servicer, usually for financial hardship. Interest continues to accrue. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)-Students use this form to apply for federal student aid, such as federal grants, loans, or work-study. Grace period-The period of time between when a borrower graduates or leaves school and when he or she is required to begin monthly loan payments is known as the grace period. For Stafford Loans, the grace period is 6 months. If the loan is unsubsidized, interest will accrue during this period. Guaranty agency-Guaranty agencies administered the FFEL program for states on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education from 1965 to 2010. Each state had a designated guaranty agency that received funds from the federal government and borrower fees to pay claims to lenders, process loan applications, maintain information on borrowers and loans, collect payments from defaulted borrowers, educate students about financial aid, and prevent loan defaults. Lender-Financial entities provide the capital for student loans. Under the FFEL program that existed from 1965 to 2010, lenders for federal student loans were commercial banks, credit unions, or private nonprofit financial institutions. Under the Direct Loan program, which began in 1993 and became the exclusive source of federal loans in 2010, the lender is the U.S. Department of Education. Loan discharge-A loan discharge is the release of a borrower from the obligation to repay his or her debt. Federal student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy after the borrower proves undue hardship in an adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy court. Federal loans are also discharged if the borrower dies, if the borrower is found to be permanently and totally disabled, or in some cases, if the borrower's school closes. Federal loan borrowers may also be able to have loans discharged if they can show that the school falsely certified their eligibility, falsely approved their loan, or did not pay a refund. Loan forgiveness-Part or all of some federal loan balances may be forgiven under such conditions as public service or teaching in a school serving low-income students. Loan limits-Federal loan amounts have limits imposed by statute to mitigate the taxpayers' financial risk and use federal resources efficiently. Perkins and PLUS Loans are limited to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received. Stafford Loan limits vary by academic level, class level, dependency status, and whether the loan is subsidized. Further restrictions can be imposed based on the program length, program type, and whether a borrower's parents were rejected for a PLUS Loan. For a discussion of loan limits, see https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#how-much. Loan rehabilitation-Loan rehabilitation is the process of bringing a loan out of default through voluntary borrower payments. To rehabilitate a loan, the borrower must make a specified number of reasonable and affordable payments of an agreed amount on a timely basis over a specified period, in agreement with the lender. The loan is then removed from default status and erased from the borrower's credit report. Loans in good standing-Loans in good standing are neither delinquent (past due on a payment) nor in default and are in regular repayment status. Outstanding balance-The outstanding balance can consist of principal, interest, or both owed by the borrower. The principal diminishes over time, as does the total outstanding balance, if sufficient payments are made to also cover interest due. If insufficient or no payments are made, interest can increase the total outstanding balance over time. Pell Grant-Pell Grants are federal grants awarded on the basis of financial need to undergraduates who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree, although students enrolled in postbaccalaureate teacher certification programs receive Pell Grants in some cases. The amount of the grant is determined by the student's financial need, the cost of attendance, and the planned intensity of enrollment. Statute determines the maximum award amount, which was $5,730 in AY 2014-15. Details on Pell Grants can be found at the following URL: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell. Treasury offset-Treasury offset debt collection is a form of debt collection in which the government seizes the federal or state tax refunds of defaulted student borrowers. Details regarding debt collections, including Treasury offsets, can be found at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default/collections.
