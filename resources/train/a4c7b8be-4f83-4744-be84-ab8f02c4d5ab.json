Since February 2020, the frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant has increased significantly and has become the dominant variant over the course of the pandemic (2) .\nThe D614G variant is shown to associate with higher viral loads in patients, though there is currently insufficient scientific evidence showing the effect of D614G mutation in increased infectivity and transmissibility (3, 4) . The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., presents severe symptoms including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (5) , neurological symptoms, organ failure, and death. More importantly, severe COVID-19 patients may experience dysregulation of an appropriate immune response, characterized by lymphopenia (6) , high neutrophil levels in peripheral blood (7) , and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (8) . While repurposed therapeutics such as monoclonal antibody cocktails, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone have shown promising results in treating COVID-19 (9) . The Pfizer/BioNTech (NCT04368728) and Moderna (NCT04283461) vaccines were recently approved by the FDA for emergency use (10, 11) , however, their long-term effects have not yet been documented (12) (13) (14) . Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that viral variants that develop relative resistance to the current vaccines and antibody treatments are becoming more common. There could also be subsets of patients who may not be responsive to the vaccines (e.g., people with immune-compromising conditions), and therefore there is a need for an alternative protection or treatment strategy.\nMultiple sources of NK cells are found in cord blood (CB), peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (15, 16) . NK cells isolated from these sources can be further modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for treating a variety of cancer and infectious diseases (17) . Recent preclinical studies of CAR-NK in cancer immunotherapy show several advantages of CAR-NK cells over CAR-T cells in clinical safety. For instance, CAR-NK cells do not present additional risk for the development of severe graft-versus-hostdisease (GVHD) (18) . More importantly, CAR-NK cells are associated with reduced host cytotoxicity compared to CAR-T cells. Specifically, NK cells are less likely to induce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that could potentially exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms in severe patients (19) . Additionally, CAR-NK cells have potential to be developed as a 'off-the-shelf' CAR product in the near future (18, 20, 21) . Given these aforementioned reasons, NK and CAR-NK cell-based immunotherapeutics have been rapidly developed for COVID-19 treatment. Specifically, adoptive transfer of monocytes or NK cells (NCT04375176, NCT04280224, and NCT04365101) and the universal 'off-the-shelf' NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells (NCT04324996) expanded from CB are currently being studied in clinical trials for COVID -19. Previous studies show that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 79.6% identical to that of SARS-CoV (22) . Similar to SARS-CoV, the Spike protein expressed on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and facilitates virus entry (22, 23) . Several neutralizing antibodies were isolated from memory B cells of convalescent SARS patients which possess cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV-2. One such antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 by binding to both the 'closed' and 'open' ectodomain trimer conformations of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (24) . In this study, we developed a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 using the scFv domain of S309. Here, we show that both the S309-CAR-NK-92MI cell line and primary S309-CAR-NK cells expanded from PB (hereinafter S309-CAR-NK primary ) cells effectively bind to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the D614G variant pseudovirus. Moreover, compared to the previously generated Spikeprotein-targeting CR3022-CAR-NK cells (25), S309-CAR-NK cells show superior killing activities against target cells (e.g., A549, an epithelial carcinoma derived from a 58 year old Caucasian male with a non-small-cell lung carcinoma (26)) expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein and mutant S protein (hereinafter, A549-Spike and A549-Spike D614G, respectively) in vitro. S309-CAR-NK primary cells show increased productions of TNF-a and IFN-g when cocultured with A549-Spike and A549-Spike D614G target cells in comparison to CR3022-CAR-NK primary . The \"4-hour gold standard\" chromium release assay further confirmed the superior killing activities of both S309-CAR-NK-92MI cell line and S309-CAR-NK primary . These data show that 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as to treat immunocompromised patients or those with comorbidities such as diabetes, cancer, malnutrition, and certain genetic disorders who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Generation and characterization of S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells", "text": "To develop an NK cell-based immunotherapy for a COVID-19 prevention and treatment, we cloned the scFv domain of S309 into an SFG retroviral vector that contains a human IgG1 hinge and CH2-CH3 domain, CD28 transmembrane (27) domain and intracellular domain, 4-1BB intracellular domain, and CD3zeta intracellular domain (Fig. 1a) . After construction of S309-CAR, we successfully generated S309-CAR-NK cells in the human NK-92MI cell line (Fig. 1a) . Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids containing S309-CAR in the SFG backbone, retroviral helper plasmids RDF and PegPam3, as previously described (28) . The SFG retrovirus particles were then used to transduce NK-92MI cells. After 4-5 days, NK-92MI and S309-CAR cells were stained with CD56 and human IgG (H+L) and the CAR expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Around 70% of CD56 + S309-CAR + NK-92MI cells were observed (Fig. 1b) .\nThen, the subsequent S309-CAR positive NK-92 cells were sorted by flow cytometry to achieve high CAR expression levels (Fig. 1b) . In summary, we have successfully established the surface expression of S309-CAR-NK cells.\nTo characterize S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells, we examined the expressions of several key immunoreceptors on S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells by flow cytometry. These receptors include TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3, KLRG1, CTLA-4, PD-1, CD69, CD8A, NKG2C, CD94, DNAM-1, 2B4, NKG2D, NKp46, and CD16 (Fig. 1c) . Overall, the expressions of these activating and inhibitory receptors are comparable between parental NK-92MI and S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells, indicating the comparable characteristics of NK-92MI at pre-and post-transduction stages."}, {"section_title": "S309-CAR-NK cells bind to the immunogenic receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S viral particles", "text": "After successful establishment of S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells, we then assessed the binding ability of S309-CAR-NK cells to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.\nSince S309 neutralizing antibody was isolated from memory B cells of a SARS patient (24) , we also included the recombinant His-RBD protein of SARS-CoV as a positive control. S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells and NK-92MI cells were incubated with the His-RBD of SARS-CoV or RBD-SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting complex was then recognized by anti-His and its corresponding fluorophore-conjugated-secondary antibody. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the binding efficiency of S309-CAR to the RBD of S protein from either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with results from previous studies (29) , S309 recognizes and strongly binds to the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 2a) . We therefore conclude that S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells can specifically bind to the recombinant His-RBD protein of SARS-CoV and the RBD-SARS-CoV-2.\nHowever, the partial RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 S may not fully reflect the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. We therefore evaluated the binding ability of S309-CAR-NK cells to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S viral particles that we generated.\nPseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were produced by transfecting 293T cells with a combination of pCMV-luciferase-ecoGFP, pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 Spike, pLP1, and pLP2 plasmids. The supernatant containing pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were used for the pseudovirus binding assay (Fig. 2b) . To further confirm the presence of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, we used the collected SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect 293T-hACE2 cells. After 48-72 hours of incubation, we observed the GFP expression of the infected 293T-hACE2 cells by EVOS florescence microscope (data not shown) and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. S2) .\nPrevious studies show that the RBD of S glycoprotein binds to ACE2 and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry (30) . Thus, we included 293T-hACE2 in our experiment as a positive control (Fig. 2c) . Full-length Spike and RBD-containing S1 subunit recombinant proteins were also included as additional control groups ( Fig. 2c & 2d) . To evaluate the binding ability of S309-CAR-NK-92MI to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S virus, S309-CAR-NK-92MI, NK-92MI or 293T-hACE2 were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S viral particles, S1 subunit, or full-length S recombinant protein. The complex can be recognized by anti-S1 subunit antibody and its corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. As expected, S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells were able to bind to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S viral particles with slightly lower binding efficiency than that of recombinant protein groups (Fig. 2c) . Surprisingly, S309-CAR-NK cells showed a stronger binding efficiency to the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles compared to that of 293T-hACE2 cells, suggesting that S309-CAR-NK-92MI may have superior binding capabilities to the SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to the natural receptor, ACE2 ( Fig. 2d) . In summary, S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells can strongly and specifically bind to the RBD-containing S1 subunit recombinant protein and the full-length pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S viral particles. (Fig. 3a) . On average, the transfection efficiencies of RBD proteins on 293T-hACE2 cells were greater than 90% as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3b ) and confocal microscopy (data not shown). For the generation of the stable A549-Spike cell line (Table S1) , we transfected 293T cells with a combination of plasmids containing RDF, Pegpam3, and SARS-CoV-2 S in SFG backbone to produce SARS-CoV-2 S retrovirus that was subsequently transduced into A549 cells (Fig. 3a) . The S protein expression on A549 is weaker compared to 293T cells (data not shown). The pre-sorting transduction efficiency on A549 cell line was around 70% verified by flow cytometry."}, {"section_title": "S309-CAR-NK cells can be activated by SARS-CoV", "text": "Transduced A549-Spike cells were subsequently sorted to achieve homogeneously high expression levels of S protein compared with 293T-hACE2-RBD cells ( Fig. 3b) Next, we examined the activation of S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells by 293T-hACE2-RBD or A549-Spike using the conventional CD107a assay (31) . Expectedly, we observed a significant increase in the surface level expression of CD107a molecules on S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells after co-culturing with susceptible 293T-hACE2-RBD or A549-Spike compared to that of parental 293T-hACE2 or A549 cells. An increase in total CD107a\n(percentage[%] and mean fluorescence intensity [MFI]) on S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells, compared to that of NK-92MI cells, was observed ( Fig. 3c) . In conclusion, S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells can be activated by both 293T-hACE2-RBD and A549-Spike cells.\nTo evaluate the killing activity of S309-CAR-NK-92MI against SARS-CoV-2-proteinexpressing target cells in vitro, we used the standard 4-hour Chromium-51 (Cr 51 ) release assay (a gold standard assay to evaluate the cytotoxicity of immune cells) (32). The data show that S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells effectively kill both 293T-hACE2-RBD and A549-Spike cells by in vitro Cr 51 release assay (Fig. 3d) . We also used an irrelevant target cell line, HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line) as a negative control, to confirm the specificity of our S309-CAR-NK. As expected, we did not observe a significant difference in the killing activity of S309-CAR-NK-92MI compared to that of wild-type NK-92MI cells ( Fig. 3d) . Here, by using three different cell lines, we demonstrated the S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells can specifically target and kill SARS-CoV-2-protein-expressing target cells."}, {"section_title": "Expanded primary S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill SARS-CoV-2-proteinexpressing target cells", "text": "After evaluating the killing function of S309-CAR-NK-92MI cell line, we then examined whether the expanded S309-CAR-NK primary cells also have similar killing function against SARS-CoV-2-protein-expressing cells, given the natural malignancy of NK-92MI cell line (17) . To expand human primary NK cells from peripheral blood (hereinafter PBNK), we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) from buffy coats from healthy donors and cocultured with 100-Gy irradiated 221-mIL21 feeder cells supplemented with 200 U/mL IL-2 and 5 ng/mL IL-15, as described (33, 34). In parallel, 293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids containing S309-CAR in the SFG backbone, RDF, and PegPam3, as previously described (28) . The SFG retrovirus particles were used to transduce expanded PBNK cells at Day 4 ( Fig. 4a) . After 48 hours, primary S309-CAR-NK cells were transferred to a G-Rex plate for continued culturing for 21 days. The NK cell purity and CAR expression were determined using flow cytometry by staining both PBNK and S309-CAR-NK primary cells with anti-CD56, anti-CD3 and anti-human IgG (H+L). On average, the NK cell purity is around 90% with approximately 80% CAR transduction efficiencies for the S309-CAR-NK primary (Fig. 4b) .\nTo immunophenotype the expanded primary S309-CAR-NK primary , we stained both expanded PBNK and S309-CAR-NK primary cells for various important activating and inhibitory receptors by which the expressions were determined by flow cytometry. The inhibitory receptors include CTLA4, PD-1, NKG2A, TIGIT, KLRG1, TIM3, and LAG3.\nThe activating receptors include CD16, 2B4, NKG2C NKG2D, DNAM-1, CD94, and NKp46 (Fig. 4c) . In general, the expressions of these immunomodulatory receptors are comparable between expanded PBNK and S309-CAR-NK primary cells.\nSimilar to S309-CAR-NK-92MI, we also used the 4-hour Cr 51 release assay to evaluate the killing function of expanded primary S309-CAR-NK primary . The data show that S309-CAR-NK primary cells effectively kill A549-Spike cells compared to expanded PBNK cells (Fig. 4d) . In summary, we demonstrated the expanded S309-CAR-NK primary cells can also kill the SARS-CoV-2-protein-expressing target cells, indicating S309-CAR-NK primary could potentially become a promising COVID-19 treatment."}, {"section_title": "S309-CAR-NK cells have higher killing activities than CR3022-CAR-NK cells against SAR-CoV-2-protein-expressing cells", "text": "CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cell line was previously generated (25). Previous studies showed that S309 neutralizing antibody recognizes both open and closed conformations of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, however, CR3022 can only bind to the open state ( Fig. 5a ) (24, 35) . To further determine the functionalities of S309-CAR-NK in vitro, we compared the activation levels of S309-CAR-NK-92MI and CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells when cocultured with susceptible 293T-hACE2-RBD or A549-Spike target cells. As expected, we did not observe a significant difference in total CD107a, in both percentages and total mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), against the 293T-hACE2-RBD target cell. However, the expression levels of surface CD107a on CR3022-CAR-NK cells were significantly lower when cocultured with A549-Spike compared to that of S309-CAR-NK cells (Fig. 5b) . Altogether, these data suggest that the conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimers play a critical role in CAR recognition and binding ability and superior activation capabilities by S309-CAR molecules.\nTo further evaluate the function of S309-CAR-NK-92MI cells, we compared its killing activities to the CR3022-CAR-NK-92MI cells. Both 293T-hACE2-RBD and A549-Spike cells were used as susceptible target cells.

Considering NK-92MI is a cell line and may not fully reflect the true functions of primary CAR-NK cells (17), we also generated S309-CAR-NK primary and CR3022-CAR-NK primary from expanded PBNK. Expectedly, S309-CAR-NK primary cells have better killing activities than CR3022-CAR-NK primary (Fig. 5d) , indicating that S309-CAR-NK is superior to CR3022-CAR-NK, and may have a better potential in targeting and killing SARS-CoV-2-protein-expressing cells in vivo."}, {"section_title": "S309-CAR-NK primary cells can also target SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant", "text": "Next, we evaluated the ability by which S309-CAR-NK primary cells bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant by flow cytometry.

To ensure the functions of S309-CAR-NK primary are not altered by the G614 mutation, we also generated A549-Spike D614G cell line. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutagenize SFG-SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid (Table 1) . Subsequently, we generated A549-Spike D614G cell line using retrovirus system, which 293T cells were transduced with a combination of RDF, Pegpam3, and SARS-CoV-2 S D614G in SFG backbone. We then performed an intracellular cytokine assay to quantify the intracellular productions of TNF-a and IFN-g of S309-CAR-NK primary cells (Fig. 6b) . In addition to using expanded PBNK, CD19-CAR-NK cells (specific for the treatment of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia) (21) were also included to show the specificity of S309-CAR-NK primary against target cells expressing S protein or D614G variant. Consistent with our previous result in Fig. 5d , S309-CAR-NK primary produce higher amount of intracellular TNF-a and IFN-g compared to that of CR3022-CAR-NK primary when cocultured with A549-Spike target cells. More importantly, the intracellular cytokine productions of S309-CAR-NK primary cells when cocultured with A549-Spike D614G target cells were similar to that of A549-Spike, indicating S309-CAR-NK primary cells can also target and kill cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant. Surprisingly, TNF-a production slightly decreased when CR3022-CAR-NK primary cells were cocultured with A549-Spike D614G but not IFN-g (Fig. 6b) .\nWe also used Cr 51 release assay to further determine the killing activities of S309-CAR-NK primary cells against A549-Spike D614G target cells.
