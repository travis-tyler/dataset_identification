[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "To complete their life cycle, trematodes from the family Schistosomatidae utilize primarily avian or, mammalian (often rodent) definitive hosts and snail intermediate hosts (Brant and Loker, 2005; Gordy et al., 2018; Brant and Loker, 2009a) . Embryonated eggs leave the definitive host, hatch into free-living miracidia, which actively seek out a snail host. Upon finding a snail, they penetrate the snail intermediate host. Inside the snail, miracidia develop into sporocysts, which produce cercariae asexually. The free-living cercariae are then shed from the snail host back into the water where they search for their definitive host. Accidental contact and penetration into human skin may cause the allergic condition known as cercarial dermatitis or swimmer's itch. Trematodes of the genera Trichobilharzia, Gigantobilharzia, Dendritobilharzia, and Schistosomatium have all been implicated in swimmer's itch outbreaks (Baird and Wear, 1987; Batten, 1956; Coady et al., 2006; Cort, 1928; Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 et al., 1999; Verbrugge et al., 2004; Zbikowska, 2004) .\nNumerous species of schistosome are capable of causing swimmer's itch in Michigan. Past studies have found that T. stagnicolae is very common in the region, cycling through Stagnicola emgarinata snails as the intermediate host, and common mergansers as the avian definitive host (Mergus merganser). As part of a previous study, we also confirmed Dendritobilharzia sp. Miracidia in the feces of a mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and a Canada goose (Branta canadensis) (Rudko et al., 2018) . Others have reported Gigantobilharzia huronensis cycling in red winged blackbirds, as well as T. szidati and T. elvae in Lymnaea stagnalis snails (Strohmt et al., 1981) .\nRemoving summer resident common mergansers was shown to be an effective swimmer's itch control method on Glen Lake in Leelanau County, MI, (Blankespoor and Reimink, 1991) . This methodology continued on similar lakes in Michigan and Maine through the 1990s and early 2000s, and again beginning in 2015. In 2018, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources began providing nuisance control permits to trap and relocate summer resident common mergansers for lakes that can demonstrate there is a swimmer's itch problem caused, at least in part, by T. stagnicolae cycling through S. emarginata and common mergansers. Our fieldwork in 2017 and 2018, along with reports from residents at specific lakes, showed that despite extensive control efforts on a number of lakes in Northern Michigan, some programs have not been effective at reducing the snail infection prevalence or the number of schistosome cercariae in the water (Reimink and Hanington, 2017) . To understand why merganser relocation was unsuccessful, improved resolution in swimmer's itch assessment tools was required.\nThe utility of PCR as a method for the detection of avian schistosomes in surface water samples was first demonstrated Schets et al. (2010) , utilizing an assay developed by Hertel et al. (2002) . More recently in 2013, Kane et al., 2013 demonstrated the detection and quantification of schistosome DNA in snails using real-time PCR, which demonstrates the flexibility of molecular detection methods in parasitology. Finally, in 2015 a pan-avian trematode qPCR assay, capable of detecting all members of the family Schistosomatidae was developed (Narayanan et al., 2015) , and has been utilized as a DNA-based method for assessing cercariae abundance at recreational beaches (Rudko et al., 2018; Froelich et al., 2019) . It has also been used to advance our understanding of how the physical environment plays a role in concentrating cercariae under certain conditions (notably wind direction) (Rudko et al., 2018) . This test has been particularly useful in measuring the relative abundance of avian schistosomes in the lakes of Michigan, where swimmer's itch is a significant recreational water issue (Rudko et al., 2018) .\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) exhibits incredible sensitivity and specificity, with the ability to accurately amplify DNA of specific species of parasite from environmental water samples. Water sampling and detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) is faster than snail collection and analysis, and provides more consistent data since representative snail sampling can be problematic due to low infection prevalence and uneven host distribution (Bass et al., 2015; Brown et al., 1988; Crews and Esch, 1986; Coady et al., 2006) . Molecular methods are more cost effective and less labor intensive than specimen collection (Huver et al., 2015) . With sufficient genetic information, species-specific qPCR tests can be developed, which would allow for assessment of multiple avian schistosome populations within a complex water sample. This is akin to the approach used in Hust et al. (2004) , which used the ITS region to discriminate between two microphallid species in their intermediate host. Various applications of eDNA testing to environmental parasitology have been recently reviewed in Bass et al. (2015) .\nThe purpose of this study was two-fold. First we report four new diagnostic tests to detect the swimmer's itch causing parasites in recreational water and in doing so demonstrate that detection of a specific schistosome species from a complex sample is possible. Secondly, we deployed these tests to attempt to determine why swimmer's itch continues to persist in Northern Michigan despite an extensive control program. The four qPCR assays developed in this study are specific to the cytochrome oxidase C gene (CO1) of three species of Trichobilharzia, and a species of Anserobilharzia in Northern Michigan. These species were selected because snail surveys conducted in 2018 on numerous lakes in Michigan found them to be the most prevalent swimmer's itchcausing parasites in the area. Each species cycles through a unique bird host, and utilizes snails common to all lakes in the region. These assays were deployed to determine the relative abundance of each species in water samples collected as part of a swimmer's itch monitoring program in Northern Michigan in 2018. Snail and waterfowl diversity and schistosome diversity, as measured by CO1 barcoding of miracidia and cercariae, was determined for each lake. Cercariae abundance in each water sample was assessed using the pan-avian schistosome qPCR test (Narayanan et al., 2015; Rudko et al., 2018) , and a semi-quantitative assessment of the avian schistosome species found in those water samples testing positive using the pan-avian schistosome assay was conducted using the species-specific qPCR assays reported in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Locations", "text": "Seven lakes in Northern Michigan were selected for study: Big and Little Glen (44.868116, Walloon (45.279333, -85 .007122) Lake (Charlevoix County).

Following collection, snails were isolated into individual plastic wells filled with well water, housed throughout the day and night, and exposed to bright natural and fluorescent light the next morning, as described in Blankespoor and Reimink (1991) . Snail genera were identified morphologically. Trematode cercariae shed from snails were pipetted into collection tubes and preserved with 95% ethanol (schistosomes were noted). Ethanol preserved samples were stored at \u223c \u221220C and then transported to the University of Alberta for further processing.

South Lake Leelanau, Long Lake, Elk Lake, Skegemog Lake, Lake Charlevoix and Walloon Lake did not have control programs. 25 L water samples were taken mid-July from sites around each lake to assess cercariae concentrations. Elk Lake, Walloon Lake, North Lake Leelanau and Glen Lake had the highest numbers of avian schistosome cercariae per litre (Fig. 1) .\nWater samples from each lake were randomly selected to be tested in the species-specific qPCR analyses.

Shoreline waterfowl surveys were also conducted for each lake. Mallard ducks were the most abundant bird recorded at all lakes, regardless of whether a merganser control program was in place, followed by Canada geese (Table 5) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Results of monitoring for swimmer's itch using the 18S pan-avian schistosome assay demonstrated that swimmers itch continues to be a problem at lakes in Northern Michigan even with continued relocation of common mergansers, with some water samples containing hundreds of cercariae per litre (Fig. 1) . As has previously been demonstrated, cercariae move with the bulk flow of water; wind and water movement towards shore concentrate cercariae in different locations (Froelich et al., 2019; Rudko et al., 2018) . Snail surveys of avian schistosomes followed by CO1 barcoding identified three species of Trichobilharzia (szidati, stagnicolae, and physellae), and A. brantae, infecting four species of snail, and three bird hosts at the lakes studied (Fig. 3, Table 2 ). The presence of other swimmer's itch causing parasites in the area and their hosts may undermine the merganser relocation control effort, as it suggests that the swimmer's itch issues stem from multiple species, rather than just one. This observation prompted us to hypothesize that perhaps one of these other species of swimmer's itch causing avian schistosomes could now be present at a high relative abundance, and be dominating cases of swimmer's itch in the region.\nUsing these species-differentiating qPCR tests to identify the species contributing to swimmer's itch in our study lakes has yielded a never before seen level of resolution. The results of the species-specific qPCR assays show that while T. physellae also cycles at many lakes, they are still observed in far lower abundance than T. stagnicolae (Fig. 2) , which is contrary to the hypothesis that merganser relocation should be reducing T. stagnicolae abundance. Despite the high density of Canada geese present at all the lakes studied, A. brantae was only detected at Lake Charlevoix, and, again, despite the large number of mallards observed on the lakes, T. szidati was only detected at North Lake Leelanau.\nThe high relative abundance of T. stagnicolae at all of the lakes in question, even those (Big and Little Glen lake, North Lake Leelanau, Fig. 2 .

The percent contribution (based on gene copy number) of each species was calculated. Fig. 3 .

We hypothesize that either that a second bird host, sympatric with M. merganser could also host T. stagnicolae, or that the T. stagnicolae population is being driven by non-resident merganser populations that are likely comprised of migratory birds in the fall or spring (ie: those that are not targeted by the merganser brood relocation programs). While we have identified in this paper T. stagnicolae miracidia in the feces of M. merganser, it is possible another host exists that is also contributing T. stagnicolae to the ecosystem. T. stagnicolae is capable of infecting canaries (Brant and Loker, 2009a,b) , and other passerine bird species have also been documented with Gigantobilharzia infections, and thus, could also be host to other avian schistosomes such as T. stagnicolae. Based on our data, while we could only speculate on other potential hosts, 57 species of bird were observed in Michigan during the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 2016 to 2017 alone, with over 25 species of water bird identified (Pardieck et al., 2018) . Nonetheless, we are confident based on our survey data that mallards do not transmit T. stagnicolae (Table 2) , which has also been corroborated experimentally by challenging mallards and Peking ducks (Brant and Loker, 2009a,b) . Our previous work has not found T. stagnicolae miracidia in the feces of B. canadiensis (Rudko et al., 2018) ; however, their abundance in the region perhaps warrants a more comprehensive assessment of the schistosome species present in their feces (Table 5) .\nThe utility of this work extends far beyond the scope of swimmer's itch monitoring and assessment of trematode flatworm biodiversity. Molecular methods, including qPCR, have been used for decades in public health microbiology to source track contributions of fecal indicator bacteria to different watersheds (Joyce M. Simpson et al., 2002) . With this study we aim to demonstrate the utility of such an approach for detecting parasites in water bodies. Many parasites utilize environmental pathways, like water, but also soil or sediments, as a means of transmission, and with more genetic information becoming available, it is possible to achieve species level resolution for certain targets in these matrices. Such assays can answer fundamental questions about parasite distribution in complex systems with regards to environmental variables, but also can provide insight into definitive and intermediate hosts in the area. Moreover, many parasitic flatworms are of agricultural or human health relevance. As control efforts for these parasites places continued pressure on specific life cycles stages, to ultimately achieve control, the life cycle must be broken, which could be assessed using qPCR assays targeting the environmental stages of these parasites.\nThis study was prompted by the observation, and reports from residents, of the continued issue of swimmer's itch in Michigan. After undertaking a comprehensive survey of parasites found in bird feces and snails, we identified 3 other species of avian trematode present at nine lakes in northern Michigan. We developed highly sensitive and specific diagnostic qPCR tests capable of determining the relative abundance of each species to avian schistosome positive water samples. To our surprise, our results demonstrate that T. stagnicolae continues to be the dominant parasite, even at lakes undertaking laborious and expensive merganser relocation programs. There remains much to be discovered regarding the life history of T. stagnicolae in Michigan, and future work will continue to investigate if migratory mergansers contribute parasites into the lake in early spring and late fall, resulting in snail infections and swimmer's itch outbreaks during the summertime, or if a sympatric host, yet undiscovered, could be contributing this elusive, yet abundant parasite into the waters of northern Michigan.
