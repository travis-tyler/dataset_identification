The ELS project tracks individual data on thousands of students, allowing researchers to conduct much better analyses than are possible with school-level data. This study also reviews the large body of previous empirical research on private schools and school choice programs."}, {"section_title": "Key findings include:", "text": "The ELS data show that students in private schools made better academic gains than students in public schools, even after controlling for race, income, parental education and family composition. Between 10th and 12th grade, private schools provided one point of additional growth in math (out of 50 points) compared to public schools. Racial and ethnic differences accounted for up to one point of growth, differences in family income among those making at least $15,000 accounted for up to one point, having both parents live at home accounted for 0.3 points and parental education accounted for up to 0.7 points. Because the data used in this analysis track individual students over time, the analysis is better able to distinguish the influence of real differences in school quality on student outcomes from the influence of parents' and schools' selecting which students will attend private schools. The private school effect is substantial in size. One point out of 50 is equal to 2 percent of the total difference from the very lowest-scoring students to the very highest-scoring students. For purposes of illustration, if similar benefits are present in all grade levels, a student who attended private school for 12 years would reach a level of academic achievement six points higher out of 50, or 12 percent of the total spectrum from the highest to the lowest students, than that same student would have achieved with the equivalent years of public school education. The finding that private schools produce greater academic achievement confirms similar findings from a large body of previous research, including studies using optimal \"random assignment\" methods. However, it stands against the finding of a study released last year by the Department of Education, which drew on an inferior data set and used grossly inappropriate methods of analysis. The ELS data also show that race relations are very similar in public and private schools. Tenth graders in both kinds of schools have almost exactly the same numbers of close friends of other races, and characterize the race relations at their schools in very similar ways (though private school students are somewhat less likely to say that students of different races fight often at their schools). Previous research has shown that private schools in voucher programs have much lower levels of segregation than public schools in the same cities. Students in the ELS data set who were in private schools in 10th grade were less likely to drop out of school before 12th grade than public school students. However, removing the effects of student selection is much more difficult in analyses of dropout rates than it is in analyses of test scores, so this result should be interpreted with caution. Controlling for demographic factors, the analysis finds that private school students were three percentage points less likely to drop out than their public school peers. Racial and ethnic differences accounted for three to four percentage points, differences in family income among those making at least $15,000 accounted for three to five percentage points and having both parents live at home accounted for five percentage points. Parental education made the biggest difference; if both of a student's parents had dropped out, the student was 13 percentage points more likely to do so as well. Previous research finds that private schools in general, and school choice programs in particular, convey other benefits. They improve the academic outcomes of public schools through healthy competition, provide better special education services, do a better job of inculcating civic participation and tolerance for the rights of others, provide about the same level of protection against staff misconduct, and produce large fiscal savings for both state budgets and local public school districts."}, {"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION", "text": "MONOPOLY VERSUS MARKETS: THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS & SCHOOL CHOICE"}, {"section_title": "An Education Market or an Education Monopoly?", "text": "The main reason education policy in the United States is such a contentious issue is because Americans hold two fundamentally opposing worldviews when it comes to education. On one side are those who think that education can be safely entrusted only to a government-owned, government-run monopoly school system. On the other side are those who think that education for all students, including those in public schools, would be better served by opening that system to competition from private providers. On this view, even the public school system itself would be better off if it were not a monopoly. There is a large body of empirical evidence that ought to inform this debate. It may not answer every question, but it provides much useful information. Unfortunately, the debate is too often dominated by myths and anecdotes rather than to an education market, the wealthy may get better services, but the poor would get worse services. Advocates respond that markets would provide all students with better services than the current monopoly system gives them: markets give schools a healthy competitive incentive to improve services to everyone in order to attract and retain students, while a monopoly provider has little incentive to improve services to anyone. Because the controversy is rooted in different expectations of the way markets will affect education, the available evidence ought to play a crucial role in school choice debates. The public ought to know whether the evidence tends to show that the expectations of one side or the other are being borne out."}, {"section_title": "Why Scientifi c Methods Matter", "text": "There are currently 22 school choice programs in 13 states plus the District of Columbia; roughly 130,000 students attend private schools using vouchers or scholarships provided by these programs. With so many programs in operation, it isn't surprising that there is now a large body of high-quality empirical research on school choice programs. What is surprising is the extent to which opinion leaders are either ignorant of or dismissive toward this trove of information. It is especially important to note the high scientifi c quality of the available research on school choice. Usually, it is very diffi cult to study the effects of education policy properly, because student outcomes are affected by so many different infl uences-including demographic factors (income, race, family structure, etc.), school type (public or private) and intangibles such as the level of enthusiasm parents and teachers invest in a child's education. The job of empirical science is to disentangle the infl uence exercised by each of these factors as well as can be done with the available evidence. When it comes to comparing public and private schools, the problem is compounded by selectivity. Students attending private schools are there because their families chose to make a fi nancial sacrifi ce to put them there. In addition, some private schools are selective to some degree in admitting students. Thus, any observable differences between public and private school students may be due to differences in the schools or to parental and school selectivity."}, {"section_title": "The starting point of a scientifi c analysis is", "text": "what is called \"descriptive\" information. This is just the facts-the way things are. Student X has income A, is of race B, comes from a family of structure C, attends a school with characteristics D, E and F, is taught by a teacher with characteristics G, H and I, and so forth. For some questions, descriptive information is enough. For example, critics charge that school choice programs do not provide broad-based access to schools for participating students, while claiming that public schools are committed to accepting every child. To determine whether these statements are true, all we need is descriptive information. As we will see below, the available descriptive information on these claims puts them into a very different light. However, most of the time descriptive information by itself is not enough, because it does not allow us to disentangle which factors are contributing what to which outcomes. In these cases, \"causal\" analysis is needed. For example, it is universally acknowledged that the average level of academic achievement is higher among students in private schools than among students in public schools. But there is a great deal of controversy over why this is. Critics of school choice often claim that it is solely due to the selection of students who enter and remain in private schools-students with higher levels of academic achievement are more likely to seek out private schools, and in turn the private schools are more likely to encourage such students to continue attending. On the other hand, school choice supporters argue that higher levels of academic achievement in private schools are at least partly attributable to the higher quality of the schools, in addition to the infl uence of selection. Making things worse, many of the factors that affect student outcomes are not measurable. The enthusiasm that parents and teachers invest in a student's education has an important impact on the student's outcomes, but we have no scientifi c way to measure such things. Thus, these factors cannot be controlled for statistically. If these unmeasured factors are not systematically different among different groups of students, they don't affect the results of an analysis. For example, if we are comparing test scores of left-handed students and right-handed students in a school, we need not worry about the infl uence of unmeasured factors such as parental and teacher enthusiasm because these are very unlikely to be systematically different among right-handers and left-handers. But a study's results will be undermined if it compares the outcomes of two groups of students where unmeasured factors are systematically different across the two groups. Parental enthusiasm might be expected to differ systematically between students who applied to participate in school choice programs and students who did not. Drawing a direct comparison between the outcomes of two such groups would be inappropriate. This is where the scientifi c quality of the evidence comes in. A study that uses good methods can overcome these problems and provide reliable information about what is infl uencing student outcomes. But if scientifi c procedures are not rigorously followed, we can come to the wrong conclusions about what factors cause what outcomes. A poor or even mediocre quality study is more likely to falsely attribute causal power to a factor that doesn't really matter, or falsely attribute no causal power to a factor that does matter, or falsely attribute one type of infl uence to a factor that actually exerts a different type of infl uence. The gold standard for empirical science is the method known as \"random assignment.\" In this method, subjects are randomly divided into two groups, a group that will receive the treatment being studied (such as school choice) and a control group that will not receive it. Because the two groups are separated only by random assignment, they are likely to be very similar in every respect other than the treatment being studied. Thus, if the two groups have different outcomes, researchers can attribute that difference to the treatment with a high degree of certainty. Random assignment studies are normally very rare in social policy. We do not usually have the opportunity to divide populations by random lottery and apply different policies to them. However, school choice has provided researchers with valuable opportunities to conduct random assignment research because school choice programs are often oversubscribed. When too many people apply to participate in a school choice program, a random lottery is often used to determine which students will be invited to participate. This creates a naturally occurring random assignment situation-applicants who are invited to participate as a result of the lottery are the treatment group, and applicants who are not invited are the control group. Both groups are made up of students whose parents applied to participate in the program; they are separated only by whether their applications were accepted as the result of a random lottery. Where a signifi cant body of random assignment research exists, its fi ndings should take precedence over the fi ndings of other types of studies. No method is as good as random assignment at disentangling the infl uence of a treatment from the infl uence of other factors. In particular, the random assignment method is the best way to ensure that unmeasured factors are not secretly driving the results of a study, since unmeasured factors will not vary systematically across the winners and losers of a random lottery-by definition, nothing can vary systematically across a factor that is random. However, this is not to say that random assignment research is the only kind worth considering. It may be the best kind of research, but where random assignment research cannot be conducted, other kinds of research are well worth conducting. The next best research method is to track year-to-year changes in outcomes for individual students. Although it is not as good as random assignment, this is still a very good method, and its results are widely regarded as being high in scientifi c quality. Tracking individual students over time removes from the analysis most, though not all, of the infl uence of unmeasured factors. If a student is advantaged in a way that is not measurable, that advantage will be present in the student's outcomes for both year one and year two of the study; thus the change in outcomes between year one and year two will mostly be due to other factors-though unmeasured factors will still exert some infl uence on the level of year-to-year change. The key to this method is not simply to have data about individual students, but to track them over time. Of course it's better in any case to have data such as demographic factors matched to individual students rather than simply to schools; it allows for a more precise statistical control for those factors. However, unless student outcomes are tracked over time, unmeasured factors unrelated to demographics will not be removed from the If it is not possible to track individual students, good research can still be done by tracking year-to-year changes in individual schools. The unmeasured advantages of the students in a given school can reasonably be expected to be similar from year to year-if a school has highly advantaged students in 2006, it will probably still have highly advantaged students in 2007. Mobility among the student population will create some change in student characteristics from year to year, but not so much that we cannot learn from school-level studies. "}, {"section_title": "Academic Achievement", "text": "There have been a total of 10 analyses of school voucher programs using random assignment methods. As has already been noted, random assignment is the gold standard for social science. It provides top-quality evidence that removes the effects of selection from study results, allowing us to compare the effect of public and private schools on academic achievement independent of the quality of the students who are selected into private schools. This evidence ought to take precedence over studies using other methods. Of the 10 studies available, eight fi nd that students using school vouchers had higher levels of academic achievement than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them (see Table 2). The other two studies also found positive results for vouchers, but in these two studies the results failed to achieve statistical signifi cance, meaning that we cannot be at least 95 percent certain that the positive results are real and not the result of a fl uke. In both of these studies, as we will see below, the failure to achieve signifi cance is explainable. Overall, this constitutes an extremely strong body of evidence in favor of school vouchers. Like all studies, these random assignment studies are limited. They do not tell us everything. For example, because of the high level of mobility that prevails among the disadvantaged populations these programs were serving, the studies are not able to track students over very long periods of time; the longest period of analysis is four years. Moreover, two of the studies examine a program in Charlotte for which baseline achievement data are not available. These baseline data would tell us how the students in the treatment and control groups were performing before they entered the program, which would provide some additional statistical certainty about the results, and also allow us to confi rm empirically that the treatment and control groups started out similar in their characteristics (as they ought to be if the random lottery was properly carried out).  This is grossly inappropriate because it is much easier for public schools to participate in these programs than for private schools. The number of private school students who get subsidized lunches is not an accurate measurement of the school's poverty level, because it is diffi cult for private schools to get access to these subsidies.

Most important, ELS begins tracking students at the end of 10th grade, or about halfway through their high school careers. This means many students will already have dropped out of school before ELS gets to them. In addition, ELS will have been unable to fi nd some students for the follow-up interview in spring 2004, and it is reasonable to expect that dropouts will have been more diffi cult to fi nd than graduates. Fortunately, these factors do not undermine the value of ELS in comparing public and private schools, for two reasons. First, the effects of these factors are likely to be similar across both school sectors. Second, the ability to control for demographic factors of individual students decreases the chance that this problem will introduce bias. The real value of the ELS data set is not in calculating the dropout rate, but in comparing the effect of attending a public or private school on the chances a student will drop out. This analysis conducts a linear regression analysis in order to remove the effects of demographic factors and selection effects as far as possible. The dependent variable was a dummy (0 or 1) for whether a student dropped out of school; the independent variable was a dummy for whether the student attended private school in 10th grade and various dummies for demographic factors.

Studying outcomes for disabled students is even more diffi cult than studying most educational subjects.

The evidence we do have, however, provides much reassurance about students' access to private schools. Contrary to stereotype, it appears that most private schools are not highly selective. Like public schools, they want to serve as many students as they can-that's why they're there. Howell and Peterson concluded that private schools serving voucher students in New York, Washington D.C. and Dayton were not highly selective. They compared students who were offered a voucher and used it to attend a private school with students who were offered a voucher but nonetheless didn't attend a private school, fi nding that the two groups were very similar in their academic and demographic character- Just as private schools do not appear to be very selective in admissions, they also do not appear to be very selective as to which students they permit to continue attending. Howell and Peterson found that fewer than 1 percent of students in the voucher programs they evaluated changed schools due to an expulsion. 20 John Witte's evaluation of the Milwaukee voucher program found that voucher students were rarely expelled. 21 Evaluations of voucher and scholarship programs in other cities also found that expulsion was rare. 22 And the national evaluation of Catholic schools found that the average school dismisses fewer than two students per year-again, less than 1 percent of the total. 23 Moreover, it is not the case, as opponents of school choice often assert, that every public school accepts every student. Nationwide, about 1 percent of public high school students are expelled each year and about 0.6 percent are segregated into specialized schools. 24 Additionally, about 1.2 percent of all disabled students receiving \"public\" education are contracted out to private schools because their local public schools can't handle their disabilities. 25 There is nothing wrong with the public school system's policy that every school does not have to accept every student. There are good reasons why not every school should take every student. Advocates of school choice would just like to see their opponents stop applying a double standard, under which public schools get no blame for not accepting every student but private schools are painted as being somehow sinister for doing the same.

This seems plausible on the surface-some amount of money from the state treasury (or from tax receipts, in the case of tax-credit scholarship programs) that would otherwise have gone to public schools is going to support students in private schools instead. However, the actual fi scal effect of school choice on public schools, and on state budgets, is a more complicated story. In a typical school choice program, state funds associated with participating students are redirected, but local funds remain in the local school districts even after students have left. This is because local school funding is not generally tied to enrollment, and doesn't change when enrollment changes. Public schools there-fore lose only part of the funding that goes with each school choice student. But they lose all of the student, and therefore all of the student's costs. In other words, school choice reduces public schools' costs more than it reduces their revenues-saving them money.

On some issues, we don't have as much evidence as we would like. And the benefits of school choice identified by these studies are sometimes moderate in size-not surprising, given that existing school choice programs are restricted to small numbers of students and limited to disadvantaged populations, hindering their ability to create a true marketplace that would produce dramatic innovation. However, these caveats should not be permitted to obscure the strength and depth of the evidence supporting school choice. A large body of top-quality studies consistently shows that school choice produces higher academic achievement for the students who have the opportunity to use it. On this issue, the evidence supporting school choice is as strong as the evidence on any social policy question whatsoever. The available evidence also supports private schools and school choice on the issues of dropout rates, improving academic outcomes at public schools, segregation and race relations, tolerance and democratic values, special education services, access to schools, safeguards against abuse and fiscal effects. On these issues the scientific quality of the evidence ranges from top-notch (tolerance and democratic values) to very good (positive impacts on public schools) to good (segregation and race relations) to fair but still acceptable (dropout rates). But in all cases the evidence we have supports school choice. The research consensus on these issues ought to be acknowledged and allowed to affect the public debate over school choice. For all the faith that the American public has in science-faith for which we scientists should be grateful-the public and its opinion leaders still have a long way to go in learning what the science really says about education.

ELS Data: Race Relations Are Very Similar in Public and Private Schools Table 8 Percentage of each student's best friends who are of a different race (out of up to three best friends) 100% 67% 50% 33% 0% Percentage of students agreeing that at their schools \"students make friends with students of other racial and ethnic groups\" Note: Students were invited to record information on their best friends, up to a maximum of three best friends. Students and their best friends were classifi ed as American Indian/Native Alaskan, Asian, black, Hispanic, multiracial, Pacifi c Islander/Native Hawaiian or white. This analysis divides the number of a student's best friends who were of a different race than the student by the total number of best friends the student reported (usually three). In cases where students did not provide the race/ethnicity of one or more of the best friends they reported, those friends were excluded. Students who did not report the race of any of their best friends were excluded from the analysis of best friends, but were included in the other two analyses. Student data were weighted to ensure proper representation of the national population.
