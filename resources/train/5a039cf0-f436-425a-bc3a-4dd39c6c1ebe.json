According to a recent study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) titled Bridges to Independence: Fostering the Independence of New Investigators in Biomedical Research (2005), the \"ideal type\" of postdoctoral grant in the biological sciences is for independent research conducted by a person who is a recent PhD. Its purpose is to deepen their scholarship and research techniques in a specialized subject area, often one that is previously unexplored. Yet, the report suggests that many postdocs in the biomedical sciences do not meet this model. Many postdocs serve for more than five years, move from position to position, and are well into their 40s before they move on to faculty positions, if such positions are available. The report comments further that many of these postdocs are working on projects funded to support the work of senior researchers. As a result, there is a lack of \"high risk, high-reward work\" by postdocs that could move the discipline forward (p. 2). The National Academy of Sciences study recommends that it is important to shorten the length of postdocs and to increase their independence, rather than using them as a low-wage, contingent labor force."}, {"section_title": "Postdoctorates: another stage in the sociology PiPeline?", "text": "LEARNING ABOUT THE POSTDOCTORATE IN SOCIOLOGY I n contrast to postdocs in the biological sciences, what do we know about the postdoc in sociology and especially compared to other disciplines?

The first has been to provide an alternative for new PhDs to a poor job market, and the second has been to create a cohort of new PhDs who would work with established scholars to further develop and enrich the subfield of economic sociology. ASA has been responsible for evaluating the program.

All of the six recipients expressed high levels of satisfaction with the opportunities and advantages of the Fellowship. The two aspects that they thought were most valuable were publishing a book based on their dissertation and help in the academic job search. All six Fellows presented papers and prepared and submitted publications based on their dissertations. All six Fellows reported obtaining fulltime (but not necessarily permanent) professional positions upon completion of their Fellowships. However, only two out of six Fellows obtained permanent tenure-track teaching positions at a university or four-year college-the \"ideal\" academic position. Another two accepted a second postdoctoral position, one obtained a (full-time) non-tenure-track teaching position, and another one obtained a position as director of a university-affiliated international research center. It may be that the job marketthough it had improved from its lowest years-was still not strong enough to provide the kinds of positions these postdocs were seeking (see ASA's analysis of the 2011/2012 job market by Spalter-Roth, Kisielewski, and Jacobs; 2012). The primary means by which the six 2010-2012 Fellows discovered their new/forthcoming positions varied greatly, but it was not their postdoctoral faculty mentor. Two cited a colleague as the primary means, but the remaining four either relied upon a PhD mentor, the Chronicle of Higher Education, a job bank, or a listserv or web site. Along with the six recipients who were awarded a postdoc, an additional 30 applicants were not awarded one. Of these, only 12 percent reported that they had found a tenure-track assistant professor position, with the remainder continuing in postdocs or holding teaching positions that were either part-time or visiting, or being in research positions at university institutes. Although they received less mentoring than the ASA/NSF Fellows, they appeared to have relatively high publication rates, although not as high as those who went through the ASA/NSF program. These data suggest that that participating in the prestigious ASA/NSF program does appear to make a difference for these individuals in terms of publication rates, access to mentors, and the next stage in their careers, but these findings clearly cannot be generalized."}, {"section_title": "NSF/Nih Survey oF grAduAte StudeNtS ANd PoStdoctorAteS", "text": "T he data from the NSF/NIH Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering shows that the total number of postdocs for all fields has increased from 2002-2008 by about 24 percentage points, from 46,700 postdocs in 2002 to 57,714 in 2008 (see Figure 1). There was significant variation between fields, however, with some showing a steady increase and others fluctuating over time. As noted, the largest number of postdocs was found in the biological sciences, since this is an institutionalized step on the biology career ladder. Within the biological sciences, the largest increase (about 84 percent) is in biological sciences-not otherwise classified (nec). The postdocs found in this subcategory may be cutting-edge new subfields of biology that have not as yet become institutionalized. In contrast to the biological sciences, the changes in the social sciences fluctuate between these years, with increases in some years and decreases in others. Across all social sciences (not including psychology), the number of postdocs dipped between 2003 and 2005, but it increased thereafter for a 39 percent increase overall. Likewise in sociology, there were no consistent patterns of increase or decrease in the number of postdocs filled. Overall, there was a 20 percent decline in the number of postdocs between 2002 and 2008. In contrast to the decline in sociology, there was an almost equal percentage increase in multidisciplinary postdocs, although data are only available for 2007 and 2008.

Based on a content analysis of the 326 advertisements for postdocs, we divided them into several types. The first division was whether the position was research-oriented, a combination of research and teaching, or primarily geared to teaching. A second distinction was between advertisements for postdocs for sociology projects and postdocs for interdisciplinary projects. The latter type of advertisements might have desired a sociology specialist for an interdisciplinary project or it may be that other PhDs from other disciplines could apply, and there is no guarantee that a sociologist will have been hired for the position. Finally, a third distinction was whether the position was to be performed individually or collaboratively (see Table 1 for the number of postdoc positions advertised by type). Not all of these decisions as to how to label positions were crystal clear-especially those that advertised teaching-geared postdocs. Given this problem, the findings may not be totally reliable. This problem aside, Table 1 suggests that 193 (or 59 percent) of these positions were research-oriented. An additional 118 (or 36 percent) were a combination of research and teaching positions. Most of these were like the NSF/ASA Postdoctoral Fellowship, which include working on research projects, but also teaching at least one course. A substantially smaller share of positions was for teaching only. It is unclear whether these positions are substitutes for adjunct or full-time faculty, or are a training position. Equal numbers of positions were collaborative versus independent, with fewer than half as many described as a combination of both (33 positions versus 80 and 80, respectively). In general, the number of interdisciplinary positions, regardless of type of work, is substantially higher than the number of sociology positions (64 percent versus 36 percent of all positions). In sum, the largest type of positions is re- search-based interdisciplinary positions, to be done collaboratively, independently, or a combination of both. In contrast to research positions, research/ teaching combination positions were split almost evenly between sociology and interdisciplinary, with the majority requiring the recipient to work independently-that is-to teach their own courses."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS", "text": "I n sum, what do we know about the postdoctorate in sociology compared to other disciplines? Based on the NSF/NIH and the ASA Job Bank databases, we find that compared to the steady growth in the natural sciences, the growth of the postdoc in sociology is sporadic and is far from being an agreed-upon stage in the sociology career trajectory. The small NSF-funded, ASA-managed and evaluated, two-year Postdoctoral Fellowship Program provides for stipends, space, and mentoring for those selected to do independent research on a topic of current interest in sociology. This model varies from what appears to be the common-rather than the ideal model in the biological sciences. Thus, if the NSF/ ASA program in sociology is taken as a model, it would be a modification of the common, but not the ideal, model in the natural sciences. However, sociology as a discipline cannot control the postdoc market for its new PhDs and the types of postdoctoral positions that are advertised. Findings from the ASA Job Bank suggest that the demand is more likely to be for postdocs who would do interdisciplinary work rather than focus on sociology alone.  in Sociology-intends to continue to examine the effects of the postdoc on sociology career trajectories. Some questions to examine, at least anecdotally, are whether PhD graduates apply for postdocs because they need more mentoring than they receive as part of their PhD programs in order to obtain fulltime, tenure-track positions in the profession. Or, is a postdoc a substitute for a full-time position? Is it a space and time to increase numbers of publications? Are those who have held postdocs more successful in achieving professional goals such as publications, grant receipt, tenure, and promotion than those who did not obtain these positions? Or does participation in a postdoc program lengthen the time to tenure, without other visible rewards? How should PhD students be trained and prepared for interdisciplinary postdocs? And, what data are available or easily collected that would allow these questions to be answered and would help concerned members of the discipline to decide whether to encourage postdocs, and particular models of postdoctoral training, as a stage in the sociology career trajectory? \u2022"}]
