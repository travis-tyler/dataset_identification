However, recent studies have shown that subtle changes in the ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) occur in MCI. [2][3] [4] [5] [6] The designation of MCI is often supported by a global rating of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 7 scale. The most heavily weighted component of the global CDR score is memory function; nonmemory components, including the 3 IADL categories, receive less weighting. Consequently, 2 individuals with MCI receiving the same global CDR score can noticeably differ in IADL performance. This lack of richness in characterizing IADL changes might prevent identification of meaningful clinical differences in individuals with MCI. To address this possibility, we compared baseline brain morphometry, cognition, and 2-year clinical outcome in subgroups of MCI partici-"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "pants who had global CDR scores of 0.5 but who differed with regard to IADL items. We predicted that, relative to individuals with intact IADL, those with relatively impaired IADL would show 1) a more widespread pattern of cortical atrophy involving frontal regions in addition to the expected medial temporal lobe involvement, 2) poorer cognitive performance, especially on tests of executive function, and 3) a higher rate of progression to probable AD.\nMETHODS Raw data used in the current study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu{ADNI). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. ADNI's goal is to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study was approved by an ethical standards committee on human experimentation at each institution. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or authorized representatives participating in the study.\nParticipants. ADNI eligibility criteria are described at http://www. adni-info.org/Scientists/ADNIGrant/ProtocolSummary.aspx. Briefly, participants were 55-90 years old, nondepressed, with a modified Hachinski score of 4 or less, and a study partner able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning. Individuals with a history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disease, substance abuse, or metal in their body other than dental fillings were excluded.\nHealthy control (HC) participants had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 24 -30, normal activities of daily living (ADL) as assessed with the Functional Activity Questionnaire (FAQ, clinical judgment without suggested cutoff), a global CDR score of 0, and normal memory function, as indicated by education-adjusted scores on the modified Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (LM II, story A only) (i.e., a score \u03fe8 for individuals with \u054616 years of education; \u03fe4 for individuals with 8 -15 years of education; and \u03fe2 for individuals with 0 -7 years of education). MCI participants had a subjective memory complaint, objective memory loss as indicated by education-adjusted scores on the LM II (score \u05458 for individuals with \u054616 years of education; \u05454 for individuals with 8 -15 years of education; and \u05452 for individuals with 0 -7 years of education), a global CDR score of 0.5 and a score \u05460.5 on the memory box of the CDR, essentially preserved ADL primarily assessed by the FAQ, and an absence of dementia. 1 This study included individuals classified as HC or MCI within ADNI with baseline MRI scans that passed local quality inspection. We excluded 7 HC who converted to MCI at any follow-up visit to minimize the possibility of misclassification of HC participants at baseline. The present study thus consisted of 202 HC and 283 MCI participants. MCI participants were divided into 2 subgroups (intact IADL and impaired IADL) based on their scores on the 3 CDR categories assessing IADL (i.e., judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies). Specifically, the intact IADL group (n \u03ed 179) consisted of individuals with a rating of 0 on all 3 IADL categories or a rating of 0.5 on 1 of the 3 categories; the impaired IADL group (n \u03ed 104) consisted of individuals with a rating of 0.5 on 2 or more of the 3 IADL categories or a rating of 1 on any 1 of the categories. The 2 MCI groups did not differ in age (t 281 \u03ed 1.79, p \u03ed 0.07), level of education (t 281 \u03ed 0.15, p \u03ed 0.88), sex distribution ( 2 (1) \u03ed 0.65, p \u03ed 0.42), history of hypertension ( 2 (1) \u03ed 0.67, p \u03ed 0.41), use of hypertension medications ( 2 (1) \u03ed 0.08, p \u03ed 0.78), or scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (t 281 \u03ed \u03ea1.67, p \u03ed 0.10). The impaired IADL group demonstrated higher FAQ scores (t 281 \u03ed \u03ea7.95, p \u03fd 0.001) and a higher frequency of APOE \u24404 carriers relative to the intact IADL group ( 2 (1) \u03ed 3.95, p \u03ed 0.04; table 1). Two-year follow-up clinical outcome data (i.e., reversion to normal cognitive status, stable MCI, or progression to probable AD) were available for 233 of the MCI participants. The determination of progression to probable AD was based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (see appendix e-2 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org for operational criteria).\nNeuropsychological assessment.

Because the impaired IADL group had more APOE \u24404 carriers than the intact group, analyses of cognitive variables were also performed with separate one-way analyses of covariance, controlling for APOE genotype. Although some of the distribu-tions of scores on cognitive tests were skewed, we did not transform the data since the sample size was sufficiently robust to enable appropriate use of the t statistic. 24 Differences in morphometric variables among HC, intact IADL MCI, and impaired IADL MCI groups were assessed with multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) followed by univariate analyses of variance with Bonferroni adjustments for Type I error (\u2423 \u03ed 0.001) (table e-1). Pairwise comparisons were conducted through separate independent sample t tests (\u2423 \u03ed 0.05).

Effect sizes were calculated with Cohen d for significant group differences on cognitive and morphometric measures. All analyses were conducted in SPSS (version 17.0).

Group differences in cognitive test performance were apparent on tests of executive function (i.e., TMT-B and Digit Symbol test) and episodic memory (i.e., RAVLT). Differences on episodic memory measures were somewhat unexpected since all participants had CDR memory ratings of 0.5 and groups did not differ in degree of atrophy in mesial temporal lobe structures implicated in memory (i.e., hippocampus and entorhinal cortices), or on performance on the LM II. Although the RAVLT, an unstructured list-learning task, may simply be a more sensitive measure of episodic memory than the LM II, a structured story-memory task, it is possible that the worse performance of the IADLimpaired group on the RAVLT is related to their greater deficit in executive functions. Although memory for complex narrative such as that required by the LM II is impaired in patients with frontal lobe lesions, 26 the RAVLT may place greater demands on executive abilities for organizing the unstructured word-list material during encoding or for strategic search during retrieval. 27 We previously found that MCI participants with impaired executive function performed more poorly on the RAVLT, but not on the LM II, than did MCI participants without executive dysfunction, and that thinning in frontal areas contributed to RAVLT performance beyond the well-known contribution of medial temporal structures. 27 These subtle distinctions between memory measures are not likely to be made within the CDR because memory ability is assessed as an overall rating based on the subjective judgment of an informant and does not take into account various cognitive processes underlying objective memory performance. Morphometric analyses showed that the impaired IADL group had greater and more widespread atrophy than the intact IADL group in left medial orbitofrontal, right lateral orbitofrontal, right supramarginal, and right parahippocampal cortex. The bilateral involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex is consistent with a recent study that highlighted the role of ventromedial prefrontal regions in carrying out complex cognitive and emotional tasks encountered in everyday life. 28 Greater cortical thinning in frontal regions in the impaired IADL group than in the intact group is consistent with their poorer performance on measures of executive function. The finding that cortical thickness was thinner in the right supramarginal and parahippocampal areas in the impaired IADL group than in the intact group is consistent with recent results that suggest brain atrophy spreads from medial temporal lobe structures to parietal and frontal cortical regions as severity of MCI increases, 29 and with the typical distribution of AD neuropathology early in the disease process. 30 Consistent with previous studies, 2,3,5 MCI participants with impaired IADL were more likely than those with intact IADL to progress to a clinical diagnosis of probable AD within the next 2 years. The 2 MCI subgroups may thus represent points along an MCI-to-AD continuum with the impaired IADL group having progressed farther toward AD than the intact IADL group. The higher scores on the FAQ in the impaired than the intact IADL group is consistent with this. It could be argued that the presence of deficits in 2 or more areas of cognition (episodic memory and executive function), coupled with impaired IADL, would support a diagnosis of mild dementia rather than MCI. However, the conventional practice of relying on summary screening measures and rating scales such as the MMSE, LM, and CDR to differentiate MCI from AD suffers from a certain granularity 31 and fails to capture the subtle but significant cognitive and functional changes in early dementia. Alternative approaches that incorporate more comprehensive neuropsychologically based methods for the diagnosis of MCI and AD have recently shown advantage in improving the stability and reliability of a diagnosis that predicts clinical decline. [32] [33] [34] [35] Global CDR score is one of the most commonly used measures for identifying and staging MCI or AD dementia. There are, however, a number of problems that have been pointed out [36] [37] [38] [39] with regard to the established methods for computing a global CDR. These include inconsistency in ratings across features (e.g., rating of memory vs other cognitive features or function) and a lack of precision in detecting or scaling levels of impairment within a particular CDR category (e.g., 0.5) or with progression. Indeed, in the present study we found that, despite comparable global CDR scores, MCI groups that differed in IADL CDR subratings had meaningful differences in baseline cognitive performance, brain morphometry, and rate of progression to AD. This suggests that the global CDR score is not sensitive enough to distinguish levels of severity or predict progression within MCI cohorts. The present findings support studies that propose alternative algorithms 38, 39 to overcome this lack of sensitivity. One such algorithm is the CDR sum of boxes (SB), which has been used in several recent studies to increase the ability to discriminate MCI from very early AD and track disease progression. 36, 39, 40 Though conceptually different from the CDR-SB, our results coincide with studies that show higher CDR-SB scores predict higher rates of progression to AD. 36, 39 A limitation of the current study is that 2-year clinical outcome data were available for only 82% of individuals with MCI at the time we conducted this study. However, MCI participants with clinical outcome data did not significantly differ from those without outcome data on any baseline demographic or global cognitive characteristic, making it unlikely that selective attrition biased the results. Another limitation inherent to the CDR is that changes in IADL abilities are based solely on an informant's report and may be subject to reporter bias. Objective assessment of functional abilities such as subjectperformed tasks might provide better discrimination between MCI subgroups and have greater predictive ability. Additionally, histopathologic verification of disease is lacking; some MCI participants may have disorders other than or in addition to AD, which might explain, in part, some of the differences observed between the 2 MCI groups. Finally, diagnosticians had access to all CDR data when making a determination of conversion to dementia, and thus could conceivably have used baseline CDR IADLs when making the diagnosis of dementia at follow-up. However, since the same inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., global CDR of 0.5 and CDR memory of 0.5) were applied to all MCI participants at baseline, it is more likely that the determination of functional impairment of sufficient severity to interfere with daily life was based on follow-up FAQ and global CDR scores.\nThe present findings demonstrate that the readily available informant-based information on IADL incorporated in a baseline administration of the CDR is useful for identifying subgroups of individuals with MCI who have more widespread neurodegeneration and are more likely to progress to probable AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Statistical analysis was conducted by Dr. Yu-Ling Chang."}]
