[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To determine the key inflammatory pathways that are activated in the peripheral and CNS compartments at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A cross-sectional study of patients with clinical and biomarker characteristics consistent with MCI-AD in a discovery cohort, with replication in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Inflammatory analytes were measured in the CSF and plasma with the same validated multiplex analyte platform in both cohorts and correlated with AD biomarkers (CSF Ab42, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (ptau) to identify key inflammatory pathway activations. The pathways were additionally validated by evaluating genes related to all analytes in coexpression networks of brain tissue transcriptome from an autopsy confirmed AD cohort to interrogate if the same pathway activations were conserved in the brain tissue gene modules. Results: Analytes of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway (KEGG ID:4668) in the CSF and plasma best correlated with CSF ttau and p-tau levels, and analytes of the complement and coagulation pathway (KEGG ID:4610) best correlated with CSF Ab42 levels. The top inflammatory signaling pathways of significance were conserved in the peripheral and the CNS compartments. They were also confirmed to be enriched in AD brain transcriptome gene clusters. Interpretation: A cell-protective rather than a proinflammatory analyte profile predominates in the CSF in relation to neurodegeneration markers among MCI-AD patients. Analytes from the TNF signaling and the complement and coagulation pathways are relevant in evaluating disease severity at the MCI stage of AD.

Even as classical AD neuropathology is described as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, it is recognized that a complex cascade of events involving additional molecular players likely play a crucial role in the disease onset and progression.\nAccumulating evidence implicates inflammatory changes in AD. [1] [2] [3] The role of systemic inflammation and occurrence of amyloid plaque-dependent inflammation have been well documented in both human autopsy specimens and animal models. 4, 5 Altered expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines in AD patients compared to controls have been reported. 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Alterations in systemic inflammation, including plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-related cytokines have been linked to worsened cognition in AD. 3, 10, 11 In addition, genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in several inflammatory genes are associated with modestly increased risk for AD. 12, 13 A role for inflammation and immune mechanisms in AD therefore appears highly likely. 14, 15 In spite of recognition of the role for inflammation in the pathophysiology of AD, there are some key outstanding questions. (1) Which key inflammatory pathways are activated in clinical AD? Among most prior studies of inflammatory changes in AD patients, small number of inflammatory analytes were measured, typically 10 or fewer. 6, 10, 11, [16] [17] [18] To help identify inflammatory pathways or networks of inflammatory analytes pertinent to AD and to evaluate if they are helpful or harmful to cognition, it is essential to develop approaches that evaluate multiple analytes concomitantly and interrogate their biological significance when expressed together, (2) Prior studies have predominantly focused on the peripheral compartment and it remains unclear how the inflammatory changes in the CNS relates to changes in the peripheral compartment for a large set of inflammatory molecules. This knowledge is critical to a mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiological changes related to inflammation in the peripheral and CNS compartments simultaneously and to potentially evaluate the utility of monitoring these inflammatory changes in AD for clinical outcomes.\nWe therefore took a systematic approach to answer these two questions among mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-AD clinical patients. After evaluation in our discovery cohort we validated the results among MCI patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We also determined if the genes related to soluble inflammatory analytes evaluated in our discovery cohort have also been transcribed in the brain tissue, using transcriptomic data from autopsied AD brains. Using functional network enrichment analysis we determined the biological pathways most likely related to the inflammatory analytes and genes of significance and its potential convergence across multiple datasets of brain, CSF, and plasma in the presence of markers of AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discovery cohort", "text": "A cross-sectional discovery study of 48 MCI-AD patients was conducted.

An additional marker of neuronal degeneration in the CSF, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), was measured in the rulesbased-medicine (RBM) multiplex analyte platform described below. NSE is often highly elevated in diseases which result in relative rapid neuronal destruction (hours/days) and levels are therefore supportive of a more recent neuronal loss in relation to analytes measured.

TNFR2 is expressed primarily in immune and endothelial cells. Signaling through TNFR2 activates inflammatory and prosurvival signaling pathways through subsequent activation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAPs) and the NF-jB pathway. 38 Interestingly, prior reports note a negative correlation between CSF levels of proinflammatory TNFa and t-tau. 39 Unlike TNFR2, it is notable that TNFa and related proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1b did not meet the limit of detection in greater than 50% of subjects in both the cohorts used in the analysis. Taken together these suggest a cell protective role for the TNFR2 mediated pathway in MCI-AD. Additional analytes that correlated to the neurodegeneration markers are known to be part of the TNF signaling pathways mediating downstream functions including leukocyte recruitment across the blood brain barrier (CCL2), remodeling of extra cellular matrix (MMP3), cell adhesion (VCAM1), and vascular effects (VGEF). 38, 40 Stem cell factor (SCF) SCF levels also correlated highly to CSF t-tau and p-tau. It is a hematopoeitic growth factor that is critically involved in regulation of blood cell production and mobilization of bone marrow stem cells and cell migration. 41 SCF is highly overexpressed by neurons at sites of brain injury. It has been noted to mediate chemoattractant activity for neural stem/progenitor cell migration and thought to play a repair role in models of stroke. 42 In the context of AD it has been reported to be low in the CSF and plasma of AD patients 43 and therapeutic effects of systemic SCF administration in mice models have shown promise in reducing amyloid. 44 The analytes related to the Complement and Coagulation pathways that were strongly related to CSF Ab42 include a-1-antitrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) Type 1, and von Willebrand factor in the CSF and a-1-antitrypsin, complement factor 3 and coagulation factor VII in the plasma. The main consequences of the activation of this pathway are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens. 38 The association between levels of these analytes and Ab burden has been noted in multiple previous studies. [45] [46] [47] [48] Among the other inflammatory analytes of significance in our results, the relationships between AD diagnosis and CCL2, 11 MMP2, 49 and VGEF 50 have been previously reported, whereas VCAM1 has been reported in relation to both AD and vascular cognitive impairment. 51 Even as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and, IL-12 did not meet threshold for analysis, among proinflammatory cytokines that met analysis threshold, CSF and plasma CRP had negative correlations with CSF t-tau in both cohorts, whereas IL-18 in the plasma had negative correlations with CSF t-tau in both cohorts (Fig. 2) . The direction of correlation in the above two analytes were consistent between the ADNI and discovery cohorts. In the plasma, the lack of some classical proinflammatory analytes as reported in previous AD meta-analysis, is notable. 18 No prior studies have evaluated inflammatory analytes measured both in CSF and plasma in relation to CSF AD biomarker levels, using Luminex technology to enable direct comparisons. Additionally as some of the prior studies lacked data on clinical variables that could impact proinflammation markers including comorbidities and concomitant medications (evaluated in this study), that could also account for difference in results.\nAnother inference from our CSF data is that, at the MCI stage of AD, TNF pathway cytokines that have been noted in AD animal and in vitro models in relation to amyloid, 52 were here best correlated not to CSF Ab42 levels but to CSF t-tau, p-tau, and NSE pointing to potential TNF pathway activation in relation to beta amyloid deposition starting earlier in preclinical AD 53 that warrants investigation."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "There are several differences between the current study design and previous reports. First, even though some prior reports had a larger number of subjects than this study, they often lacked characterization by AD biomarkers, and often focused on the dementia stage of AD, both of which could potentially add confounders to the results. Furthermore, none of these previous studies had a validation cohort to evaluate replicability of results on the same analysis platform. Additionally the methods used in prior analyses were based on in-house methodologies, mostly ELISA, and not from a clinically validated shared resource that others could replicate their results against, limiting the generalizability. Second, there are concomitant CSF and plasma measurements to evaluate both peripheral and CNS-related inflammation changes in this report. Third, this study has multiple internal and external validity checks to account for quality of data and measurements. Fourth, we were able go beyond single analyte associations to meaningfully assess multiple analytes and narrow our focus to key activated biological pathways. Fifth, we could assess the relevance of functional pathways identified in CSF and plasma across two different cohorts and for their activation in the AD brain tissue as well and validate these results.\nDespite these strengths both Type I and II errors have to be considered in this study where we do not confirm some plasma analyte results reported previously, while other analytes (e.g., YKL-40) were not analyzed in the RBM MAP. Our results pass a stringent multiple comparisons cut-off but it is possible that with weaker enrichment patterns other analytes of significance may become more salient with increased sample sizes.
