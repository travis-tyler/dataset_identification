The 1999-2000 SASS covered four school sectors: traditional public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Traditional public schools are the subset of all public schools in the United States except public charter schools. Traditional public schools are defined as institutions that provide educational services for at least one of grades 1-12 (or comparable ungraded levels), have one or more teachers to give instruction, are located in one or more buildings, receive public funds as primary support, and are operated by an education agency. They include regular, special education, vocationaUtechnical, and alternative schools. They also include schools in juvenile detention centers, schools located on military bases and operated by the Department of Defense, and BIA-funded schools operated by local public school districts.

Private schools are schools not in the public system that provide instruction for any of grades 1-12 (or comparable ungraded levels). The instruction must be given in a building that is not used primarily as a private home. Public charter schools are public schools that, in accordance with an enabling state statute, have been granted a charter exempting them from selected state or local rules and regulations. BIA schools are schools funded by the BIA, but may be operated by a local tribe, by a local school district, or as a public charter school.' The traditional public school data come from a sample of schools on the 1997-98 Common Core of Data (CCD) that was selected to be representative at the national and state levels. The private school data come from a sample based on the 1997-98 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), updated with more current information from 1998-99 private school association lists (Broughman and Colaciello 1999), that was selected to be representative at the national and affiliation2 levels. Data on public charter schools include the universe of public charter schools that were open during the 1998-99 school year and were based on a list provided by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) as described in The State of Charter Schools 2000 (2000). The BIA school population frame was the Office of Indian Education Programs: Education Directory (BIA 1998) list of schools that were operating in school year 1997-98. The data were collected in school year 1999-2000, using the most current frames available for sampling. In all cases, schools had to be open in 1999-2000 to be included in the media centers, facilitating collection of complementary data sets that provide policymakers, researchers, educators, and the general public with a broad range of information on the condition of schools and staffing in the United States.

In private elementary schools, teachers in self-contained classes averaged 20.3 students. In BIA elementary schools, selfcontained classes were even smaller, with an average of 18.0 students. Class size for departmentalized' instruction in secondary schools also differed by sector. In traditional public and public charter secondary school classes with departmentalized instruction, teachers averaged 23.4 students and 23.7 students per class, respectively.

During this time period, research has accumulated that links student achievement to the qualifications of teachers (see Ferguson 1991Ferguson , 1998Goldhaber and Brewer 2000;Mayer, Mullens, and Moore 2000)) Two central measures of elementary and secondary teacher qualifications are teachers' postsecondary education and their certification. To understand how many students are taught by teachers lacking specified levels of training, efforts have focused on mismatches between teacher qualifications and their teaching assignments (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future 1996;Ingersoll 1999). Such mismatches are commonly referred to as \"out-of-field\" teaching. Mismatches might include, for example, teachers with a degree in English who are teaching classes in social science or, conversely, teachers with educational backgrounds in the social sciences who are assigned to teach classes in reading. One of the main findings concerning teacher qualifications has been the relatively high incidence of teachers teaching subjects outside their areas of subject matter training and certification (see, e.g., Bobbitt and McMillen 1994;Ingersoll 1996Ingersoll , 1999Ingersoll , 2000Neuschatz and McFarling 1999;Robinson 1985). Moreover, the incidence of out-of-field teaching has been shown to vary by subject and by grade level. Out-of-field teaching also has been shown to occur more often in the classrooms of low-income students (Ingersoll 1999). A number of researchers have explored the hypothesis that teachers' knowledge and ability are associated with student learning in the classroom. One of the earliest studies in this area is the Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) survey (Coleman et al. 1966), which found a positive relationship between teachers' verbal abilities and pupil performance. Over the last decade, there has been an increased interest in this area. In a 1991 analysis of Texas school districts, Ferguson used measures of teacher literacy as an indicator of the quality of schooling to conclude that one-quarter to one-third of district variation in student test scores was associated with differences in the quality of schooling. A 1992 study (Hanushek, Gomes-Neto, and Harbison, as cited in Monk 1994) used measures of teachers' subject matter knowledge and student learning gains, and found a positive relationship between how much teachers knew about the subject taught and their students' learning gains in that subject. In a 1994 analysis of student performance and the science and mathematics subject matter preparation of their teachers, Monk reported a positive relationship between student gains in performance and the number of courses their teachers had taken in the subject taught. What is more, Monk also found that coursework in subject matter pedagogy (i.e., teaching methods) appears to contribute more to student performance than academic courses in the subject taught. In more recent work, Goldhaber and Brewer's 1997 analysis of teachers' postsecondary degrees and students' mathematics performance found a positive relationship between these variables, with higher levels of performance among students whose teachers held a bachelor's or master's degree in mathematics than among students whose teachers were outof-field. Then, in 2000, Goldhaber and Brewer examined data on the postsecondary degrees and certification status of teachers and their students' performance in mathematics and science. They observed a positive relationship between teachers' degrees and student performance in mathematics consistent with earlier findings.2 They also found that students whose teachers were certified in mathematics but did not hold a postsecondary degree in mathematics did not perform as well as students whose teachers held a postsecondary degree in mathematics. These findings provide a foundation for further examinations of out-offield teaching data. Postsecondary education. Policymakers and researchers agree that teachers should have undergraduate or graduate coursework in the fields they teach, but opinions differ over how much coursework a teacher needs to complete. Some argue that teachers should earn a major in any subject they intend to teach (Ravitch 1998). Conversely, others argue that a minor in a field is sufficient (as described in Ingersoll 1999). As a result, this report includes data from all degrees attained at the bachelor's level or above for measures of major only and separately for measures of major or minor combined.4 Further, given the positive research findings of Monk (1994) for coursework in subject matter pedagogy, and of Goldhaber andBrewer (1997, 2000) for academic subject matter majors, both subject matter education and academic degrees are included. 3The NCES Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) has also collected data on out-of-field teaching. See Lewis et al. (1999). 4Coursework in pursuit of either an academic major or a subject-specific education major is included in these measures. Certification. To receive a \"regular\" or \"standard\" certificate for teaching a specific subject and grade level, all states require a bachelor's degree that includes subject matter as well as pedagogical studies; all but 10 states require basic skills tests in reading, mathematics, or general knowledge; and 31 states require subject matter exams (U.S. Department of Education 2002).5 Typically, states also provide novice teachers a \"probationary\" certificate that is based on the requirements of the standard certificate. Schools hiring and assigning teachers accept this certificate in lieu of the standard certificate with the expectation that teachers will earn the standard certificate in due time through full-time teaching in the school. This report combines data on probationary, standard, and advanced certificates in determining teacher certification status.6 Teacher qualification measures featured in this report. Those who argue that a major in the subject taught is the most appropriate measure of a teacher's qualifications might opt to exclude certification status or minors in the subjects taught from their analyses of in-field and out-of-field teaching. However, few would argue that teachers who have neither certification nor training in a subject are sufficiently equipped to teach in that subject. As a result, this report focuses on two measures: teachers without a major, a minor, or certification in the subject taught; and teachers without a major and certification in the subject taught. Depending on the focus of the analysis, the teachers in both of these measures can be identified as out-of-field. The teachers in the first measure lack any of the earned credentials that researchers have identified as indicators of teacher qualifications. The teachers in the second measure lack the two earned credentials that researchers have identified as elements of teacher qualifications that are associated with high student performance."}, {"section_title": "Measures of out-of-field teaching", "text": "The SASS data provide the basis for analyzing out-of-field teaching in several different ways. For instance, one focus might be on teachers and the extent to which teachers are 5The amount of subject matter and pedagogical studies required varies across states and across grade levels. For example, in some states, middle-grade teachers are certified to teach across subjects (i.e., hold a K-9 elementary certification), while in other states, a grade 7-12 subject-specific certification is required in some of the middle grades. 6A small percentage (3.3 percent) of America's public school teachers hold provisional certificates. However, variations across states in the requirements for these provisional certificates make it difficult to use them as a measure of teacher qualifications. assigned to teach classes outside their areas of preparation. This information could provide answers to questions such as: How often are teachers assigned to teach classes outside the areas for which they have been trained? In what fields are teachers most often assigned to classes outside their areas of preparation? SASS data allow analyses of teachers' qualifications in their reported main assignment fields (the subjects in which they teach the most classes), as well as in each different subject that they teach. Alternatively, the focus might be on the extent to which students are taught by out-of-field teachers. A focus on students could provide insight into the quality of instruction provided to students by answering questions such as: How often are students in U.S. classrooms exposed to instruction from teachers who do not have postsecondary training or certification in the subject area taught? Four out-of-field teaching measures. Based on SASS data, four approaches to measuring out-of-field teaching can be used to address these questions: teachers out-of-field by main teaching assignments, teachers out-of-field by each subject taught, classes taught by out-of-field teachers, and students taught by out-of-field teachers. The focus of this report is on measuring students' exposure to out-of-field teachers; thus, this report focuses on the measure for students taught by out-of-field teachers. In addition, detailed tables for all four approaches are included in the complete report. The out-of-field measure featured in this report: Students taught by out-of-field teachers. The measure for students taught by out-of-field teachers tracks the number of students taught by teachers who are in-field or out-of-field in a specific subject. The \"students taught\" measure provides the most targeted assessment of the extent to which students are exposed to underqualified teachers. This measure allows analysts to report the percentage of all students taught each subject by teachers who are teaching outside their areas of preparation.' Reporting out-of-field teaching by grade level Differences in school and class organization at the elementary, middle, and high school levels require a separate consideration of out-of-field teaching by level of instruction. At the elementary level, the available data do not 7Since SASS is a sample of teachers rather than students,technically the measure is the percentage of teachers' students who are in classes with teachers teaching outside their field. For ease of presentation, this is referred to as the percentage of students who are in classes with teachers teaching outside their field. support estimates of the percentage of students taught by out-of-field teachers. However, data on the teacher-based measure of out-of-field teaching in the main assignment field are included in the complete report. Inasmuch as class rotations, or departmentalized instruction, are limited in the early grades, this measure provides a reasonable proxy of student exposure to teachers with different levels of qualifications. Policymakers and researchers have increasingly examined the middle school grades as an important, separate level of instruction (see Alt, Choy, and Hammer 2000;Levine, McLaughlin, and Sietsema 1996;Lewis et al. 1999). For most students, the middle grades mark their first experiences with departmentalized instruction, in which students move between classrooms from teacher to teacher and subject to subject. Thus, the middle grades serve as an introduction to the secondary years of schooling. Previous research on out-of-field teaching has found substantial differences in the extent of out-of-field teaching between the middle grades and the high school grades. In particular, Ingersoll (1999) found higher rates of out-of-field teaching in the middle grades compared with the high school grades. At the high school level, most teachers are assigned to subject-area departments and teach a single subject or several subjects to multiple classes throughout the school day. Although actual rates of out-of-field teaching are lower at the high school level than at the middle school level, the wide range of subjects and classes at the high school level makes the potential for out-of-field teaching high. Moreover, the instructional content at the high school level can extend well beyond the introductory level of content in a given subject area. Therefore, a teacher without adequate preparation in a specific subject area may have greater difficulty teaching the content effectively at the high school level than at the middle school level. The course content and educational contexts are so different between the elementary, middle, and high school years that reporting them together would disguise important differences in out-of-field teaching. Thus, it is important to report out-of-field teaching estimates separately for all three levels.8 Teachers were categorized based on the range of grades taught and main assignment field. The elementary grades, K-4, include those teaching in these grades exclusively and those who teach some combination of grades K-9 with a main assignment field of elementary education 8Although the complete report provides detailed tables for all levels, the report . focuses on the data for the middle and secondary levels."}, {"section_title": "kitti NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS", "text": "Qualifications 07110 2;elloce*GO,Wiirkforce: PIMIT092G)33 CO Out-of-Field Teaching 987-88 Go 9  or special education. The middle grades, 5-8, include those teaching some combination of grades K-9 with a main assignment field other than elementary education or special education and not teaching any grades higher than 9. The high school grades, 9-12, include those teaching grade 9 only and those teaching any grades 10 or higher. Reporting on out-of-field teaching over time This report includes SASS data collected from public school teachers over 4 school years (1987 -88, 1990 -91, 1993 -94, and 1999-2000) that span a 13-year period.9 Although the data from the three earlier administrations of SASS have been published previously, there has been variability over time in different aspects of the definitions used. A portion of this variability has resulted from differences in the surveys used. These changes impact slightly the matches that are made between teachers' majors and minors and the subjects they teach. A larger source of variability has resulted from analysts' choices concerning the credentials used to match with subjects teachers teach, the teachers to include, and the definitions of grade ranges. Thus, in preparing the data for this analysis, considerable care was taken in developing a consistent set of definitions that were applied to the data from each administration of SASS to allow for an analysis of changes in these measures over the last 13 years."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "The student-based measure of out-of-field teaching discussed here provides estimates of students' exposure to teachers with different levels of qualifications. The measure of students taught by teachers without a major, a minor, or certification in the subject taught provides estimates of the percentage of students in each subject whose teachers lack the minimal level of qualifications deemed necessary for teaching a specific subject. The measure of students taught by teachers who do not have both a major and certification in the subject taught provides subject-specific estimates of the percentage of students whose teachers do not have the two credentials that are most likely to help their students excel. The data are presented separately for the middle grades and the high school grades. All data discussed in these findings are included in table 1.

Although there was a decrease between school years 1987-88 and 1999-2000 in the percentage of middle-grade students in physical education/health education classes that were led by teachers without any of these credentials, there was no measurable change between these school years in the percentage of middle-grade teachers lacking credentials in any of the other subjects examined. High school grades-9-12. In the 1999-2000 school year, between 5 and 6 percent of the high school students enrolled in English, science, social science, arts and music, and physical education/health education classes; 9 percent of the high school students enrolled in mathematics classes; and 11 percent of the high school students enrolled in foreign language classes were in classes led by teachers without a major, a minor, or certification in the subject taught. In contrast, 31 percent of the students in ESU bilingual education classes had teachers who did not have a major, a minor, or certification in the field. In some fields, teachers may have a general degree and certification or a degree and certification in one specific subfield. For example, data reported for the broad category of science include matches between teacher credentials in general science or any science subfield as legitimate. However, since teacher credentials in the specific subfield may be more important to student success in that subfield, where available, data are presented for subfields as well.

The only increase in high school students' exposure to teachers lacking the specified credentials occurred in arts and music, where, despite the increase, it remained the case in school year 1999-2000 that 95 percent of the high school students enrolled in arts and music classes were in classes led by teachers with at least one of these credentials in the specific area of arts and music taught."}, {"section_title": "Teachers without a major and certification", "text": "Middle grades-5-8. In the 1999-2000 school year, at least two-thirds of the students in middle-grade mathematics classes (69 percent) and ESUbilingual education classes (73 percent) had teachers who did not report a major and certification in the subject taught. Approximately 60 percent of the students in middle-grade English classes (58 percent), foreign language classes (61 percent), and science classes (57 percent) had a teacher who did not report a major and certification in the subject taught. By comparison, although the estimate for the specific subfield of biology/life science (64 percent) was similar to the percentage for all science classes, most students in middlegrade physical science classes (93 percent) had teachers who did not have certification along with a major in any of the physical sciences or in physical science education. About one-half of the students in middle-grade social science classes (51 percent) had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the field, but 71 percent of the students in middle-grade history classes had teachers who did not report having a major in history or world civilization and certification in the field. In contrast, fewer students enrolled in classes in arts and music and in classes in physical education/health education had teachers who did not hold a major and certification in the field taught.

Over the 13-year period from school year 1987-88 to school year 1999-2000, there were decreases in the percentage of middle-grade English teachers who did not hold certification and a major in the subject taught; however, in 1999-2000, it remained the case that 58 percent of middlegrade English students had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the field. For the other subjects examined, there were small apparent fluctuations over this time period, but there were no measurable differences over time. In both the 1987-88 and the 1999-2000 school year, approximately 70 percent of the middle-grade students in mathematics classes and 60 percent of the middle-grade students in science classes had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the subject taught. In contrast, only 15 to 22 percent of the middle-grade students in arts and music and in physical education/health education classes had teachers who had not majored and were not certified in their teaching field. High school grades-9-12. In the 1999-2000 school year, one-third or fewer of the high school students in English, mathematics, science, social science, arts and music, and physical education/health education classes had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the subject taught. In contrast, 71 percent of the high school students in ESL/bilingual education classes had teachers who did not have a major and certification in ESUbilingual education. And 48 percent of the students in foreign language classes had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the specific language taught. Despite the relatively small amount of out-of-field teaching evident in the general fields of science and social science in school year 1999-2000, a different profile emerges when individual subfields are considered separately. Although 27 percent of the high school students in science classes had teachers without a major and certification in any field of science, the percentages were much higher for each specific subfield. Thus, 45 percent of high school students in biology/life science classes had teachers who did not have certification and a major in biology/life science. About 63 percent of the high school students in physical science classes had teachers who did not have certification and a major in some area of physical science. The percentages were similar for the subfields of chemistry (61 percent) and physics (67 percent), but higher for the subfield of geology/ earth/space science, with about three-quarters of the students (79 percent) in high school geology/earth/space science enrolled in classes led by teachers without certification and a major in geology/earth/space science. Similarly, although 28 percent of high school students in social science classes had teachers without a social science major and certification of some type, 63 percent of the high school students in history classes did not have teachers with a major and certification in history or world civilization. Although in school year 1999-2000 one-third or fewer of the high school students in English, mathematics, and social science classes had teachers who did not have a major and certification in the subject area taught, over the 13-year period from school year 1987-88 to school year 1999-2000 the percentage of students in classes led by teachers who did not have an in-field major and certification decreased in each of these fields. Similarly, there were decreases in the percentages of high school students in physics, physical science, ESUbilingual education, and physical education/ health education classes with teachers who did not have an in-field major and certification. The apparent decrease in the percentage of high school students in science classes was not significant. Although there was an increase for arts and music, 20 percent of the high school students enrolled in these classes had teachers without an in-field major and certification in the specific subfield taught in 1999-2000.12"}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Summary", "text": "The two measures of teacher qualifications featured in this report provide different perspectives on out-of-field teaching. Teachers who do not have a major, a minor, or certification in the subject taught can, most certainly, be classified as out-of-field teachers. In the middle grades in 1999-2000, some 11 to 14 percent of the students taking social science, history, and foreign languages, and 14 to 22 percent of the students taking English., mathematics, and science were in classes led by teachers without any of these credentials. In addition, approximately 30 to 40 percent of the middlegrade students in biology/life science, physical science, or ESUbilingual education classes had teachers lacking these credentials. In the high school grades in 1999-2000, between 5 and 10 percent of the students in classes in English, mathematics, science and the subfields of biology/life science and chemistry, social science and the subfield of history, arts and ; A music, and physical education/heath education had teachers who were without a major, a minor, or certification in the field taught, and thus are considered out-of-field by this measure. Within the subfields of science, 17 percent of the high school students enrolled in physics and 36 percent of those enrolled in geology/earth/space science were in classes led by out-of-field teachers. In addition, 31 percent of the high school students enrolled in ESUbilingual education classes had out-of-field teachers. When the definition of out-of-field is expanded to include teachers who do not hold certification and a major in the subject taught, the amount of out-of-field teaching increases. With this measure, at a minimum 6 out of every 10 middle-grade students in classes in English; foreign languages; mathematics; science, including the subfields of biology/life science and physical science; history; and ESL/ bilingual education were in classes led by out-of-field teachers in 1999-2000. The proportions were higher for some subjects, with 73 percent of the students enrolled in ESUbilingual education classes, 69 percent of the middlegrade students enrolled in mathematics, 71 percent in history, and 93 percent of the students enrolled in physical science in classes led by teachers without majors and certification in these fields. At the high school level in 1999-2000, at a minimum 6 out of every 10 students enrolled in physical science, including the subfields of chemistry, geology/earth/space science, and physics; history; and ESUbilingual education classes had teachers who did not have certification and a major in the subject taught and thus are considered out-of-field by this measure. In addition, 45 percent of the high school students enrolled in biology/life science and approximately 30 percent of those enrolled in mathematics, English, and social science classes had out-of-field teachers using this measure. A comparison between the experiences of students in the middle grades and those in the high school grades shows that there were relatively fewer teachers with certification and an in-field major in the middle grades than in the high school grades in English; mathematics; science, including the subfields of biology/life science and physical science; and social science over the 13-year period. That is to say, compared to the high school grades, higher percentages of students in the middle grades were in classes led by teachers who did not hold certification and a major in the subject taught. Similarly, higher percentages of students taking these subjects in the middle grades were in classes led by 18 teachers without any of the recognized credentials. Whether it is because a general elementary certification or training is thought to be sufficient in the middle grades, or because teacher specialization in the middle grades has not caught up with the move toward changing classes in the middle grades, teachers who teach specific subjects in the middle grades are less likely to have the recognized credentials than their contemporaries teaching in the high school grades. A comparison of the student experiences over the 1987-88 to 1999-2000 period shows that in the middle grades there were decreases in the percentages of students taught English by teachers who did not have certification and a major in the subject taught, and there was a decrease in the percentage of students in physical education/health education classes that were led by teachers without any of the recognized credentials (i.e., no major, minor, or certification). More changes were evident in the high school grades, where there were improvements evident in a number of fields with decreases in the percentages of students taught by teachers who did not have both a major and a certification in the subject taught in English, mathematics, the science subfields of physical science and physics, social science, ESUbilingual education, and physical education/health education. There was an increase in the percentage of high school students in arts and music classes with teachers without a major and certification in the specific subfield taught, but in 1999-2000 this only affected 20 percent of the students. Decreases were also evident in the percentages of students who were taught by teachers without any of the recognized credentials in English; mathematics; science and each of the subfieldsphysical science, chemistry, geology, and physics; social science and the subfield history; and ESUbilingual education. The only increase in the high school grades was in arts and music, where the percentage of students taught by teachers without a major, a minor, or certification went from 3 percent in 1987-88 to 5 percent in 1999-2000. There was one pattern that was similar across both the middle and high school grades: the arts and music teachers and the physical education/health education teachers were the most likely of all the subject matter teachers to have certification and a major in the subject taught. And in the middle grades these teachers were also the least likely to lack a major, a minor, or certification. Whether this is the result of the specific requirements to teach in these fields or a matter of supply and demand remains a topic for further study.

These publications highlight some important findings contained in the new SASS data. Researchers and policymakers will turn to these data, as they have to earlier releases of SASS, to explore a variety of critical school resource and policy issues. SASS provides both nationally representative data and state-by-state estimates. NCES staff and other researchers have generated literally hundreds of papers and presentations from this data source (Wiley et al. 1999). The importance of SASS lies in the fact that it is the largest, most extensive recurrent survey of K-12 school districts, schools, teachers, and administrators in the country and that it includes parallel data on traditional public schools, private schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools, and in 1999-2000, for the first time, public charter schools. Like its predecessors (the 1987(the -88,1990(the 91, and 1993, this fourth cycle of SASS offers data along four important dimensions: critical components of teacher supply, demand, and attrition, with attention to critical shortage areas and the policies and practices at all levels enacted to meet the demand in those areas; E the professional characteristics, preparation, and experience of teachers and administrators, plus their perceptions of school conditions, professional responsibilities, decisionmaking, and compensation policies; N the conditions and characteristics of the school as a work place and learning place, including characteristics of the student body, curriculum, special programs, and organizational structure; the implementation of school programs and policies such as English as a second language [ESL], bilingual education, diagnostic and prescriptive services, and programs for the gifted and talented. (Excerpted from Mullens and Kasprzyk 1997.) Each cycle of SASS focuses on these fundamental issues, and some cycles have added questions intended to shed light on issues of rising prominence. For example, the 1999-2000 SASS includes a survey of the complete universe of public charter schools. In addition, the 1999-2000 SASS includes data on computer availability and use, as well as more extensive data on professional development opportunities and training."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Although some policymakers and researchers have criticized SASS because it provides no link to student outcome data, others have noted that SASS'S importance lies in the fact that it does focus on collecting teacher-and schoollevel data, whereas most other NCES K-12 programs focus on collecting student-level data (Mullens and Kasprzyk 1997). Clearly, both policymakers and researchers have come to depend on SASS as a way to measure (1) the current status of schools, administrators, and teachers; and (2) changes over time in schools and the professionals who work in them, which take place as this country's demographics, public policies, and state and national economies change. Providing an Overview of the Data Schools andStaffing Survey, 1999-2000: Overview of the Data for Public, Private, Public Charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Elementary and Secondary Schools provides 60 tables of data, in order to \"present a synopsis of the types of information that can be produced with the [SASS] data\" (Gruber et al. 2002). Separate tables are presented for each school sector; and, within each sector, findings are broken out by community type, region, school level, and school enrollment. In addition, findings on public schools are broken out by state. Among the topics explored are school safety, class size, programs in elementary schools, programs in secondary and combined schools, teacher salary schedules, the teaching experience of principals, professional development, and school libraries and media centers. A variety of interesting findings are highlighted in the Overview report, illustrating the breadth of the SASS data on the status of schools and staffing in 1999-2000. Examples include the following: Teachers in private schools were less likely to report being threatened with injury (4 percent) than teachers in BIA schools (13 percent), public charter schools (11 percent), and traditional public schools (10 percent). This report is not meant to fully utilize the SASS data but rather to offer a sample of what is available. These few findings help us determine the questions that call for more sophisticated analyses. For example, does school location influence our interpretation of these findings? Specifically, does the fact that public charter schools are overrepresented in central cities change our perspective on the above aggregate comparisons of all public charter schools to all traditional public schools? Once location is taken into account, will charter schools be found to be more safe for teachers than traditional public schools? Similarly, is the greater availability of extended day programs at public charters, compared to traditional public schools, due to the fact that extended day programs, in general, are more prevalent in central cities? Another interesting issue to explore with these data is the relationship between the characteristics of schools and the quality of the teachers who work in them. For example, do schools with smaller classes, or schools with salary schedules, draw more highly qualified teachers than schools with larger classes, or schools without salary schedules? The 60 tables presented in this report provide ample information about the nation's schools and also raise several interesting questions."}, {"section_title": "Exploring the Qualifications of Public School Teachers", "text": "In contrast to the Overview report, Qualifications of the Public School Teacher Workforce: Prevalence of Out-of-Field Teaching 1987-88 to 1999(Seastrom et al. 2002 hones in on one issue: out-of-field teaching (teachers are teaching out-of-field if there is a mismatch between their training and the subject they teach). The report's findings on this key issue will be examined with new urgency, because \"teacher quality\" is currently being touted by researchers and policymakers as, if not the most important determinants of teacher quality include years of teaching experience, academic ability, participation (as new teachers) in induction programs, and extent of exposure to highquality professional development programs (Mayer, Mullens, and Moore 2001). Although researchers and policymakers are not in agreement about how certification programs should be structured, there is, nevertheless, a great desire to know more about the certification profile of today's teaching corps (e.g., what percentage of teachers have full certification, probationary certification, alternative certification, emergency certification, or no certification?) and how this profile is changing over time. Each of these teacher-quality issues can be explored from a variety of vantage points using SASS data.* The Qualifications report focuses on the extent to which teachers teach courses they were not trained to teach. Previous research has shown that out-of-field teaching adversely affects student achievement. Goldhaber and Brewer (1996) and Monk and King (1994) looked at the subjects teachers studied in college and graduate school and found that subject matter preparation is related to student achievement even after controlling for relevant teacher and student background and contextual variables. There are a variety of valid ways in which to define out-offield teaching. Some measures set a high threshold or standard, while others set a lower one. In this report, for example, the highest threshold is one that requires in-field teachers to have both a major and certification in the subject they are teaching, whereas the most lenient threshold requires only that a teacher have a major, a minor, or certification. Using the highest standard, 30 percent of English, 31 percent of mathematics, 27 percent of science, and 28 percent of social science students in high school were being taught by out-of-field teachers during the 1999-2000 school year. Using the lower standard, 6 percent of English, 9 percent of mathematics, 6 percent of science, and 6 percent of social science students in high school were being taught by out-of-field teachers. By either standard, the numbers are dramatically higher in middle schools. For example, using the major and certification standard, 58 percent of English, 69 percent of mathematics, 57 percent of science, and 51 percent of social science students in middle school were being taught by out-of-field teachers during the 1999-2000 school year. Using the more lenient major, minor, or certification standard, 17 percent of English, 22 percent of mathematics, 14 percent of science, and factor, one of the most important factors influencing school *The academic skills of teachers cannot be measured directly with SASS data, but the undergraduate institution that teachers attended can be identified, and this has often quality. Besides the training that teachers receive, other key been used as a proxy for academic skills. 13 percent of social science students in middle school were being taught by out-of-field teachers. While the middle school versus high school differential is not surprising, it is surprising that there was a great decrease in out-of-field teaching in high schools between 1987-88 and 1999-2000. The decrease is most evident when applying the major, minor, or certification standard, although it is also evident when applying the major and certification standard. For example, between 1987For example, between -88 and 1999For example, between -2000, the percentages of high school students being taught by teachers without a major, a minor, or certification dropped by almost one-third to over one-half in the following subjects: physical science (dropped from 31 percent of students in 1987-88 to 16 percent of students in 1999-2000), geology (51 percent to 36 percent), physics (40 percent to 17 percent), ESUbilingual education (54 percent to 31 percent), and English (13 percent to 6 percent). In examining tables B-9 and B-18 from the report (reproduced here), it is clear that the downward shift in out-of-field rates occurred between the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS. This finding is surprising in light of news reports throughout the 1990s announcing significant teacher shortages in the nation's largest school districts. If these shortages really did exist nationwide, it would seem likely that out-of-field teaching would have increased during that period. However, NCES not only has nationally representative data on trends in teaching preparedness but also notes that \"methodological differences, including differences in survey formats over the years, do not appear to have a major impact on change over time in the estimates.\" As a result, researchers will want to use the SASS data to determine what really happened in the teacher labor market in the 1990s, so that we can learn from that experience. For example, researchers might want to explore whether the shortages were confined to particular types of districts or schools, regions of the country, or types of communities."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The 1999-2000 SASS data and the Overview and Qualifications reports are important for the education field. There is much to be learned from them about schools, administrators, and teachers at the turn of this century. There is no question that there were important changes in schools and how they were staffed throughout the 1990s and that these changes are likely to persist into the next decade. The past two decades have seen a sea change in how teachers are trained in the United States. Twenty years ago, only a few states offered alternative certification routes for prospective teachers, and few candidates took this path. Today, 45 states offer such alternatives, which are supplying approximately\nIn fall 1998, access to the Internet was common for postsecondary instructional faculty and staff. In addition, 69 percent of full-time faculty and 46 percent of part-time faculty used e-mail to communicate with students in their classes, and about one-third of both full-and part-time faculty used course-specific web sites. While the overall findings in this report indicate increasing integration of telecommunications technologies in postsecondary settings, there are three caveats. First, this study showed wide differences between full-and part-time faculty in access to and use of telecommunications technologies. Without exception, full-time faculty reported 4Total student contact hours were calculated as follows: For each for-credit class taught (a maximum of five classes could be reported by respondents), the number of hours per week spent teaching the class was multiplied by the number of students in the class.The products were then summed to obtain the total number of student classroom contact hours. 102 more access to the Internet and more use of e-mail and course-specific web sites than did part-time faculty. Second, Internet access and the quality of computing resources were important factors in the use of telecommunications technologies. Postsecondary instructional faculty and staff who had access to the Internet both at home and at work were significantly more likely to use e-mail and course-specific web sites than those who had access only at home or only at work. Clearly, the amount of Internet access was a main indicator of use for both e-mail and course-specific web sites, and it remained important after controlling for other variables. After controlling for other variables, the quality of computing resources also remained a significant factor in the likelihood of using course-specific web sites: overall, instructional faculty and staff who rated their institution's computing resources as good or excellent were more likely to use course-specific web sites than were those who rated the computing resources as poor. Finally, the type of institution was shown repeatedly to be a key factor. In particular, postsecondary instructional faculty and staff at 4-year doctoral institutions were significantly more likely to use e-mail and course-specific web sites than those at 4-year nondoctoral or 2-year institutions.

At the heart of this concern lies the issue of \"who teaches undergraduates in postsecondary institutions\" (Boyer Commission 1998). Although some research has been conducted to address this issue (Chen 2000;Middaugh 1999;Townsend 2000), current descriptive information regarding who teaches undergraduates at postsecondary institutions in the United States is limited.\nTrends in the condition of American education show a mixed picture. While high school graduates have increased their enrollment in more advanced courses since the early 142 NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS 1 O3 Condition 00 a:1232020M pzm 1980s, the performance of 12th-graders in mathematics and science has stagnated in recent years. International comparisons suggest that U.S. 9th-graders have relatively good civic knowledge, and even better civic skills, but that the reading literacy scores of U.S. 15-year-olds are similar to the international average among advanced industrialized countries. International comparisons in mathematics and science also show mixed results, with U.S. 8th-graders performing above the international average of 38 countries but below the average of their counterparts in 14 countries. In addition, gaps persist in academic performance and educational participation among different racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic groups, and school sectors. The gaps between the average reading scores of White and Black students ages 9, 13, and 17 have remained stable or increased since the late 1980s. In mathematics, high poverty levels in schools are associated with low student achievement in the 4th grade. While the percentages of dropouts in the population of White and Black young adults have declined, the percentage for Hispanics has remained higher than that of other groups and remains high. Finally, private school students in general scored higher than public school students in reading, mathematics, and science. A growing and increasingly diverse population of elementary and secondary students continues to heighten the challenge of providing high-quality instruction and equal educational opportunities. In addition, school absence 1!-) \u00a7 among middle and high school students and the declining academic interest of high school seniors are just a few of the challenges that educators face. At the postsecondary level, institutions must prepare for the record numbers of enrollments expected over the next decades. NCES produces an array of reports each month on findings about the U.S. education system. The Condition of Education represents the culmination of a yearlong project. In the coming months, many other reports and surveys informing us about education will be released, including studies of elementary and secondary school staffing, the participation of children in before-and after-school programs, a followup look at the status of the 8th-grade class of 1988 14 years later, school crime, early childhood education, full-and half-day kindergarten, children's computer use at home and at school, and adult learning.

Knowing who comprises the nation's teaching corps, how teachers are allocated among schools (e.g., rich vs. poor, private vs. public, public charter vs. traditional public, BIA vs. traditional public), and how various aspects of school staffing change over time will become more important than ever.   \nparts to teach in the fine arts. By the fall of 1998, no differences were detected between male and female faculty teaching in this program area. Conversely, in the fall of 1992, no differences were detected in the proportion of male and female faculty teaching in the social sciences. However, in the fall of 1998, part-time male faculty were more likely than their female counterparts to teach in the social sciences.

The report summarized in this article presents the results of the NAEP 2001 Geography Assessment for the nation, along with several sample questions and student responses from the assessment. Results of the 2001 geography assessment are compared to results of the preceding NAEP geography assessment, which was conducted in 1994 and was the only other geography assessment in which the test questions were based on the current framework."}, {"section_title": "NAEP geography framework", "text": "The NAEP geography framework that describes the content for both the 1994 and 2001 assessments was developed through a national consensus process and adopted by NAGB.

The achievement levels are performance standards adopted by NAGB as part of its statutory responsibilities. They represent collective judgments of what students should know and be able to do. Basic denotes partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade. O Proficient represents solid academic performance for each grade assessed. Students reaching this level have demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter, including subject matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Advanced signifies superior performance. As provided by law, the Deputy Commissioner of Education Statistics, upon review of a congressionally mandated evaluation of NAEP, has determined that the achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted and used with caution. However, both the Deputy Commissioner and NAGB believe that these performance standards are useful for understanding trends in student achievement. NAEP achievement levels have been widely used by national and state officials as a common yardstick of academic performance.

Doctoral students received assistantships more frequently (47 percent) than did master's (16 percent) or first-professional (11 percent) students. In addition, at the doctoral level, students in science and in engineering were more likely than students in the humanities/social sciences to have assistantships ( figure B). At the master's level, M.A./ M.S. students in science were more likely than those in other fields to have assistantships. Assistantships are a common form of aid for foreign students, who are not eligible for federal grant and loan programs. In 1999-2000, 54 percent of foreign students received an assistantship, compared with 17 percent of U.S. citizens and resident aliens. This high percentage reflects the fact that about 40 percent of foreign students were studying science or engineering as well as their need to have an alternative to federal aid. The average amount received by full-time, full-year graduate and first-professional students with assistantships was $9,800. Ph.D. students in the sciences who attended full time, full year received an average of $15,000 in assistantships, and those in engineering received an average of $13,500. Students with assistantships often receive benefits in addition to a stipend. About two-thirds of those with teaching and research assistantships (64 and 67 percent, respectively) received tuition discounts or waivers in conjunction with their assistantship. Various types of insurance are also sometimes provided: 36 percent of teaching assistants and 42 percent of research assistants received insurance (such as health or life) that was at least partially paid for by their institutions. One way of examining the contribution of assistantships is to compare them to the price of attending and to the amounts borrowed. For full-time, full-year graduate or firstprofessional students, the average price of attending (including tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses) was about $26,300. The average amount received for assistantships and the average amount borrowed were negatively related. For example, students with assistantships paying less than $5,000 borrowed an average of $7,700, while those with assistantships of $15,000 or more borrowed an average of $2,200.\nFinancing dJ laitickoa9ecri First-Professional aftoaeglois 9 999-2000 About one in five graduate and first-professional students had a teaching or research assistantship in 1999-2000, but assistantships were more common at the doctoral than at the master's or first-professional levels. Assistantships were also concentrated by field. About three-quarters of doctoral students in science and in engineering received assistantships, and they received larger amounts on average than those in the humanities/social sciences. Teaching assistants spent an average of 15 hours per week working with students in the classroom or lab, holding office hours, or assisting faculty with grading or other instruction-related tasks.

To obtain the complete report (NCES 2002-166) This report examines postsecondary instructional faculty and staff's access to and use of electronic mail (e-mail) and the Internet. Though these telecommunications technologies are rapidly becoming core components of the instructional experience of students in the United States, little descriptive information exists at the national level to address basic questions about technology use and teaching in postsecondary education. The purpose of this study is to respond to this need by answering the following questions: Who has access to telecommunications technologies (in particular, the Internet)? How much and in what ways do they use these technologies for instructional purposes? How does technology use relate to workload and contact with students? The findings of this report are based on a nationally representative sample of instructional faculty and staff who taught one or more classes for credit in fall 1998. These data originate from the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:99).' Access to the Internet, Quality of Computing Resources, and Use of Telecommunications Technologies\nRelationship of Internet access and quality of computing resources to instructional use of technology Full-and part-time instructional faculty and staff who rated their institution's computing resources as either good or excellent were much more likely to use e-mail to communicate with students in their classes than were those who rated their institution's computing resources as poor. In addition, instructional faculty and staff's use of e-mail to communicate with students in their classes and use of course-specific web sites was associated with their level of access to the Internet. Those who had access both at home and at work were more likely to use e-mail and coursespecific web sites than those who had access only at work, had access only at home, or had no access. However, of those who had access to the Internet both at home and at work, full-time instructional faculty and staff were more likely to use e-mail to communicate with students in their classes (78 percent) than were their part-time counterparts (64 percent).\nUsing the most current national survey of faculty, the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:99),1 this report supplies such information by addressing the following three questions: 1) Who teaches undergraduates in postsecondary institutions?' 2) How much do they teach? and 3) What teaching practices do they use for their undergraduate teaching? The findings, which are summarized below, are based on a nationally representative sample of postsecondary faculty and instructional staff who reported having some instructional responsibilities for credit in fall 1998.\nThe purpose of this E.D. Tabs report is to describe how the gender and racial/ethnic composition of full-and part-time instructional faculty and staff has changed between the fall of 1992 and the fall of 1998. The report uses data from NSOPF:93 and NSOPF:99. In addition to this more focused report, two new NCES publications use data from NSOPF:99 to explore gender and racial/ethnic differences among faculty by several outcome variables such as salary, tenure status, and academic rank: Gender and Racial/Ethnic Differences in Salary and Other Characteristics of Postsecondary Faculty: Fall 1998 (Bradburn andSikora 2002) and Tenure Status of Postsecondary Instructional Faculty and Staff 1992-98 (Parsad and Glover 2002). The data for this report are analyzed by institution level, type and control, and academic program.' The analyses are based on instructional faculty and staff; that is, faculty and staff with some for-credit teaching responsibilities. The first part of this summary focuses on changes in the gender composition of instructional faculty and staff, and the second part discusses changes in the racial/ethnic composition of instructional faculty and staff.2 'Institution types are based on the Carnegie classification and whether the institution is public or private not-for-profit.To improve readability,the phrase\"not-for-profit\" may be excluded when referring to\"private not for profit\" institutions.

The TiGri5 Old alphrai Riers rnade -elneSe A great deal is known about high school vocational coursetaking, including which students take more rather than less vocational education (see Levesque et al. 2000;Tuma 1996). Less is known about vocational education offerings and the types of schools that provide various types of vocational education programs. To help fill this gap, this Issue Brief uses data from the 1999 \"Survey on Vocational Programs in Secondary Schools\" (see Phelps et al. 2001) to examine systems for delivering vocational education and the offerings provided by public high schools in urban, suburban, and rural areas.' Schools in these areas are likely to differ in the nature of their local labor markets, and thus in the demand for vocational education faced by schools. In particular, many rural areas are likely to have labor markets that are less diverse than those in suburban and urban areas. Vocational offerings also might be more limited in rural areas compared to urban and suburban areas in part because rural high schools tend to be smaller than high schools in other areas. In 1998-99, for example, the average student enrollment in rural public high schools was 437, compared to 1,120 for schools in suburban and urban areas. Assuming rural schools do have more limited vocational offerings, a subsequent issue of interest is the likelihood that rural schools offer certain types of programs. This Issue Brief examines these issues. The 1999 \"Survey on Vocational Programs in Secondary Schools\" This survey asked administrators of public high schools to classify their school as \"comprehensive\" or \"vocational\" in focus.2 The survey also included a list of 28 selected occupations that typically require less than a baccalaureate degree. School administrators were asked to identify for which of the 28 selected occupations their school offered a vocational education program (defined as a sequence of courses within an occupational preparation area) in 1998-99. The survey included the most common occupations for which vocational education prepares students at the high "}, {"section_title": "Systems for Delivering Vocational Education", "text": "According to the \"Survey on Vocational Programs in Secondary Schools,\" almost 90 percent of U.S. public high schools in 1998-99 were comprehensive high schools rather than vocational schools (table 1). The remaining 11 percent of schools were roughly evenly split between area or regional vocational schools (which typically serve students on a part-time basis) and full-time vocational high schools. Among comprehensive high schools, only 63 percent offered at least one program for any of the 28 selected occupations (Phelps et al. 2001). Some comprehensive schools that do not offer these programs might offer individual vocational education courses rather than programs. In addition, some may offer students access to vocational education programs at area or regional vocational schools.4 Thus, student access to vocational education is more widespread than is indicated by schools' program offerings. As evidence of this widespread access, 3The missing program areas include transportation, protective services, and some areas within precision production and communications technology. Based on analyses of the 1998 High School Transcript Study (HSTS),these missing programs include less than 10 percent of students' occupational coursetaking. 4In 1991, over half of all public school districts offered students access to area or regional vocational schools (Office of Educational Research and Improvement 1994)."}, {"section_title": "EDUCATION STATISTICS", "text": "Vocational Wamlicco Offerings B o amid IttCogdosdig 91 percent of 1998 public high school graduates earned credits in occupational coursework.5 The systems used to deliver vocational education were slightly different in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas (table 1).

Specifically, rural schools were less likely than nonrural schools to offer programs for four of the five listed technical occupations, all listed service occupations, and three of the four listed mechanical occupations. Rural schools also were less likely than nonrural schools to offer three of the six listed programs for health and life science occupations, including the relatively common nurse/nurse's aide programs, and two of the four programs for business and marketing occupations (sales associate and restaurant/food service manager).

On the other hand, rural schools were as likely as nonrural schools to offer the two most common business and marketing programs (accountant/bookkeeper and administrative assistant/secretary) and were at least as likely as nonrural schools to offer all listed programs in the building trades. Rural schools were more likely than nonrural schools to offer vocational education programs for welding and for agriscience. The greater propensity of rural schools to offer vocational programs for these two fields would seem to reflect labor market differences between rural and nonrural areasspecifically, the concentration of agribusiness in rural areas. Other factors also could contribute to this pattern of offerings. One hypothesis suggested by the findings is that vocational education programs for expanding occupations (e.g., in technical and health fields) are less commonly offered in rural schools. One way to examine this issue is to compare schools' offerings for occupations that are growing at a relatively fast rate. Of the 28 selected occupations, 10 were projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be fast growing (defined as having a projected growth rate of over 20 percent from 1996 to 2006; Bureau of Labor Statistics 1998) (table 3). Among the public high schools that offered at least one program for any of the 28 selected occupations, an average of 25 percent of the programs offered by nonrural schools were programs for these projected fast-growing occupations, compared to 17 percent for rural schools. In other words, the programs offered by nonrural schools were more likely than those offered by rural schools to be programs that prepare students for occupations expected to be fast growing. This difference in offerings does not necessarily mean that rural schools are less responsive to the labor market than are other schools. Instead, this difference in offerings could reflect labor market differences in rural and nonrural areas.

Many students who, for one reason or another, are not succeeding in regular public schools are being sent to alternative placements. In general, students are referred to alternative schools and programs if they are at risk of educational failure, as indicated by poor grades, truancy, disruptive behavior, suspension, pregnancy, or similar factors associated with early withdrawal from school (Pag lin and Fager 1997). The 2001 \"District Survey of Alternative Schools and Programs,\" conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through its Fast Response Survey System (FRSS), is the first national study of public alternative schools and programs for students at risk of educational failure to provide data on topics related to the availability of public alternative schools and programs, enrollment, staffing, and services for these students. The results presented in this report are based on questionnaire data from a nationally representative sample of 1,534 public school districts. Although there is no single commonly accepted definition of what constitutes alternative schools and programs (Lange and Sletten 2002), this survey included only public alternative schools and programs that were geared toward students at risk of educational failure, that were administered by regular districts,' and where students spent at least 50 percent of their instructional time.\nThe CCD consists of six surveys that are completed each year by state education agencies (SEAs). Three of these surveys provide basic statistical information about public elementary/secondary institutions, students, and staff. Although all information is reported directly from SEAs, the surveys include data about individual states, local education agencies, and schools. The numbers of students who complete high school with a regular diploma or some alternative credential have been reported at the state and local education agency levels since the 1987-88 CCD collection.

Fifty-nine percent (6,400) of all public alternative schools and programs for at-risk students were housed in a separate facility (i.e., not within a regular school) during the 2000-01 school year.

Some students do return to regular schools less \"at risk,\" but many are sent back to or simply remain in (by choice or decree) an alternative school or program for the duration of their education (Quinn and Rutherford 1998).

This annual measure of recent dropout occurrences provides important information about how effective educators are in keeping students enrolled in school. Data used to compute event rates are collected through the CCD and the Current Population Survey (CPS). Status rates provide cumulative data on dropouts among all young adults within a specified age range. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts regardless of when they last attended school. Since status rates reveal the extent of the dropout problem in the population, these rates also can be used to estimate the need for further education and training designed to help dropouts participate fully in the economy and life of the nation. Data used to calculate status rates for young adults ages 16 through 24 are collected through the CPS. Cohort rates measure what happens to a group of students over a period of time. These rates are based on repeated measures of a cohort of students with shared experiences and reveal how many students starting in a specific grade drop out over time.

Conceptually, the dropout collection through the CCD is designed to be consistent with the current CPS procedures. However, there are operational differences in dropout collection procedures between the two data sets. First, the CCD represents a state's public school dropout counts; in other words, the dropout rate represents the number of public school students who have dropped out divided by the total number of public school students enrolled in the state. This differs from the CPS dropout counts in a few ways. The CPS counts include students who were enrolled in either public or private schools. Second, the CPS is a count of young adults who live in the state, not necessarily those who went to school in that state. The third difference between CPS and CCD dropout collection procedures is that the CCD collects data on dropouts from grades 7 through 12 and reports event rates based on grades 9 through 12 versus only grades 10 through 12 in the CPS. Fourth, the CCD collection is based on administrative records rather than a household survey, as in the CPS. One other difference is that, in contrast to the CPS, the CCD collection counts those students who leave public school to enroll in GED programs (outside the public education system) as dropouts, but they are not counted as dropouts in the estimates NCES publishes based on CPS data. Finally,"}, {"section_title": "68", "text": "the CPS is not traditionally used to report state-level dropout estimates. How does the CCD 4-year completion rate differ from the CPS completion rate? The CCD and CPS are different types of data collections that lead to different completion rates. The CCD is an annual administrative records data collection from SEAs of data about schools, districts, and states. The CPS is a monthly household survey of 50,000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide information about employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the civilian noninstitutionalized population. Many of the differences between the CCD and CPS dropout collections are evident in their respective data collection procedures. There are additional distinctions, however. The CCD is more of an accountability measure for states, while the CPS measure defines a population. The main difference is that the CCD 4-year completion rate is a leaver rate: of those who left school, how many completed. The CPS measures an age group of the population (in NCES' case 18-to 24-year-olds) and asks if they graduated from school."}, {"section_title": "70", "text": "NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS GetiD3 2acc1:1 Dropouts aid Gompleters Uturp CeaD &alum @ao Cols @good fteug 998-99 old 9  Thus, the CCD estimates a cohort completion rate for those who have left school, while the CPS provides a status rate based on the total young adult population."}, {"section_title": "National totals", "text": "Because not all states report dropouts using the CCD definition, the CCD cannot provide national totals for dropout or completion rates.

These risk factors involve enrollment patterns, family and financial status, and high school graduation status. From this perspective, the risk 84 factors are highly related to characteristics of a diverse undergraduate population as described in this study, and some (such as parenthood) are one and the same. In 1999-2000, three-quarters of all undergraduates reported at least one risk factor (table C). Overall, the average number of risk factors reported by all undergraduates was 2.2. More risk factors were reported by Black students (2.7), American Indian/Alaska Native students (2.8), and Hispanic students (2.4). The same was found for students with disabilities, who averaged 2.6 risk factors. Based on their risk profile, parents are at greater risk than other undergraduates (i.e., they are financially independent, have children, and may be single parents). Undergraduates with children or other dependents averaged 4.3 risk factors, and single parents averaged 4.7 risk factors. Because female undergraduates were more likely than male undergraduates to be parents, they averaged more risk factors (2.3 vs. 2.1). However, because men were more likely to work full time, no differences were detected between men and women in their overall likelihood of having at least one risk factor (75 percent). According to a study of persistence in postsecondary education (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996), 64 percent of beginning students with one risk factor persisted in their postsecondary program or completed a degree or vocational certificate within 5 years, compared with 43 percent of those with three or more risk factors. Thus, among 1999-2000 undergraduate students with three or more risk factors, at least half might be expected to leave postsecondary education without completing a degree or certificate.8 8The time frame of the persistence survey was 5 years, so it is possible that some students could return after 5 years."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This profile of 1999-2000 undergraduates suggests that the postsecondary education system in the United States offers opportunities to a diverse group of individuals.

One indicator that might be of interest to researchers, students, and parents is the proportion of senior faculty members (i.e., full professors and tenured faculty), particularly those at research and doctoral institutions, who teach undergraduates. Figure C presents this information for 4-year doctoral institutions. Among full-time instructional faculty and staff who taught one or more classes at 4-year doctoral institutions in fall 1998, 63 percent of full professors reported teaching at least one undergraduate class and 37 percent of them reported teaching such classes exclusively.

For example, among both part-and full-time instructional faculty and staff who taught classes at 4-year doctoral institutions, instructors/lecturers were more likely than assistant, associate, or full professors to teach undergraduate classes, and to teach such classes exclusively (table A). Faculty with a lower degree (e.g., a bachelor's or lower degree) were generally more likely than those with a doctoral or first-professional degree to teach undergraduate classes and to teach them exclusively. At 4-year doctoral institutions, part-time faculty were more likely than full-time faculty to indicate that all of their classes were at the undergraduate level, although no difference was found between the two groups regarding teaching at least one undergraduate class. In addition, at 4-year doctoral institutions, non-tenure-track faculty were more likely than tenured faculty to report teaching undergraduate classes exclusively. There was also variation across teaching fields. At 4-year doctoral institutions, both fulland part-time faculty in the humanities were more likely than average to report teaching undergraduate classes and teaching such classes exclusively, whereas those in the health sciences were less likely to do so.  Independent relationship of specific variables to teaching undergraduate classes Most relationships described above remained after taking into consideration various academic and demographic characteristics of instructional faculty and staff. Specifically, after controlling for principal field of teaching, employment status, academic rank, highest degree, gender, race/ethnicity, and age, faculty at 4-year doctoral institutions were still less likely to teach undergraduate classes and to teach such classes exclusively than were their colleagues at 4-year nondoctoral institutions.9 In addition, when other faculty characteristics were held constant, full professors were less likely to teach undergraduate classes or teach such classes exclusively than were instructors/lecturers.

Similar patterns were observed among full-and part-time faculty. However, faculty with a higher academic rank spent more of their time on research and graduate teaching activities and less of their time on undergraduate teaching activities than their junior colleagues. For example, at 4-year doctoral institutions, full-time full professors spent 48 percent of 107 their work time on research and graduate teaching activities, a higher percentage than that spent by full-time instructors/lecturers (22 percent) (figure E).

At the same time, instructional faculty and staff at 4-year doctoral institutions were more likely than their colleagues at 4-year nondoctoral and 2-year institutions to have teaching assistants in some or all of their undergraduate classes. With some exceptions, undergraduate teaching loads at 4-year institutions were inversely related to faculty's academic rank and tenure status. Instructional faculty and staff with higher academic ranks or tenure status (e.g., full professors or tenured faculty) generally had lighter teaching loads than those with lower academic ranks and tenure status (e.g., instructors/lecturers or non-tenure-track faculty). This relationship was more apparent at 4-year doctoral institutions than at 4-year nondoctoral institutions. What Kinds of Teaching Practices Do Faculty Use in Their Undergraduate Classes? Instructional faculty and staff with classroom teaching duties were asked about their use of various methods lecture/discussion, seminar, lab/clinic, and apprenticeship/ fieldworkas primary teaching methods in their classes. According to their responses, the predominant teaching method for undergraduate classes was lecture/discussion. In fall 1998, 83 percent of instructional faculty and staff who taught undergraduate classes reported using lecture/ discussion in at least one of their undergraduate classes (table C) Instructional faculty and staff also used a variety of methods to make assignments, assess students, and grade students' performance. In fall 1998, 60 percent of instructional faculty and staff who taught at least one undergraduate class indicated that they assigned term/research papers in some or all of their undergraduate classes; 44 percent asked students to evaluate each other's work; and 40 percent asked students to submit multiple drafts of written work. To assess students, 62 percent used short-answer midterm or final exams in some or all of their undergraduate classes; 60 percent used essay exams; and 58 percent used multiplechoice exams. To grade students' performance in some or all of their undergraduate classes, instructional faculty and staff were more likely to report using competency-based grading than grading on a curve (61 percent vs. 30 percent). While lecture/discussion was popular, faculty's use of other instructional methods was related to their teaching disciplines. For example, at 4-year doctoral institutions, full-, time faculty in the fine arts (32 percent) and health sciences (30 percent) were more likely than average (16 percent) to use labs/clinics as their primary instructional method in one or more of their undergraduate classes, while their colleagues in the humanities (4 percent), business (7 percent), and social sciences (7 percent) were less likely to do so.

Full-time faculty, with 71 percent of undergraduate credit hours, still constituted the major group in undergraduate teaching in fall 1998. This report also reveals that a majority of full-time senior faculty members (i.e., full professors or tenured faculty), including those at 4-year doctoral institutions, taught at least one undergraduate class in fall 1998. About 40 percent of full-time senior faculty who had classroom instruction responsibilities at 4-year doctoral institutions reported teaching undergraduate classes exclusively. There were, however, variations regarding those who taught undergraduates and how much they taught. First, whether or not faculty taught undergraduates was related to the role and mission of the institution. Instructional faculty and staff at 4-year doctoral institutions were less likely than their colleagues at 4-year nondoctoral and 2-year institutions to teach undergraduates and also had lighter teaching loads if they did teach. Second, within institutions, especially 44er doctoral institutions, undergraduate teaching behaviors were somewhat related to faculty's seniority. Compared with junior faculty, senior faculty were less likely to teach undergraduates, and if they did, they typically had lighter teaching loads and also were more likely to have teaching assistants.

In the recent past, postsecondary education has undergone dramatic changes that have required colleges and universities to examine new ways to efficiently manage their limited resources (Chronister and Baldwin 1999). These changes including increased enrollments of nontraditional students, reductions in state funding, increased availability of distance education instruction and technologies, and increased use of contingent and contract personnelhave led to a reexamination of key faculty issues such as salary, scholarly productivity, teaching performance, and tenure. The literature examining tenure concerns has relied largely on data from two national studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF), conducted in 1988(NSOPF), conducted in , 1993(NSOPF), conducted in , and 1999and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System \"Salaries, Tenure, and Fringe Benefits of Full-Time Instructional Faculty Survey\" (1PEDS-SA), conducted annually since 1987.

Faculty determine curriculum content, performance standards for students, and the quality of students' preparation for careers. In addition, faculty perform research and development work upon which the nation's technological and economic advancement depend. For these reasons, it is essential to understand who they are; what they do; and whether, how, and why the nation's faculty are changing."}, {"section_title": "Target Population and Sample Design", "text": "NSOPF:99 utilized a sample of 960 institutions and 28,576 full-and part-time faculty employed at these institutions. The sample was designed to allow detailed comparisons and high levels of precision at both the institution and faculty levels. The sampled institutions represent all public and private not-for-profit Title IV-participating, degree-granting institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Both the sample of institutions and the sample of faculty were stratified, systematic samples. The institution sample was stratified by Carnegie classifications that were aggregated into fewer categories. The faculty sample was stratified by gender and race/ethnicity. The sample for NSOPF:99 was selected in three stages. In the initial stage, 960 postsecondary institutions were selected from the 1997-98 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Institutional Characteristics (IC) data files and the 1997 and 1995 IPEDS Fall Staff files.? Each sampled institution was asked to provide a list of all of the full-and part-time faculty that the institution employed during the 1998 fall term, and 819 institutions provided such a list. 'In the interest of brevity, this report uses the term \"faculty\" interchangeably with \"faculty and other instructional staff.\" ?Information about IPEDS, as well as data and publications, can be found on tht Internet at htto://nces.ed.gov/ioeds/."}, {"section_title": "1:50", "text": "In the second stage of sampling, 28,576 faculty were selected from the lists provided by the institutions. Over 1,500 of these sample members were determined to be ineligible for NSOPF:99, as they were not employed by the sampled institution during the 1998 fall term, resulting in a sample of 27,044 faculty. A third stage of sampling occurred in the final phases of data collection. In order to increase the response rate, a subsample of the faculty who had not responded was selected for intensive follow-up efforts. Others who had not responded were eliminated from the sample, resulting in a final sample of 19,213 eligible faculty."}, {"section_title": "Data Cogiection Design and Outcomes", "text": "NSOPF:99 involved a multistage effort to collect data from sampled faculty. At the same time that institutions were asked to provide a list of all their faculty and instructional staff (as described above), they were also asked to complete a questionnaire about their policies regarding tenure, benefits, and other policies. Counts of full-time and parttime faculty were also requested on the questionnaire. Prior to sampling faculty from the lists provided by the institutions, counts of faculty on the lists were compared with counts on the questionnaires. If no questionnaire data were provided, the list counts were compared to the, prior year's IPEDS data. If a discrepancy of more than 5 percent existed, intensive follow-up was conducted to rectify the inconsistency. Once an institution's list was determined to be accurate and complete, faculty were sampled from the list and were invited to participate in the study. Intensive locating was performed to ensure that an updated home or campus address was available for each sample member."}, {"section_title": "Institution data collection", "text": "Institutional recruitment began in September 1998 when the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for each sampled institution was asked to designate an institution coordinator, who would be responsible for providing both the list of faculty and the institution questionnaire. The institution coordinator was then mailed a complete data collection packet, including both the institution questionnaire and instructions for compiling the list of faculty. The coordinator had the option of completing the questionnaire via the Internet or returning a paper questionnaire. The list of faculty could be provided in any format; institutions were encouraged to provide the list in an electronic format, if possible. Follow-up with coordinators was conducted via telephone, mail, and e-mail. The field period for list and institution questionnaire collection encompassed approximately 54 weeks. Of the 959 institutions that were determined to be eligible to participate in NSOPF:99, a total of 819 institutions provided lists of their faculty and instructional staff, resulting in an unweighted participation rate of 85.4 percent. A total of 865 institutions returned the institution questionnaire, resulting in an unweighted questionnaire response rate of 90.2 percent."}, {"section_title": "Faculty data collection", "text": "Because lists of faculty were received on a rolling basis, faculty were sampled in seven waves. Data collection for wave 1 began in February 1999, and data collection for wave 7 began in December 1999. Sampled faculty were given the option of completing a paper questionnaire and returning it by mail or completing the questionnaire via the Internet. Sampled faculty in each wave received a coordinated series of mail, e-mail, and telephone follow-up, including as many as two additional mailings of the questionnaire and six e-mail reminders. Telephone follow-up included telephone prompting to encourage self-administration, followed by computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) for nonresponding faculty. Of the final sample of 19,213 faculty who were determined to be eligible to participate in NSOPF:99, a total of about 17,600 respondents completed the faculty questionnaire, resulting in a weighted response rate of 83.2 percent. This response rate takes into account the reduction of the active sample through subsampling as described earlier."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control", "text": "Quality control procedures were implemented for receiving faculty list data and processing it for sampling, monitoring the receipt of completed questionnaires, preparing paper questionnaires for data entry, editing paper questionnaires for overall adequacy and completeness, entering the data, flagging cases with missing or inconsistent data through automated consistency checks, coding responses, checking data entry, and preparing questionnaires, lists, and other documentation for archival storage."}, {"section_title": "Data Quality", "text": "Item nonresponse One measure of data quality is item nonresponse rates. Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent does not complete a questionnaire item. Item nonresponse creates two problems for survey analysts. First, it reduces the sample size and thus increases sampling variance. This happens when respondents must be eliminated from the sample that is used for analyses because they failed to respond to a large percentage of the questionnaire items. As a result, insufficient sample sizes may hinder certain analyses such as subgroup comparisons. Second, item nonresponse may give rise to nonresponse bias. To the extent that the missing data for a particular item differ from the reported data for that item, the reported data are unrepresentative of the survey population. Item nonresponse is also worth examining because it can signal items that respondents had difficulty answering. Item nonresponse rates were calculated by dividing the total number of responses to a question by the number of respondents eligible to respond to that item (n). The standard error of the item nonresponse rate (SE) equals the square root of (RATE * (1RATE)/n). In general, this means that the larger the number of eligible respondents for a particular question and the further the nonresponse rate is from .5, the lower the standard error. Because these estimates were conditional on selection into the sample and do not represent population estimates, for simplicity's sake, the standard errors for item nonresponse rates were modeled as though the sample were a simple random sample. For questions containing multiple subitems, each subitem was counted as a unique question. The mean item nonresponse rate for the institution questionnaire was 3.4 percent (SE=.004). Overall, the item nonresponse rate for the faculty questionnaire was 6.2 percent. More than half of the items on the faculty questionnaire (55 percent) had an item nonresponse rate of less than 5 percent, 25 percent had rates between 5 and 10 percent, and 20 percent had rates greater than 10 percent."}, {"section_title": "Discrepancies in faculty counts", "text": "Another measure of data quality is the magnitude of discrepancies in faculty counts on the lists and questionnaires provided by institutions. When institutions provided discrepant data, they tended to provide more faculty on the questionnaire than on the list. As was detected in earlier rounds of NSOPF, some institutions had difficulty generating lists of part-time faculty. Without discrepancy checks, this can result in serious coverage error, with part-time faculty given less of an opportunity to participate in NSOPF:99. Similarly, earlier cycles of NSOPF indicated that some institutions were less likely to include medical faculty on their lists. Special reminders were inserted into the list collection instructions to encourage institutions to remember to include part-time faculty and medical faculty. In addition, a rigorous check was conducted to ensure the completeness of the faculty lists, with intensive follow-up if needed. Nearly 43 percent of the institutions returning both a questionnaire and a list provided identical data on both. An additional 30 percent had discrepancies of 10 percent or less. Thus, roughly 73 percent of institutions provided data with a discrepancy of 10 percent or less. This stands in marked contrast to the previous cycle of NSOPF, where only 42 percent had discrepancies of 10 percent or less. Part of the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD), the \"Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey\" has two primary purposes: (1) to provide a complete listing of all public elementary and secondary schools located in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and five outlying areas, or operated by the Department of Defense or Bureau of Indian Affairs; and (2) to provide basic information and descriptive statistics on all schools, their students, and their teachers. Data are provided annually by state education agencies (SEAs) from their administrative records. The 2000-01 data set contains 96,570 records, one for each of the listed schools. The following information is included for each school: NCES and state school ID numbers; name of the agency that operates the school; name, address, and phone number of the school; school type (regular, special education, vocational education, or alternative); operational status (open, closed, new, added, or changed agency); locale code; latitude and longitude; full-time-equivalent classroom teacher count; low/high grade span offered; school level; Title I and schoolwide Title I eligibility status; magnet school and charter school status (yes or no); free luncheligible, reducedprice luncheligible, and total free and reduced-price luncheligible students; migrant students enrolled in previous year; student totals and detail (by grade, race/ ethnicity, 'and gender); and pupil/teacher ratio.

CD-ROM: NELS:88/2000 Public-Use Data Files and Electronic CodebookBase Year Through Fourth Follow-up The NCES National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) was designed to provide longitudinal data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. For this study, a nationally representative sample of eighth-graders was first surveyed in 1988. A fourth follow-up was conducted in 2000 to examine what this cohort had accomplished 12 years after the baseline survey. The 2000 data were collected at a key stage of life transitions for the eighth-grade class of 1988most had been out of high school for nearly 8 years and many had already completed postsecondary education, started or even changed careers, and started to form families. This CD-ROM contains public-release data files and an updated electronic codebook from the NELS:88 base year (1988) through the fourth follow-up (2000). Also included is a data file user's manual, which is also available as a separate publication (NCES 2002-323). This CD-ROM contains only the sample surveyed in the year 2000. For any analysis using only data collected prior to the fourth follow-up, the NELS:88/94 CD-ROM (NCES 2000-328) is needed.
