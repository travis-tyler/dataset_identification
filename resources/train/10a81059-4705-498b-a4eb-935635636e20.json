[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Countries differ considerably in their respect for and political recognition of human rights. Using the cross-country CIRI data (Cingranelli & Richards; N = 74 to 191 countries), we tested two main theories: First, the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory going back to Piaget and Socrates postulates that individuals and nations with higher levels of cognitive ability think and behave in a way more conducive to human rights.\nSecond, the culture-religion theory going back to Weber, Sombart and Voltaire postulates that different religious beliefs shape attitudes, and propel societies toward institutions that are more or less supportive of human rights. Two measures of cognitive ability were utilized: the average level of cognitive ability within society, and the level within the society's intellectual class. Two measures of religious belief were also utilized: percentage of Christians, and percentage of Muslims. In path analyses, we controlled for the effects of education, political institutions, wealth, evolution and marriage patterns (consanguinity). Average cognitive ability had a positive impact on human rights but its effect varied substantially depending on the country sample (r = .26 to .51, \uf062 = .10). Cognitive ability of the intellectual classes had larger effects (r = .52, \uf062 = .35 to .38). Most important was religion, the effects of which were observed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. Percentage of Christians had a positive impact (r = .62, total effect \uf062 = .63), and percentage of Muslims had a negative one (r = -.57, total effect \uf062 = -.59). Political institutions are highly correlated with human rights (democracy: r = .70, rule of law: r = .65), but religion appears to be the decisive background factor."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "recognition that they enjoy in different countries (e.g., Posner, 2014) . Human rights -as well as related political institutions such as the rule of law, democracy and press freedom -are rare phenomena, seeming to have only arisen in history under very specific, propitious conditions. Each year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch publish reports detailing the state of human rights in different countries.\nLarge discrepancies are consistently documented. But why do such discrepancies exist?"}, {"section_title": "Theories on the development and practice of human rights", "text": "A first insight into the origins of cross-country differences in human rights can be found in their historical development (e.g. Ishay, 2004; Lauren, 2011) . Human rights were the application of the Sharia for the punishment of criminals: \"There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia.\" The Sharia, however, contains methods of penalization that would be considered unusual and cruel by Western standards, and are proscribed by the UN Declaration. A further inconspicuous but instructive detail is that an important member of the drafting committee for the Universal Declaration, the Arab Charles Malik (1906 Malik ( -1987 from Lebanon, was in fact a Christian, rather than a Muslim. All of the preceding hints that culture seems to be important.\nA second insight into the origins of cross-country differences in human rights can be found in the wording of the declarations themselves. For example, article 16 of the Virginia Declaration from 1776 states: \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our\nCreator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed by reason and conviction, not by force or violence\". Similarly, article 1 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"All human beings \u2026 are endowed with reason and conscience...\" In both of these cases, we see the proclamation being accompanied by a reference to reason, to cognitive faculties, to the ability to argue in a reasonable way. This hints that education and cognitive competence could be relevant factors.\nA third insight into the origins of cross-country differences in human rights can be found in empirical relations. For example, in countries where the rule of law is applied more even-handedly, and where democracy and freedom prevail, human rights tend to enjoy greater respect and political recognition (see Table 2 ). This hints that politics and institutions might play a role. We will now describe the respective theories in more detail."}, {"section_title": "The cognitive-moral enlightenment theory", "text": "The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1948 Piaget ( /1932 Piaget ( , 2001 Piaget ( /1947 ) devised a cognitive-moral development theory for children: According to his theory, cognitive development comprises four successive stages, the last of which is abstract formal thinking that encompasses role-taking, hypothetical reasoning and metacognition (thinking about thinking). The process of cognitive development represents an advancement from cognitive egocentrism to decentered thinking. According to Piaget, moral development -the ability to judge ethical problems in an impartial and unbiased way -relies on prior cognitive development. Indeed, cognitive and moral development are structurally similar. In both is acquired a well-founded, reasonable structure. As Jean Piaget (1948/1932, p. 404) stated: \"Parallelism exists between moral and intellectual development: ... Logic is the morality of thought just as morality is the logic of action.\" And this parallelism is based on the cognitive nature of morality, e.g. to behave ethically one has to take the perspective of third parties.\nThis theory has roots in both the enlightenment and classical philosophy. The idea that evil is a result of ignorance can be found in the dialogs of Socrates (Protagoras 358c, Plato, 1997/-350) :\n\"Do you say that ignorance is to have a false belief and to be deceived about matters of importance? \u2026 No one goes willingly toward the bad or what he believes to be bad; neither is it in human nature, so it seems, to want to go toward what one believes to be bad instead of to the good.\"\nThis idea can also be found in Aristotle's Nicomachean ethics (2000/-322, III, 1, p. 39): \"In fact, every wicked person is ignorant of what he should do and refrain from doing, and missing the mark in this way makes people unjust and generally bad.\"\nPiaget's ideas were invoked by Kohlberg (1984) and others, who elaborated the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory and provided evidence for it. Cognitive ability and moral judgement have been found to correlate at r = .62; and if age is partialled out the correlation is still an impressive r = .50 (Krebs & Gillmore, 1982) . Cognitive ability is the result of cognitive development, and the Piagetian development level correlates with psychometric test scores at about r=.50 to .70 (Hattie, 2009, p. 43; Jensen, 1980, p. 674) . McNamee (1977) compared stages of moral development with helping behavior by means of an experiment. Individuals who were deemed to be at a higher stage of moral development, as measured by Kohlberg's approach, were more likely to help a person in need, by giving some advice (r=.63) or via personal assistance (r=.60).\nSimilarly, Kohlberg (1984, p. 70, p. 546) found that in Milgram's fictitious torture experiment, fewer individuals at higher stages of moral development followed the order to torture a third party. Likewise, in Milgram's experiment on obedience, participants were asked to subject another person to electric shocks in order to improve their learning; only 13% of participants at the highest stage followed this order versus 75% of participants at the lowest moral stage.\nFurther support can be found in negative correlations between cognitive ability and criminality. Correlations using different tests and various real world crimes are around r = -.23 (e.g. Cunha et al., 2006, p. 751, own reanalysis) . Note that this correlation is due not only to a direct effect of cognitive ability (i.e., reflecting on the consequences of one's own behavior), but also to its indirect effects via variables such as personal income and social status. There is also some evidence that cognitive ability correlates with pro-social attitudes (see Solon, 2014 ).\nThe cognitive-moral enlightenment theory has been applied by sociologists and philosophers to the level of whole societies, cultures and historical developments:\nAccording to J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1984 Habermas ( /1981 , societies that are able to operate at the highest cognitive level -the so-called formal operational stage (e.g., \"decentration of an egocentric understanding of the world\"; Habermas, 1984 Habermas, /1981 -are well-placed to enhance and broaden rationality including institutions, ethics and culture (e.g., \"rationally motivated mutual understanding ... consensus formation that rests in the end on the authority of the better argument\"; Habermas, 1984 /1981 .\nRational discourse and fair argumentation can constitute the cornerstone of rule of law including human rights (Habermas, 1996 (Habermas, /1992 .\nSimilarly, Georg W. Oesterdiekhoff (e.g. 2009a Oesterdiekhoff (e.g. , 2009b Oesterdiekhoff (e.g. , 2014 Oesterdiekhoff (e.g. , 2016 has applied the Piagetian approach, bringing together psychogenesis and sociogenesis to many societal and historical phenomena. For example, rising cognitive ability level (i.e., the FLynn effect) contributed to the disappearance of cruelty in punishment and in public theatrical performances (arena games), as well as fundamentally changed the concepts of legal rights, leading to the improved treatment of others including women, children, animals and enemies (see also Pinker, 2011) .\nFinally, the cognitive ability levels of intellectuals (i.e., members of the intellectual class: philosophers, scientists, politicians, business elites etc.) may be crucial because it is precisely these individuals who build-up institutions and shape the worldview on which the next generation of scientific and social innovations are based. For example, scholarly works pertaining to rights and laws were promulgated by such enlightenment philosophers as John Locke, Du Marsais, Baron d'Holbach, Montesquieu and Immanuel Kant."}, {"section_title": "Culture, worldviews and religion", "text": "Culture prescribes values for individuals, groups and entire nations, which guide ways of thinking and living. In its every-day usage, culture refers to dietary habits, clothing customs, artefacts, works of art, architecture, literature and music. While these are the more tangible and easily observable manifestations of culture, they arguably do not constitute its core. Rather, its core comprises the descriptive and normative elements of worldviews. By influencing thinking and behavior, these worldviews shape the physical, social and mental environment of individuals and groups alike. Religions provide worldviews that have transcendental content, usually comprising elements such as a distinct founder as well as some supernatural and wondrous epiphenomena. They also have secular content, are gradually blended with non-religious traditions, and undergo historical developments, including changes in interpretation and practice over time. Religions constitute a central element of culture, influencing everyday habits and orientations in non-religious domains (e.g. Burckhardt, 1943 Burckhardt, /1905 .\nReligious texts make prescriptions concerning behavior, ethics and how to deal with others, especially those who are different. Religion may affect beliefs and social organization via (1) its original message, (2) the 'role model' function of its founder, (3) later interpretations of its original message, and (4) its lived practice. Different religions may have markedly different impacts on human rights. The history of human rights indicates that two religions are especially important, namely Christianity and Islam. It is on these two that we shall focus.\nChristianity -which was originally based on Judaism, was later reshaped by Greek, Roman and European traditions, and was further developed by scholastic theology, Protestantism, the Enlightenment and burgher society -arguably provides a supportive foundation for the development of human rights: In Judaism and Christianity, \"God created man in his own image\" (Gen 1:27 ESV). Humans being the image of God, \"God-likeness\", implies treating humans in a respectful way. Of course, at first blush, history reveals large discrepancies between the message of Christianity and the actual behavior of Christians. However, this does not mean that such behavior was consistent with the Christian message, and in many cases it was criticized by prominent Christians at the time. The Christian message had a corrective function. For instance, the inhumane treatment of American Indians by Spanish colonists was criticized by the Dominican priest Bartholom\u00e9 de Las Casas (as mentioned above). The abolitionist movement was organized by Protestants and led by the Evangelical Christian William Wilberforce. The horrors of war were mitigated by charities such as the Red Cross, which was founded by the evangelical Christian, Henry Dunant.\nWithin Christianity, Protestantism stresses conscience, individual guilt, internal control, autonomy and self-responsibility (Weber, 2008 (Weber, /1904 . All these traits are conducive for liberty, the rule of law, democracy and human rights (e.g., \"Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded.\"; Nietzsche, 2009 Nietzsche, /1885 . As Alexis de Tocqueville (2010 /1835 ) noted in his seminal work, 'Democracy in America', religion supported the development of liberty, democracy and rule of law in North America: \"They brought to the New World a Christianity that I cannot portray better than by calling it democratic and republican: This will singularly favor the establishment of the republic and of democracy in public affairs. From the onset, politics and religion found themselves in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since.\" Whereas Max Weber emphasized the difference between Protestantism and Catholicism, Werner Sombart (1998 Sombart ( /1913 In contrast, Islam has arguably served to stymie the development of human rights.\nThis starts with the original message, is amplified by the role model function of the founder, is continued in the later understanding of the original message, and is bolstered by lived practice. Compared to Jesus, who is not reported to have killed anybody, Muhammad took part in wars, executions, cruel punishments (e.g., stoning) and enslavement. There are many instances within the Koran in which unbelievers, Christians, Jews, women, sinners (e.g. adulterers) and enemy combatants are treated in an unequal, disparaging or cruel way. While Christian saints are depicted as victims, who are sacrificed through violence, e.g. Jesus, John and Paul, the sword in Paul's hand is the sword by which he was executed, the opposite message is true of Islamic ones. Some examples: \"And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush.\" (Sura 9:5) \"Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land.\" (Sura 5:33) On Jews: \"Say, 'Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that as penalty from Allah? [It is that of] those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of Taghut.'\" (Sura 5:60) \"Allah has promised you much booty that you will take [in the future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld the hands of people from you -that it may be a sign for the believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path.\" (Sura 48:20) criticized by Western intellectuals early on, such as Voltaire (\"Fanaticism, or Is there any empirical evidence as to the effects of religion on behavior related to human rights defined more narrowly or more broadly to include such as violence, corruption and criminality? According to a study by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony in Germany, more religious Muslims tend to be more violent, whilst more religious Christians tend to be less violent (Baier et al., 2010, pp. 117f.) .\nAnd for education the pattern is reversed: higher religiosity among Muslim youth is associated with lower education, while among Christians, higher religiosity is associated with higher education (Baier et al., 2010, pp. 90f.) . In a broader sample of six West European countries, more Muslims exhibited out-group hostility than Christians (Koopmans, 2014) . For example, 54% of Muslims but only 11% of Christians agreed with the statement, \"Don't want homosexual friends\", while 44% of Muslims but only 9% of Christians agreed with the statement, \"Jews cannot be trusted\". Many terrorist groups in different parts of the world (e.g. the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Boko\nHaram, ISIS, Abu Sayyaf, Uyghur terror groups) explicitly refer to Islam and jihadIslamic holy war. Across Western countries, the higher the percentage of Muslims, the greater the threat of Islamist violence (r = .59; Carl, 2016 Carl, , 2017a . While it could be countered that this is a trivial result (who else but Muslims would carry out violence in the name of Islam?), non-religious violence is also associated with Islamic affiliation. In Scandinavia, the rate of immigrant crime across different groups is related to the percentage of Muslims in the home country (r = .60, \uf062 = .37) and to the home country's average IQ (r = -.57, \uf062 = -.37), but less to the home country's GDP per capita (r = -.43, \uf062 = -.28; Kirkegaard, 2014a Kirkegaard, , 2014b ). An association between criminality and percentage of Muslims in the home country has also been observed across Dutch immigrant groups (r = .24), which was higher for second generation immigrants (r2G = .54 vs. r1G = .12), and increased when income was controlled (r = .36; Kirkegaard, 2015) . The effect on crime appears to be robust across countries and control variables.\nOther studies have documented that, in Protestant countries, trust is higher, corruption is lower and levels of social and economic freedom are higher (Delhey & Newton, 2005; Harrison, 2013) . People tend to be more self-controlled, having internalized social rules, meaning that harsh and violent control by the state is not needed. In addition, domestic violence is more frequent in the Middle East than in Europe (37% vs. 25%; e.g. WHO, 2013, pp. 17f.) .\nThe evidence adduced above suggests that religion not only exerts an effect on attitudes towards disbelievers or towards particular transgressions (e.g., adultery, homosexuality), but may also exert a diffuse effect on aspects of personality such as self-regulation and impulse control: The phenomenon is broader. There is not only a direct effect on specific behavior motivated by the verbatim religious message.\nPersonality, worldviews and culture are shaped in interaction with developed institutions and the effects of groups, e.g. multiplier and aggregated effects in schools, neighborhoods and societies. Of course, it is hard to disentangle the effects of say, Protestantism, from a general civilizing process (Elias, 2000 (Elias, /1939 , which may itself 2 \"Harby\", an Arabic term, today written \"harbi\", literally means to \"belong to the war\". It is a concept of Islamic law referring to those non-Muslim people, who are not subjected and do not have been influenced by other factors, such as cognitive ability, historical contingency and evolution. Furthermore, religion may also have had an effect through education. For example, Protestantism placed emphasis on reading and autonomous thinking (e.g. older studies Sombart, 1998 Sombart, /1913 Weber, 2008 Weber, /1904 ; or newer studies Becker & Woessmann, 2007; Harrison, 2013; Steppan, 2010) . Religion may enhance or impede cognitive ability, thereby exerting an indirect effect on ethics (cognitive-moral enlightenment theory)."}, {"section_title": "Institutions and political-historical processes", "text": "Culture is not only shaped by religion but also by past political, historical and institutional processes. Moreover, these processes have a direct impact on human rights "}, {"section_title": "Further supportive or impeding factors: Evolution and consanguinity", "text": "There is no genetic theory relating specifically to the establishment of human rights or to ethical behavior. However, there is a theory concerning pacification and behavioral pay special taxes. (Frost, 2010) , which are both clearly conducive to ethical behavior. The gradual build up of Roman institutions via a central authority, including the courts, guards and military, led to the monopolization of violence manifested in the Pax Romana. In hunter-gatherer societies, male violence typically has a positive effect on fertility (Chagnon, 1977) between 0.5 and 1 homicides per 100,000 (Frost & Harpending, 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "self-control", "text": "A complementary theory was developed by Gregory Clark (2007): In Britain, from the mediaeval times on until the 19 th century, the middle-class and the rich had more surviving children than the poor. In addition, membership of a particular class was not only dependent on one's parents' class but also on one's own behavior. In other words, individuals who were able to make it into the higher social classes, i.e. those with traits such as conscientiousness, predictability, discipline, peaceableness, delay of gratification and industriousness, left more surviving children. Society therefore gradually came to be populated by individuals with \"burgher\" traits, which were more conducive to economic development. This theory can be broadened (to Western Europe) and deepened (i.e., grounded in a specific cultural pattern) by appeal to the Western European marriage pattern (Hajnal, 1965) . By the end of the sixteenth century, it was socially prescribed that an individual (especially a man) could only marry if he could make a living for himself, a spouse and his children -i.e., only if he had achieved a certain position within society, e.g. possessing a farm, being a master craftsman, or practicing as a professional. This led to late marriage, high rates of childlessness (of about half of the cohort), more rights for women, and large investments in education. Going further than Hajnal himself did, it arguably also enhanced delay of gratification, self-control (especially of sexuality), conscientiousness, frugality, industry and cognitive ability. The causes of this marriage pattern can be traced to Roman, Germanic and Christian traditions, to the interests of the church, and to the interests of landlords and guilds. Its impact via both culture and evolution, via both personality and ability, laid the foundation for burgher society, for industrialization and for the socio-political ascent of the West.\nAll three theories (Frost's, Clark's and Hajnal's) describe a process of embourgeoisement, a gentrification of society in personality, manners, orientations and behavior (resembling the historical-sociological theory of Elias, 2000 Elias, /1939 . However, although all three theories are well-supported by circumstantial evidence, none has been supported by direct evidence of selection on individual genes. We do not yet know precisely which genes contribute to the various psychological and behavioral traits in question, so we cannot run tests for positive selection using genomic data. But there are genetic markers (markers of evolution and ancestry, which can be used (e.g., Putterman & Weil, 2010) .\nA second genetic approach concerns consanguinity: that is marriage between close relatives (usually between cousins). Insofar as they bring together two copies of rare recessive alleles, consanguineous unions tend on average to exert a deleterious neurological-cognitive effect on children, which results in a lowering of IQ by about -3 to -6 IQ points (inbreeding depression; Jensen, 1983; te Nijenhuis, 2010) . Other health and personality effects that have been linked to consanguineous unions include personality disorders and psychosis (Bener et al., 2016) .\nIn addition, consanguinity within society acts to reduce cooperation between unrelated persons insofar as it makes such cooperation less useful and riskier; and consanguinity decreases both trust and individualism -all of which have a negative effect on democracy. In the study of Woodley and Bell (2013) , the correlation between consanguinity and democracy was r = -.63; in regressions the negative effects were about \uf062 = -.45 to -.74 (and see Carl, 2017b; Schulz, 2017) .\nFinally, for all mentioned processes apply that they are related to culture: They depend(ed) on a certain culture and they produce(d) a certain culture."}, {"section_title": "Our approach", "text": "Our approach is a statistical one, based on country-level data from the 20 th and 21 st centuries. We utilize cognitive ability (as measured by student assessment and intelligence tests), as well as religion (as measured by percentages of adherents), and analyze their effects on respect for human rights. We employ regression analysis to help us answer the questions: How large is the statistical effect of cognitive levels compared to the one of religion in explaining cross-country differences in human rights? Are there relationships between country differences in cognitive ability or religion on the one hand, and country differences in human rights on the other?\nWe use international data sets. We assume the larger the statistical effect, the closer the relationship, e.g. between ability and human rights, and the larger is the impact of ability on human rights. In order to justify such conclusions, besides theoretical substantiation, possible additional factors have to be controlled and reasonable intervening factors considered. We start with simple bivariate correlations. However, a correlation between two variables obviously does not necessarily represent a causal effect. E.g. cognitive ability may influence human rights; human rights may influence cognitive ability; or a third variable, e.g. religion, may influence both cognitive ability and human rights.\nWe attempt to deal with this problem in the following ways: first by presenting (what we hope is) a convincing theory, namely, that cognitive ability enhances human rights (see above); second by controlling for potentially confounding variables (possible \"real causes\") via partial correlations, regressions and path analyses; third by including intervening variables to showing direct and indirect effects, e.g. the effect of education on human rights via cognitive ability; fourth by using cross-sectional and longitudinal models, the latter being capable of analyzing reciprocal effects, e.g. of ability on human rights and of human rights on ability; and fifth by employing different indicators of the same construct, and checking the robustness of effects, e.g. for human rights general vs.\nwomen's rights.\nLimitations: Our analyses do not represent a study of ideas and their influences over historical time. We do not conduct an analysis of the history of ideas in co-development with society and institutions. However, we have outlined the historical processes above, and we have described why cognitive ability, religion, institutions and other factors might have an impact on the development of human rights and their practice today.\nNevertheless, a thorough historical analysis remains a task for historians and philosophers."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Human rights: Data on human rights were taken from the CIRI Human Rights project For the purposes of coding, CIRI uses the country overviews provided by the US"}, {"section_title": "State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Amnesty", "text": "International's Annual Reports (described by Cingranelli & Richards, 1999; Cingranelli & Richards, 2010; Cingranelli et al., 2014) .

Student data from countries with only regional data were corrected so as to be more nationally representative (e.g., Shanghai for China). IQ estimates that were not directly measured were also corrected.\nObviously incorrect data were excluded or corrected (e.g., TIMSS 2007 Kazakhstan, psychometric IQ for Bosnia). Student assessment scores and psychometric IQ test results are highly correlated, and form a strong international G-factor (rs around .80 to .92; Coyle & Rindermann, 2013) .\nMany student assessment studies also provide data for the 95%-ability level (i.e., intellectual classes, high achievement groups).

Rather, it stands in for the possible effect of evolution that could be detected in the future by detailed genetic-psychological studies, whilst controlling for important background factors such as religion and other important environmental factors, e.g. politics and wealth.\nConsanguinity measures the percentage of unions to close relatives, i.e., the degree of inbreeding (in a biological language). Information is taken from Woodley (2009) The data given on background variables are far from optimal (e.g., somewhat old, not based on the largest samples, few research groups, difficult to measure).

The weakness of the correlations implies that some countries are high in physical integrity but low in freedom of speech, and that some are low in freedom of religion but high in women's rights, and so on, which seems somewhat difficult to believe. The correlations of the human rights subconstructs with rule of law, political freedom, democracy and gender equality are also not as high as expected. For example, the correlation between the rule of law and physical integrity is only r = .62, the correlation between political freedom and freedom of speech is only r = .74, and the correlation between gender equality and women's rights is only r = .71 (Table 2) .\nOn closer inspection of the human rights data, it appeared that peculiarities in the values for particular country-years could help to account for these low correlations. For example, in 1981 Israel achieved the same result for physical integrity (2) as North Korea and Bolivia. Spain (4) is identical in physical integrity to Cuba but scores worse than Haiti, Egypt and Sudan (5). In 2011, Russia had the same physical integrity result (0) as Libya and Eritrea. Sweden (7) scores worse than Singapore (8), and Israel (2) scores worse than Iraq (3). There seem to be some coding issues (Wood & Gibney, 2010 Furthermore, the pattern of correlations between the subconstructs of human rights and the various measures of political conditions shown in Table 2 makes sense: There is a stronger correlation between political freedom and freedom of speech (r = .74) than there is between either of these variables and any of the others in the table. Similarly, there is a stronger correlation between gender equality and women's rights (r = .71) than there is between either of these variables and any of the others. The validity of the human rights subconstructs is therefore supported by a multitrait-multimethod matrix approach.\nAdditionally, the overall (averaged) human rights construct exhibits a higher correlation with the criterion variables than the average of the correlations of each subconstruct with each criterion variable. For example, in Table 2 , rule of law and human rights correlate at r = .65, whereas the average correlation of the four human rights subconstructs with the rule of law is only r = .50 (based on .62, .43, .32, .64 ).\nFinally, our two conceptually identical measures of GDP per capita, Maddison and Penn, correlate at only r = .76 (N = 158). It is only when the natural logarithm of each indicator is used, that the correlations reaches a respectable level of r = .94. In summary, the human rights data are not perfect, but do show some validity, which is improved through statistical adjustments."}, {"section_title": "Human rights, education and cognitive abilitythe cognitive-moral enlightenment theory", "text": "According to the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory, higher cognitive ability contributes to ethical behavior as manifested in respect for human rights. Education is a proxy for cognitive ability, but also captures the effects on other variables, such as personality and attitudes. Cognitive ability measures correlate positively with human rights (see Table 1 ). The correlations are higher for the overall human rights construct than for the individual subconstructs. This is a typical result, and can be attributed to the impact of averaging on reliability. However, of the human rights subconstructs, physical integrity and women's rights appear to correlate most strongly with the cognitive ability measures.\nWe do not have a straightforward explanation for this. Why should freedom of speech and religion depend less on cognitive development? It may simply be attributable to contingencies of the data construction process. When all the predictor variables are compared in the same sample of countries (N = 95, in parentheses), two patterns can be detected. First, education is slightly more highly correlated with human rights than cognitive ability is (r = .54 vs. .50 to .51). This may be because attitudes fostered by education have an effect on human rights, over and above the impact of cognitive ability. Second, the intellectual class measure of cognitive ability is slightly more highly correlated with human rights than is average cognitive ability (r = .52 vs. .48). The social, political and legal institutions that support human rights are constructed and disproportionately maintained by members of the intellectual class. Thus differences among countries in the cognitive ability level of institution builders are more important than differences in the cognitive level of the average person or of lower ability groups.

The correlations with political conditions also represent a check on the validity of our human rights measure, especially the correlations with the rule of law measure -given its conceptual proximity to human rights. Wealth can be seen as another potential determinant of respect for human rights. Of course, human rights and political conditions influence each other, and both may depend on the same factors.\nAll the correlations between political and economic conditions and human rights are positive (see Table 2 ). Contrary to expectation, the correlations with the human rights measures are highest for political freedom, not for the rule of law (r = .84 vs. .65).\nWomen's rights appear to especially benefit from well-functioning effective governments (r = .65), but -unsurprisingly -is most strongly correlated with gender equality (r = .71), which supports that measure's validity. Similarly, freedom of speech is most strongly correlated with political freedom (r = .74). Human rights measures are more strongly correlated with political conditions than with GDP per capita (r = .41), which supports the validity of the human right measures. Table 3 around here please"}, {"section_title": "Background factors: Religion, evolution and consanguinity", "text": "Correlations with potential background factors are displayed in Table 3 . Christianity The correlation of human rights with religion is higher than the one with education (r = .38), and the one with cognitive ability (r = .26 to .51/.52). In summary, while the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory receives support, the culture/religion theory seems to provide a better empirical-statistical explanation for cross-country differences in respect for human rights. All religions other than Christianity and Islam are less important.\nHowever, one interesting methodological point should be mentioned: it is most difficult to measure Animism. There is no single church, and certainly no official membership; Animism is of course more an orientation or practice than an organized religion (e.g., Voodoo, Candombl\u00e9, Macumba). Nonetheless, the pattern of correlations (Table 3) . Skin brightness is more highly correlated with human rights than is cranial capacity (r = .25 vs. .18). Of course, skin color itself is unlikely to exert any effect; it constitutes a marker for evolutionary pressures that may be associated with culture (see Introduction). However, in the case of cranial capacity, a causal effect is more plausible, because brain size may be a proxy for intelligence, working via the cognitive-moral enlightenment path.\nFinally, consanguinity is very strongly and negatively correlated with human rights (r = -.65). The negative correlation with women's rights (r = -.64) is particularly large.\nWhen comparing these correlations to those with other variables, it is has to be kept in mind that the consanguinity data are only given for 74 nations. If the correlations with religion are re-estimated in that same sample of 74 countries, they become much larger in magnitude: the Christian-Muslim contrast and human rights are correlated at r = .80\n(consanguinity and human rights at r = -.65). In a multiple regression analysis, the effects differ dramatically, with the one for religion being much larger: \uf062CMC \uf0aeHR = .76, \uf062Cons \uf0aeHR = -.05 (N = 74; correlation between Christian-Muslim contrast and consanguinity r = -.79). This indicates that country samples have to be comparable, and that there can be also indirect effects, here from religion to consanguinity. Path analyses must take this into account."}, {"section_title": "Path analyses comparing and integrating factors Figure 1 around here please", "text": "To begin with, we tested the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory against the cultureworldview-religion theory while only considering cognitive ability and religion - Both depend positively on cognitive ability in a society, especially on the level of its intellectual class. We had initially assumed, based on the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory, that cognitive ability has a direct effect on human rights. However, when political conditions are assumed to depend on cognitive ability, the direct effect of cognitive ability becomes around zero. This direct effect was therefore excluded.\nIn this model (see Figure 2) , religion (percentage of Christians) has a strong direct effect on human rights (\uf062Christ \uf0aeHR =.31). Its total effect including indirect effects (e.g. via democracy .48 \uf0b4 .52 = .25, which has to be added) is \uf062ChristTot \uf0aeHR = .63. So religion is the most important variable. The strongest direct effect is exerted by democracy (\uf062Demo \uf0aeHR = .52), but its causal impact is less clear. There is obviously a conceptual overlap between the constructs of democracy and human rights, meaning that the relevant paths may have been somewhat over-controlled. Even under these conditions, religion exerts a strong direct impact on human rights. And if GDP per capita is added, the direct effect of religion is only reduced from \uf062Christ \uf0aeHR = .31 (.308) to \uf062Christ \uf0aeHR = .30 (.303) -a negligible change. GDP per capita itself has only a weak impact on human rights (\uf062GDP \uf0aeHR = .10). Differences in human rights between countries can therefore be explained primarily by differences in culture, i.e., religion. Looking more closely at the model, education has a positive effect on cognitive ability (\uf062Educ \uf0aeCA = .74), and the general cognitive ability level of a society on the cognitive level of its intellectual class (\uf062CA \uf0ae95% = .85). Intellectual classes have a positive impact on wealth (\uf06295% \uf0aeGDP = .52) and democracy (\uf06295% \uf0aeDemo = .31). For all three variables the model is rather uncomplex: First, cognitive ability increases education, not only education increases cognitive ability. Second, the ability level of intellectual classes also increases the general ability level of a country. Finally, intellectual classes have also a positive impact on the general cognitive ability level of a society via research, education and institutions. All models have their limits."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3 around here please", "text": "In a third model, we added the second background factor, namely evolution (g factor of evolution; Figure 3 ). Compared to the effect of religion (percentage of Christians), the effects of evolution on education and cognitive ability are much stronger (\uf062Evo \uf0aeEduc = .51, \uf062Evo \uf0aeCA = .56, \uf062Evotot \uf0aeCA = .56 + (.51\uf0b4.40) = .76, vs. \uf062Christ \uf0aeEduc = .33, \uf062Christ \uf0aeCA = .33\uf0b4.40 =.13). Adding a direct path from religion to cognitive ability results in a small negative effect (\uf062Christ \uf0aeCA = -.05). The strong effects of evolution on education and cognitive ability also mean that the indirect effects of evolution via education, cognitive ability, intellectual classes, democracy and wealth are larger. However, for the central question, explaining national differences in human rights, religion is decisive. First, there is a large direct effect of religion on human rights (\uf062Christ \uf0aeHR = .31; Figure 3 ), this effect is identical to the one where evolution is omitted (Figure 2 ). Adding evolution does not alter the effect of religion. Second, if a direct path from evolution to human rights is added, the magnitude of the effect is near zero (\uf062Evo \uf0aeHR = -.04). Third, religion also has an indirect effect on human rights via democracy (.51 \uf0b4 .40 = .24). For understanding international differences in human rights, religion is crucial."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4 around here please", "text": "In the fourth model, we substituted democracy for the rule of law, which is conceptually closer to human rights (Figure 4) .

Its total effect is identical to the one using democracy as an intervening variable (Figure 2 ). Again, religion appears crucial for human rights. short-run effect of people with certain beliefs but also a long-run effect of people with a more secular worldview shaped by religion: cultural, personality and institutional effects tend to persist even if religious affiliation and faith fade out, as has happened in most Western European countries (Harrison, 2013) .\nAs in our cross-sectional analyses, cognitive ability and religion (percentage of Christians) each have a positive impact on human rights. Again, the effect of religion is stronger than the effect of intelligence and knowledge (\uf062Christ \uf0aeHR10 = .36 vs. \uf062CA90 \uf0aeHR10 = .27). The reciprocal effect of human rights on cognitive ability is comparatively small (\uf062HR80 \uf0aeCA10 = .06). Religion also has a positive impact on cognitive ability (\uf062Christ \uf0aeCA10 = .12).\nThe effect of religion on human rights (percentage of Christians: \uf062Christ \uf0aeHR10 = .36) is robust in longitudinal models when measuring religion as the percentage of Muslims (\uf062Muslim \uf0aeHR10 = -.32) or as a Christian-Muslim contrast (\uf062CMK \uf0aeHR10 = .42), as well as when utilizing education rather than cognitive ability (\uf062Christ \uf0aeHR10 = .37, \uf062Educ80 \uf0aeHR10 = .16; N = 103), or the rule of law rather than cognitive ability (\uf062Christ \uf0aeHR10 = .44, \uf062RoL96 \uf0aeHR10 = .28; N = 125). Religion appears to be the crucial variable for explaining international differences in respect for human rights.\nOur final analyses concern effects for regional sub-samples. Within sub-Saharan Africa, which has a comparatively low ability level on average (Rindermann, 2013 ) the percentage of Christians is still positively (but weakly) related to human rights (r = .10; N = 48), and the percentage of Muslims is still negatively(but weakly) related to human rights (r = -.12). Evolution has a somewhat larger positive effect (r = .25; N = 42), whereas cognitive ability does not (r = -.10, restricted variance; N = 47). In a regression analysis, the effects of background variables become stronger: The Christian-Muslim contrast has a positive effect, \uf062ChMuC \uf0aeHR = .14, as does the evolution variable \uf062Evo \uf0aeHR = .31 (N = 42).\nWithin the \"Third World\", a rough category comprising poor developing and emerging countries, the effect of religion is strong. The overall human rights construct has a strong correlation with the percentage of Christians (r = .51; N=102), and the percentage of Muslims (r = -.45), but is essentially unrelated to the evolution variable (r = .03; N = 91), and does not have a positive correlation with cognitive ability (r = -.10; N = 101). Partialling out wealth (GDP per capita) is another strategy similar to a within Third World analysis, but is less arbitrary (than the three worlds categorization), and uses variation across many more countries: It yields a correlation between Christianity and human rights of rp = .56, a correlation between Islam and human rights of rp = -.54, a correlation between evolution and human rights of rp = .00, and a correlation between cognitive ability and human rights of rp = -.06. Again: Religion is crucial for understanding international differences in human rights."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The study has tried to answer the question of why nations differ in their respect for and recognition of human rights. The main hypotheses that we examined were: first, the cognitive-moral enlightenment theory, based on Socrates, Piaget, Kohlberg, Habermas, Oesterdiekhoff and others, namely that higher cognitive ability renders people better able to take the positions of others, and thereby act less self-interestedly and more ethically; and second, the culture-religion theory, based on Weber, Sombart, Harrison and others, namely that religions shape attitudes and psychological dispositions relevant to ethical behavior. Our analyses controlled for institutional (democracy, rule of law), economic (GDP per capita), evolutionary (ancestry) and familial-genetic (consanguinity) factors.\nCognitive ability had a positive impact on human rights (r = .26 to .51, \uf062 = .10), as it does on many positively valued societal characteristics, such as economic productivity, income, wealth, democracy and health (e.g. Coyle, Rindermann & Hancock, 2016; Jones, 2016) . However, its effect on human rights varied substantially depending on the country sample (i.e. lower in Africa and the Third World). Additionally, the level of intellectual classes had larger effects on human rights than the average ability level did (r = .52, \uf062 = .35 to .38; similarly for the economy: Coyle et al., 2017) . The cognitivemoral enlightenment theory was supported, yet the effect of religion was stronger and more robust, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal models, than the effect of cognitive ability. Percentage of Christians had a positive impact (r = .62, total effect \uf062 = .63), while percentage of Muslims had a negative one (r = -.57, total effect \uf062 = -.59). Education is an important intervening variable, and depends on religion. Wealth as measured by GDP per capita is comparatively unimportant for human rights. Evolution is important for explaining education and cognitive ability differences between countries (a view that is commonplace among experts, see Rindermann, Becker & Coyle, 2016) , but its direct effect on human rights is small compared to that of religion.\nFinally, consanguinity has a robust negative effect on women's rights.\nComparing different Christian denominations (measured by the percentages of adherents in the population), Protestantism and Catholicism both exerted strong effects of similar magnitude, whereas Orthodox Christianity exerted weak effects. Thus, the contention of Sombart, namely that Protestantism is an accentuation of a trend established by Catholicism, is supported more than that of Weber, who argued that there is a categorical difference between the two denominations. However, it must be stressed that, during the course of the reformation, the enlightenment and burgher society, Protestantism had an influence on Catholicism. Catholicism today is clearly different from the Catholicism of the 15 th century, and this is not only due to internal progress but also due to Protestantism -both its direct and indirect effects. It has been shown empirically (e.g. by Becker & Woessmann, 2007, p. 29) that Catholics living in predominantly Protestant counties in Germany have a higher literacy level than those living in predominantly Catholic counties, i.e., they benefited in education from the presence of Protestants. Such evidence hints that it is not just the initial message (e.g., the holy book) and the founder of a religion that are relevant (both are identical for the two denominations), but also later interpretations of the religion's initial message.\nReligions evolve over time, and may eventually amalgamate into the local culture.\nAttributes of peoples and ideas of intellectuals are important; factors, that are not independent from evolution and sometimes accidental historical occurrences: For example, no European power has ever been strong enough to rule the entire continent.\nThere were the emperor vs. the pope, center vs. periphery, nobles vs. cities, citizens vs. knights, northern vs. southern vs. western vs. eastern powers (e.g. Weede, 2012) .\nNote that our study is not historical in nature. It does not trace the development of ideas and religions over historical time. However, studies that do attempt this could obviously shed further light on the development of human rights. Such studies could also examine the interplay between culture and society by considering how factors such as education, cognitive ability and intellectual classes (e.g. Scholastic philosophy) altered religious messages and religious thinking during the course of history. The evidence we have presented supports the view that religion, especially Christian Protestantism, has contributed to the development of universal human rights.\nFinally, historical-hermeneutic or empirical-statistical case studies may help to further enhance our understanding of the determinants of human rights. Studies comparing countries with a common origin that today have rather different levels of human rights are particularly revealing: e.g. Turkey, Greece and Arabian countrieswhich are all descendants of the Ottoman Empire. The same is true for Israel and Egypt.\nSimilarly, the former British colonies of Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, which have different dominant religions, could be compared. Case studies might also contrast pairs of countries with different roots, but with important common characteristics: such as Canada versus Mexico, both are former colonies, but one in the British-Protestant and one in the Spanish-Catholic tradition; Sweden versus Spain, both are smaller European countries which have long been independent, but one is Protestant and one is Catholic; Russia versus Iran, both are old empires with no democratic tradition, but one is Christian Orthodox and one is Shiite Muslim; or Britain versus China, both are old empires at high levels of cultural and cognitive achievement, but one is Protestant and one is Confucian.
