Methods-Radiographs of 695 participants aged 2 40 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study ofAging were read for changes of OA, using Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 2 as the case definition. Results-Logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, revealed a significant association between OA in the knee and the following joint groups: distal and proximal interphalangeal (DIP, PIP) and Hand2 (OA in two or more hand joint groups) for grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 disease, and the first carpometacarpal (CMCI) joint for grade 3-4 disease. Conclusion-There is an association between OA in hand sites and the knee. The strength of the associations increases with increasing disease severity. For the PIP site, there is a trend toward increasing strength of association for increasing numbers of affected joints and bilateral disease.\n(Ann Rheum Dis 1996; 55: [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Generalised osteoarthritis (GOA) was reported as early as 1805 and was re-emphasised in 1952 by Kellgren and Moore.' In 1969, Lawrence described radiographic GOA, a polyarticular subset of osteoarthritis (OA), in a population based sample from Leigh and Wensleydale, England.2 Two criteria were used for case definition: either three or more, or five or more joint groups with grade [2] [3] [4] OA (as defined in the Atlas of Standard Radiographs),3 among the joint groups visible on radiographs from the following sites: hand, foot, knee, pelvis, and cervical and lumbar spine. The concept of GOA was validated in other population based studies using radiographically defined OA,4 however none of the earlier studies reported the association of OA between specific joint groups. More recently, the co-occurrence of OA at two of three major OA sites (hands, knees, and hips) was examined in a clinic based population in whom OA was defined by radiographs and clinical symptoms.' The only significant association was found between knee and hand OA in women.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine if the association between radiographic hand and tibiofemoral knee OA occurrred more often than that which could be attributed to chance alone, after adjusting for age, which is the strongest known risk factor for OA, and body mass index, as a measure of obesity, which is a risk factor for radiographic OA in some joint sites."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY POPULATION", "text": "All subjects in this study were participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a multidisciplinary research project conducted at the Gerontology Research Center, National Institute on Aging in Baltimore, Maryland. The continuing research project began in 1958 and was limited to male participants until 1978, when women began to be enrolled. Participants are community dwelling volunteers of middle to upper socioeconomic status, who are evaluated at two year intervals. Radiographs of the hands have been taken quadrennially since inception of the research project, and knee radiographs were added to the examination procedure in 1985. Ninety six percent of the BLSA participants are white; they were aged from 18 to 93 years at entry to the study. This paper reports a study of a population (referred to hereafter as the study population) limited to white participants (426 men and 269 women aged 40 years and above) who had bilateral hand and knee radiographs, obtained at the same visit, from 1985 to 1991."}, {"section_title": "RADIOGRAPHS AND DEFINITIONS", "text": "Bilateral posteroanterior hand and bilateral standing anteroposterior tibiofemoral knee radiographs were read for the presence of OA as described in the Atlas of Standard Radiographs. 3 The five point Kellgren-Lawrence scales used (0-4) were: grade 0 = normal; grade 1 = questionable; grade 2 = mild; grade 3 = moderate; grade 4= severe. Definite OA was defined as Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or higher, present in at least one joint of a given group.6 Radiographs of each joint site were read by a separate radiologist (hand: WWS; knee: RR), blinded to the subject. Previously obtained inter-reader (and intra-reader) intra-class correlations for these investigators and joint sites were 0 74 (0 80) and 0'68 (087), respectively.7 8\nThe following joint groups were examined: the knees, and the distal and proximal interphalangeal (DIP, PIP) and first carpometacarpal (CMC1) joints of the hands. For convenience, the occurrence of definite OA in at least two of the three hand joint groups was termed Hand2.\nAnthropometric measurements were made of height (m) and body weight (kg). Obesity was measured as body mass index (BMI) (kg/(m)2). DATA "}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS", "text": "Separate multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratio for the association of knee OA with OA at each hand site: knee OA was the dependent variable; the independent variables were BMI, which is continuous; age, which is ordinal (by decade); gender, and OA at each hand site, which are dichotomous. The reference group for all of the knee OA and hand site OA association analyses was no involvement of the respective hand sites. Interaction terms consisted of combinations of the independent variables. For the DIP and PIP hand sites, the contribution of increasing numbers of affected digits, and unilateral or bilateral disease was compared with no affected digits at the respective site.\nTwo sets of dummy variables were created: the first set was to test the association of interphalangeal (IP) and knee OA in two joint increments of affected IP joints; the second set was to test the association of IP and knee OA using two groupings of unilateral and bilateral IP OA. In group I, the dummy variables were created for unilateral or bilateral OA of one or Age (years) more affected digits, respectively. In group II, hand OA was further broken down into the following dummy variables: one affected digit; more than one affected digit unilateral disease: one affected digit on each hand; bilateral hand joint OA, two or more affected digits present on at least one hand. The dummy variables in each group were analysed using no affected hand joint digits as the reference.

Figure 1 shows the age and gender specific prevalence of grade 2-4 OA for each joint group studied. The DIP joint was the most frequent site of OA involvement in both genders and all age groups. Hand OA was significantly more prevalent in women at age 60 and older at each hand site, especially the CMC 1. The prevalence of grade 2-4 knee OA was comparable in men and women. Figure 1 also demonstrates the strong association between increasing age and increasing OA prevalence at each joint site. Figure 2 shows the overall prevalence of grade 2-4 polyarticular OA by sites involved. The combination of DIP and knee involvement had the greatest prevalence: 29A4% for men and 32-6% for women. The combination of three joint groups (Hand2 plus knee OA) was not uncommon, with a prevalence of 22-0% for men and 26-0% for women. An age associated increase in grade 2-4 hand and knee polyarticular OA occurred at significance levels of p < 0 0001, regardless of the hand site involved Significance of associations: *p < 0-05; **p < 0-01; ***p < 0-001."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main finding of this study is the association between radiographically defined hand joint and tibiofemoral knee OA in a healthy, community dwelling population, after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI. The trends in age and gender specific prevalence of hand and knee OA sites in this study are similar to those reported in other population based studies of radiographic OA. 4 6 915 In studies in which hand, feet, knee, hip, and spine radiographs were available, non-nodal GOA was slightly more common in men than in women, and nodal GOA and severity of OA at individual sites were more common in women. Grade 2-4 polyarticular OA at the DIP, PIP, CMC1, and Hand2 plus knee OA sites had greater prevalences in women in our study (fig 2) . However, associations of OA between specific joint groups were not reported in the earlier polyarticular OA studies2 and data concerning Heberden's nodes have not been analysed in the BLSA cohort.\nAlthough we found a significant association between hand and knee OA in both men and women in our study, Cushnaghan and Dieppe found an association in women only.5 This difference may be attributable to the different composition of the study populations: healthy community volunteer compared with clinic based. Different case definitions (symptomatic radiographic disease versus radiographic disease) may also have contributed, as gender specific differences in symptom reporting have been documented.'6 However, the possibility of a gender difference in the occurrence of polyarticular OA should not be disregarded. Although the differences in the gender specific odds ratios in our study did not achieve statistical significance when a gender-by-hand site interaction variable was added to the logistic regression model for the entire study population, there may not have been a sufficient number cases of polyarticular OA in the younger and sometimes the eldest age strata to allow detection of an interaction. '7 Investigation of the significance of this trend would require analysis of larger samples from the same or comparable populations.\nThe strengths of association for the various unilateral and bilateral DIP joint OA variables were comparable (table 4); the lack of significance for unilateral or bilateral single digit DIP OA, and multidigit unilateral OA, probably reflects the small numbers of affected participants. For PIP OA, there was a trend toward increasing association for numbers of joints involved and bilateral disease (fig 3,  table 4 ). The wider confidence interval for one digit bilateral disease, overlapping that for bilateral disease with more than two digits, may account for the greater odds ratio point estimate of the former. In summary, this study examined the association between radiographic changes of hand and knee OA in a healthy, community dwelling population. The findings include significant associations between radiographic OA at the DIP, PIP, and CMC 1 joints, and the knee. The strength of these associations increased with disease severity and, for the PIP site, there was a trend toward increasing strength of association with increasing numbers of affected joints and bilateral disease.\nThis study was supported in part by a grant from the Arthritis Foundation, Maryland Chapter.

We would like to describe a patient who was significantly older than the age incidence mentioned in their study and posed considerable diagnostic difficulty.\nA 66 year woman was referred urgently by her general practitioner with a two week history of sore throat, fever, weight loss, arthralgia/myalgia, and a rash. Apart from a history of hypertension she had previously been well. When examined, she had a non-suppurative pharyngitis, a generalised polyarthritis with bilateral knee joint effusions and wrist and ankle joint synovitis bilaterally. She had an erythematous macular rash affecting her arms, legs, and trunk. She was pyrexial, with a temperature of 40\u00b0C. There was no obvious site of infection. Examination of the abdomen was normal; in particular, there was no hepatosplenomegaly. Investigation revealed erythrocyte sedimentation rate 123 mm/lst h, haemoglobin 12-5g/0/%, leucocyte count 28-6 x 109/l (differential count, 94% polymorphs), mildly increased concentrations of urea and creatinine AUTHORS REPLY: Drs Dunne and Davies reported a case of adult Still's disease in an elderly patient and emphasised the difficulties of diagnosis, particularly in this age group. We share their opinion as to the difficulty of making a diagnosis ofASD, which is the reason why we used the criteria of Ohta et al (sensitivity 96%; specificity 92%/) in all but one case. Nevertheless, in our experience diagnosis does not seem any more difficult in elderly patients: in our sudy we identified two patients who were 61 and 62 years old.\nDrs Dunne and Davies suspect many cases of ASD to be mild. In our study we did not distinguish between mild ASD or full ASD, but required the symptoms to fit with the criteria of Ohta et al.\nIn conclusion, we agree that what is required is greater awareness of this disease, and we believe that making studies of its incidence is one approach to achieving progress towards that aim. MacGregor and colleagues' reported a lower prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in black Caribbeans than in white subjects in Manchester. There are grounds for supposing that one cause of RA is low testosterone levels.2 It has been reported that in the USA, black males have significantly higher testosterone levels than white males.3 '5 A similar difference has been reported in the USA between (pregnant) black and white females.6 It seems likely that part of this racial variation of testosterone levels is not genetic.7 Meanwhile, it would be interesting to know whether there is racial variation in testosterone level in this country."}, {"section_title": "Correction", "text": "Association ofhand and knee osteoarthritis: evidence for a polyarticular disease subset "}]
