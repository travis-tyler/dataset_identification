[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract The purpose of the study was to understand the association between stressful life events prior to conception (PSLEs) and women's alcohol and tobacco use prior to and during pregnancy, and the continuation of such use through pregnancy. Data were from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (n=9,350). Data were collected in 2001. Exposure to PSLEs was defined by indications of death of a parent, spouse, or previous live born child, divorce or marital separation, or fertility problems prior to conception. Survey data determined alcohol and tobacco usage during the 3 months prior to and in the final 3 months of pregnancy. Weighted regressions estimated the effect of PSLEs on alcohol and tobacco use at each time point and on the continuation of use, adjusting for confounders. Experiencing any PSLE increased the odds of tobacco use prior to (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.87) and during pregnancy (AOR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.19-2.07). Women exposed to PSLEs smoked nearly five additional packs of cigarettes in the 3 months prior to pregnancy (97 cigarettes, p=0.011) and consumed 0.31 additional alcoholic drinks during the last 3 months of pregnancy than unexposed women. PSLEs are associated with tobacco use before pregnancy and alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy. Alcohol and tobacco screening and cessation services should be implemented prior to and during pregnancy, especially for women who have experienced PSLEs."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy are known risk factors for adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight and birth abnormalities, as well as fetal and infant death (Kesmodel et al. 2002; Patra et al. 2011; Rogers 2009 ). In 2012, 24.6 % of US women aged 15 to 44 reported using tobacco, and more than 50 % reported drinking alcohol (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2013). While many women discontinue their alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy-perhaps due to the known deleterious consequences or social stigma of substance use during pregnancy-rates of alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy among US women have remained unacceptably high at 8.5 and 15.9 %, respectively (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2013). Reducing alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy may require the focus of cessation efforts to be shifted upstream to the preconception period, specifically targeted both to preventing the initiation of unhealthy alcohol and tobacco use, as well as to promoting the cessation of use prior to conception (Association of State and Territorial Health Officials 2013; US Surgeon General 2001; US Surgeon General 2005) . Therefore, understanding the factors associated with alcohol and tobacco use before and during pregnancy, as well as disparities in alcohol and tobacco cessation during pregnancy, may be critical to improve intergenerational health outcomes.\nMaternal stress may be an important factor in predicting substance use in the perinatal period. Theory suggests that some women use alcohol and tobacco to cope with stress (Niaura and Shiffman 1995) , and previous clinic-based studies have found associations between perceived stress and tobacco use during pregnancy (Woods et al. 2010) . Research has also demonstrated the health importance of exposure to stress across the lifecourse, particularly prior to conception, for both women and their children (Witt et al. 2014a, b) . However, no studies have examined how stressful life events prior to conception (PSLEs) influence the use of alcohol and tobacco immediately prior to and during pregnancy.\nAs such, this study sought to understand whether PSLEs affect women's health behaviors prior to and during pregnancy using a nationally representative, population-based sample. Specifically, this study examined whether and to what extent PSLEs are associated with tobacco or alcohol use in the 3 months prior to conception and with the continuation of tobacco and alcohol use through the final 3 months of pregnancy."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Data were from the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative cohort of children born in 2001 and their parents. The ECLS-B used a clustered, list frame design to select a probability sample of the approximately 4 million children born in 2001, with oversampling of children from minority groups, twins, and children born very low birthweight and low birthweight (United States Department of Education 2001). Children born to mothers under 15 years of age, those who were adopted after the birth certificate was issued, and those who did not survive up to 9 months of age were not included in the sampling frame (Snow et al. 2009 ). Over 14,000 births were sampled from all registered births from the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics system, and contacted. From these sampled births, the final study cohort (consisting of completed 9 month interviews) of 10,700 was formed when the children were approximately 9 months old.\nRestricted data was obtained with permission and approval from the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) Data Security Office of the US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). In accordance with NCES guidelines, all reported unweighted sample sizes were rounded to the nearest 50 (United States Department of Education 2001). The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences institutional review board considered this study exempt from review.\nParticipants were eligible for this study if the main survey respondent was the infant's biological mother (n=10,550); 450 additional records missing birth certificate data were subsequently excluded. ECLS-B included individual records for each child within twin pairs identified through oversampling; for this analysis, one twin was randomly selected from each pair to retain in the sample. For other multiples in the sample (i.e., not explicitly recruited as part of the oversampling), only one infant from the household was surveyed. The final sample contained 9,350 mother-child dyads, surveyed approximately 9 months after delivery."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Alcohol and tobacco use Participants were asked about their alcohol and tobacco usage during the 3 months prior to pregnancy and in the final 3 months of pregnancy; responses were dichotomized as \"any\" versus \"none.\" Additionally, participants reported the total number of cigarettes smoked in an average day and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed in an average week both before and during pregnancy (alcohol use categories were operationalized ordinally at their midpoint). Continuation of use into pregnancy was derived from these variables.\nStressful life events prior to conception The date of conception was derived using birth certificate data on the length of gestation and the infant's date of birth. Women were coded as having experienced a PSLE if they indicated that one or more of the following events occurred prior to conception: (1) death of the respondent's mother, (2) death of the respondent's father, (3) death of a previous live born child, (4) divorce, (5) separation from partner, (6) death of a spouse, or (7) fertility problems. All of these experiences were considered or operationalized as stressful life events in previous research (Holmes and Rahe 1967; Witt et al. 2014a, b, c) . Death of a previous live born child was collected from the birth certificate and was assumed to have occurred prior to conception.\nPrenatal health and stress Birth certificate data determined if women had experienced any of the following pregnancy complications: anemia, diabetes, (oligo) hydramnios, hypertension during pregnancy, eclampsia, incompetent cervix, Rh sensitization, uterine bleeding, premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption, or placenta previa. Birth certificate data also identified women who had previously delivered a preterm or small for gestational age (SGA) infant and women with chronic conditions (including cardiac disease, lung disease, genital herpes, hemoglobinopathy, chronic hypertension, renal disease, or other medical risk factors 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, or 35 years or older) , marital status at the infant's birth (married or living with partner, separated, divorced, widowed, or never married), health insurance coverage during pregnancy (no health insurance, any publicly funded insurance, or private health insurance coverage only), US region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West), and socioeconomic status (SES). SES was defined using a 5-category composite index (quintiles) generated by the NCES that incorporated the following: (1) father's or male guardian's education, (2) mother's or female guardian's education, (3) father's or male guardian's occupation, (4) mother's or female guardian's occupation, and (5) household income (United States Department of Education 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Analyses were conducted using survey procedures from SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC) and Stata SE 12 (College Station, TX). The standard errors were corrected due to clustering within strata and the primary sampling unit, and applied survey weights were used to produce estimates that accounted for the complex survey design, unequal probabilities of selection, and survey nonresponse. Summary statistics were generated to describe sample characteristics; chi-square and Kruskall-Wallis tests determined significant differences in sociodemographic characteristics between women who did and did not experience any PSLE and by alcohol and tobacco use prior to and during pregnancy.\nFour separate multivariable logistic regression models examined the impact of maternal exposure to PSLEs on the probability of any alcohol or tobacco use in the 3 months prior to pregnancy and in the final 3 months of pregnancy.\nMultivariable negative binomial regression examined the impact of maternal exposure to PSLEs on the mean number of alcoholic drinks ingested per week, and the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day. Using the results from the negative binomial model, marginal effects were used to estimate the total number of alcoholic drinks ingested and total number of cigarettes smoked during each 3 month period. Standard errors were estimated using the delta method (Agresti 2002) .\nTo identify the predictors of the continuation of alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy, separate multivariable logistic regression models and multivariable negative binomial regression models examined the predictors of continued use of alcohol or tobacco among a subsample of women who used either alcohol or tobacco prior to pregnancy. All models adjusted for concurrent alcohol or tobacco use, maternal chronic conditions, prepregnancy BMI, parity, race/ethnicity, age, marital status at birth, health insurance coverage, SES, and region of residence.

Women who did not receive prenatal care were the most likely to smoke prior to pregnancy (44.9 %) and during pregnancy (31.5 %); these women also had the highest rate of continuation between the two time points (70.2 %) and smoked more cigarettes on average at each time point. The prevalence of smoking before and during pregnancy was lowest for women in the highest SES quintile (7.1 %) and for Asian/Pacific Islander women (1.2 %), respectively.\nWomen who experienced any PSLEs had higher odds of ever smoking prior to pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.87; Table 4 ) and smoked more prior to pregnancy on average (96.96 cigarettes over 3 months, p=0.011).

The findings from this study indicate that mothers who experienced any PSLE were more likely to use tobacco before pregnancy and both alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy. Among women who smoked prior to pregnancy, women who experienced SLEs during pregnancy were more likely to continue smoking in the third trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, concurrent substance use was highly predictive of tobacco and alcohol use prior to, during, and continuing into pregnancy. In this national study of US women, 37.9 % reported using alcohol and 23.2 % reported using tobacco in the 3 months prior to pregnancy. Although prenatal substance use was found to be far less prevalent, the fact that 49.0 % of pregnancies in the US in 2001 were unintended (Finer and Henshaw 2006) suggests that many women may have used substances during the early first trimester before realizing they were pregnant, a critical period when many fetal organ systems form (Moore et al. 1988 ). The preconception period thus provides a crucial opportunity for clinicians to identify substance use in women of childbearing age and intervene before there are deleterious health consequences for women and their babies. A number of validated alcohol screening instruments and evidence-based alcohol and tobacco guidelines have been developed for clinical settings, and studies have shown that brief interventions designed to reduce alcohol and tobacco use in women of childbearing age are both feasible and effective (Floyd et al. 2008; US Surgeon General 2001) . Growing evidence also indicates that preconception care can modify women's risky behaviors, such as tobacco and alcohol use (Xaverius and Salas 2013) , and it may be advantageous to incorporate PSLEs into existing screening tools.\nThis study also identifies two important risk factors for the continuation of either alcohol or tobacco use into pregnancy: stressful life events during pregnancy and the concurrent use of both of these substances. These findings, which are corroborated by previous clinic-based studies (Harrison and Sidebottom 2009; Pirie et al. 2000; Zimmerman et al. 1990) , suggest that women who report these risk factors may need targeted interventions to achieve cessation. Furthermore, previous clinic-based research has found that these two groups of women are also less likely to respond positively to cessation interventions, suggesting that integrated approaches that address both stress and concurrent substance use may be warranted (Pirie et al. 2000) .\nIt is known that prenatal tobacco and alcohol consumption are important risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes, including low birth weight, premature birth, sudden infant death syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome (Cornelius and Day 2000; Dietz et al. 2010; LandesmanDwyer 1982; Little and Wendt 1991; Yerushalmy 1971) . The neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with these negative maternal health behaviors place a substantial economic strain on the US, both in terms of avoidable medical costs (Adams et al. 2002; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2002) and indirect costs to society (Bouchery et al. 2011) . Given these considerable consequences, reducing the burden of alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy is one of the leading public health objectives. In fact, Healthy People 2020 outlines several objectives with the goal of reducing the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use, particularly among reproductive aged adults and pregnant women (US Department of Health and Human Services and Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2013), and the Affordable Care Act requires that health plans provide universal alcohol and tobacco screening and cessation services for all adults, with expanded services for pregnant women (US Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Despite the fact that tobacco use and alcohol misuse screening and cessation counseling are considered to be particularly important and efficacious preventive health actions (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2011), the prevalence of these negative health behaviors reported here and in other studies suggests that pervasive, long-term cessation among vulnerable populations has not been achieved through current efforts (Tong et al. 2013 ; US Preventive Services Task Force 2003; US Preventive Services Task Force 2004). As this study identified PSLEs as significant predictors of tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy, it may be advantageous to incorporate PSLEs into existing screening tools in order to identify women who may require additional behavioral counseling interventions to reduce alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy. Further, as cessation often requires multiple attempts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2013), population-level interventions that are administered universally to reproductive aged women may demonstrate the greatest success at reducing these behaviors during pregnancy; alternatively, the use of PSLEs to identify high-risk reproductive aged women may be a particularly cost-effective way to utilize finite resources to tackle this important public health issue.\nSeveral potential limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, women may have underreported their alcohol and tobacco use (both any use and the amount of use) prior to conception and during pregnancy (Ebert and Fahy 2007; Jacobson et al. 2002) . However, the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use prior to and during pregnancy is similar to other national estimates (Muhuri and Gfroerer 2009; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Office of Applied Studies 2009). As few women reported using alcohol during pregnancy, these analyses may have been underpowered to detect effects for PSLEs on this health behavior. In addition, the ECLS-B collected categorical, rather than continuous, data on the exact numbers of alcoholic drinks. Therefore, estimates from the negative binomial models may not be precise. Analyses relied on self-reported data for factors like prepregnancy BMI, which may have biased the estimates in an unknown direction. The ECLS-B collected limited data on stressful life events and may not have comprehensively captured the spectrum of stressors some women experience, which might have resulted in misclassification."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This nationally representative study shows that PSLEs are associated with increased tobacco use prior to and during pregnancy, as well as an increased amount of alcohol use during pregnancy among US women. The findings further suggest that the influence of PSLEs on health behaviors can last throughout a woman's pregnancy. Such results lend support for the call to implement alcohol and tobacco screening and cessation services prior to pregnancy, as these services may improve the long-term health of these vulnerable women and their children."}]
