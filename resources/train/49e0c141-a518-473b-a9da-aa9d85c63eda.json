The formulation of such targets acknowledges the importance of research and innovation in a competitive and globalised economy and implies the availability of a highly skilled workforce. In the case of the European Union, it was estimated that at least 500 000 more researchers would be needed to reach the target of 3% by 2010. Doctoral graduates are at the same time the most qualified people in terms of educational attainment and those who are trained and most predisposed for research careers. They are expected to contribute to the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and technologies. While higher education systems undergo many transformations everywhere, little is known about the current developments in the career paths of doctoral graduates and recent work at the OECD has raised a number of questions about their education-to-work transition, employment and mobility patterns (Auriol, 2004). Do we train too many or too few of them? To what extent are they in competition with other graduates? Are they fully operational when they arrive on the labour market after many years of study? What is the role of postdoctoral positions? How many leave research for other types of jobs? For which reasons? What is their employment pattern in terms of public vs. private sectors? Are they mobile across sectors and internationally? In order to get responses to these questions and better understand the situation of doctorate holders on the labour market, the OECD initiated in 2004 a collaborative project with the UNESCO's Institute for Statistics (UIS) and Eurostat on careers of doctorate holders (CDH). The first results of this project are presented in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Brief description of the CDH project", "text": "As early as 2002, the OECD Secretariat explored the potential of graduate and/or doctorate surveys. A paper on \"Entry of Doctorate Recipients into Working Life: Survey Systems of France, the United States and the United Kingdom -Points of Comparison\" [DSTI/EAS/STP/NESTI (2002)19] was prepared by a consultant for a workshop on human resources in science and technology organised in 2002. This work was followed by the establishment of an inventory of doctorate recipients' surveys in OECD countries, which was presented at a subsequent workshop in 2003. The inventory on \"Availability and Characteristics of Surveys on the Destination of Doctorate Recipients in OECD Countries\" [DSTI/DOC(2003)9] has shown that many such surveys existed at national level and that they provided valuable information for the understanding of career patterns and mobility of the most highly educated population and of researchers, who are recruited for a large part among doctorate holders. However, such surveys had been developed to serve national statistical needs and priorities and were not harmonised internationally, therefore limiting international comparison of the results and failing to capture some important characteristics of this cadre of talents, such as their international experience or mobility. For this reason, the OECD launched in 2004 a collaborative project to improve countries' capability to survey recipients of highly advanced (doctorate level) degrees. The objective is to develop an internationally comparable production system of indicators on their careers and mobility building on surveys currently existing in some countries (in particular those of the United States and Canada) and on other data sources. An important element of this work is to measure the mobility of doctorate holders both within a country and across borders. Interest in cross-border movements requires surveys to be internationally comparable, and the OECD to partner with other relevant international organisations, i.e. UIS and Eurostat. An expert group was set up at the end of 2004 to develop the different components of the work. Currently, the expert group brings together some 30 countries from a wide variety of regions world-wide and at different stage of development. Large OECD countries such as the United States and Japan are represented, as well as numerous European countries, but also important emerging economies -e.g. China and India -and developing countries (e.g. Uganda) concerned with their loss of talents. However, the involvement of these countries in the project varies according to the development of their statistical system and the resources they may dedicate to it. In 2005, the group worked on the development of a three-component package -methodological guidelines, output tabulations and a core model questionnaire -in co-ordination with the three international bodies involved. A first metadata and data collection was launched in Autumn 2005, which provided a first set of results for seven countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and the United States. It is the aim of this paper to present and analyse these results."}, {"section_title": "Labour market characteristics and international mobility of doctorate holders: first results for seven OECD countries", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data availability and sources", "text": "The project on careers of doctorate holders (CDH) aims at determining the stock of persons having obtained a highly advanced degree across participating countries, as well as their demographic and educational characteristics, their labour market situation and international mobility. In addition, the ambition of the project is to give information on the career development and prospects of doctorate holders. The approach is therefore wide and the project, for this reason, draws on all data sources that may provide information at national level while aiming to report in a harmonised and internationally comparable manner. Censuses and labour force surveys are widespread and reasonably harmonised data sources at international level. They can provide the basic contextual data on doctorate holders that are needed in addition to the more complex indicators on career path or trajectories emanating from cohort, longitudinal or retrospective surveys. Five of the seven countries that reported data in this first exercise have extensively drawn from their census and/or labour force survey, while sometimes also using other data sources. The data for Australia and Canada are for the most part generated by the national censuses, while those for Germany and Switzerland originate from the labour force surveys. The data for the United States, on the other hand, come from dedicated surveys -i.e. the National Survey of College Graduates and the Survey of Earned Doctorates. Canada has also conducted a Survey of Earned Doctorates in 2003 and 2004 on the model of the one in the United States and also used some of the results for data provision in this exercise. Argentina and Portugal on the other hand have conducted dedicated surveys using the core model questionnaire developed in the framework of the project. In the case of Portugal, the survey was a pilot test before the first full-scale international survey planned for 2007. For this reason, the data presented here for Portugal only cover recent doctorate holders, those having received their doctoral degree between 2000 and 2004, while the whole population of doctorate holders is covered in the aforementioned countries. In the case of Argentina, only employed doctorate holders are covered. In addition, those doctorate holders who work exclusively for the business sector (without having any academic activity) are not covered, but it would seem that their number is quite limited. For more details on data availability and sources, see Annex Tables 1 and 2."}, {"section_title": "Number of doctorate holders in the population", "text": "The data collected in the framework of the CDH project helps determine the number of doctorate holders in the population and in the labour force (Table 1) and shows a very contrasted situation between some of the European and non-European countries having participated in this first exercise. The share of doctorate holders in the population or labour force of Germany and Switzerland is two or three times higher than in Australia, Canada and the United States. It is well known that European countries produce a higher share of university and especially doctoral degrees than the United States (OECD, 2005) and graduation rates calculated from official education statistics and shown in Table 1 confirm this. In the case of Germany and Switzerland (but not Portugal), it seems that this also translates into a high percentage of doctorate holders in the population and labour force. However, data are not available for a sufficient number of countries to see if this pattern can be generalised to other European countries. There may also be questions on what is counted as a doctorate in each country and how the ISCED 1 level 6 definition of an advanced research degree is applied. The data for Germany and Switzerland, for instance, comprise doctoral degrees in medicine which are not counted under ISCED 6 in the United States. This, however, is not sufficient to explain the differences in the volume of degrees delivered between these countries. "}, {"section_title": "Demographic characteristics of doctorate holders", "text": "The first striking demographic feature of doctorate holders is that of the under-representation of women. With the remarkable exception of Argentina (and Portugal, to a lesser extent), men represent at least two-thirds and sometimes up to three-quarters of doctorate holders in the five other countries. The balance is a bit better in the United States and Germany than it is in Australia and especially Canada and Switzerland. The situation is also improving over time, as can be seen from the two countries (Canada and the United States) that have reported data with an interval of some years (Table 2). This improvement can be attributed to a catching-up phenomenon when looking at the age structure of doctorate holders: except for Argentina, women are in all cases younger than men (Figures 1 to 8)."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "The ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) is used for classifying educational programmes and degrees at international level. The age distribution of doctorate holders varies from one country to another. The youngest population is found in Australia with 40% of doctorate holders under 45 years old and 32% over 55. Germany and Switzerland also have around 40% of their population under 45, but a higher percentage (36.7% and 37.6% respectively) is over 55 years old. The United States has an older population of doctorate holders characterised by both a higher share of people over 55 (38.8%) and a lower share of people under 45 (32.2%). Canada is in an intermediary situation between the two European countries and the United States with 35.6% of persons over 55 and 37.6% under 45. Data for Canada and the United States also show that the population of doctorate holders has aged over five or ten years of interval. The age distribution of doctorate holders in Argentina is characterised by a very high share (more than 60%) of those between the ages of 35 and 55, and a very low share (around 4%) under 35. Could it be that the young doctorate holders are mainly employed in the business sector (not covered by the survey) or abroad? "}, {"section_title": "Educational characteristics of doctorate holders", "text": "Doctoral degrees are granted at a younger age in Germany and Switzerland (around 32-33 years old) than in Australia, Canada or the United States (35 to 37 years old) or Portugal (37 to 38 years old) as may be seen from Table 3. This may be explained by different factors affecting the organisation of higher education at national level: structure of programmes, public or private funding of institutions, access to doctoral fellowships/scholarships, dependency on loans, or the need to work to finance one's studies. "}, {"section_title": "Source:", "text": "First OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders. The time to complete a doctoral degree also appears to be much longer in the United States than in other countries, i.e. longer by approximately 30 months (Table 4). This may partly be explained by the fact that the duration in this country is calculated from the start of graduate school since students may join a doctoral programme just after their bachelor degree. Many however will first prepare a master degree. Another reason explaining the longer duration of doctoral degree completion is the lesser access to fellowships or scholarships and the need for students in the United States to work as research or teaching assistants in parallel with the preparation of their thesis (Table 5). Note: In the United States, time to complete is defined as duration between starting and completing graduate school. Source: First OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders. Differences in graduation age and time for completion between men and women are not very significant in four countries out of seven. However, women obtain their doctoral degree on average at the age of 37 in Canada compared to age 35 for men. Women are also more than one year older than men when they earn their degree in the United States. The opposite is true in Germany. \nFirst OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders. There are also differences in graduation age and completion time by field of doctoral degree: it takes longer to prepare a thesis in humanities or social sciences than one in medical sciences, and even longer than one in natural sciences or engineering and technology. This again may be due to a number of different factors. First, field work in humanities or social sciences may take longer than laboratory experiences in natural sciences or technology. Second, the availability of public funding and/or fellowships/scholarships in natural sciences and engineering is probably more substantial than in social sciences or humanities. The data in Annex Tables 3 to 6 confirm this: a higher percentage of students in natural sciences and engineering benefit from fellowships or scholarships and from teaching or research assistantships. Students in social sciences and humanities on the other hand are more dependent on other forms of funding such as other occupations, loans, personal savings or family support. These results converge with the findings of S. Kergroach and M. Cervantes (2006) who report that \"the average duration of PhD programmes is variable across countries from a minimum of 3 years to a maximum of 6 or 7 years. (\u2026) Generally PhD studies are longer in humanities, social sciences or theology. (\u2026) International differences in the duration of PhD studies may be due to a range of factors such as the availability and amount of funding for PhD studies, the structure of academic programmes, the labour force status of PhDs and post-doctorates (i.e. students versus employees).\"\nFirst OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders and OECD Educational Attainment database. The transition of doctorate holders to employment can take some time, as is the case for all young university graduates. For example, a survey conducted by the CEREQ 2 in France shows that 7.4% of doctoral degree awardees in 1998 were still unemployed in 2001 (P. B\u00e9ret, J.-F. Giret, I. Recotillet, 2002). In the same way, the data received in the framework of this CDH exercise show that 4.7% of young Canadians who received their doctoral degree in 1995 were unemployed in 2000. Figure 9 depicts the unemployment rates of doctorate holders by year of doctoral award in Australia.  1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 % Men Women\nFirst OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders.\nFirst OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders.\nOECD calculations based on data from \"The Scientist 2003 Salary Survey\". One striking feature in Table 12 is that doctoral graduates in the United States are better paid in non-research occupations than in research, which is not the case in Canada. In the United States, the business sector also offers higher salary levels to researchers than the government sector, and it is in the higher education sector that researchers have the lowest salary levels. In Canada, the salary levels by sector rank the other way around: researchers are better paid in higher education than they are in the government sector and they are the less well paid in the business sector although the salary differentials between sectors are less marked than in the United States. As may be expected, women are less well paid than men and for research positions the differential is larger in the United States (-27%) than in Canada (-20%). The differences are also more pronounced in business and less marked in higher education. There is an exception to this in postdoctoral positions, where women receive higher salaries than men. One should also note that post-doc salary levels are much lower than other research position salary levels and S. Kergroach and M. Cervantes (2006) also report that \"salaries for early stage researchers are rather low in many countries relative to per capita GDP\". Sector differences in salaries of recent doctoral recipients in Portugal mainly affect women: they earn significantly less when they work in the business enterprise or private non-profit sectors."}, {"section_title": "Labour force status of doctorate holders", "text": "Many studies show that highly educated people have better employment and job prospects than those who were not able to pursue higher education (L. Auriol, 2003). This is indeed the case, as confirmed from the data presented in Table 6. Inactivity rates of university graduates are half of those of the overall population and their unemployment rates also substantially lower. Doctorate holders are also less frequently unemployed than other university graduates. This table also shows that the overall labour market situations may be quite different from one country to another, which also has an impact on the situation of university graduates and doctorate holders. "}, {"section_title": "Centre d'\u00c9tude et de Recherche sur les Qualifications.", "text": "The data in this figure reflect not only the time it takes a doctorate holder to enter the labour market but also the evolving labour market conditions over the ten years under review. It shows that although labour market conditions seem to be more favourable to women in the two years following the doctorate award (unless there was a drastic improvement for women in the years 2000 and 2001), it takes longer (two to five more years than for men) until their unemployment rate stabilizes around 2%. Men's unemployment rate drops to 2% after four years compared to after six to nine years for women. A look at unemployment rates by age category also brings some interesting information. One can see from Figure 10 that while unemployment decreases with age in Australia, it tends on the contrary to increase with age in the United States. This pattern differs somehow from that for the total US labour force and should probably be attributed to the different labour market conditions prevailing for doctorate holders, especially at the beginning of their career.  The unemployment rate for doctorate holders remains nevertheless generally low -between 2% and 4% -as can be seen from Table 7. Among the countries for which we have data, it is higher in Canada and lower in Australia and, with the exception of Canada, higher for women that it is for men. There are also informative differences according to field of doctoral degree ( Figure 11). For example, unemployment rates for engineering and technology doctorate holders are higher than average doctorate holders' unemployment rates and even higher than those of any other discipline in the United States. In Germany, unemployment rates of engineering doctoral graduates reaches 5.3%. More than 20% of German engineering and technology doctoral graduates are also employed in occupations classified below the managerial and professional levels, part of them possibly in occupations labelled \"technicians and associate professionals\" (Annex Table 8). In the United States and Portugal, the unemployment rate of natural science doctorate holders is also higher than the average unemployment rate. This is somewhat at odds with the discourse on a possible shortage of natural science and engineering professionals. In contrast, medical science is the discipline with the lowest unemployment rates. Doctoral graduates in social sciences and humanities are also less exposed to unemployment than their counterparts in natural sciences and engineering in the United States. This is also the case in Australia and Portugal for holders of doctorates in social sciences.  Labour conditions can also be gauged through the type of contract (permanent vs. temporary or parttime vs. full-time) that doctorate recipients hold. Tables 8 and 9 show that, for the countries for which data could be provided, part-time or temporary employment is not negligible, especially for women. Part-time employment reaches 18% in Australia and 28% for women both in Australia and Germany. One should note that part-time employment may to some extent be chosen by women wanting to devote time to their children, but in some cases they may also be compelled by the lack of infrastructure enabling both parents to work. A comparison with general employment figures shows that doctorate holders are, however, less frequently employed on a part-time basis than other employees, especially in the case of women. In Switzerland, 21% of doctorate holders (26% of women) are on temporary contracts. The data for Germany show that the youngest doctorate holders are under such contracts: 33.7% of those aged 25-34 and 14.2% of those aged 35-44. Part of these contracts are most probably for post-doctoral positions. The case of Portugal is particular in that the population covered is restricted to recent doctorate holders having earned their doctoral degree in the last five years and thus probably still in a transitional career period. Included in temporary contracts are also, for this country, all academic staff with five-year working contracts.  1. Doctoral degrees awarded between 2000 and 2004; included is all academic staff with five-year working contracts."}, {"section_title": "Occupations of doctorate holders", "text": "In Argentina, Canada and Germany, 85% of employed doctorate holders work in managing or professional occupations. This figure rises to over 90% in Portugal and the United States (see Table 10). This also means that up to 15% of them in Canada and Germany, 10% in Argentina and 8% in Portugal and the United States are in occupations below their qualifications. At least one-third of employed doctorate holders in Argentina, Canada and the United States and up to 78% of the recent doctorate holders in Portugal are teaching professionals, which is their main professional destination. In Germany, it is in life science and health professions that more than one-third of doctorate holders are employed. It is also important to note that 76% of employed doctorate holders in Canada and 72.5% in the United States are active in research. In the latter country, the breakdown by sex shows that men (74%) work as researchers more frequently than women (70%). Information collected on post-doc occupations in the United States shows that these types of occupations are held by 7.3% of researchers with a doctoral degree in natural science. This percentage reaches 11.3% for women against 6.9% for men. Postdoctoral positions also represent 5.8% of female researchers holding a doctoral degree in medical sciences and 1.3% of male researchers holding a doctoral degree in engineering. In Portugal, up to 90% of recent doctorate holders are active in research, 85% of whom work in the higher education sector. A look at the distribution of post-doctoral positions reveals that women are more likely to hold such positions than men in all doctoral degree fields except humanities (Table 11). This raises the question of possible different recruitment procedures prevailing for male and female researchers. "}, {"section_title": "Salaries of doctorate holders working as researchers", "text": "Canada and the United States provided data on salaries of doctorate holders. Portugal's data cover recent doctoral awardees (Table 12). Although the data given in the table above do not refer to the same year, the salary differences between Canada and the United States cannot merely be attributed to the different years, and salaries of doctorate holders in the United States therefore appear to be much higher than in Canada. The Scientist Salary Survey confirms there are salary differences between these two countries for senior research positions in life sciences, but less so for junior positions (Table 13). "}, {"section_title": "Job-to-job mobility: length of stay with the same employer", "text": "One way to gauge job-to-job mobility is to look at length of stay with the same employer. Data have been provided for Germany and in more detail for Argentina the United States (Table 14). Firstly, doctorate holders in Argentina are not very mobile: 82% have been with the same employer for more than five years. One-quarter of researchers in the government sector, however, have been with their employer for only one to two years. Secondly, doctorate holders are less mobile in Germany than they are in the United States: 62% of them have been with the same employer for at least five years in Germany against 55% in the United States. Thirdly, doctorate holders who are in research occupations in the United States are less mobile than those in non-research occupations: they are 5% more likely to be with the same employer for at least five years. In addition, a higher percentage of those in non-research positions hold their job for less than one year. Among researchers, it is in higher education that mobility is less frequent: 60% of the employed hold their job for at least five years, against 50% in other sectors."}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction of doctorate holders with their employment situation", "text": "Two types of questions are considered here: whether doctorate holders perceive their job as being related to their doctoral degree, and a ranking of their satisfaction according to a number of criteria (see below). The United States was able to provide data for the whole population of doctorate holders while Canada and Portugal gave responses for recent doctorate holders. The vast majority of doctorate holders consider their job as being related to their doctoral degree. However, 7% of the total US population and of the Canadian 2000 graduates and 8% of the Portuguese 2000-2004 graduates are not in a job related to their degree. Part of this population is probably the same as that identified in Table 10 as employed in occupations below their qualifications. The vast majority of doctorate holders also express satisfaction with the employment criteria listed in Table 15. However, they feel more satisfied with those criteria linked to the content of the work (intellectual challenge, level of responsibility, degree of independence and contribution to society) than with those related to employment conditions (salary, benefits, job security, location and opportunities for advancement). Dissatisfaction with salary even reaches 20% of doctorate holders in the United States, 40% in Portugal and 55% in Argentina, and the percentages are even higher for women."}, {"section_title": "Outputs of doctorate holders working as researchers", "text": "Argentina and the United States were able to provide data on outputs of doctorate holders working as researchers. For technical reasons, only the data for the United States are shown in Table 16. These data show that in general men are more productive than women. Lower productivity of women has been shown in other studies (M. Bordons, 2005). One reason put forward for this is the fact that women feel more comfortable with other means of knowledge diffusion, such as teaching activities, for example. The average number of articles published diminishes with age in the United States (the reverse is true in Argentina) while the number of books published is higher in the older age categories. Patenting and commercialisation of products or processes reaches its highest intensity among the middle-aged researchers in the United States, i.e. between 45 and 54 years old. US citizens are more productive in terms of patenting and commercialising products and processes while foreign citizens, especially those who are permanent residents, publish more. Finally, researchers in social sciences and humanities, with the exception of books, produce less tangible outputs than researchers in other fields. In Argentina, the striking feature is that most outputs come in the form of articles and some books, while patenting or commercialisation of products remain marginal. This may be partly due the fact that doctorate holders working in the business enterprise sector are not covered. "}, {"section_title": "National origin of doctorate holders and international mobility", "text": "An important objective of the CDH project is to get better measures of the international mobility of doctorate holders. To this aim, it was decided to collect data according to various national origin and mobility criteria, and to cross-classify some of them: data on doctorate holders were collected by both place of birth and citizenship (as well as by acquisition of citizenship) and cross-classified with data on residential status, length of stay in the country, previous country of residence and other demographic (sex and age) and educational variables (field and place of doctoral or previous degree). This approach gives some interesting results that are shown below and opens new avenues to better refine the measurement of international mobility. In a previous paper, J.-C. Dumont and G. Lema\u00eetre (2005) illustrated the differences in the stock of persons of foreign origin as measured by those foreign-born and those of foreign nationality. The data collected in the framework of the CDH project confirm these differences, i.e. the stock of people foreignborn is larger than that of foreign nationality (Table 17). The reason for this is that the foreign-born reflect the cumulative entries of immigrants into the country across the years, a part of whom has acquired the nationality/citizenship of the recipient country. We see from Table 17 that the foreign contingent is very important in Switzerland both in terms of the foreign-born and the foreign citizens. Switzerland is also known for having the highest share of foreign-born doctoral students among OECD countries. The most striking point revealed by the data, however, is that the share of foreign-born doctorate holders is much higher in Canada and Australia than it is in the United States. In Canada, the foreign-born doctorate holders are even more numerous than the native ones. Table 18 confirms that indeed in the so-called settlement countries -Australia, Canada and to a lesser extent the United States -a large share of citizens have acquired the nationality of the country through naturalisation. The data for Canada and the United States also show that the population born in the country is roughly equal to the number holding citizenship of the country by birth, and that the foreign population is roughly equal to the number of those born abroad, minus the number of people who since acquired the citizenship of the country (the difference being accounted for by nationals born abroad, Box 3 of Chart 1). This is because birth within the territory automatically conveys the citizenship of the country, i.e. jus soli applies in their case: Boxes 2 and 5 of Chart 1 are equal to zero. This is not, however, the case in most other countries. In Germany and in Switzerland, for example, legislation governing the granting of citizenship is much more strict, and children and grandchildren born in the country of immigrant parents may not have acquired the citizenship in their country of birth. The data supplied by Germany and Switzerland in the course of this exercise are unfortunately incomplete, and we were not able to include them. The fact remains, however, that for \"immigration countries\", such as Canada and the United States, the number of doctorate holders born abroad who have acquired citizenship (Box 4 of Chart 1) will provide an indicator of definitive or long-term immigration, while those who were born abroad and hold foreign citizenship (Boxes 6 and 7 of Chart 1), with the exception of those who chose to retain their original citizenship even though they have settled permanently in the country, will give an indication of more recent immigration or of temporary mobility toward the country. Information on residential status (temporary or permanent) can refine the data on the timing (recent or earlier) of arrivals in the country. These data show, for example, that the foreign-born population is much more integrated in Canada, either through naturalisation or the granting of permanent residence, while the temporary resident population is more significant in the United States (Table 19).  A look at the regions of origin of alien doctorate holders in the reporting countries also provides some interesting information. In the United States, as well as in Canada and in Australia, the two main regions of origin are Asia and Europe. If we compare the numbers in terms of place of birth and citizenship (Table 20), we see that, in the United States, doctorate holders born in Asia are more than 2.5 times higher than those with Asian citizenship, which indicates that a very large share of the Asian-born have acquired US citizenship 3 . The ratio is about two for Europe, Africa and South America and the numbers are of a smaller magnitude. With the exception of those from Asian origin, probably due to the large inflow from China, the number of foreign citizens has however grown faster than the number of foreign born over the period 1993 to 2003, indicating a lesser propensity to acquire US citizenship. Data on residential status also show a lesser propensity to become permanent resident (68% of foreign citizens in 2003 against 80% in 1993). The United States nevertheless remains an important magnet for doctorate holders, who probably come more than in the past for reasons linked to temporary labour market opportunities as opposed to educational or long-term settlement possibilities, as we will see later in this paper. Conversely to the situation in the United States, the percentage of European Union-born doctorate holders (41%) in Australia is higher than the Asian-born (27%) ( Table 21). 26.9 27.8 27.2 49.4 41.0 47.0 Oceania 7.0 6.7 6.9 0.9 1.2 1.0 Caribbean countries 0.1 0.2 0.2 1.4 3.1 1.9 Central and South America (except Mexico and the Caribbean) 0.8 1.4 0.9 4.5 11.0 6.3 Non-OECD and non-EU Europe 1 2.9 4.0 3.2 5.9 7.1 6.3 Unknown or not elsewhere classified 2.1 2.7 2.3 Source: First OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders."}, {"section_title": "Chart 1. Distribution of a country's population according to the origin of its inhabitants", "text": "More data on the date and place of doctoral and previous university degrees as well as information on intentions to stay or move out of the country can help better understand international mobility patterns of doctorate holders, in particular those who are foreign citizens."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "There may also be among the Asian-born a small share of US citizens (Box 3 of Chart1) or other non-Asian citizens. Table 22, on where doctoral degrees are awarded, shows different patterns across countries. First, the share of citizens of the three reporting countries having received their doctorate abroad varies greatly. It is very low as expected in the United States (5%), the double (10%) in Portugal 4 and reaches 19% in Argentina (there are almost no foreign doctorate holders in Argentina, so the total shown in the table roughly corresponds to citizens from Argentina). Not surprisingly, higher percentages of foreign citizens have earned their doctoral degrees abroad: 15% in Portugal and up to 43% in the United States. This latter figure may be surprising knowing that many foreigners come to the United States to prepare their doctoral degree, and hence reveals that there are also many foreigners that come to work in the United States having been trained for research abroad. This is confirmed by the reasons given by foreign doctorate holders for coming to the United States. Beyond keeping count of cross-border movements, policymakers are interested in the reasons or motives for these movements. The project on doctorate holders' careers is thus seeking to collect qualitative information on mobility intentions and motivations. These data are for the moment only available for the United States, but they offer some evidence as to how mobility motivation has evolved over time, and how this relates to the residential status of migrants in the country. The data in Table 23 show that over the last five years, educational opportunities in the United States have become less prominent as a reason for moving to the United States than job or economic opportunities, compared to the previous five years. Reasons relating to scientific or professional infrastructures also became more important. These trends are particularly marked among doctorate holders with permanent resident status. For those who have acquired US citizenship, family-related reasons also play an important role, although less so in the last five years compared to the prior five-year period.

Data on intentions to move out of the country are also collected on an optional basis in the CDH project. Data in Table 24 confirm that US citizens are not very internationally mobile: only 5% of recent doctorate holders declare their intentions to move out of the country, but this figure rises to around 15% among Canadian and Portuguese citizens. Forty percent of foreign citizens in both Canada and the United States intend to leave the country in the next year, whereas only 25% intend to do so in Portugal. A look at intended destinations provides more information. Among Portuguese doctorate holders intending to move, 60% plan to go elsewhere in Europe (of which half to the United Kingdom or Spain) and 30% to America (of which 66% to the United States). Three-quarters of the Canadian citizens intending to move plan to go to the United States and 18% to Europe. In the United States, doctorate holders' chosen destinations vary greatly depending on whether they are citizens or not. About half of US citizens will choose Europe as their next destination and 20% will choose Asia. Among foreign doctorate holders in the United States, destination choices probably reflect their origin to some extent: 57% will choose Asia and 16% Europe (Figures 12 and 13).  The Portuguese survey provides additional information about reasons behind these intentions to move, and their analysis reveals that: \"the main reasons are the conclusion of post-doc in a foreign country for the Portuguese recent doctorates (60%) and family or personal reasons for the foreign recent doctorates (57%)\" (OCES, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The first OECD/Eurostat/UIS data collection on careers of doctorate holders helps to better understand what the main demographic, educational, labour market and mobility patterns of doctoral graduates are. Their share in the population and in the labour force varies widely from one country to another: it is two or three times larger in Germany and Switzerland than in Australia, Canada and the United States. In these five countries, women represent only one-quarter to one-third of doctorate holders. The United States has an older population of doctorate holders than the other countries analysed in this paper and the data show that this population is still ageing, as is also the case in Canada. In the United States, age at graduation is higher and completion time for doctorates is also longer. In all countries, it also takes longer to prepare a doctorate in social sciences and humanities than in natural sciences and engineering. Not surprisingly, unemployment rates of doctorate holders remain low, but are relatively higher in natural sciences and engineering. Furthermore, a significant share of the population seems to be overqualified for their current occupations. A non-negligible share works on temporary contracts or part time, especially women. Amongst young researchers, women also seem to be more likely to hold post-doctoral positions than men. In addition, there are important salary differences between men and women and across sectors, especially in the United States. In the United States, as well as in Portugal and Argentina, salary is one of the main reasons why doctoral graduates are dissatisfied with their employment situation. This first data collection also brings some progress in the measurement of international mobility by cross-classifying place of birth and citizenship with residential status and other variables. It shows a high share of foreign doctorate holders in Switzerland and also a higher share of foreign-born doctorate holders in Canada and Australia than in the United States, a younger population of foreign doctorate holders than those of the country, and confirms the importance of Asia and Europe as the two main regions of origin of foreign doctorate holders in Australia, Canada and the United States. Data on place of doctoral degree reveals that there are many foreigners coming to work to the United States having been trained for research abroad, and that this pattern has grown stronger in recent years. Data on intentions to move abroad confirm the low propensity of US citizens to be mobile. Among mobile young Canadian citizens, three-quarters choose the United States as their next destination. Mobile young Portuguese doctorate holders move abroad to join a post-doctoral position. These qualitative indicators on mobility intentions and motivations are extremely useful to help understand the complex patterns of international mobility that cannot only be gauged through quantitative data because of, inter alia, the heterogeneity of migration systems across countries. It is only in the light of data on intentions or reasons for moving abroad that some of the quantitative indicators can be interpreted. All efforts should therefore be conducted to collect and refine such information. The CDH project also brings important added value by introducing the collection of information on doctoral graduates' perceptions of their employment situation. Data on doctorate holders' satisfaction with their salaries, working conditions or other criteria are for instance of great value for the steering of research systems. It is important that a larger number of countries be able to collect such data, more of which should become available in the future."}, {"section_title": "ANNEX TABLES", "text": "DSTI/DOC 2007 2005 2001 1996, 2001 2003, 2004 (1987-2003) 2004 2003, 2004 1993, 2003 Table P2.
