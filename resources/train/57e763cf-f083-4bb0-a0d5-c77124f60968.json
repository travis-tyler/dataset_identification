The overall goals of the project are to (1) reduce local flooding within the City of Oxnard by increasing the capacity of J Street Drain and reducing backwater effects in the lagoon during significant rain storms, and (2) minimize adverse ecological impacts to the lagoon.

Existing site conditions at Ormond Beach differ substantially from historic conditions. The project site historically contained a large wetland complex and coastal lagoons fronted by a beach. One lagoon was located north of J Street and fed by what is now the Hueneme Drain; the second was located south of J Street and fed by what is now the OID. Historical lagoons have been mostly filled and/or their drainages modified. Only a small remnant of the historical lagoon and wetlands at OID remains. 2. The existing lagoon began to develop following construction of J Street Drain, the Hueneme Pump Station in 1961, re-routing of the OID, and bypassing of littoral sediments initiated by the port of Port Hueneme in the early 1960s. J Street Drain and OID originally discharged separately to the ocean; as storm water ponded behind the growing dunes and beach, the two drains became connected in the late 1980s and began to function as a unit with a single outlet to the ocean during breaching events. 3. The geometry of the existing lagoon is naturally dynamic, varying considerably from season to season and year to year. Breaching during the design storms considered herein is dominated by the flows from OID and, more recently, breaches have tended to form near the OID and migrate south in the direction of net longshore sediment transport. 4. If sand bypassing at Port Hueneme were to cease, more rapid erosion at Ormond Beach would occur. Beach erosion and associated landward shoreline migration could create a lower and narrower beach, resulting in more frequent breaching. Similarly, ongoing sea level rise is expected to cause gradual shoreline recession and could conceptually result in more frequent breaching. 5. If J Street and OID were both provided permanent outlets through the beach to the ocean and freshwater not allowed to pond, the aerial extent of the lagoon would likely decrease due to infilling from wind blown sand and resulting in a lagoon more similar to the one that existed in the 1970s. If the ecology of the existing lagoon is to be maintained or improved, permanent outlets through the beach should not be considered. 6. When the lagoon is closed to the ocean, surface water and groundwater inflows cause the lagoon water level to rise, while evaporation and percolation through the beach tend to decrease water levels. Maximum water level in the lagoon prior to a breach is regulated by the lowest beach elevation between the lagoon and ocean. Beach elevation during closed conditions has been observed to be as high as 11.6 ft NGVD (14 ft NAVD) in isolated dunes. Based on available surveys and water level observations from 1975 to 2008, a nominal minimum beach elevation of 7.6 ft NGVD (10 ft NAVD) was applied for breaching analysis."}, {"section_title": "7.", "text": "Lagoon breach formation is characterized as seaward breaching caused by freshwater overtopping the beach. Following a major breach, some limited wave-induced landward breaching may also occur. Breaches may occur multiple times each year. Wave-induced sediment transport is the main process for closing the breach and rebuilding the beach face. The tidal exchange through the breached inlet does not create velocities high enough to counteract the accretion caused by waves. Long-shore transport, aeolian transport, inflow from J Street, Hueneme and OID, and tidal exchange through the breach also contribute to the closure process. The time required for the breach to close is not expected to increase by emergency breaching. 8. Water levels in the lagoon, prior to a breach, range from about 1.6 ft to 6.6 ft NGVD (4 ft to 9 ft NAVD) and have been reported to reach up to 7.6 ft NGVD (10 ft NAVD). Based on numerical modeling for the 100-year storm, peak water levels within the lagoon at J Street are expected to reach about 9.6 ft NGVD (12 ft NAVD) in the absence of emergency breaching. 9. Channel design should consider lagoon water levels of no less than 9.6 ft NGVD (12 ft NAVD). If hydraulic analysis of the improved channel indicates that this water level cannot be accommodated by the design, or if the future unanticipated events change the condition of the beach/lagoon such that the design conditions analyzed herein may be exceeded, then emergency breaching must be considered."}, {"section_title": "10.", "text": "Creating an emergency breach near OID prior to the 100-year storm is unlikely to decrease the peak water level in the lagoon near J Street, but would reduce initial lagoon water levels.

Emergency breaching would become less effective if performed further south of J Street. 12. Any emergency breaching alternative should include continuous monitoring of the lagoon water levels, a system for accurate prediction of storm events, a well defined emergency management plan, and the ability to rapidly mobilize excavation equipment. The emergency breach should be at least 50 ft wide, but would likely form on its own after initial excavation. Locating the breach near OID would maintain the existing lagoon configuration but does not achieve the lowest design water levels for the 100-year event at J Street."}, {"section_title": "Project Review", "text": "Various sources of existing information were gathered and reviewed to develop an understanding of the original project and recent analyses of J Street Drain and the Lagoon performed by others."}, {"section_title": "Physical Description", "text": "J Street drain was originally constructed in 1960 and discharged directly to the Pacific Ocean. As a result of storm water ponding behind the dunes and beach, two shallow lagoons formed at both J Street and OID, eventually becoming hydraulically connected and forming the existing lagoon. The lowest (deepest) areas of the lagoon are now located at the ends of J Street Drain and OID. These low areas are connected by a higher and relatively flat channel that varies in width from 50 to 100 ft. The surface area of the lagoon varies with freshwater inflow, the configuration of ephemeral side channels, and condition of the breach (open or closed). The majority of the wetted lagoon is located near to and south of the OID. The lagoon and adjacent wetlands intermittently connect to the Pacific Ocean following rain events when the lagoon water levels exceed the elevations of Ormond Beach. Bottom elevations in the lagoon are high compared to tide levels, thus limiting tidal range and prism.  "}, {"section_title": "Previous Technical Studies", "text": "Previous hydraulic modeling and analysis of the J Street Drain and/or the lagoon has been conducted by the VCWPD (Su 2007, Tuan 1995, URS (2005), Tetra Tech (2005, and Phillip Williams and Associates (PWA 2007), among others. These studies differ in their assumptions regarding design flow rates and downstream boundary conditions in the lagoon but are otherwise consistent. Prior to 1992, VCWPD routinely breached the lagoon mechanically near the J Street outfall. This practice was halted because of environmental concerns associated with decreasing water level and hydroperiod in the lagoon. Su's (2007) memorandum provides information on frequency of berm breaching and the modeling work of Tetra Tech (2005). Assuming that the berm completely breaches when the storage capacity of the lagoon is reached, Su (2007) indicates that the lagoon would breach during a 2-year storm event. During stronger storms the backwater effect of the lagoon will not substantially increase flooding because the breach occurs early in the storm. However, during the 2-year event, localized flooding may occur prior to breaching. URS 2005developed a plan and preliminary design to reduce flooding in the City of Oxnard by improving flow in J Street Drain. URS concluded that along with drainage system modifications, the backwater effect in the lagoon should be managed to reduce flooding. URS (2005) applied HEC-RAS, a one dimensional flow model, to analyze the existing and proposed hydraulic conditions. Rather than modeling the breaching process, URS assumed that the water level in the lagoon was either at the elevation of the beach or at normal depth based on channel slope, depending on the return period of the storm considered. Tetra Tech (2005) applied FLO-2D, two dimensional flood analysis model, to define flooding in the City of Oxnard associated with a 100-year storm event; this modeling followed work by Pacific Advanced Civil Engineering. Tetra Tech also modeled the 2-year and 100-year storms to estimate when the lagoon breach occurs, assuming initial water levels in the lagoon of 4.0 ft and 6.5 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL) (6.7 ft and 9.2 ft NAVD). The analysis of flow in the lagoon was more detailed than that performed by URS (2005), but did not include an analysis of breaching processes that might elucidate potential project impacts for the improved channel. Tetra Tech suggested that lack of capacity in the existing drainage channels contributes more to local flooding than the condition of the beach elevation or lagoon water level. Tuan's (1995) memorandum describes a VCRAT (Ventura County Rational Method) study to analyze the lagoon water level, backwater flooding effects, and rainfall intensity associated with flooding near the lagoon. The report indicates that the elevation of the beach varies from 5.5 ft to 8.5 ft MSL and that in September 1994 water levels in the lagoon reached approximately 7.5 ft MSL before breaching occurred. The analysis indicated that flooding begins when water levels in the lagoon reach 5.5 ft MSL and when rainfall intensity exceeds 1 inch/hour. The California State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) is developing a comprehensive environmental restoration plan at Ormond Beach, including the lagoon and adjacent wetlands. To evaluate project feasibility, Philip Williams and Associates, Ltd (PWA 2007) prepared a hydrologic and geomorphic conditions report. The report summarizes key processes affecting Ormond Beach, the lagoon, and surrounding wetlands based primarily on existing data sources, surveys of the upper beach, and studies by others. The report also describes concepts for maintaining a tidal inlet at the lagoon by modifying elevations of adjacent lands and installing jetties or similar structures. Previous studies have characterized stormwater flows into Ormond Lagoon and generally describe processes affecting lagoon breaching. Detailed analyses of coastal processes, lagoon hydrodynamics, hydroperiod, lagoon breaching dynamics, and lagoon closure have not been previously performed for assessment of potential project-related impacts or for design purposes."}, {"section_title": "Physical Processes", "text": "Modifications to J Street Drain and outlet configuration could potentially alter breaching frequency and duration, tidal prism, lagoon hydroperiod, and other characteristics of the lagoon. Therefore, HDR investigated the history of the lagoon, behavior of similar systems, and key physical processes affecting the coupled behavior of the drains, lagoon, beach, and the nearshore Pacific Ocean. The following sections provide a summary of key physical processes affecting the lagoon. More detailed information on physical processes can be found in Appendix A and within the references listed in Section 8."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Processes Summary", "text": "\u2022 Tides in the project area are semi-diurnal with a 5.4 ft range between MHHW and MLLW. For reference, the elevation of MHHW is approximately 5.3 ft NAVD. Tides exceed MHHW approximately 5% of the time. \u2022 Tidal Prism varies considerably with changing topography of the lagoon and connected channels. PWA (2007) estimated the tidal prism to be between 15 and 17 acre-ft. Based on the models presented in Appendix B, the tidal prism ranges from approximately 9 to 24 acre-ft, depending on the tide and geography of the lagoon. \u2022 Winds are predominantly from the west and are characterized in detail in Appendix A. Wind plays three primary roles in coastal processes by driving nearshore waves, surface currents, and aeolian transport (wind blown sand). \u2022 Average rainfall in the area is only about 0.04 inch/day with higher rates from October through April. \u2022 Waves nearshore are predominantly from the southwest. Significant wave height ranges from 1.5 to 5.0 ft 85% of the time. Wave period is between 12 and 18 seconds 75% of the time. Waves drive longshore and cross shore sediment transport at Ormond Beach. Wave-driven sediment transport coupled with tides, wind and lack of strong discharge from the drainage system causes closure of the breach. \u2022 Net longshore transport is to the south at about 1,000,000 CY per year. Disruption of ongoing artificial bypassing at Port Hueneme would result in significant erosion at Ormond Beach and thus potentially alter the nature of the lagoon. \u2022 Cross-shore transport is the dominant process responsible for breach closure and has not been previously studied. \u2022 Due to the arid climate, aeolian transport along Ormond Beach is significant and capable of partially filling and dividing the lagoon in the absence of significant freshwater discharge. \u2022 Measured long-term mean sea level rise at nearby tidal stations is less than 1 ft per century. IPCC (2007) predicts eustatic sea level rise of 1.1 ft over the next 100 years. Sea level rise likely will not significantly affect the elevation of the beach adjacent the lagoon over the next 100 years. Rise of MHHW by 1.3 ft should be considered to determine the lower limit for lagoon water level during a storm. \u2022 Combined sediment load from J Street and OID is approximately 320 CY per year (HDR 2008B) with about 95% of the sediment contributed by OID. \u2022 Hydroperiod of the lagoon has not previously been studied and/or documented in detail."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Lagoon Inlets and Breaching Review", "text": "A review of available literature was conducted to provide background on work completed at other sites and methods applied to analyze lagoon breaching dynamics. The reader is referenced to the following sources for more information. Most of the literature relevant to coastal breaching focuses on landward breaching occurring during extreme marine events from elevated storm surge levels so that water is flowing from the ocean rather than to the ocean. Coastal breaching models have been developed by Basco and Shin (1999), Kraus (2003), Tuan, Verhagen, and Visser (2006), Tuan (2007), Mohamed (2001), Faeh (2007), Srinivas and Dean (1996), Odd, Roberts, and Visser (1998), Maddocks (2000), and others. Examples of applicable general sediment transport work include Madsen and Wood (2002), Myrhaug and Holmedal (2003), Freds\u00f8e and Deigaard (1992), Davies et al (2002), Baldock et al (2005), Ogston and Sternberg (2002), Smith (2002), Soulsby andDamgaard (2005), andYu, Sternberg, andBeach (1993). Case studies evaluating lagoon/estuary breaching on the California coast and around the world are documented by Kraus (2002), Hansen et al (2007), PWA (1993A, 1993B), and Battalio et al (2006), among others. Stone Lagoon (along the coast of northern California) is similar to Ormond Beach Lagoon in that it breaches seaward (Kraus 2002). Kraus (2008) presents detailed discussion of breaching at multiple northern California lagoons/estuaries."}, {"section_title": "Breaching at Ormond Lagoon", "text": "Breaching at the Ormond Lagoon is caused by buildup of freshwater originating from J Street, Hueneme and Industrial Drains and can be characterized as seaward breaching. Tuan (2007), following Gordon (1990), describes the breaching process of coastal lagoon barriers due to overflow induced by heavy rain as follows: \"The lagoon breakout stage is observed to consist of three distinct stages. In the first stage, a preferred scour channel (initial channel) is formed and cuts backwards across the barrier. The flow is subcritical in the breach section and supercritical on the down slope. The second stage commences when a crescentshaped weir forms in the main sand plug followed by a series of steps in the channel. The breach width increases rapidly as the breach flow is highly turbulent and supercritical. Once the main sand plug has been washed out completely, the final stage begins with a slower rate of breach deepening and widening.\" After the breach is established and upland discharge has significantly decreased, tidal exchange between the lagoon and ocean acts to maintain the breach. Waves transport sediment onshore and alongshore and the varying tide and wave run-up distribute the sediment along the shoreface. Sediment transport in the swash zone, similar to transport under a small bore, effectively carries sediment into the breach. As tidal flow in the inlet becomes insufficient to remove all of the sand being transported by the waves, the breach will begin to close. Based on field observation of Ormond Lagoon by HDR, the breaching process appears to be consistent with that described by Tuan (2007) and Gordon (1990). For reference, Figure 4.1 shows the location of previous historic breaches along Ormond Beach, based on historic surveys and aerial photographs. Breaches tend to occur along the lagoon south of J Street and, more recently, near the outlet of the OID. The figure shows that the breach has occured at many different locations. Recent breaches have been located closer to OID than to J-Street. Except at the existing breach area, which is the southeastern most area circled in Figure 4.1, the water level along the beach must exceed about 10 ft NAVD before landward breaching is likely to occur. There is no record of the tide level exceeding this elevation since the Santa Barbara gauge was installed in 1933. For reference, the highest tide recorded at the Santa Barbara gauge is 7.3 ft NAVD. Wave run-up in combination with extreme high tides could overtop the beach and dunes when the beach is low, for example following a seaward breaching event. However, the volume of water contributed to the lagoon in this case would be relatively small compared to the storage area of the lagoon. In any case, landward breaching is controlled by the ocean tide and wave conditions, which cannot be affected by the J Street Drain modifications."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Interpretation", "text": "The primary objective of the data collection and interpretation was to fill critical data gaps and compare new data with existing data for more detailed assessment of lagoon dynamics and project alternatives.

Therefore, a bathymetric survey was performed along the beach face, nearshore, and within the wetted lagoon to supplement existing survey data. Surface sediment grab samples were collected along the beach face from the surf zone to the dunes and within the lagoon and breach. Grain size distributions were then determined by laboratory testing. Concurrently, suspended sediment samples were collected and later tested. An electronic gauge was also installed within the lagoon to continuously monitor water levels and salinity near the main body of the lagoon for 30 days. The data collection timing and duration was selected to meet the needs of the project schedule.

Transects extended from the dry beach out to a depth of approximately 40 ft. The purpose of the beach profile survey was to provide detailed cross-shore profile data along the beach fronting the lagoon. Changes in two-dimensional beach profiles provide a means for estimating the closure depth and net cross-shore sediment transport patterns. Closure depth is an important parameter in sediment transport modeling, and is the depth beyond which sediment transport is less active. Locations of the cross-shore beach profile transects are depicted in Figure 5.1. Three of the transects were located on transects previously established by the Beach Erosion Authority for the Clean Oceans and Nourishment (BEACON) monitoring program, while ten new transects, Transects OL01 through OL10, were established specifically for the present project. Alignments of the new transects were chosen based on transect BCN23. Transect OL01 was aligned with J Street, approximately 575 ft east of transect BCN23, while transects OL02 through OL10 were taken at 500-ft intervals. The transect establishment activities, data collection procedure, and reduction processes are described by Coastal Frontiers (2008).

Because there were no readily available means of measuring the longshore current, the survey rodman floated along shore near Transect OL09 for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. The position of the rodman was measured and the mean velocity calculated (Table 5.2). Although somewhat crude, this measurement technique provided a rough approximation of typical longshore current velocity at the site. Measurements of longshore current are otherwise unavailable for Ormond Beach. "}, {"section_title": "Sediment Samples", "text": "Sediment size is a controlling factor of beach morphology.

The expected maximum water level in the lagoon is regulated by the lowest beach crest elevation. Aerial surveys provided maximum coverage of the beach allowing reasonably accurate estimation of the minimum and maximum beach elevations adjacent the lagoon. The beach transects surveyed by BEACON do not provide coverage at the breach and instead provided estimates of the maximum dune crest elevation near the lagoon. The 1975 survey shows that J Street and OID had separate discharge locations, similar to the configurations in the photographs presented in Appendix A. The survey data suggest that the beach reaches its maximum elevation of approximately 14 ft NAVD in the vegetated dunes. Elevation across a beach is not uniform in space or constant in time. To support numerical modeling, described later in this report, it is important to define the beach in an idealized uniform manner. A nominal beach elevation is determined through analysis of available survey data to represent the existing beach elevation. The nominal elevation of the beach for the purposes of this discussion is defined as the elevation at which the beach is likely to be overtopped. The nominal elevation is significantly lower than the maximum beach elevation. Tetra Tech 2005assumed representative beach elevations of 10 to 11 ft MSL (12.7 to 13.7 ft NAVD) based on a single available survey. Review of the additional survey data listed in Table  5.3 indicates that elevations range from 4 to 14 ft NAVD, depending on storm activity, that 4 ft is representative for a breached condition, and 14 ft is representative for a beach that has not breached in well over one year. The aerial surveys show the representative nominal beach/dune crest elevation adjacent the lagoon to be approximately 10 ft NAVD. Based on the aerial surveys and other available data and under typical conditions, a representative elevation for the beach prior to breaching is approximately 10 ft NAVD.

The sensor was configured to record conductivity, temperature, and pressure every six minutes based on an average of 60 samples taken at 2 Hz. Salinity measurements of the ocean and inside the lagoon were collected to attempt to measure the salinity transport during a breaching event; however, the lagoon remained closed through the monitoring period. Measurements were taken at a single point at mid-depth to obtain a time series history for model input. During the data collection period, the lagoon remained closed and water levels were not tidally influenced; however, some exchange of salinity between the ocean and lagoon did occur. The measured salinity in the lagoon, water level in the lagoon, and tidal elevation are shown in Figure  5.6. Salinity in the lagoon responded to fluctuating water levels in the ocean, with high tides resulting in an increase of salinity at the gage location. Even though the lagoon was not open to tidal exchange, waves in combination with high tides appear to have overtopped the recently closed breach, resulting in slightly higher water levels and salinity spikes measured at the gage. The overall trend of decreasing salinity combined with rising water level is attributed to industrial and agricultural runoff, and not precipitation. Significant rainfall was not recorded during the monitoring period.

However, the data qualitatively indicate that the lagoon water levels generally rise and remain elevated above tidal levels during the summer months from May to September, and then rapidly decrease by 2 to 3 ft following breaches in early fall through the spring. The gage data also demonstrate that breaches form and close multiple times each year, from the early fall through the spring. Duration of lagoon closure may range from one week to five months or more.

Two breaches occurred during the monitoring period, first on December 17, 2007 and again on January 4, 2008. The December breach appears to have occurred with an initial lagoon water level near 8.3 ft NAVD. Freshwater inflow caused the water level to rise to around 9.2 ft NAVD before the lagoon breached and water level dropped. From the plots, it appears that the lagoon emptied and equilibrated with the tide in less than 6 hours, consistent with observations at the J Street gauge discussed above. Following the breach, water levels at OID remained tidally dominated, with no appreciable phase lag. However, the low tide level is clipped. This may have resulted from either drying of the water level gage or more likely impoundment of water within the lagoon above the tidal level due to the bathymetry of the lagoon or tidal channel.

More active management of lagoon water levels may be required, in an emergency, to reduce impacts to the adjacent beach and lagoon dynamics. The following three outlet alternatives were therefore evaluated: Evaluation of a permanent installation, such as a jettied inlet or weir structure, was not considered because of the desire to avoid significant alteration of lagoon dynamics such as hydroperiod and geomorphology and the excessive cost of maintaining an inlet. This section describes numerical modeling and analysis that were undertaken to evaluate the feasibility, potential benefits, and impacts of these three alternatives."}, {"section_title": "Description of Outlet Alternatives", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "No Action Alternative", "text": "This alternative represents the unmanaged outlet condition, where the lagoon is allowed to breach and close as it has since mechanical breaching ceased in 1992. This alternative would result in no direct impacts to lagoon dynamics since breaching and closure of the lagoon would not be directly changed. Lagoon hydroperiod, which varies with beach elevation and water level, would be unaffected. Due to the dynamic nature of the lagoon, the geometry and depth of the lagoon will continue to change.

The elevation of the maintained section would need to be above extreme high tide, approximately 7 ft NAVD. Maintenance is a common practice on recreational beaches and can be performed with standard construction equipment such as a bulldozer or front-end loader. Effective maintenance requires constant action to remove wind blown sand that would accumulate within the maintained area. Maintaining a breach corridor would increase the frequency of breaching and likely result in lower water levels in the lagoon even when the breach is closed, decreasing the existing lagoon hydroperiod. This alternative would result in impacts to the lagoon."}, {"section_title": "Emergency Mechanical Breaching Alternative", "text": "Creating a mechanical breach, as was performed prior to 1992, would decrease the lagoon water level to the minimum possible elevation prior to significant rainfall events and provide more rapid discharge of stormwater from the lagoon to the ocean.

Thus, this alternative would decrease the lagoon water levels sooner (likely on the order of 24 hours) than natural breaching. Effective execution of this alternative requires continuous monitoring of the lagoon water levels, advanced prediction of significant stormwater events, a well defined emergency management plan, and the ability to rapidly mobilize equipment."}, {"section_title": "Numerical Modeling", "text": "Incorporating the site data described in previous sections, MIKE 21 numerical models were applied to simulate hydrodynamics and lagoon morphology during breaching events for the existing condition and for hypothetical lagoon conditions based on available survey and water level data.

Then the hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sediment transport model capable of simulating sediment transport and bed morphology.

Additional details on the numerical models are documented in Appendix B. The breaching model was run for the scenarios outlined in Table 6.1. Table 6.2 summarizes the maximum water level near J Street and OID, as well as the time from model start (start of the hydrographs) to the time the breach begins to take place for each scenario. Calibration and verification information is presented in Appendix B. Based on comparison with available water level data, actual breaching occurs more rapidly than simulated by the model.

Because of the dynamic nature of the lagoon, the lagoon configuration at the time of the March 2008 survey is not considered representative of typical conditions. The idealized domain was created by altering the March 2008 data to match conditions observed in the historic data, creating a relatively uniform beach (berm) with a low elevation of about 10 ft NAVD. Idealized representative conditions were simulated in Runs 1 through 3 for both the 2-year and 100-year events. Initial water levels in the lagoon ranged from 6 ft to 9 ft NAVD for the 2-year event. The maximum water level within the lagoon is a function of beach elevation and inflow. Supercritical flow during initial breach formation in the model is handled through introduction of numerical dissipation; therefore, the rate of erosion at incipient breaching was limited to improve model stability. Consistent with previous analysis by others, the simulations indicate that the breach would occur significantly earlier in the 100-year event than during the 2-year event and that the maximum water level is about the same for both events for the idealized representative case. Greater flow during the 100-year event causes earlier breaching than the 2-year event and leads to significantly greater sediment transport, providing greater forcing to reshape the lagoon/beach system. Figure 6.1 shows the bed level at peak flow during the 100-year event. Because the modeled beach was relatively uniform, overwash and seaward deposition occurred over a broad area near OID. The simulated flows ultimately eroded a single dominant channel. The same results were observed in the 2-year storm simulations, but on a smaller scale. As a sensitivity test to assess the role of aeolian transport, the model was run with variable elevation along the lagoon channel between OID and J Street to represent wind-blown sand deposits. The model showed that the high sections tend to erode and the low sections tend to fill, maintaining the lagoon in its current configuration. This exercise helps show how variable infilling from aeolian transport would typically be offset by flow during storms. \nAllowing the lagoon system to continue to breach in an unmanaged manner would result in no significant change to lagoon dynamics or hydroperiod. However, the No-Action alternative does not guarantee that the future lagoon configuration (geometry, water depth, hydroperiod, etc.) would be the same as the existing configuration.

A maintained breach corridor was modeled in Runs 5 through 7. The initial water level was set about 1 ft below the beach elevation to allow sufficient difference between the wet and dry areas within the model at model start. Comparison between the existing conditions and a maintained breach corridor indicated that maintaining the corridor near OID would decrease the maximum water level in the lagoon during a 2-year storm by about 3 ft (see Run 6). The model results suggest that reducing the width of the breach corridor to less than 100 feet would significantly reduce the benefits of maintenance. Different locations for the breach corridor were also tested with the numerical model. The analysis indicates that the water level is about 1.3 ft lower at J Street when the breach is near J Street as opposed to the breach being located near OID. Historic data and model results indicate that the beach could overtop near OID for less frequent events, even if the beach is lowered adjacent J Street. Maintaining a breach corridor at J Street may lead to loss of connection between J Street and OID and is therefore not recommended."}, {"section_title": "Emergency Mechanical Breaching", "text": "Creating a lagoon breach just prior to a storm would provide the lowest water surface elevations in the lagoon at J Street. Creating the emergency breach near OID would most likely maintain the lagoon in its current configuration. However, an emergency breach would temporarily impact hydroperiod. The initial water level was set to the tidal boundary based on the assumption that the breach had allowed the entire lagoon to drain to the tidal elevation, as described in Appendix B. This assumption states that the lagoon drains to tidal elevation just as it would after discharge from a storm has ceased. There could be areas within the lagoon at higher elevations based on actual bathymetry of the lagoon at time of breach. At peak discharge with a breach simulated near OID, modeled lagoon water levels at J Street reached about 7.9 ft NAVD for the 2-year storm. With the inlet near J Street the peak water levels at J Street reached 7.2 ft NAVD for the 2 year storm. During the 100-year storm for the idealized representative beach the inlet forms early in the hydrograph, well before peak flow, essentially creating the same case as modeled for the emergency breach with the inlet near OID. At peak discharge with a breach simulated near OID, modeled lagoon water levels at J Street reached about 11.8 ft NAVD for the 100-year storm. With the inlet near J Street the peak water levels at J Street reached 8.5 ft NAVD for the 100year storm. Further investigation into inlet location was carried out to determine the impact of closure of the channel between J-Street and OID. At peak discharge for this case, modeled lagoon water levels at J Street reached about 7.2 ft NAVD for the 100-year storm.\nEmergency mechanical breaching allows management of lagoon water levels when needed, reduces impacts to lagoon hydroperiod, and appears to be the most feasible outlet alternative.

There are several processes (long-shore transport, cross-shore transport, wind-blown transport, tidal exchange, runoff, etc.) that likely contribute to breach closure. Breach closure is dynamic occurring over a duration controlled by the ambient forcing. It is hypothesized that cross-shore transport is the predominant mechanism and have employed SBEACH as a tool to test that hypothesis. The SBEACH model only considers closure due to waves. Tide was included so that the waves acted on a variable water level. Considering the small tidal prism, waves are a more dominant forcing than tidal currents. Therefore, tidal currents in the breach were excluded, although they may act to change the length of time the breach is open. The model helped with examination of the long term wave-induced sediment transport into the breached section of the beach."}, {"section_title": "Closure Model Results", "text": "The closure model presents qualitative insight into the process of breach closure. The model shows that waves can cause closure of the breach within a relatively short period of time (within 2 to 4 weeks). Observations also indicate that this time scale is accurate. The dynamic nature of cross shore transport, coupled with variability in waves and tides, makes prediction of actual closure time complex. The model also assumes that there is no additional discharge from the drain or tidal currents. Both of which could act to increase time the breach remains open. These model results serve to indicate that wave forced cross-shore transport would fill the breach within the timescale witnessed. More exact time for the breach to close and whether or not the breach would stay closed is dependent on the wave conditions at the time as well as other physical processes not included in the model.

Lagoon morphology is forced by upstream inflow, waves, tides, aeolian transport, and anthropogenic factors. A lagoon appears to have been historically present as part of the natural drainage system of the now channelized OID. That lagoon did not extend to the limits of the current lagoon between J Street and OID. Both two-inlet and single-inlet lagoon configurations are apparent from the available information. Lack of recent mechanical breaching has contributed to tendency of the lagoon to breach at one location. The breach tends to form near OID where the largest volume of flow originates. Flow rates peak in the lagoon during breaching, when greater velocities last until the water surface in the lagoon has equilibrated with the ocean tide. After the water surface in the lagoon is at the same level as the ocean, flow is controlled by the tides and ambient flow from the drains. Areas of rapid sediment transport are primarily confined to the breach and narrow sections (channels) in the lagoon."}, {"section_title": "Water Level in the Lagoon", "text": "Water levels in the lagoon during rain storms is a function of the initial water level, beach conditions (elevation, width), and inflow.

Extreme high tide levels in the ocean frequently exceed 7 ft NAVD but rarely exceed 8 ft NAVD. Analyses of existing conditions, including results of numerical models and analysis of available data, show that the water level in the lagoon generally exceeds 9 ft NAVD prior to breaching. Lowering the maximum elevation of the beach by creating a breach corridor would decrease the pre-storm water level in the lagoon. In comparison, creating an emergency mechanical breach before a storm provides an even lower pre-storm water level. As the intensity of the storm increases, the upstream flood-reduction benefits of decreasing the pre-storm water level in the lagoon decrease because flow during the onset of the storm acts to create a breach well before peak flow."}, {"section_title": "Potential Impacts of Proposed Alternatives", "text": "This list of considerations is not intended to be an exhaustive list but rather a brief discussion of some conceptual impacts.

Longshore Transport", "text": "Longshore transport is the movement of sand along a coastline, forced by waves and currents. Greater wave height and/or angle of approach generally cause greater longshore sediment transport. Sediment is carried from sources updrift of Ormond Beach and from Ormond Beach to downdrift areas. Between Santa Barbara and Point Mugu, the net direction of sediment transport along the coast is to the south. Gradients in the rate of longshore transport, such as offshore losses to coastal canyons or deep draft navigation channels, are primarily responsible for beach erosion and accretion trends. Ormond Beach is located immediately southeast of Port Hueneme, a jettied inlet that interrupts longshore transport. Sand supply for beaches in Ventura County has historically been from Ventura and Santa Clara Rivers. Longshore transport can be significantly interrupted by tidal inlets, especially during the initial phases of inlet development. Approximately 1,100,000 cubic yards (CY) of sand per year are mechanically bypassed south around Port Hueneme (Coastal Sand Management Plan 1989). Campbell and Benedet (2004) report that from 1959 to 1987 about 910,000 CY were bypassed annually around the Port in the direction of net transport. Weigel (1994) has also confirmed a similar magnitude of bypassing and further describes longshore transport in the area. Without a continuous supply of bypassed sand to Ormond Beach from the north, ongoing transport to the south would lead to more rapid erosion at Ormond Beach and impact the lagoon system. Ormond Beach would switch from being a stable beach (not significantly accreting or eroding) to one with significant erosion. This erosion would likely narrow the beach and expose the lagoon to more frequent inundation from the Pacific Ocean. Lagoon morphology would be altered as the beach retreated and the lagoon became more frequently exposed to wave action and tidal influence. During a site visit to Ormond Beach on February 12, 2008, HDR observed waves breaking on a small ebb shoal that had developed seaward of the channel following a breaching event. The small shoal was reworked into the beach system, as was observed on March 20, 2008. When a tidal inlet first opens, ebb and/or flood shoal typically forms. Sediment from these shoals comes from the adjacent beach and from the adjacent coastlines as fed by longshore transport. It appears that while the breach at Ormond Lagoon is open, some small component of the longshore transport is trapped in both the ebb shoal and lagoon. The small ephemeral ebb shoal created by episodic breaching has no significant effect on downdrift beaches. However, a permanent inlet (for flood control or restoration) at Ormond Beach would affect longshore transport by temporarily trapping sand in the ebb shoal and lagoon until natural bypassing commences, or by impounding sand against a hard structure such as a rock jetty. Experience at Port Hueneme indicates that a significant effort would be required to maintain a permanent tidal inlet at Ormond Beach. Therefore, alternatives for improving J Street Drain that include a more permanent connection between the lagoon and the ocean are not advised."}, {"section_title": "A7. Cross-shore Transport", "text": "Cross shore transport refers to sand moving across the wet beach perpendicular to the shoreline (onshore and offshore). On an engineering time scale, cross shore transport is limited to a conceptual depth of closure beyond which waves do not cause significant sediment transport (Dean, Kriebel, and Walton 2002). Depth of closure is a function of the sand gain size, shape of the beach profile, and waves. According to methods by Dean, Kriebel, and Walton (2002), depth of closure can be estimated based on an annual 12-hour exceedance significant non-breaking wave height. Based on a wave record of 2 years, this definition results in a conceptual depth of closure at Ormond Beach of approximately 25 feet. Observations of profile data further support this estimate of depth of closure. Cross-shore transport plays an important role in moving sand across the shore face, eventually closing the lagoon breach and rebuilding the beach. There are no readily available data or studies documenting cross shore transport at Ormond Beach. However, historic beach profiles at locations immediately north and south of the project site are available as part of monitoring by the BEACON.

In the absence of freshwater discharge, wind-blown sand fills shallow areas of the lagoon and narrow tidal channels during dry summer months.

Aeolian transport is known to have significantly contributed to closing of small inlets at other locations such as Mustang Island Fish Pass in Texas (Kraus and Heilman 1997). Visual observations made during the February 12, 2008 site visit indicated that the back beach may be quickly reformed by aeolian transport after breach closure.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (2008) reports that historic measured relative sea level rise at the Santa Barbara tide gauge is approximately 0.91 feet per century and approximately 0.52 feet per century at Santa Monica. Relative sea level rise is the combined relative change in water level including effects of subsidence or uplift. Ground water withdrawal and oil and gas production have been named as the primary source of subsidence within the Oxnard Plain (Hanson 1992). Hanson (1992) also indicates that tectonic activity is a minor contributor to subsidence and uplift within the Oxnard Plain. Available data indicates that MHHW is rising 19% faster than MSL for a mean anticipated rise of 1.3 ft over then next century (Coastal Conservancy Undated-B). Sea level anomalies occur when the 5 month average of the interannual variation of mean sea level is greater than 0.3 ft (NOAA 2008). The greatest anomalies on the California coastline are attributed to the El Ni\u00f1o and the 2000-2001La Ni\u00f1a events (NOAA 2008. The anomaly during the El Ni\u00f1o event raised the sea level for an extended period by as much as 1.2 ft (Ryan et al 1999). El Ni\u00f1o has occurred 5 times in the observed data record and its influence is accounted for in the representative beach developed to assess flooding in the lagoon. Historically, eustatic sea level is rising and the trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Irrespective of improvements at J Street and Ormond Beach, sea level rise will result in long-term retreat of shorelines in the absence of additional sediment sources. One method to calculate shoreline retreat due to sea level rise was proposed by Bruun (1962). Bruun (1962) suggests that volume within the active beach will be conserved over a long period and provides an equation to calculate shoreline retreat given an equilibrium beach profile. Based on Bruun (1962) the shoreline at Ormond Beach will retreat between 40 ft to 50 ft for every 1 ft of sea level rise. Naturally, shorelines retreat due to rising relative sea level but the beach profile will generally remain unchanged relative to MSL and shoreline position. If the supply of sediment is unchanged and the beach is not limited on its landward side, then the entire beach system will simply fall back. In this case, the elevation of the dune will be relative to sea level, meaning that if sea level rises by 1 ft then the dune crest will rise by 1 ft as will every other part of the active beach profile. If however, the sediment supply is reduced or development has been allowed to take place behind the beach, the character of the future beach becomes much more uncertain. Development north of Port Hueneme and the considerable amount of material that is bypassed every year make it likely that sediment supply will be reduced if sea level rises considerably. A reduction in sediment being bypassed at Port Hueneme will lead to shoreline erosion at Ormond Beach. If the beach begins to erode due to lack of available sediment supply, it is likely that the lagoon will be filled with sand as the beach tries to migrate landward, requiring more rainfall to maintain the current lagoon configuration. If climate change results in lower precipitation then it is likely that the lagoon will fill to a state similar to that seen in photos taken in the 1970's. Considering, that short term (such as El Ni\u00f1o events) sea level rise of 1 ft is already present in the data used to develop the representative beach for analysis purposes, the nominal elevation of the beach adjacent the lagoon will not appreciably accrete over the next 100 years if sea level rises by only 1 ft. It is more likely that shoreline erosion will become a problem over the next 100 years as coastal development continues and beaches attempt to retreat landward. Significant shoreline erosion will likely change the character of the lagoon and increase frequency of breaching but will not likely raise the elevation of the beach. Sea level rise likely will not significantly affect the elevation of the beach adjacent the lagoon over the next 100 years. Rise of MHHW by 1.3 ft should be considered as the lower limit for lagoon water level during a storm."}, {"section_title": "A10. Aerial Photography", "text": "Historic aerial photography was obtained for the vicinity of the lagoon and photos from 1945, 1950, 1972, 1979, 1989, 1994, 2004, 2006 and 2007 were qualitatively reviewed. A shoreline survey from 1855 and navigation chart from 1945 were also reviewed. Historical conditions indicate that the lagoon was created in its current form by drainage system construction. Continued evolution and growth of the lagoon is expected to be similar to the recent past.  Historically, a natural drainage, wetland, and lagoon existed at the current location of the OID. Portions of this lagoon and wetland features are still evident at the south end existing lagoon. The central lagoon has been filled and no longer exists. Historical drainage is now captured by the Hueneme and J Street Drains. The central and south lagoons likely breached to the Pacific Ocean following large rainfall events but did not remain permanently connected. However, the lagoons may have been open to tidal influence longer than under existing conditions because of the larger tidal prism of the lagoons and adjacent wetlands. The large lagoons shown in Figure  A.9 are similar to one of the alternatives being considered by the California State Coastal Conservancy to restore wetland habitat in the area.    Figure A.11 shows the early formation of the lagoon at the outfall of J Street Drain in 1972, ten years after construction in 1962. Available information suggests that during this time the breach was periodically maintained to promote flow from J Street directly to the ocean and mechanically excavated breach is evident in the photograph. The figure also shows that water frequently drained behind the dunes and within dune swales, forming what were likely ephemeral wetlands and channels. Sediment from the dunes was likely transported from the lagoon to the ocean following storm events. Comparison between the 1972 photos and the 1945 photo indicate that discharge from the J Street Drain created the northern portions of the lagoon because direct flow from the drain to the ocean wasn't maintained at all times. Lateral spreading of the impounded water, both north and south, occurred until the J Street drainage flows scoured a path south to the Oxnard Drain, connecting the two systems.  . Channelization of what is now OID likely increased the capacity of the lagoon to convey floodwater directly to the Pacific Ocean and prevented flooding of inland areas. These changes also likely increased the frequency and intensity of breaching by conveying more flow directly to the lagoon and beach rather than allowing for local storage in uplands and adjacent wetlands. The result was the formation of a well defined lagoon channel.       This low resolution 1994 aerial photograph in Figure A.16 shows a significantly larger connection/lagoon between J Street and OID. This can be attributed to the lack of mechanical breaching at both J Street and OID. The lagoon appears most similar to the current configuration. Flow from J Street and OID converge at the lagoon in this photograph. The lagoon exists on the beach bounded on its landward side by development and infrastructure.  The historical aerial photographs support the assumption that the existing lagoon developed as a result of flow from J Street and Industrial Drains ponding on the back side of the beach until a breach occurred. Flow during the breaching events is strong enough across the entire lagoon area to transport sand from the dunes to the ocean. That frequent process, along with groundwater seepage, appears to have caused the gradual formation of a semi-permanent lagoon and wetlands evident today. Without strong flow within the lagoon during breaching, much of the lagoon area would likely never have developed. It's probable that if both drains were provided permanent, constricted flow pathways through the beach, the lagoon would rapidly decrease in size, ultimately resulting in short channels across the beach instead of a lagoon. turbulence is not included in the sediment transport solution, leading to reduced transport during initial breaching."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Wetting and drying", "text": "o The model requires that the water level in adjacent cells reach a preset level prior to breaching.

The hydrodynamic model, coupled with waves and sediment transport, calculates wave setup and longshore current. Observations of longshore current ranged from 0.50 m/s to 0.65 m/s. Simulated longshore current during the observation period is shown in Figures B.8 and B.9.

The samples were collected across the surf zone rather than in the breach during a storm event. Verification based on sediment suspended across the surf zone was conducted. Data collected during a breach would be the best possible source for verification, but that data was not available. The sediment transport model calculates total load which includes suspended and bed load (DHI 2008C) while the measurements only capture suspended load. Bed load must be calculated separately to compare the computed total load to the measured suspended load. Bed load is calculated outside of MIKE21 following the method proposed by Soulsby and Damgaard (2005). Bed load is then subtracted from the modeled total load to determine total suspended load. The calculated total suspended load is then compared to the measured suspended load to estimate model accuracy. Typical sediment transport accuracy is within about an order of magnitude of observations (Davies et al 2002). Table B.1 shows the comparison between measured and simulated total suspended sediment transport. Figures B.10 and B.11 show the magnitude of total transport near shore. The samples are an instantaneous measurement of suspended transport. Suspended transport can vary significantly over a single wave period based on the periodic oscillations of velocity and acceleration under waves. Given the typical accuracy of sediment transport models, the analysis requirements and the available data and time allowed to collect additional data, the model is considered sufficiently accurate to meet the requirements of this analysis.

Idealized Representative Beach", "text": "An idealized beach/lagoon system was developed for the model domain to represent the noaction condition. The dynamic nature of the lagoon ensures that the lagoon configuration at the time of the latest survey was not representative of the longer term trend. The idealized domain was created by altering the March 2008 data through analysis of historic data, ultimately creating a uniform beach elevation where the March 2008 beach was below 10 ft NAVD. An idealized representative beach was modeled for both the 2-year and 100-year events, with the initial water level varied between 6 ft and 9 ft NAVD for the 2-year event, and with modifications made within the domain to test erosive properties of the flow. Figure B.13 shows the water level at its peak for the 2 year event. Figure B.14 shows the bed level immediately after the 2 year event. Even though the flow overtopped a significant portion of the beach, one primary channel ultimately formed. The results show that a significant section of the beach is overtopped during the storm and that as the discharge falls and the channel scours the flow tends toward one dominant channel. Figure  B.15 shows the bed after the 100-year event, indicating the same trend as seen during the 2-year events but with significantly more transport over the beach. Aerial photos taken after the December 2007 breach indicate that the beach is in fact overtopped over a long section with a majority of the flow tending towards one dominant channel. Bed level change after the 2 year event for the domain with high and low sections included in the channel between J Street and OID shows that the deep sections are filled and the higher sections are eroded, effectively acting to maintain the current shape of the lagoon. Without flow between J Street and OID, natural channel maintenance will not occur. Peak water level during the 100 year storm ( Figure B.16) shows that the water level is slightly higher than the 2 year and overtopping occurs over more of the beach.    "}, {"section_title": "B2.8.2. Beach Maintenance", "text": "Maintaining a section of the beach to a maximum elevation would cause a breach to form earlier in a storm and lower the maximum water surface elevation achieved at the beach. The minimum elevation to which the beach can be maintained without being opened by the tide is approximately 7 ft NAVD. The recommended location for the maintenance is near OID. Historic data and model results indicate that the beach will overtop at this location even if the beach is lowered adjacent J Street. Comparison between the existing conditions and a 1 m (3 ft) lower beach section indicate that maintaining the beach near OID will lower the maximum water level in the lagoon during the 2 year event by about 1 m (3 ft). The model suggests that the width of the maintained section would impact the water level during the 2 year storm if the width is less than about 100 ft, but this dependency is affected by model inaccuracy related to the time it takes for the breach to form. Conservatively, the data shows that the low section of beach to be maintained needs to be about 100 ft wide. Figure B.17 shows the bed level after the 2 year event with the beach crest maintained at a low elevation. The result is similar to the existing condition with less overtopping of the overall beach section. Figure B.18 shows peak water level during the 2 year storm for a 30 m wide low section near OID.

The data show that the water level within the lagoon near the outlet fluctuates with the tide but the elevation of the bottom within the channel between J Street and OID prohibits tidal exchange beyond the channel except at the highest tides creating a perched section of the lagoon. Figures B.21 and B.22 show the bed level change in the lagoon after the 2-year event. Scour in the channel between J Street and OID is considerably more pronounced during run 9, driven by higher flow from OID than J Street. Figures B.23 and B.24 show the bed level change in the lagoon after the 100-year event The breach/inlet will likely best be created by cutting a section of beach from the lagoon to the ocean, allowing the flow to create the breach. The model suggests that the breach would be between 10 m and 30 m wide to a depth determined by the elevation of the lagoon. The model results show that, for a typical storm, the emergency breach produces the lowest water level of any of the assessed alternatives near J Street and that the closer the inlet is to J Street, the lower the water level there will be.
