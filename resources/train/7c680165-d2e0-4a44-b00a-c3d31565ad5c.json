Visual assessment of these MRI data by radiologists has become an extraordinarily important part of patient care in terms of improving diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring, especially for neurological disease. Image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets, so that, historically, a particular algorithm extracts a piece of information from a particular kind of image. There are several excellent public data resources that algorithm investigators may use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols in multi-parametric studies, most notably leading to the current emphasis on the study of the physical and functional connections between different brain regions (i.e., the \"connectome\" (Sporns et al., 2005) ). These have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences NeuroImage 54 (2011 NeuroImage 54 ( ) 2854 NeuroImage 54 ( -2866 with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multiparametric data.\nMRI reproducibility is commonly assessed with protocols optimized to answer specific questions. However, scan time is a precious resource. Construction of a general protocol that covers many different imaging sequences to meet a specific time constraint (herein, 1 h) leads to comprises based on experience and \"arbitrary\" judgments. The aggregate time constraint certainly limits the quality of data that can be acquired, especially for sequences that require a relatively large amount of data (e.g., parametric mapping for relaxometry, diffusion, etc.), but time is a real constraint under which most clinical studies must labor. MRI data are more often being reused for purposes other than that for which originally intended, so it may be pragmatic to use a more general imaging sequence that leave open greater possibilities for reanalysis. Herein, we present and characterize one such unified sequence for multi-parametric MRI.\nHistorically, data resources have been made available in the form of published atlases, with early and lasting contributions from Brodmann (1907) and Talairach and Tournoux (1988) . These stereotaxic spaces have been digitized and widely applied to 3D MRI interpretation. The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM), in particular, have released a series of brain atlases (including the large-scale averages MNI305, MNI152, and MNI452 along with the high-resolution \"Colin\" brain), which have come to define standard stereotaxic space in MRI-based neuroscience. In line with the NIH data-sharing intuitive, full datasets have begun to emerge; these enable substantively more general re-analyses than are possible with average or representative atlases. Two prominent initiatives, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Mueller et al., 2005) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), have provided a substantial number of public MR human brain datasets. Although large in their participant numbers, both of the datasets are limited in the cataloging of various MR modalities. The ADNI project consists of approximately 819 subjects scanned longitudinally at both 1.5 and 3 T with T1, T2, and proton density (PD) weighted sequences (Jack et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2005) . The OASIS project is divided into longitudinal (Marcus et al., 2010) and cross-sectional (Marcus et al., 2007) sub-studies with T2-weighted images. The cross-sectional dataset consists of 416 subjects (18-96 years old). The longitudinal dataset contains 150 subjects (60-96 years old). Numerous smaller datasets are available through the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN, http://www.birncommunity.org/resources/data/) and various investigators' websites. While some particularly exciting datasets are available (for example, the \"1000 Functional Connectomes\" Project-http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000/), no substantial scan-rescan datasets with a broad range of multi-parametric MRI studies have been publicly disseminated (to the authors' knowledge).\nIn other imaging disciplines, richly featured, common resources libraries have spurred innovation of both general and specialized methods (consider the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark-http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/ bsds/). The lack of widely available data appropriate for validation of image processing algorithms that make use of multi-parametric MRI data has hampered the development and validation of such algorithms. Herein, we present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structural characteristics, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol at 3 T. We assess scanrescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts and report the results in a tabular form for convenient prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table.

Subjects were scanned twice with one of two protocols listed in Table 1 (either the short protocol or the extended protocol). The longer protocol fully used the allotted scan time, while the shorter protocol allowed for a less rushed transition between scans. The protocol used for each subject was selected based on scanner availability. Ten subjects were scanned with the short protocol and 11 subjects with the long protocol. After being scanned for approximately 1 h, each subject exited the scan room for a short break and then reentered the scan room for an identical session. Notably, there was a full repositioning of the volunteer, coils, blankets, and pads before both 1-h sessions. All scans were completed during a 2-week interval. The resulting dataset consisted of 42 \"1-h\" sessions of 21 individuals. Randomized ID codes (01\u2026 42) were assigned to each of the sessions, and each individual was assigned a unique 3-digit key. The sequences explored for this study are briefly reviewed in the following sections.\nTo assess the intrinsic SNR of the sequences in the absence of repositioning effects, a single subject (M/25 years old) was scanned twice with the long protocol without repositioning between sessions.

FLAIR sequences exploit the idea that when signal from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is nulled, T2 hyperintensities of the brain tissue will reflect lesions better (Hajnal et al., 1992) ."}, {"section_title": "FLAIR description", "text": "FLAIR MRI is performed by applying an inversion pulse prior to a spin-echo (or fast spin-echo) readout and can be performed in a multi-slice or a 3D fashion. The 3D FLAIR sequence (so-called VISTA by Philips Medical Systems and SPACE by Siemens Medical Systems) is a multi-echo-turbo-spin-echo, with select modifications: (1) the refocusing pulse train is modulated in such a fashion to maintain a very high SNR and CNR scan throughout an extended readout train. Busse et al. noted that with appropriate RF modulation of the refocusing pulse train, one can maintain the echo for a very long time while creating the contrast from the earlier echoes (Busse, 2004; Busse et al., 2006; Chagla et al., 2008) . (2) We image in the sagittal plane such that SENSE is applied in 2 directions, phase encode in 2 directions and turbo directions in 2 directions (y and radial). Hence, the sampling of k-space is not a simple linear sampling pattern therefore when coupled with modulations of RF refocusing; this yields the desired T2-contrast and high CNR over long TE. Furthermore, Busse et al. noted that due to the RF modulation, the T2 decay is not a single exponential with decay constant = T2. It is, however, decaying with some other decay constant (much longer than T2). The reason being is that if the magnetization is not fully in the x-y plane, then it will dephase less rapidly. Because the apparent T2 is much longer, the extended echo train does not blur the image (T2-filter, or \"smearing\") in quite the same way as a conventional 90-180-180-180\u2026, turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequence.\nThe delay time between the inversion pulse and the excitation of the slice (or phase encode for 3D) is approximately the time when the CSF signal crosses the zero-point on the T1 recovery curve (Hajnal et al., 1992) . The timing for CSF nulling is proportional to the T1 of CSF, so the inversion time (TI) for FLAIR sequences is often very long (TI~2400 ms), and the TR between excitations is longer still (~10 s) to allow for full recovery of the longitudinal magnetization of the CSF prior to the subsequent inversion. To shorten the scan time and gain an increase in resolution, 3D methods have been employed as in this article Moraal et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2008) . The sequence parameters for the FLAIR scan for this study are as follows. A 3D inversion recovery sequence was played out (TR/TE/TI= 8000/330/2400 ms) with a 1.1\u00d7 1.1\u00d7 1.1 mm 3 resolution over an FOV of 242 \u00d7180\u00d7 200 mm (anterior-posterior, right-left, foot-head) acquired in the sagittal plane. The SENSE acceleration factor was 2 in the right-left direction. Multishot, RF amplitude-modulated fast spin-echo (TSE factor =110) was used with 6 dummy start-up echoes. To reduce the power deposition resulting from a large number of refocusing pulses, minimize the effect of T2-decay over a long TE, and reduce the T2-filtering effect, the refocusing angle was set to 50\u00b0, although the actual flip angle of refocusing pulses is modulated similarly to the methods presented by Busse et al.

One 7-min run was recorded which provided 210 time points (discarding the first four volumes to achieve steady state).\nOne of the primary sources of artifacts in functional connectivity is due to correlation of signals from non-neuronal physiological activity such as respiration and cardiac pulsation. To minimize these effects, several methods have been proposed. One such method is RETROICOR (Glover et al., 2000) , which uses respiration signal (typically from a respiratory belt) and a cardiac pulse signal (typically from a pulse oximeter). A newer method (COMPCOR) uses signal from the white matter and CSF to minimize similar artifacts and has been shown to be equally good if not better than RETROICOR (Behzadi et al., 2007) .

Two methods have been employed to measure the absolute T2 of tissue. The first is the multiple echo method, where a spin-echo sequence is performed, and the signal as a function of echo time is obtained, but, as with T1 mapping, this technique is prohibitively long with some acquisitions lasting over 30 min. To overcome these hindrances, T2 can be obtained from a twopoint method, where one dataset is obtained with long TR and short TE (i.e., proton-density weighting) and a second obtained with the same TR and a long TE (~T2, T2-weighted). The advantage of this method is that in a typical clinical evaluation, PD-and T2-weighted images are already obtained, thus the calculation of the estimate of T2 follows with little effort."}, {"section_title": "T2 mapping sequence", "text": "The double echo time T2 measurement is a conventional spinecho with data obtained at two distinct echo times.

Anonymized NIfTI data were analyzed in a subject-specific space, which was defined in the following manner. One MPRAGE for each subject was randomly selected as the target for each subject (21 MPRAGE images), and the remaining 21 MPRAGE images were registered with a six-degree-of-freedom rigid body transform (with cubic spline interpolation) into this space, resulting in a registered MPRAGE for each scan session. The fMRI and DTI scans were registered to the coregistered T2w anatomical target (which is not susceptible to EPI distortion) of their own session using affine (12-degree-of-freedom) registration to compensate for EPI distortion. Other scans within the \"first\" session were registered to the \"first\" session MPRAGE, while all other scans within the \"second\" session were registered to the transformed MPRAGE from the second sessions using rigid body registration and normalized mutual information criteria.\nThe brain was isolated with SPECTRE, a joint registrationsegmentation approach (Carass et al., 2007) to form \"skull-stripped\" MPRAGE.

For each of the labeled regions, the following were assessed in a cross-sectional manner: (1) the mean regional intensity, (2) the coefficient of variation of the intensity within the region, (3) the coefficient of variation of intensity between scans, and (4) the intra-class coefficient (ICC). The ICC assesses the degree of absolute agreement among measurements (i.e., criterion-referenced reliability-also known as A-1) (McGraw and Wong, 1996; Shrout and Fleiss, 1979) . For scans with multiple modalities (e.g., the 32 diffusion weighted directions used in DTI), we report the average coefficient of variation and ICC over the series of scan types.\nTo assess SNR, three regions were manually delineated in the corpus callosum, peripheral white matter, and the globus palidus using the MPRAGE image. SNR was calculated on the scan-rescan data without repositioning as the ffiffiffi 2 p times the mean signal intensity divided by the standard deviation of the scan-rescan difference within each region.\nAll data analysis was performed using the Java Imaging Science Toolkit (JIST) (Lucas et al., 2010) , an open-source framework for medical image analysis and batch processing based on the Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization (MIPAV) program produced by the Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health (McAuliffe et al., 2001 ).

Normal anatomical variability (both temporal and inter-subject characteristics) can make rescan-rescan data complex to interpret.

While fully removing biological variability is impossible, the impact of biological variability on these data can be sufficiently minimized. Actual biological variability is attenuated by having volunteers rescanned within an hour of initial scanning, while detected biological variability is minimized by choosing sufficiently large regions of interest for analysis. The regions of interest used in this study reflect the macroscopic organization of the brain (minimum volume approximately 10 cm 3 ), which are insensitive to small biological differences that may occur between scan and rescan.

(3) regional sensitivity to variations in partial-volume effects. These data are therefore intended to provide the background noise level of an experimental methodology that one needs to determine the power of that method in measuring true biological variability within a smaller ROI. Reproducibility of structural scans was higher than that of images targeting physiologically quantities. In the cortical GM and WM, T1 weighted scans (qT1 and MPRAGE) exhibited the highest reproducibility (mean CVb 2.2%), while DTI, fMRI, and FLAIR exhibited good reproducibility (mean CV~5%). MT and quantitative T2 exhibited mean cortical reproducibility of CV 17%. ASL was the least reproducible in the cortical GM and WM with a mean CV of 21%. Notably, the ASL intensity in white matter exhibited a CV of 28%. Note that ASL is a perfusion sensitized measurement and WM has very low perfusion relative to cortical GM (which had a CV of 14%). VASO reproducibility was also low with a CV of 15%. Increased variability for quantitative scans is to be expected both because of physiological variability as and the increased sensitivity for artifacts.\nAlthough the structural scans (MPRAGE and FLAIR) exhibited consistent reliability between the brain and cerebellum, reproducibility of the sequences was not uniformly consistent for all scan types. ASL was exceptionally stable for cerebellar and brainstem structures (CV of b3%) while quantitative T2, MT, and field mapping approaches were also improved compare with cerebral structure (CV reduced by N11%). Yet, the quantitative T1 exhibited much lower reproducibility (CV increased by b7%) for brainstem regions. For deep brain structures (thalamus, putamen, caudate), there was strong correlation (\u03c1 = 0.74) between acquired slice thickness and CV of these structure. For deep brain structures, T1 weighted studies had high average reproducibility (b3% CV) while the ASL CV neared unity (94%) and the mean CV with VASO was 1.53. MT and quantitative T2 also performed poorly in the caudate (80% CV). CSF exhibited relatively low reproducibility (N5% CV) for all scans except quantitative T1, in which it was consistently of moderate intensity (~70% that of GM). The impact variability can be appreciated from the increased variability on bordering structures, especially those in which CSF is bright. For example, the caudate was poorly reproduced in scans with T2 weighted contrasts.\nHerein, we tabulate the reproducibility of image intensities for large-scale neurological structures. These reproducibility measures are, by construction, less than that which one would expect if smaller, more homogeneous, regions were carefully placed. Specifically, we have intentionally included the effects of scan-rescan variation in artifact, distortion, partial voluming, and non-rigid motion that might corrupt subsequent analysis. The regions of interest were chosen to be representative of the large-scale regions that (1) are of general interest to community and (2) are reproducible with fully automated methods. More detailed characterizations would be valuable to specific fields, such as inclusion of a cortical parcellation or more precise characterization of white matter. However, these approaches would introduce additional methodological dependence and would likely benefit from careful consideration of the specific problem domain. Use of these data for comparative evaluation of anatomical characterizations (and their associated MR-derived contrasts) would be an interesting area of future research. Alternatively, regions of interest could be placed as to avoid these potential confounds if these effects would not be interfere with the data interpretation. We note that the variability measures themselves (e.g., resting state fMRI and diffusion weighted MRI intensities) are not always of direct interest. Rather, the scan-rescan variability measured presented herein can be used to model (either empirically or in simulation) the variability of derived parameters of interest. These data have been made public so that study-specific local regions of interest may be readily compared to the summary measures presented.\nA direct analysis of the reliability and reproducibility does not mitigate the information contained in the resulting images. For example, ASL has the lowest reproducibility, but it is the sole method for studying cerebral perfusion in the absence of contrast injection, so it is invaluable, although maybe not as reproducible as an approach that measures large-scale changes in tissue water. Without a doubt, SNR plays a clear role in the reproducibility specific, yet a precise assessment of SNR for each contrast would necessitate either additional data (i.e., scan-rescan information within a session or Mean ICC shown \u00b1 standard error. noise-only scans) or making assumptions as to the where one could isolate of signal regions with true homogenous signal or use parametric modeling assumptions. As presented, this multi-parametric protocol can serve as a baseline set of sequences to which new generations of acquisition techniques can be compared. Given the rather limited sample size (n = 21), it is difficult to control for age and gender effects, which are known to modulate both brain structure and function. This heterogeneity does not necessarily undermine the assessment of within subject variation (so long as variability is not particularly associated with healthy aging). Furthermore, for power analyses, a hypothesis on effect size is also required. Here, we leave it to the reader to estimate effect size for the analyses methods and contrasts relevant to their endeavors. If imaging variability is believed to be strongly associated with demographics for a particular condition, the data are fully available so that cohorts may be repartitioned into representative populations and appropriate estimates of imaging characteristics may be estimated. The protocol has been fully released so additional acquisitions on select target populations with equivalent sequences are also possible and may be compared with those that have been presented.\nThere are ample opportunities to use this dataset to assess of specific metrics (e.g., quantitative parameters) and/or multi-parametric mapping (e.g., functional connectivity measures on cortical surfaces labeled with diffusion inferred connectivity). In many cases, the numerous potential approaches to derive the same metric are available and it would be an interesting scientific effort to compare such methods. Furthermore, these best practice methods may vary by intended application and require substantial exposition to detail the precise variant of a method used during analysis. Although these analyses are fascinating avenues for continuing study, such efforts are beyond the scope of this work. The authors are actively pursuing characterization of several approaches; however, independent efforts by other groups are also encouraged."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "All resources for this article have been publicly shared through the resource website of the national resource for quantitative functional MRI (http://mri.kennedykrieger.org/databases.html) and the \"multimodal\" project on the NITRC portal (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/ multimodal/).
