These immense storms pose a number of threats to coastal residents including storm surge flooding, rainfall flooding, and high winds. Hurricane threats can have devastating effects in low-lying coastal areas, as well as inland areas. For example, in the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 an estimated 8,000 people (estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000) died when hurricane storm tides of eight to fifteen feet inundated the entire island city of Galveston, Texas (NOAA, 2001). In 1957 Hurricane Audrey's storm surge of over twelve feet extended as far inland as twenty-five miles and was the main cause of 390 deaths in southwestern Louisiana. Not only can hurricanes result in loss of life, they also have the potential to cause significant damage to the economy of an entire region. A recent example of such a storm was Hurricane Andrew. Andrew was a massive storm that caused the most damage of any natural disaster in the history of the United States, estimated at about $25 billion (USGS, 1998). Hurricanes can also undo years of development; destroying infrastructure such as bridges, transportation facilities and buildings. Hurricanes can also devastate natural resources by contaminating water supplies, and by transforming the topography of a region through coastal erosion and landslides. To avoid or reduce the potential loss of life that hurricanes can bring, at-risk coastal cities often seek to evacuate populations under threat of significant hurricanes. The goal of an evacuation is to get as many people out of high-risk areas as quickly and safely as possible. This task can become complicated since tropical storms are often unpredictable. Storms can develop into a hurricane within six to twelve hours, while many heavily populated hurricane prone areas often require 24 to 36 hours to complete an evacuation (FEMA, 1997). As a result, a successful evacuation often depends on the amount of advanced warning time given to evacuate. To give enough time, the landfall location and intensity of the hurricane should be known. Forecasting technology has advanced since the beginning of the century and now incorporates tools such as Doppler radar, weather satellites, computer models and historical data to predict landfall locations. However, despite these advances, the ability to provide adequate advance warning for evacuations remains somewhat limited. In addition to the constraint of limited warning time, population centers along hurricane prone areas have become much larger and more densely populated over time. Currently, there are about 45 million permanent residents in the hurricane-threatened areas of the United States (Jarrell et al., 1992). The most rapid growth has been in the region from the Carolinas to Texas. The State of Florida, where hurricanes occur most frequently, leads the nation in new residents. Since the 1990's Florida's population has grown by an average of 693 new residents a day (State of Florida, 2000). Of these new residents, 80 percent choose to live in one of the State's coastal counties along with the millions of existing residents. Combined with major population growth, there has also been a recent increase in the number of intense hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In 1998 Hurricane Georges and in 1999 Hurricane Floyd precipitated the two largest evacuations in the United States history. During both evacuations, a significant percentage of the population evacuated. This resulted in heavy volumes of traffic moving away from the coastal areas. During the Hurricane Floyd an evacuation trip on Interstate 26 (I-26) from Charleston to Columbia, South Carolina that normally required two hours, took between 16 and 18 hours. In addition to lengthy travel times, other problems such as vehicular incidents and communication difficulties between agencies involved in the evacuation process were also experienced by evacuees and highway agencies."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "In the aftermath of Hurricanes Georges and Floyd, the need for an increased level of involvement from the professional transportation community became apparent. Historically, evacuations have been managed at a local level by emergency management officials. These officials have typically received little input from engineers and planners in the areas of evacuation transportation planning and traffic management. Since the two major evacuations of 1998 and 1999, more transportation agencies have become aware of evacuation needs and issues, and have started to become more actively involved in the process of planning and managing evacuations. One of the factors that currently limits the ability of transportation professionals to assist in the evacuation planning and analysis process has also been the limited amount and availability of evacuation-related transportation literature. While a considerable amount of information does exist, it has been typically available in and disseminated through emergency management literature, post storm reports, operational plans, and other non-traditional sources, rather than in the more familiar transportation literature. Thus, the need existed to synthesize relevant historical and current information into a single document."}, {"section_title": "Research Goals and Objectives", "text": "To overcome the problem of limited information availability and dissemination, this study was undertaken to synthesize relevant historical development of evacuations; and review the policies, procedures, methods and technologies on the subject of hurricane evacuation planning and operations in the Continental United States.

It also identified and prioritized the stated needs of transportation agencies responsible for evacuations and identified the areas of research need that could be undertaken in the future to improve the practices in this field."}, {"section_title": "Goals", "text": "The goals of this study were to increase knowledge and understanding of hurricane evacuation from historical and current practice perspectives; and to document, compare, and contrast current practices in different Atlantic and Gulf coast states in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The objectives of this study were: \u2022 to conduct a comprehensive literature review, \u2022 to conduct a nationwide survey of hurricane evacuation practices and, \u2022 to compare and contrast various practices."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2. Methodology", "text": "The major steps that were taken for this study included a literature review and a survey of state practices. The first step conducted was a traditional literature review that included library and Internet searches. The literature review revealed a moderately sized body of literature on evacuations in general, and it also revealed a relatively low amount of transportation-specific information. To address this problem a direct survey was undertaken. The survey was effective because its results were used to assess the most up-to-date practices, plans and policies. This was not possible using only sources of published information. Thus, the literature review portion of the study provided an historical context for current practices in the United States. Then the survey was used to establish the most current level of practices and procedures. This chapter describes the methodology used in the literature review and in the survey. Results of the literature review will be presented in Chapter 3. Survey results will be presented in Chapter 4."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review Procedure", "text": "The literature search included a review of professional and research journals, conference proceedings and research reports found through library and Internet searches. The results of this review showed that relatively little information was available on transportation engineering aspects of hurricane evacuations. The majority of the information was found in the emergency management literature, including many behavioral studies about why people evacuate. Since a relatively small amount of information was found in the general transportation literature, an additional step to gathering information was also taken. Request letters were sent to transportation officials and planners asking for information related to hurricane evacuations. The purpose of the letter was to gather internal documents and technical reports from transportation agencies actively involved in the process of hurricane evacuation planning, traffic operation and control.  2000). A sample of the letter is included in Figure 1. A total of 83 request letters were sent out via email. Responses were received from 41 emergency management and transportation agencies from the Continental US. In general, the information received as a result of the request was primarily from states that had experienced the Floyd and Georges evacuations, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana. Information received from the letter respondents included post storm assessments reports, hurricane evacuation studies, state emergency plans, and contraflow operational plans. Literature gathered from both the traditional search and the mail out request for documents has been reviewed and summarized in Chapter 3. Dear Mr./Ms. ___________________: My name is Elba Urbina and I am a graduate student researcher in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Louisiana State University. Currently, we are conducting a comprehensive review of information related to hurricane evacuation. Our particular focus is on traffic operations and planning issues, particularly the design and operation of lane reversals for evacuation, the use of ITS during evacuation, the planning and implementation of traffic control systems during evacuation and the allocation and use of field personnel prior to these events. In June of this year, you (or someone at your agency) attended the Federal Highway Administration Hurricane Evacuation Workshop in Atlanta. Since your agency is currently working in areas related to this topic, we hoped that you would be able to share your information with us. This information may include literature reviews that you have already conducted, internal reports, technical papers, or any kind of information that you would consider to be helpful to this effort. The information that you provide will be summarized and combined with that sent from others in this field to create a comprehensive report of current practices and new ideas to address hurricane evacuation problems. It will also be used to develop a list of needs and recommendations for future research in this area. If requested, we would also be happy to send you a copy of this report when it is completed (anticipated summer 2001). We thank you for you assistance in this important matter. The quality and completeness of this report depends on the contribution that we get from you and others like you. If you do not have, or do not wish to provide, this information could you please forward this message to the appropriate person in your agency and share this request with other people that you know have done or are doing work in this area.

The survey was developed to allow these practices to be compared and contrasted and identify practices which have shown to be successful in past evacuations. Areas of emphasis included the authority and command structure, the advance warning times required to implement evacuations, the policies that governed the enforcement and management of evacuations, and the communication strategies used for the exchange of data and information. It was expected that the results gained from the survey would also be used to prioritize current needs and future research topics that could be undertaken in the field of evacuation. To develop the questionnaire, a preliminary list of questions was first devised. the \"correct survey contact person\", calls were made to these state agencies to obtain the names of those in charge of hurricane evacuations in the particular state. Potential survey participants from each state were faxed or emailed for the survey forms. Reminders were sent every two weeks to those participants that had not responded within two weeks from the day the survey was distributed. A total of 41 surveys were distributed and 29 responses were received for a response rate of 70 percent. Of the 29 responses, 16 were from emergency management officials, ten were from transportation officials and three were from law enforcement officials. Appendix B lists the names and agencies of the survey and pilot test respondents."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3. Literature Review", "text": "Strong tropical storms, regionally known as hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones impact coastal regions throughout the world. The primary impact of these storms are regularly felt in seven basins: Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, Northwest Pacific, North Indian, Southwest Indian, Southeast Indian/Australian, and Australian/Southwest Pacific. Tropical storms with winds in excess of 74 miles per hour are called hurricanes in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific basins, typhoons in the Northwest Pacific basin, and cyclones in the other basins. Worldwide, an average of 85 significant tropical storms form each year. While not all these storms make landfall, those that do are capable of significant damage. In 1991, a cyclone killed 140,000 people in the cities of Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh (IDNDR, 1996). In 1999, Hurricane Mitch plowed through Central America killing more than 10,000 people. In the United States, hurricanes are consistently the costliest form of natural disaster. According to Herbert et al., hurricanes resulted in annual average damages of $1.6 billion between the years of 1950of and 1989of , and of $6.2 billion between 1989of (Herbert et al., 1996. Figure 2 shows the global pattern of tropical cyclones (i.e. generic term of an area of low pressure which develops over tropical or subtropical waters) in the seven tropical cyclone basins. "}, {"section_title": "Source: Risk Prediction Initiative", "text": "While hurricanes are a worldwide event, the Atlantic basin is the area that has been studied most extensively. Reliable records for this region go back to the 1940's, with records for landfalling hurricanes on the U.S. mainland going back as far as 1899 (RPI, 1997). The Atlantic basin consists of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. The level of tropical activity in the Atlantic basin is about half that of the Pacific and Indian basin. In a typical storm season the Atlantic basin averages nine to ten tropical weather events that reach tropical storm strength. Of these, five to six reach hurricane strength per year. These hurricanes comprise only about 12 percent of the world total. The Atlantic hurricane season \"officially\" begins on June 1 and concludes on November 30. Maximum activity is in early to mid September. Tropical cyclones outside that period are relatively rare and mostly limited to low latitudes (Landsea, 2001). Hurricanes cannot be controlled, but vulnerability to their effects can be reduced through preparedness and effective evacuations. This chapter presents an historical context and current information related to hurricanes evacuations. It focuses primarily on the Continental United States, and also reviews past hurricane events that have made particularly significant impacts in the development of hurricane evacuation practices in the US. This chapter also discusses recent developments that enhance the hurricane evacuation process in the US, highlighting those that are closely related to the transportation field."}, {"section_title": "Threats", "text": "From June through November, all Atlantic and Gulf coast areas are subject to hurricanes or tropical storms. The most significant threats from hurricanes are storm surge, storm tides, winds, floods, and tornadoes. Storm surge is a large dome of water often as wide as 50 to 100 miles across that sweeps the coastline near where the eye of the hurricane makes landfall. The combination of the storm surge and normal tides create the hurricane or storm tide, which can increase the mean water level 15 feet or more. Along the immediate coast, storm tides present the greatest threat to life and property. This is because most portions of the US' densely populated Atlantic and Gulf Coasts coastlines lie less than 10 feet above mean sea level. In the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 in which over 8,000 people were killed, it was found that most of these fatalities were direct result of storm tide (NOAA, 2001). In 1969, Hurricane Camille produced a 25-foot storm tide in Mississippi. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage (NOAA, 2001). Inland areas can also be impacted by high winds, floods, and tornados. Winds produce debris, such as signs and roofing materials to become flying missiles in hurricanes. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo battered Charlotte, North Carolina (175 miles inland) with gusts to near 100 miles per hour (NOAA, 2001). Another threat for areas well inland are heavy rains and floods. Hurricane Camille in 1969 brought 27 inches of rain to Virginia causing severe flooding (NOAA, 2001). Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 brought 45 inches of rain to areas near Alvin, Texas (NOAA, 2001). In addition, tornadoes are also a threat for inland areas. The rains produced severe flooding that was responsible for one death and $400 million in damage in the US. In 1972, Hurricane Agnes generated 15 tornados in Florida and 2 in Georgia (NOAA, 2001). Agnes caused 122 deaths in the United States. Nine of these were in Florida (mainly from severe thunderstorms) while the remainder was associated with the flooding. The storm was responsible for $2.1 billion in damage in the US, the vast majority of which came from the flooding. The areas that are at risk of hurricane damage and that need to be evacuated during such an event are usually divided into high-risk areas and low risk areas. Typically high-risk areas usually include coastal areas and barrier islands, while low risk areas include inland areas in this region that are usually subject to rainfall flooding."}, {"section_title": "Casualties", "text": "Loss of life is the most obvious reason for the need to evacuate. Historically, the majority of the people who have died in hurricanes around the world have drowned. In the United States, it is estimated that 90 percent of the people who have died in hurricanes have drowned. Although the greatest potential for loss of life related to a hurricane is from the storm surge, the number of people that have drowned due to storm surge or storm tide has drastically decreased in the last 30 years. This is largely because of improved warnings and evacuations.  Source: Tropical Prediction Center."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Forecasts", "text": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) tracks tropical cyclones and predicts future positions and intensities over the Atlantic Basin. To forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones, NHC uses mathematical models that represent the future motion and intensity of a tropical cyclone and its environment in a simplified manner. The results from these models are interpreted by hurricane forecasters to arrive at a final estimated storm track and intensity forecast. These final track and intensity forecasts are then distributed to emergency managers and the public in the form of advisories. Public advisories are issued when data confirms that a tropical storm has developed. After the initial advisory, scheduled advisories are issued at six-hour intervals. These advisories follow a standard format that provides information such as storm location, motion, wind, intensity, expected storm surge, actions to be taken, associated events (e.g. rainfall, tornados, etc.) and the forecaster's name. They also include watches and warnings issued for a specified area. Table 1 shows the definition for tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings. Watches and warnings also exist for inland high wind, tornadoes, and flash floods. When watches or warnings are in effect, public advisories are issued every three hours by the NHC. Advisories are also issued every two hours when a watch or warning is in effect and land-based radars have identified a reliable storm center. While the information included in the public advisories is essential for emergency managers and the general public, those who benefit from these advisories should know that tropical cyclone forecasts included in these advisories are not perfect. According to NHC, errors in forecasts come from two main sources: inaccuracies in the observations or insufficient number of observations, and incomplete understanding of the physics of the hurricane and the atmosphere in which it is embedded. "}, {"section_title": "TROPICAL STORM WARNING", "text": "A tropical storm warning is issued when tropical storm conditions, including winds from 39 to 73 mph, are expected in a specified coastal area within 24 hours or less."}, {"section_title": "HURRICANE WATCH", "text": "A hurricane watch is issued for a specified coastal area for which a hurricane or a hurricane-related hazard is a possible threat within 36 hours."}, {"section_title": "HURRICANE WARNING", "text": "A hurricane warning is issued when a hurricane with sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or higher is expected in a specified coastal area in 24 hours or less. A hurricane warning can remain in effect when dangerously high water or a combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves continues, even though the winds may have subsided below hurricane intensity."}, {"section_title": "Source: National Hurricane Center", "text": "The forecast track error is defined as the distance between a forecast position and a \"best track\" position for the time of the forecast. For forecasters it is easier to predict where a hurricane will be right before it makes landfall, than to predict where it will be 72 hours before making landfall. Figure 4 shows the NHC average official track forecast errors measure in nautical miles (NM) for the Atlantic Basin between 1989 and 1998. This figures shows that, at shorter forecast time periods, the forecast track errors are fairly small. In contrast, the errors increase significantly when the forecast is farther in the future. \nOne method used by forecasters to define the uncertainty in hurricane forecasting is the use of strike probability forecasts. These probability forecasts are based on the current best-forecast track and past forecast error statistics. They are issued by the NHC to indicate the statistical chance that the hurricane center will pass within 65 NM (75 miles) of a location within 72 hours of the initial forecast time. Table   2 shows the maximum probabilities by forecast period. It can be observed from the table that as the forecasts period shortens, the accuracy of the prediction increases. For example, if a hurricane is expected to make landfall in 24 hours in New Orleans, the highest the probability that it would strike can be is 50 percent. However, the City of New Orleans with its 1.3 million residents and limited outbound route capacities estimates that 72 hours of advanced notification time would be needed to issue and evacuation order for a category three, four or five hurricane (see Tables 3 and 7). Thus, if the City of New Orleans wait until the probability is 50 percent or greater, it will be too late to complete the evacuation. *Note: These probabilities are those which would be computed if the forecast position (at the given time period) were directly over a community. A range of probabilities is given because forecast errors differ by location. The probability can be 100% if the center is already close to a location. In addition, the probabilities can exceed the maximums listed in the table if the hurricane center is actually forecast to be at the location at an earlier time period.\nA common application of the strike probability forecasts is the use of a probability strike band. This band visually represents the area that would need to be evacuated based on the forecast track and intensity of the storm. This area is usually known as the warning area. Thus, evacuations depend directly on forecast track and intensity, as well as the warning area. Figure 5 shows the warning area for a 24-hour forecast track. As shown this figure, the orientation of the forecast track with respect to the coast is a major factor considered when determining the size of the warning area. Hurricane forecasters are not only challenged to predict the hurricane's track, but they are also asked to predict the strength or intensity of a hurricane. The intensity of a hurricane at landfall is directly related to its central pressure and its forward speed (Simpson and Riehl, 1981). Weather forecasters in the US use the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Intensity Scale to give an estimate of the potential flooding and damage to property given a hurricane's estimated intensity. This scale rates hurricanes based on wind speed, barometric pressure and storm surge height. There are five different categories in this scale, ranging from category one which has the lowest wind speeds to a category five which has the strongest wind speeds. Hurricanes of categories three, four and five are considered to be \"major\" hurricanes.  Less than 27.17\" Less than 920.08mb < than 18.0' < than 5.5m  "}, {"section_title": "Population Growth and Development on Coast", "text": "Over the past 40 years, the population of metropolitan areas along the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts has grown significantly. More people now live along these coasts than ever before in history. As a result of the increase in population in coastal areas, development along these areas has also increased, producing more damage in property when disasters occur. According to the Office of Ocean Resources Conservation and Assessment (ORCA), the region with the largest coastal population is the Atlantic Coast followed by the Pacific Coast and then the Gulf of Mexico region (Culliton et al., 1990). In addition to the permanent residents, these coastal areas attract holiday, weekend, and vacation populations during the hurricane season. Many of the Nation's most popular vacation spots are located on or near the coast; this together with the growing coastal population intensifies the risk of fatalities during a hurricane. Since shorelines are the most attractive to new residents in the areas, the coastline from Maine to Texas has been filled with new homes, condominium towers, commercial buildings and hotels. Coastal counties have become many of the most developed areas in the country. About half of all new residential and nonresidential construction in the United States between 1970 and 1989 occurred in coastal areas (Culliton et al., 1992). According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico accounts for 60 percent of the distribution of coastal housing units, 58 percent of the coastal commercial and industrial buildings, and 57 percent of U.S. hotel and recreational buildings authorized by permit between 1970 and 1989 in the United States (Culliton et al., 1992). Property damages costs of tropical cyclones equal or exceed those of earthquakes and every other type of natural catastrophe (RPI, 1997). As people continue to develop coastal regions around the world, there is little doubt that societal impacts of tropical cyclones will continue to increase."}, {"section_title": "Meteorology", "text": "While population and coastal development were increasing in US coastal areas from 1970s to the 1990s, a different phenomena was taking place in storm frequency. The number of intense hurricanes making landfall along the Atlantic and Gulf coast decreased during the 1970s to the early 1990s (RPI, 1997). During this time, hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean was below the average of the past 50 to 100 years. This meant that most significant increase in coastal population and development occurred during an usual lull in hurricane activity. This combination of events has led to a general feeling that coastal areas are less prepared and equipped to deal with the threat of severe hurricanes than they were in the past. Hurricane experts at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) maintain that hurricane frequency in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions runs on 20 to 30 year cycles. Since the period during the 1970s to the early 1990s was characterized by a lull in hurricane activity, a return to a more active regime is now experienced. This theory is also supported by the observation of a very active regime from the 1940s through the late 1960s (RPI, 1997). Research suggest that the active Atlantic hurricane seasons of 1995 and 1996 represent a return to the high levels of activity seen during the 1940s through 1960s (Landsea et al., 1996). However, it remains unclear whether tropical cyclone activity is changing on a global scale because of lack of reliable records."}, {"section_title": "Historical Review of Evacuations", "text": "The beginning of the th century was a difficult time for coastal populations because of the high level of hurricane activity that took place. Two events characterized the history of hurricane evacuation during the last 100 years. In September of 1900 a hurricane struck Galveston, Texas killing more than 8,000 people. These two events represent pivotal points in the history of hurricane evacuation preparedness and recovery. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 was the first \"wake up call\" for federal, state, and local officials that led to the improvement of warning and response systems. It also made officials realize the critical need for information about hurricanes and the need for additional research in this area. Despite nearly 100 years of advancements in technology, Hurricane Floyd still left officials with many questions about how information could best be been disseminated to the different groups that needed it. In addition, it made everyone think about how evacuations are being handled and what can be done to improve them. In order to take a closer look at the different events that have made an impact in the development of hurricane evacuation practices, procedures, and policies, the following is a chronological account of some of the most important events during the past100 years."}, {"section_title": "Pre 1900", "text": "History is punctuated with natural disasters such as hurricanes. Their legacy span many cultures and thousands of years. Geologists believe that layers of sediments at the bottom of a lake in Alabama were brought there from the Gulf of Mexico by storm surges associated with hurricanes that occurred as much as 3,000 years ago. (Liu and Fearn, 1993). Humanity has always been scared of hurricanes; therefore, hurricane evacuations are an ancient process. Perhaps, the Mayans, whom in hieroglyphics had early records of Atlantic hurricanes, built their major settlement away from hurricaneprone areas (Konrad, 1985). Many storms left important marks in history; several events destroyed invincible armadas. The French, English, Spanish and Dutch all lost large fleets at some point in history. Naval disasters were common due to hurricanes during the colonization period. It is believed that the first European to encounter such storms was Columbus during his voyages to America. Ship records served as a witness of past hurricanes during those years. Even though, hurricane disasters have occurred for centuries, it is during the last 100 years that authorities and the general public have given more attention to these events."}, {"section_title": "The Galveston Hurricane of 1900", "text": "The event that changed the way many people looked at hurricanes was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. On September 8, 1900 the city of Galveston, Texas and the surrounding area of Southeast Texas were hit by a major hurricane. This event still represents the deadliest natural disaster (in terms of lives lost) in American history. The tragedy of the event is certainly the main reason why it is constantly in the minds of emergency managers when a major hurricane comes. Therefore, to avoid another disaster of that magnitude, it is imperative to look back at past events like the Galveston Hurricane in order to learn from previous mistakes. The many books written about the event are a constant remainder of a national tragedy that could happen again to any coastal city in the 21 st century if no measures are taking to prepare everyone for a major hurricane. Many factors combined at the time to make the Galveston Hurricane the tragedy that it was. At that time, technology like Doppler radars, and other forecasting instruments were not available; therefore, storm warnings were not given with enough time to completely evacuate some areas. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Weather Bureau, Daily Journal for September 1900, despite warnings, many people did not evacuate because they did not expect the storm to be as severe as it was. Many residents who had survived the storm in 1886, which was only a mild tropical storm, believed that it would not be worse than before. The key factors causing large number of deaths in Galveston were a late storm warning and a feeling of confidence that the storm was not severe. Lew Fincher in his paper The 1900 Great Galveston Storm and Earlier Disasters along the Gulf Coast analyzed the Galveston Hurricane and several storms that hit Gulf areas at the end of the 19 th century. To mitigate future events of this magnitude, disasters should be utilized as lessons that should be reviewed in order to learn from them. In Fincher's paper, it is maintained that the biggest problem at that time and now is to reach the atrisk population with the correct information in a timely manner. Some of Fincher's suggestions included building better highway systems for quicker evacuations, and to improve and enforce better building codes (Fincher, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "1901-1939", "text": "After the Galveston Hurricane, a greater research effort on hurricanes and their causes and effects began. Forecasters, whom at that time had worked with few tools such as barometric pressure readings and wind direction data to plot the course of a hurricane, began to develop more sophisticated weather forecasting and measuring tools. The dream of not having to rely on ship reports, received after the storm from those that had encountered it and also fought to survive the storm, was actively pursued. In August of 1909, the first hurricane report was radioed from a ship and received by the United States Weather Bureau. Before this, the Bureau, who had sole authority to issue storm warnings, was forced to rely on information from its stations ashore for its hurricane forecasting (Weems, 1957). At the same time that improvements in hurricane prediction technology were taking place, events like the transformation of the industry of the automobile were also occurring. The automobile was transformed from a luxury to a necessity. The power of the automobile was now within the reach of the average citizen. In addition, the transportation system was also growing and improving. The nation was attempting to respond to the explosion of the motor vehicle population and the need to rebuild and construct many miles of roads. The automobile and the growing transportation system represented a great benefit for evacuations because it meant a fast way to get people out of risk areas. But at the same time, it meant that evacuation plans were needed in order to accommodate the growing number of vehicles. During the first four decades of the 20 th century, 67 hurricanes made landfall in the United States mainland. Of these 67 hurricanes, 27 were categorized as major hurricanes. One of them was the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that hit the Florida Keys. This hurricane was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the mainland U.S. in the 20 th century. Another major hurricane during this period was the New England or Long Island Express Hurricane of 1938. This hurricane caused great damage. More than 600 deaths, 4,500 homes destroyed, 26,000 destroyed automobiles, and 63,000 homeless were among the damages of this category 3 hurricane. Despite evacuations warnings, many residents did not evacuate during these two storms. One must keep in mind that at this time there were no weather satellites, no weather radar, and no offshore weather buoys."}, {"section_title": "1940-1969", "text": "This period from 1940 to 1969 was characterized by a very active regime of hurricane intensity with two particularly active periods from 1944 to 1950 and from 1954 to 1960. During both of these six-year periods the Atlantic coast from New England to Florida experienced seven intense hurricane landfalls (RPI, 1997). In total 56 hurricanes hit the mainland United States during the 29-year period. Of the total number of storms, of 21 were categorized as \"major\" hurricanes (Herbert et al., 1996). One of the most significant of these major hurricanes was Camille, which hit the Mississippi and Louisiana Coastline in 1969. Camille was the most intense hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States. It caused significant damage and loss of life with 256 deaths (Herbert et al., 1996). These were mostly storm surge deaths of people who did not evacuate despite the warnings. As with previous hurricanes, forecasters had difficulty forecasting the path of the storm. At the time sophisticated computer models like those used by the National Hurricane Center today were unknown. Between 1940 and 1969 great advances were made in technology which helped forecasters determine the path of storms. Beginning, in 1944, reconnaissance aircraft started flying to help gather information on approaching typhoons or hurricanes. It was not until the early 1950's, after several hurricanes swept up the eastern coast of the United States, that policymakers took the hurricane threat seriously enough to significantly finance research. Since this time, more reliable records of U.S. landfalling hurricanes exist."}, {"section_title": "1970-1997", "text": "The hurricane activity observed during the 1970s through the early 1990s was relatively low when compared with the previous three decades. This time period ended with two years of significantly increased level of hurricane activity. The years of 1995 included nine hurricanes and five intense hurricanes and 1996 with nine hurricanes, of which six were intense, that suggested a return to high levels of activity seem during the 1940s to 1960s (RPI, 1997). Starting in the 1970s, several cities conducted studies for the evacuation of coastal residents. For example, The Miami Federal Executive Board conducted a pilot study for Dade County. In 1973, they published the report Evacuation of Coastal Residents during Hurricanes based on this study. The Board developed an operational plan that included a description of the actions to take upon issuance of a hurricane warning. Their primary objectives were to reduce the volume of vehicular traffic required for evacuation of coastal residents and to reduce the length of time required to achieve relocation. It also provided places of emergency refuge for persons that remained in risk areas when evacuation routes were terminated and normal storm shelters could no longer be reached (Miami Federal Executive Board, 1973). During this period, advancements in technology also took place, most notably in the area of weather modeling. The Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model was developed by the National Weather Service (NWS) to accurately predict hurricane storm surge under certain sets of conditions. The SLOSH output maps provided valuable information to determine which areas should be evacuated, planning evacuation routes, and for safe emergency shelters. In addition, Hurricane and Evacuation (HURREVAC) was developed by FEMA and the Corps of Engineers. The HURREVAC uses geographical information system (GIS) information to correlate demographic data with shelter locations and their proximity to evacuation routes to estimate the effect of strategic-level evacuation decisions. The program also downloads hurricane advisory data provided by the National Hurricane Center and puts it in a user-friendly graphical interface to help decide when and if an evacuation should be ordered. The 1970 and 1996 period also brought new technologies for evacuations. Contraflow operations were planned for use during hurricane evacuations to increase the capacity of the highway evacuation routes and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology was used to disseminate traffic condition information to evacuees on evacuation routes and coordinate the process in some states."}, {"section_title": "1998-Current", "text": "The most recent years have brought further advancements in the area of hurricane evacuations. During this period the two largest hurricane evacuations took place. The first one, Hurricane Georges was place in September of 1998 during Hurricane Georges. The second one occurred a year later, in September of 1999. Hurricane Floyd caused the largest hurricane evacuation ever in the United States and perhaps, its largest traffic jams. In response to the problems experienced during these evacuations, highway agencies began to take a more active role in the planning, management and operation of hurricane evacuations."}, {"section_title": "One of the advancements of this period has been the creation of the Evacuation", "text": "Liaison Team (ELT). The ELT comprise of FEMA, US Department of Transportation, and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers officials. The primary role of the ELT is to facilitate communications between federal and state emergency and transportation officials providing them with timely traffic-related information (i.e. traffic flows, shelter location, road closures, traffic count stations) during a multi-state evacuation. A major function of the ELT is to inform states of how much traffic is anticipated to arrive in their state from another state. The ELT uses the Evacuation Traffic Information System (ETIS), formerly Traffic Demand Forecast Model (TDFM) to collect and disseminate traffic information during hurricane evacuations (this model will be discussed later in this chapter). The ELT is activated for a category 3 or higher and its activities are coordinated from the FEMA Regional Operation Center in Atlanta, Georgia."}, {"section_title": "Georges", "text": "Although Hurricane Georges was neither the deadliest nor the strongest hurricane of the Atlantic basin during the 1998 season, its 17 days of journey resulted in seven landfalls. It made the last two of its seven landfalls in the US, first in Key West, Florida then near Biloxi, Mississippi. After its landfall in the Florida Keys, early forecasts pointed toward Northwest Florida. Later forecasts shifted Georges farther west to Louisiana, and then back east again to Mississippi. Thus, evacuation orders were issued in different regions of the US causing the second largest hurricane evacuation in US history. In Florida, all 80,000 residents of Monroe County (i.e. Florida Keys) were ordered to evacuate. It should be noted that the only evacuation route out of the Florida Keys is US 1, a two-lane highway that connects the Florida Keys islands to the mainland. Also in Florida, some Miami area residents were urged to evacuate. Miami-Dade county Mayor issued a voluntary evacuation for residents of the barrier islands, low-lying areas and mobile homes, including 100,000 residents of Miami Beach. Voluntary evacuations were also issued for some counties in the northeast area of Florida. In the Gulf coast, before making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, Georges was predicted to make landfall in New Orleans, home to approximately 1.3 million inhabitants. Since the city is situated on land that is predominately below sea level and has limited number of evacuation routes leading out of the city, emergency managers urged people to evacuate. Almost half of the population who live in the metro area evacuated, resulting in gridlock on the roads (Galle, 2001). Interstate 10, the main evacuation route out of the city, was closed to avoid late evacuees to be stranded on the highway. About 14,000 evacuees took shelter in the Superdome stadium. In addition, evacuation orders were issued for parishes surrounding the City of New Orleans increasing the number of evacuees in the limited number of routes leading out of the city. In other areas of the Gulf such as coastal counties in Mississippi and Alabama voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders were also issued. During the evacuation process, Northwest and South Florida reported that traffic moved smoothly. Hurricane assessments studies adjudicate this to timely evacuations, appropriate and effective traffic control and modest participation rates out of areas that potentially could have been impacted by the storm (PBS&J, 1999). In contrast, the evacuation process in the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama reported similar traffic difficulties such as delays due to construction along evacuation routes, lack of capacity on evacuation routes, heavy traffic congestion and flash flooding on major evacuation routes (PBS&J, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Floyd", "text": "Hurricane Floyd was a large and intense storm that roughly paralleled the Atlantic US coastline remaining offshore from Miami, Florida to its landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina as a category 2 hurricane. Only a year after hurricane Georges, Floyd precipitated the largest evacuation in the US history forcing nearly three million people to evacuate. For the United States, nearly the entire Atlantic coast from Miami to Plymouth, Massachusetts was put under a hurricane warning (PBS&J, 2000b). During Hurricane Floyd mandatory and voluntary evacuations were issued in almost every state from Florida to New York. In Florida, an estimated 2 million people evacuated, while in Georgia after evacuation orders were given an estimated 300,000 people left the Georgia's coast. In South Carolina, a voluntary evacuation was closely followed by a mandatory evacuation in the State's six coastal counties. In response to these two evacuations orders, over 400,000 people evacuated. Evacuation orders were also issued in North Carolina where Floyd made landfall. "}, {"section_title": "Historical Development of Hurricane Evacuations and Evacuation Research", "text": "Since the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, improved methods of hurricane detection, forecasting, and response systems have been developed. Today the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continuously monitors and forecasts these storms and warns emergency preparedness officials and the public directly of possible threats. Unfortunately, despite these warnings, the public's response to evacuation orders varies widely. When evacuation orders are given not everyone always evacuates. This is due to a number of reasons that include considerations of safety, cost, comfort, and traffic, to name a few. The field of hurricane evacuation research gained initial interest in the 1950s, particularly in the area of evacuee behavior (Baker, 1991). Since this time, researchers have conducted behavioral surveys in the aftermath of many hurricanes. These decades of research have created a database of sufficient size and geographical scope to draw conclusions about how coastal populations behave under the threat of approaching storms. Studies of evacuation behavior have identified consistent patterns of how and why people evacuate. Researchers found that evacuation participation rates can vary from about 30 to nearly 100 percent depending on the level of warning and perception of risk (Sorenson and Mileti, 1988). For populations in high-risk areas (i.e. low lying coastal areas and barrier islands), rates of around 90 to 95 percent are common, while rates in low risk areas (i.e. inland areas) are more typically around 25 to 35 percent. In a more specific review of over a dozen hurricanes, researchers found that risk areas and the nature of warnings given by public officials were the most important variables affecting public response (Baker, 1991). In addition to these findings, other generalizations have also been made. Not surprisingly, a greater percentage of mobile home dwellers evacuate than occupants of other housing, especially in moderate-risk and low-risk areas. A belief that one's home was subject to flooding was also strongly associated with whether the occupant leaves or not (Baker, 1991). Studies have also been conducted to understand differences in responses to hurricane evacuation warnings. These studies have included analyses of demographic factors such as age, previous hurricane experience, previous unnecessary evacuation, general hurricane awareness, education, and gender. Researchers have found that these factors are poor predictors of evacuation behavior. For example, many social scientists have argued that the greater the elapsed time since a hazardous event the lower the public perception of the threat. However, in a study of how hazard perception changed among long-time residents of hurricane prone areas, researchers found that the awareness of the true threat of hurricanes remained high as much as twelve years after an event (Cross, 1990). These studies provided an initial understanding of how permanent residents respond to hurricanes, but they overlooked the behavior of transient populations such as tourists and business people (Dow and Cutter, 1998). Typically during holidays, weekends, and popular vacation periods, the population of hurricane prone areas drastically increases. These periods also coincide with the Atlantic hurricane season (June 1 st to November 30 th ). Thus, the behavior of this group is often underrepresented in evacuation studies. The concern over the omission of this group is also increased because of the difficulty in locating tourists after the storm. A study of tourists and other transients population behavior during five disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, found that approximately 75 percent of the tourists and the business people responded to warnings by evacuating to a safer place, while only 58 percent of the homeless people evacuated (Drabek, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Evacuation Modeling", "text": "Understanding the public response to perceived hazards and evacuation orders, (i.e. how and why people evacuate), is one of the keys to improving evacuation processes. This information has been used by transportation planners to model travel demand forecast patterns. During the 1980s, the field of transportation planning analysis advanced with the development of conceptual and computer models used on studies to estimate traffic flow analysis. The majority of prior studies have relied on models developed for evacuations in case of nuclear power plant emergencies. However, one study conducted for the City of Virginia Beach in the mid 1980's was done with a model developed for hurricane evacuations (Hobeika et al., 1985). The goal of this project was to develop a hurricane transportation evacuation plan for the City of Virginia Beach. In the study, MASS eVACuation (MASSVAC), a macroscopic simulation model developed for hurricane evacuations was used as an evaluation tool. The model was run under four scenarios that included different hurricane intensity levels and operational strategies. Among the operational strategies that were incorporated in the model to reduce evacuation time were the use of contraflow traffic operations, the use of shoulders, and the change of signal operation to flashing mode. Researchers found that the primary factors that affected the overall evacuation time under hurricane and flood conditions were: the size of the population to be evacuated; the location and number of shelters; the capacity of the evacuation routes; the time available for evacuating from the threatened areas; and the specific operational traffic strategies used for alleviating the congested link. Another model that can be used for hurricane evacuations is the Oak Ridge Evacuation Modeling System (OREMS). This microcomputer-based system was developed by the Center for Transportation Analysis at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to simulate traffic flow during various emergency evacuations such as nuclear attacks (ORNL, 1995). The model can be used to estimate clearance times, identify operational traffic characteristics, and other information such as evacuation routes and evacuation time necessary to develop evacuation plans. It also allowed users to experiment with alternate routes, destinations, traffic control and management strategies, and evacuees response rates (ORNL, 1995). More recently, researchers from ORNL have identified the need for a decision tool capable of modeling hurricane evacuation activities in more timely and accurate ways (Franzese and Han, 2001). This has included the development of a computerbased incident management decision aid system (IMDAS). When completed, the system will include two primary components: a static module and a dynamic module. The static module will generate the inputs that do not change over time. analysis, an evacuee behavioral analysis, a sheltering analysis, and a transportation analysis. The hazard analysis identifies the areas that would need to be evacuated in storms of different intensities and tracks. The vulnerability analysis identifies the number of households and people occupying the area and structures needing to be evacuated. The behavioral analysis projects how the public will respond to the hurricane threat. The transportation analysis assesses street and road capacities and identifies critical links in the network. The shelter analysis evaluates structures to be used as refuges for evacuees."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Evacuation Planning", "text": "As in similar types of emergencies, planning is one of the most important steps that should be taken to reduce casualties. Hurricane evacuation planning should involve not only emergency managers and law enforcement officials, but also transportation officials because of their expertise in traffic control, design and planning. While some state transportation agencies have contributed to the evacuation planning and management process, their activities could usually be characterized as peripheral support. The effect of limited involvement has been most evident during past evacuations where severe traffic congestion and construction zones along evacuation routes were experienced. In the aftermath of these events, emergency management and state transportation officials recognized the need for an increased level of involvement from the transportation professional community. Another problem that impacts the ability to evacuate threatened populations is evacuation route capacity. In general, the transportation infrastructure in U.S. coastal regions has not kept pace with the increasing population in these areas. According to the Federal Highway Administration (Row, 2001) during the past years there have been a growth of 70 percent in vehicle mile used, while only a little over one percent growth in roadway capacity has been experienced. It is thought that traffic engineers can use their experience and expertise to introduce flexible strategies and more efficient use of facilities while incorporating the needs of evacuation in their normal traffic planning, design, and analysis activities to make the transportation system work in emergencies. For example, the use of contraflow operations and the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (discussed later in this chapter) are methods that are being planned to increase capacity of the transportation system during emergencies."}, {"section_title": "New Methods Used in Recent Hurricane Evacuations", "text": "Recently, regional evacuation plans have begun to incorporate some novel and progressive methods and technologies to increase outbound capacity and communication between emergency personnel and the public (ALDOT, 2000a;NCDOT, 2000;PBS&J, 2000c). One example of this is reverse lane, or contraflow strategies. Contraflow operations were used during Hurricane Floyd by South Carolina and Georgia to increase capacity. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies were also used during Hurricane Floyd in several states to increase the exchange of information between emergency officials, evacuees and the media. This section addresses these two new methods used in recent hurricane evacuations."}, {"section_title": "Contraflow Operations", "text": "Contraflow operations refer to the conversion of one or more lanes of a highway to flow in the opposite direction. This increases the capacity of the highway without The idea of using contraflow operations to increase capacity in case of major evacuations was first suggested in the 1980s (FEMA, 1984). During this time, contraflow operations on evacuation routes were recommended for use as a last resort option and were originally planned for use during nuclear missile attacks. The City of Detroit had a one-way civil defense evacuation plan that called for the reversal of all lanes of I-94 and I-75 out of the city in the event of a nuclear attack. Today, with heavily populated hurricane risk areas and major hurricanes expected to strike with increasing frequency, contraflow operations are considered to be a valuable tool to expedite the movement of people out of threatened areas. Several one-way plans were prepared for the Florida Turnpike in the 1990s. The initial plan was to provide contraflow over its entire length. However, this was thought to be infeasible because of large personnel and equipment needs involved in the plan. Since this time, several other alternative one-way plans have been developed (described later). In the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd, the Governor of Florida created a task force whose primary assignment was to identify the need and feasibility of reverse laning on limited access facilities. Florida now plans to use contraflow on seven interstate evacuation routes during major hurricane evacuations and every other state along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have developed contraflow evacuation plans (FDOT, 2000;GDOT, 2000;NCDOT, 2000;ALDOT, 2000a;ALDOT, 2000b;TXDPS, 2000). Despite the wide-spread plans for contraflow evacuation, research on the costs and benefits of its use remain limited. One recent study of this subject was conducted by FEMA (PBS&J, 2000c). In this study traffic volumes collected by Florida, Georgia and South Carolina during Hurricane Floyd were used as a base to compute planning level roadway capacities for evacuation traffic under different conditions. During the Floyd evacuation, Florida did not implement contraflow operations. Traffic counts in Georgia were not on the portion of the Interstate where flow was reversed. The South Carolina DOT provided the only contraflow traffic data collected from this operation. Some of the traffic counts did not, however, have the capability to record traffic data on the reverse lanes. According to this study, the use of contraflow operations provided approximately 30 to 70 percent increases in capacity over conventional operations depending on the configuration. Table 4 shows these values.  (Ford et al., 2000). CORSIM is a microscopic traffic simulation model for the analysis of freeways and surface street networks. This model was used to analyze 14 different sections of the I-37 evacuation route from Corpus Christi to San Antonio, to determine a suitable termination point for the reversal operation. An additional factor in the analysis was the ability to provide mobility and access for residents living along I-37 but not in the evacuation zone. The model was also used to identify queuing problems, and evaluate highway ramps and cross street traffic operations. In the I-37 study, it was assumed that 60 percent of the traffic "}, {"section_title": "ITS Applications", "text": "In addition to the need to increase capacity during evacuations, the need for the collection and transfer of traffic flow information is also a need. Traffic engineers have used remote sensing equipment for decades to obtain traffic data (e.g. speed, volume, vehicle classification). One of the problems that was observed in past evacuations was that this traffic data was not in a useable format for emergency managers. To be more useful, traffic data needed to be condensed and summarized in a timely manner to provide understandable information for emergency managers. This will allow them to make decisions about evacuation routes and to inform the media and the public. The task of keeping emergency managers, the media, and evacuees informed in a rapid and effective manner during a hurricane event can be challenging. This is because many agencies do not necessarily have all the equipment to provide real time data along evacuation routes to monitor and disseminate traffic information. In During a hurricane evacuation, ITS applications can be used for the acquisition of traffic flow data in real or near-real time. Such timely information can then be used to control and reroute traffic, get information into the affected areas to support decisions such as when to terminate the evacuation, and to get information out to the evacuees and the media. Many ideas and recommendations on the use of ITS technologies for major evacuations have been made recently (PBS&J, 2000c;FHWA, 2000b). ITS technologies are used extensively in Florida to help manage evacuations. In Florida, emergency management officials are planning to use these technologies to monitor the status of one-way operations and get road status information and travel advisories to evacuees on roadways (Collins, 2001). Despite the emerging interest in ITS, there has been little research to determine their impact on capacity and level of service during hurricane evacuations. Researchers at the Center for Urban Transportation Research of the University of South Florida (USF) conducted one of the few studies published in this area (Zaragoza et al., 1998). The first phase of the USF study used FDOT permanent traffic count data to examine the temporal variation in traffic volumes during two hurricanes evacuation events (Hurricane Opal in 1995 and Hurricane Bertha in 1996) and compared those conditions with assumptions used in the HES previously completed for the areas impacted by those storms. It was found that new traffic counters were needed to supply emergency management personnel with real time traffic information. Counters that collect and disseminate information in real time and store data for long periods of time were recommended to the FDOT. The second phase of the USF study focused on the use of advanced technologies such as traffic surveillance video cameras, and real-time traffic information Internet sites to improve operation management during hurricane evacuations. The study produced an inventory of the traffic surveillance cameras in the State of Florida, including those cameras planned for future implementation around the state. It was found that both technologies could provide valuable decision support tools. A more recent study focused on ITS technologies in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (PBS&J, 2000c). This study produced an inventory of ITS technologies currently in use and planned for future deployment in the study area. The study also developed recommendations for each of the states, providing maps showing locations where ITS applications were recommended and tables with cost estimates for each treatment. The most recommended applications were closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, Highway Advisory Radio (HAR), Variable Message Signs (VMS), count stations, and weather stations. While the use of ITS systems can bring benefits to the evacuation process, they are not without considerable expense. They can also be limited because these technologies are most often found in urbanized areas. Urban areas typically represent a portion of the total distance that evacuees drive to find shelter during evacuations. Thus many states DOTs are seeking to integrate these systems into a rural architecture that can be used to better monitor and manage hurricane evacuations."}, {"section_title": "The Evacuation Process", "text": "The process use to evacuate varies fairly significant from state to state. In this section the Louisiana evacuation process is described. The following description is taking exactly from the National Review of Hurricane Evacuation Plans and Policies report published by the LSU Hurricane Center (Wolshon et al, 2001). The most visible part of the evacuation process is when people take to the road to flee an approaching storm. However, this action is only the last step in a process that often begins more than a week before. Emergency management terminology and preparedness vary significantly from state-to-state. However, most states generally follow similar process in their response to hurricane threats. In Louisiana, the Office of Emergency Preparedness (LOEP) is responsible for developing emergency procedures and coordinating preparedness, response, and recovery functions for hurricanes. The development of an evacuation order, while a critical part of the response process, is one of many tasks that need to be carried out during this process. The LOEP uses a five-step \"activation\" process that transitions their staff from routine operation through the various stages of readiness, response, and recovery after the storm (LOEP, 1999). The LOEP activation process is used to highlight the key activities of the pre-evacuation development process. While these procedures are presented relative to the landfall time of an approaching storm, it should be noted that in preparing for hurricane there is no such thing as a \"normal\" storm. Hurricane behavior can be notoriously unpredictable and, as such, these prelandfall time references can vary significantly and the activations can often jump several levels at once.

Activities within the emergency operations center (EOC) shift to action-oriented tasks, including the recommendations to evacuate. In Louisiana, evacuation orders can only be issued by local authorities, such as a mayors or parish presidents (the highest countylevel officials). At two hours prior to expected storm landfall, the LOEP issues an order to close all evacuation routes and evacuates traffic enforcement and news media personnel to last resort refuges. During the storm LOEP remains at Level I Activation and develops post storm response and recovery strategies. Activities also include assessments of casualties, damage to personal property and critical infrastructure, resource availability, and the coordination of services for the post-storm recovery effort."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4.

This chapter covers areas that need to be considered when planning for hurricane evacuations. These areas include general evacuation information such as hurricane operations plans, evacuation time and the types of evacuation. This general information will serve as a background for areas that are more specific to the transportation field. These include practices on moving people without access to personal transportation, the use of contraflow operations, the use of ITS systems for evacuations and construction zones on evacuation routes. Information on current practices is based on responses from emergency management, transportation and law enforcement officials that participated in the survey described in Chapter 2."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Operations Plan", "text": "The  Table 5 lists the current status of plans for hurricane evacuation for those states that responded to Questions 6 and 7 on the survey. "}, {"section_title": "Authority and Command Structure", "text": "One of the key issues that must be defined in emergency operations plans is the command structure. Command is defined as the authority to issue evacuation orders. The command structure is different in every state. By law, Governors generally have the ultimate authority to order an evacuation in case of a hurricane. However, this authority is often delegated to local officials (e.g. mayor, city council, county law enforcement, county judge and county president). At the same time, local officials rely on county or municipal emergency managers for advice. This is because emergency managers have better knowledge and training in the evacuation process. Table 6 shows the state and local level official with the authority to order a hurricane evacuation for those US coastal states that responded to Question 1 on the survey. As shown in the table the Governor has authority to order an evacuation in fourteen of seventeen states. In New York and Texas the authority is delegated exclusively to local authorities because only a relatively small area of the State is vulnerable to hurricanes. In contrast, in South Carolina the Governor has sole authority to order a hurricane evacuation. This is in part because evacuations are often unpopular and politically sensitive issues since they are so costly. The economic loss of ordering an evacuation can cost the economy millions. This cost includes lost of productivity, the cost of safeguarding homes and businesses, and canceled beachfront vacations to name only a few. "}, {"section_title": "Evacuation Implementation Time", "text": "A critical issue in avoiding casualties from hurricanes is the time at which state or local authorities must order an evacuation relative to the expected arrival of a storm. The earlier the evacuation order is issued, the more time residents and tourists will have to evacuate. However, the earlier the evacuation order is issued the greater the possibility that the hurricane could change course before landfall, rendering the evacuation unnecessary or placing evacuees in a more dangerous location. Evacuations that turn out to be unnecessary also lead to a \"Cry Wolf\" syndrome in which people are less likely to evacuate during future threats. The primary criteria governing the decision to evacuate is the forecast storm information from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The NHC provides storm track, forward speed, and intensity information to state and local authorities about every six hours with intermediate forecasts every three hours. Currently, the NHC forecasting system is able to predict strike locations within an average error of 100 miles in the period 24 hours before storm landfall (see Figure 4). Most of the agencies that participated in this study believe that this prediction is neither timely nor accurate enough. Most moderate to large cities need in excess of 12 hours to initiate evacuations and have them completed before arrival of tropical storm-force winds (39 miles per hour). In addition to hurricane forecast information, officials also need to consider evacuation clearance times and pre-landfall hazard time. The clearance time is the time required to configure all traffic control elements on the evacuation routes, initiate the evacuation, and clear the routes of vehicles once deteriorating conditions warrant its end. Clearance times are estimated for most coastal states by transportation planners using data such as anticipated population to evacuate, the number of lanes available for evacuation and impacts from other areas that will affect the evacuation. Clearance times can vary widely by location. They can be significantly lengthened by en route congestion and set-up time required for contraflow. Pre-landfall hazards time is the time during which hazardous conditions exist prior to actual hurricane landfall. Pre-planned evacuation times vary widely by location. The survey showed that most of these times were around 24 hours. However, many states required additional time for stronger storms. States officials assumed that more people will evacuate in case of major hurricanes. In North Carolina, clearance times can vary from nine hours in some portions of the state to 24 hours in other portions. In New Jersey the maximum clearance time is 36 hours for their most southern county, Cape May. In the State of Texas, clearance times range from two to 29 hours. As a safety factor, officials in Texas generally add in three hours to advise the public and get the evacuation underway. Thus, depending on the size of the storm and its location along the coast, Texas local jurisdictions make the evacuation decision at least as early as 5 to 32 hours ahead of storm landfall. Appendix C shows worst-case clearance times for several counties in Florida. Figure 7 shows the components of evacuation time. Table 7 shows the estimates of preferred minimum advanced notification time for the 9 states responding to Question 2 on the survey.  "}, {"section_title": "Types of Evacuation", "text": "Once an evacuation order is deemed necessary, the extent and type of evacuation must be determined. The extent and type of evacuation order issued is dependent on the characteristics of the storm and clearance times. Evacuations are typically classified into three types: \"voluntary\", \"recommended\", and \"mandatory\". Variations of the three levels of evacuation are used in all coastal states. However, they are not all inclusive. Some states do not have all three levels. The State of Virginia designates all evacuations are either \"voluntary\" or \"recommended\"; none are \"mandatory\". In South Carolina, all evacuations are either \"voluntary\" or \"mandatory\", while in the State of Texas there are no \"mandatory\" evacuations; all of them are \"recommended\". The terminology of evacuation also varies by state. For example, in the six coastal counties in the State of Georgia affected by storm surge, evacuations can be \"partial voluntary\" when only a portion of the county is asked to consider evacuating due to the threat of storm surge (e.g. barrier islands communities). The State also uses \"full voluntary\", \"partial mandatory\", and \"full mandatory evacuations\". In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, \"voluntary\" evacuations are referred to as \"precautionary\". In Texas, evacuation guidance provided by government officials is typically referred to as an \"evacuation recommendation.\" It was also found that the terms \"recommended\" and \"voluntary\" are used interchangeable in many states. Table 8 shows the types of hurricane evacuations by the states that responded to Question 3 on the survey.  The type of evacuation order issued is important because many potential evacuees will make a decision based on the type of evacuation issued. Research studies have shown that people who said they heard officials issue mandatory evacuation orders were the most likely to evacuate. This was followed by those who said they heard officials recommend that they should leave (PBS&J, 2000b). The type of evacuation order and how it is communicated to the public is important to avoid unnecessary evacuations. This phenomenon, known as shadow evacuation, occurs when people near threatened areas evacuate their homes even though they are not necessarily in danger. In Florida, authorities considered that the increase in the number of evacuees experienced during Floyd was a result of shadow evacuation. Therefore, it is important for officials to reach those for whom evacuation notices are intended, while avoiding those for whom they are not. One of the most difficult aspects for emergency management officials in states where mandatory evacuations exist is how to enforce them. To carry out a mandatory evacuation, emergency management officials must rely on local and state law enforcement agencies. Typically, a combination of state police (highway patrol) and local law enforcement officers are supplemented by the National Guard to enforce mandatory evacuations. Table 9 shows the agencies that have enforcement responsibility in case of mandatory evacuations in the states that responded to Question 4 on the survey. Although the State of Mississippi has mandatory evacuations, the current laws of the State do not allow them to be enforced. In the State of New Jersey, emergency management officials acknowledge that if persons want to stay, the State typically would not physically remove them from their property against there will unless it was absolutely certain that they would be harmed by the storm. The State of Delaware has never had a mandatory evacuation. However, if one were to occur the State would use state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce the evacuation.  "}, {"section_title": "Low Mobility Groups", "text": "In the United States the transportation system is dominated by the automobile. As a result, automobiles are the most valuable and versatile resource for evacuations. Unfortunately, not all persons in at risk areas will own or have access to transportation such as automobiles. The portion of the population in these situations are characterized as \"low mobility\" groups. During hurricane evacuations low mobility groups represent a challenge for emergency management officials. Typically the movement of these people is the responsibility of local emergency management agencies that coordinate transportation for those that need assistance. This coordination usually consists of establishing pick up points for citizens without transportation and it is often directed to the poor and elderly. Coordination of this type often requires mutual aid agreements to be in place between the emergency management agencies and the various Boards' of Education for use of school buses, or mass transit providers (e.g., tour and public bus companies). Special facilities populations are also often considered to be low mobility groups during hurricane evacuations. Special facilities can include a range of different facilities, including health care facilities, nursing homes, and jails. Typically, the decision to evacuate these facilities is determined by the chief administrator of the individual facility. Often, these people are neither familiar with nor trained in the procedures and regulations of emergency management. Most state emergency management agencies recognized the special needs that low mobility groups have during hurricane evacuations. They often provide special arrangements such as elderly registration programs in counties and the use of airplanes in some hospitals to transport some medical patients. In New York these special arrangements vary according to local municipal plans. In Maryland and Virginia, they are also determined individually by each local jurisdiction. In New Jersey arrangements for large facilities such as nursing homes, hospitals and prisons are written into plans; while for smaller facilities and/or individuals they are handled locally. For example, in all of the states mentioned before, buses would be used to transport elderly people to shelters. Table 11 shows the list of surveyed states that make special arrangements (i.e. use of buses) for low mobility groups as reported on Question 23 on the survey. "}, {"section_title": "Use of Public Transit in Evacuations", "text": "Transportation systems in the US typically encompass several different modes. tourists without a car that could be in the area during a hurricane evacuation, nor special needs populations. The total number of buses in all of New Orleans would provide only a fraction of the capacity needed to transport all of these people. Thus, Louisiana emergency management officials plan to use any available alternative means of transporation, including National Guard vehicles. One option that has been suggested is use of the proposed Gulf Coast MagLev (magnetic levitation) System to transport low mobility groups to higher areas. This system has been proposed for the City of New Orleans, but has not been built. If built, this could be a viable option when advance warning has been given. It should not be used close to the arrival of the storm because of high winds can destabilized this systems. Moreover, it should be well organized to avoid great numbers of evacuees that might be left at the station without shelter when the system is shut down due to arrival of tropical storm winds. "}, {"section_title": "Contraflow", "text": "As a solution to the lack of capacity on many evacuations routes, contraflow operations plans have been developed for use during hurricane evacuations. Contraflow operations are also known as one way out or reverse laning. These terms are used interchangeably in many states. However, some states prefer the use of the term reverse laning. For the purpose of this study the term contraflow will be use to describe any operation configuration in which one or more lanes in the inbound direction are used for outbound flow.   (Trammell, 2001). The State of New Jersey is also looking for routes that are worth reversing like Garden State Parkway, New Jersey Turnpike, I-78 and I-80 (Augustiniak, 2001).   Use of a shoulder lane has been estimated to increase capacity by approximately eight percent (PBS&J, 2000c). Although the capacity increase depends greatly on the width of the shoulder and the design of bridges that might produce bottlenecks. Drivers tend to reduce speeds and flow rates are decreased when they are laterally constrained. Consideration is also given to the narrower pavement cross-section thickness and greater cross-slope of shoulders (Wolshon, 2001).  The contraflow plans in the surveyed states typically call for the use of one type of strategy. However, New Jersey, South Carolina and Louisiana plan to use more than one strategy as shown in Table 16. Any one of the particular strategies in these states will be implemented depending on the characteristics of the storm and evacuation time. Termination points designs also vary from state to state. The most common designs include diverting traffic to secondary routes using exit ramps. When the inbound lanes are diverted, traffic on the outbound lanes will continue as normal. However, when the traffic on the outbound lanes is diverted to secondary routes, traffic on the inbound lanes will have to be diverted to the outbound lanes using crossovers.   Cape May County, New Jersey, that usually requires 36 hours to evacuate will be reduced to 20 hours when contraflow is used. Clearance times in Atlantic, Ocean City and Monmouth Counties clearance times are expected to be reduced from 28 to 20 hours, 22 to 15 hours, and 20 to 15 hours respectively when contraflow is used (Augustiniak, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Operational Issues", "text": "Despite the advantages that contraflow operations can bring to the evacuation, its disadvantages also need to be considered. No matter what type of contraflow operations is used, all highway agency personnel agree that one-way operations will be inconvenient and likely confusing for drivers not familiar with this type of operation. They are also expected to be labor intensive to initiate, difficult to enforce and potentially dangerous for drivers. If safety is the principal goal, measures will be taken to assure the safety of the evacuees on the roadway. This can include redesigning guardrails on the outbound lanes. By contrast, if the focus is more into getting as many people out as possible, some more risky measures can be taken to let everyone get into the inbound lanes using exit ramps. As part of this study the following operational issues were considered: safety, driver understanding, accessibility, enforcement, convenience and cost. This section discusses these operational issues and gives examples of what states are planning to address such issues. \u2022 Safety. One of the critical factors in the design of highways is safety. Traffic engineers design special features such as guardrails, crash attenuators, and breakaway signs to reduce the severity of accidents that result from vehicles running off the roadway. However, during contraflow operations these design features may not be suitable for or could in fact be hazardous to vehicles driving in the opposite direction. To address this issue some states are planning to redesign or retrofit existing safety appurtenances (Wolshon, 2001). For example, the NCDOT has proposed the reconstruction of guardrails along I-40 to protect vehicles traveling in the opposite direction (NCDOT, 2000). Other states have taken the approach not to redesign these devices since contraflow is infrequent and it would not be cost effective. It is also widely assumed that during contraflow operations vehicles will maintain relatively low speeds, thereby decreasing the likelihood and severity of the impact. Another key issue associated with contraflow is the potential for head on accidents, with vehicles traveling in the opposing direction. To address this issue most states plan to reverse all inbound lanes. In addition, evacuation plans call for State Police or National Guard troops to be positioned at entrance ramps on the inbound lanes to prohibit the entrance of inbound traffic. Traffic incidents on evacuation routes are another concern during contraflow operations. A traffic incident refers to any non-recurrent event that causes reduction of roadway capacity or an abnormal increase in traffic demand. When incidents occur, lanes are blocked, thereby reducing roadway capacity. During hurricane evacuations, vehicular incidents such as overheating, flat tire, run out of fuel vehicles, and accidents are expected to occur. When they do, they have to be cleared in a safe and timely manner to restore the roadway to its full capacity. However, during contraflow operations incident clearance becomes a challenge due to the difficulty of service and law enforcement vehicles getting to the incident site. To address this issue some states are planning to preposition wrecker vehicles along the contraflow route. The South Carolina DOT will use the motorist assistance program called State Highway Emergency Program (SHEP). The use of this program will assist in situations such as repairs to disabled vehicles, assist to traffic control and incident management. If needed, SHEP patrol personnel can also provide first aid until emergency medical services arrive. \u2022 Driver Understanding. Another issue considered to be critical by emergency management and transportation officials is driver understanding of the contraflow routes particularly for those on the reverse lanes. Driver confusion can result in traffic incidents, thereby reducing roadway capacity. During contraflow operations, drivers are faced with an unfamiliar situation; therefore, the dissemination of reversal information (e.g. contraflow routes, exist and secondary routes) information is critical. This is especially true for tourists who many not be familiar with the area. To address this issue the GDOT has produced brochures that explain the contraflow plan and include evacuations routes. The VDOT and GDOT also have contraflow on their websites. However, these measures should be complementary to highway signing and delineation, since only a few, if any, evacuees will have access to the Internet in their cars. In addition, reading these brochures could be a distraction for drivers. \u2022 Accessibility. Accessibility for both emergency service personnel and evacuees is an issue that must be considered when planning contraflow operations. Evacuations increase the demand for roadside restroom facilities, gas stations, and in some cases emergency facilities. The contraflow plans currently in place will limit access to these facilities, especially for those evacuees traveling on the reversed lanes. To address this issue, some states will attempt not to restrict the exit of vehicles in the inbound lanes. In North Carolina, most interchanges exits will be open both in the inbound and outbound lanes. They will also be closely monitored by police and DOT personnel. In South Carolina, evacuees will be allowed to exit the interstate at most locations and re-enter in the normal fashion. Emergency service personnel can also be affected by this issue, since contraflow operations limit return access for inbound vehicles. Many states have proposed the use of parallel secondary routes for service access (FHWA, 2000a). TxDOT officials have planned circulation routes for emergency vehicles. Thus, vehicles will be circulating parallel routes that will be used for emergency access assistance during the IH-37 reversal. \u2022 Enforcement. Enforcement is also an issue that should be considered in the \u2022 Convenience. During routine travel conditions, highway facilities allow drivers to drive at high speeds; therefore, reducing travel times. During hurricane evacuations, the convenience of limited access facilities turns into inconvenience when lengthy travel times are experienced and highway access ramps are closed. To address this issue in South Carolina, transportation and law enforcement officials plan to provide water and maps in six rest areas and two weigh stations. Portable toilets will also be provided for evacuees at these locations. \u2022 Cost. Cost is also an issue that must be considered in the planning process. Contraflow operations are considered to be relatively inexpensive by transportation officials when compared to the cost of building new lanes to increase capacity. However, contraflow operations do include other costs of capital improvement, equipment and labor. For example, the construction of paved crossovers to divert traffic to the outbound lanes. Additionally, traffic control devices such as barricades, evacuation signs, highway advisory radio and variable message signs also add to the cost. However, most of these devices can be used during normal routine traffic activities. For this study, emergency management, transportation, and law enforcement officials were asked to rate their degree of concern relative to the various operational issues presented. Using a DOS based computer program of the method suggested by Thurstone (1927), responses from survey participants were analyzed. This program compares alternatives against each other and rates them from the most important to the least important. This process is known as psychometric scaling. The data used for this process was obtained from Question 21 of the survey respondents (See Appendix A). Survey participants had six different operational issues to rate according to a scale provided for them in the survey. Figure 14 shows the relative level of importance of each operational issue for survey respondents. In this figure the numbers on the bar represent how the different six operational issues were rated when compared to each other in a scale from 0 to 1. The lines serve as division between the different ranges on the scale provided in the survey. For example, enforcement obtained a rate of 0.45; therefore, is considered to be an important operational issue because it follows in between 0.40 and 0.53. In general, this figure shows that officials considered safety; driver understanding; and accessibility as very important issues. They also considered enforcement to be an important issue though relatively less important than the first three issues. From the survey responses it was also apparent that convenience and cost, while important, were the least critical of the six measures. This is primarily because "}, {"section_title": "Contraflow Implementation Time", "text": "The time that it takes to implement contraflow operations prior to a hurricane is critical. One of the key factors involved in the decision on if and when to initiate contraflow operations is the time required to set up the contraflow operation. It includes the time required to clear the roadway of all vehicles in the inbound lanes, the time required to install traffic control devices (e.g. barricades) and the time required for law enforcement and DOT field personnel to report to their assigned positions. This time ranges from four to 12 hours depending on the length of the highway in which the operation will be implemented, the number of interchanges, ramps or merging points that may require control devices and law enforcement personnel. Advanced notification time is also a factor that influences this decision. Transportation officials usually start implementation operations when they are notified of the need to do so. However, this decision depends on storm information (e.g. size, intensity and track). Notification time depends on the time that authorities estimate to prepare for contraflow operations. In Florida, authorities estimate that 49 hours will be needed to prepare for a contraflow operation. This time includes notification by the Governor, the time necessary to activate the National Guard, and 12 hours of set up time (Collins, 2001). Based on the survey of state practices it was found that there is no standardized criteria on when to implement contraflow of operations. It was also found that most states are reluctant to implement them at night because of the limited visibility for drivers and enforcement personnel. Most states base their decision to contraflow on the category of the storm and time of the day. For example, the States of New Jersey and highway without adequate shelter. The two most common factors that dictate the shutdown time for contraflow operations in the surveyed states were the arrival of tropical storm force winds and the decrease in evacuation traffic volumes. Table 17 shows the criteria that states that responded to Question 16 will used as the basis for contraflow termination. are not guaranteed to be safe in strong hurricane situations; however, they provide an option which may be better than remaining on the road in vehicles during strong winds. Another option under study has been vertical evacuation, where last minute evacuees are moved to upper stories of buildings. However, because of the inherent dangers (e.g. windows being blown out) of this practice most states consider this option to be a last resort. High-rise buildings are vulnerable to hurricane-force winds, particularly at the higher levels since wind speed tends to increase with height. Emergency managers must also allow for the time necessary to move DOT field personnel and law enforcement officials from the evacuation routes. Texas is one of the few states that includes detailed shout down time information in their plans. In Texas, it is estimated that four hours will be required to set up the contraflow routes and five hours will be required to evacuate field personnel after it is complete. Figure 15 shows TxDOT chronology for the set up and removal of the I-37 contraflow section. "}, {"section_title": "Source: Texas Department of Transportation", "text": "In Florida, it is estimated that eight hours will be required to set up I-4 for contraflow and six hours will be required to end contraflow operations. Figure 16 shows FDOT chronology for the set up and removal of the I-4 contaflow section. The traffic information considered by transportation officials to be most important during an evacuation is traffic volume and speed. This is because it is critical to decide when deciding when to start and terminate contraflow operations, or when to reroute traffic. Typically, officials in charge of evacuations compare evacuation traffic data under routine conditions to historical traffic data to confirm that traffic volumes are higher or lower than normal and immediate action is needed (i.e. contraflow operations, reroute traffic, shutdown contraflow, etc.). Additionally, information on vehicular incidents such as accidents, disabled vehicles (i.e. run out of fuel, overheating, etc.), or debris on the roadway is also needed to take effective actions that will clear the roadway of such incidents and restore capacity. Weather information is important because decisions such as road closures due to flooding or bridge closures due to high winds depend on this information. In response to the need for timely traffic information during hurricane evacuations, several states plan to incorporate ITS technologies into the evacuation process. ITS systems allow traffic to be collected remotely from the field. This data is usually received at a traffic management center where traffic engineers summarize it in a format useful for emergency managers. With such information, emergency managers can monitor status of contraflow operations, decide when to shutdown contraflow operations, etc. This information is also provided to the public through the use of ITS systems and the media. ITS systems make the exchange of information between officials and evacuees better because they are able to provide real-time or near real-time information. While the use of ITS systems can bring benefits to the evacuation process, they are not without considerable expense. Their utility can also be limited because these systems are usually found in urbanized areas. Urbanized areas typically represent only a portion of the total distance that evacuees drive or are driven to find shelter during evacuations. Therefore, a rural ITS architecture is needed to help better manage hurricane evacuation while benefiting routine travel conditions. Another limitation of ITS is its expense. Since evacuations are infrequent events, transportation agencies often do not consider it to be cost-effective to install expensive ITS equipment for use exclusively during hurricane evacuations. To be considered a viable option, ITS systems need to have a multipurpose functionality so they can be utilized during both routine travel conditions and during evacuations. Results from the survey showed that ITS technologies are more likely to be used during an evacuation and surveillance equipment and equipment that helps disseminate traffic information to the public. Surveillance systems can include a variety of devices such as cameras and sensors that can produce important information about current traffic flow. Many decisions are then based on this information (e.g. requests for help, messages to evacuees, etc). Typically, traffic engineers use loop detectors to measure speed, volume, and vehicle categorization. Even though during hurricane evacuation it would be preferred to use real time count stations (i.e. current information, up to the minute), the use of near real time count station (i.e. traffic data is not up to minute, but usually delayed up to an hour) can be useful for traffic analysis to communicate traffic flow and speed information to emergency managers and law enforcement officials as well. In addition to traffic count stations, closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) can also provide critical information to transportation officials and emergency managers. CCTV cameras can provide real time data on traffic conditions on the transportation network. This information is important to emergency managers, transportation officials and law enforcement officials because it can illustrate both the flow of traffic and weather conditions in particular locations. It may also be used for the automatic detection of incidents and verification that an incident has been cleared. This type of information can then be disseminated to evacuees.  Table 18 provides a summary of ITS systems planned for use during hurricane evacuations in the coastal states that responded to Question 24 on the survey. roadway that are subject to flooding to monitor the area and advise the public of possible flooding areas, and of road or bridge closures."}, {"section_title": "Public Information Via Internet", "text": "Since evacuees need to know what routes to take, when to evacuate, the location of shelters the dissemination of information during hurricane evacuations is critical. While some ITS technologies are useful for evacuees already en-route, it does little for those still at home and in the process of planning and preparing for an evacuation. Thus, emergency management, law enforcement and transportation officials make use of the news media and Internet. In addition, contraflow information and general evacuation route information is necessary for tourists and business people that may be unfamiliar with evacuation routes or the hurricane evacuation process. For some DOT's the Internet has become a highly effective and practical way to keep people informed of evacuation routes, road conditions, and weather information, among others. This type of information is has been incorporated into DOT's websites in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia. Some states such as South Carolina have also created special purpose websites that include evacuation-specific information. Table 19 lists three webpages that contain hurricane-specific information. places where this information can be obtained. Figure 18 shows the homepage of the special website created by the South Carolina Department of Public Safety.  Other suggestions that have been made to maintain full capacity on evacuation routes construction zones include limiting the construction season, length, contract duration, and/or phase sequencing of projects on evacuations routes (Wolshon, 2001). However, these have not been evaluated to determine they would work during a hurricane evacuation event."}, {"section_title": "Re-entry", "text": "After a hurricane threat has passed, public officials and evacuees begin the process of re-entry. Although the direct threat of the hurricane may have passed, evacuated areas typically undergo several inspections to make sure that is safe to allow evacuees back into the area. Most coastal states permit evacuees to return after they are deemed to be safe by local and state officials. In practice, however, most evacuees often leave inland shelters as soon as it appears that re-entry routes are open. This typically occurs well before an all-clear advisory. Leaving shelters early can be dangerous for evacuees because debris such as downed power lines, trees, and roofing material can block roadways. Flooded roadways can also be hazardous for drivers. According to National Hurricane Center statistics, as little as one foot of water can move most cars off the road; and most flood related deaths occur at night and involve people in vehicles. In Lafayette, Louisiana many of these issues were encountered by evacuees that left shelters early in the reentry process without an all clear advisory from authorities after the Andrew evacuation in 1992. This situation resulted in discontent among law enforcement officials and the public. It also delayed recovery activities being undertaken by DOT and utility personnel. Another re-entry concern that authorities have is looting, particularly in homes and businesses that might be missing door and windows. To address this issue and restrict those re-entering an area, many areas issue re-entry stickers for residents. These stickers assist law enforcement personnel to identify residents. However, having a reentry sticker does not mean that residents can reenter the county at any time. In Texas, TxDOT has written re-entry procedures. The process consists of two phases: the initial or re-entry phase, and the clean-up or recovery-phase. TxDOT officials believe that utilizing a two phase approach will decrease the time needed to gain access to affected areas. The first phase or re-entry phase consists of opening a minimum path on the roadway (14 feet wide). This facilitates access for law enforcement, public works, utility and relief vehicles into affected areas. During this phase, routes to hospitals or emergency center will be the first to be opened followed by primary highway routes (IH, US, State Highway). Any damage to the roadway or bridges along the route will also be reported. During this phase traffic is usually limited to official traffic. The recovery phase consists of the removal of debris and the opening of all accessible routes. During this phase the full width of the roadway will be cleared to provide two-way access to evacuees. The GDOT also has re-entry procedures written into plans. They are similar to the Texas procedures. In Georgia, the re-entry will also consist of two phases: the initial or basic restoration phase and the follow up or full restoration phase. In addition to decreasing the time needed to gain access to affected areas, they feel that this approach will also limit access into the affected areas enhancing the ability of law enforcement officials to maintain security, control sight-seers, and prevent looting. The two phases follow the same approach as the ones in Texas with the exception that the minimum path width on the roadway will be of 12 feet. Another method that has been used during the re-entry process is contraflow. In "}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5. Identification of Current Needs and Future Research Areas", "text": "Transportation professionals involved in the evacuation planning have been able to identify specific needs in the area of hurricane evacuations. This identification of these needs has also led to the identification of many areas that will require future research to meet some of these needs. This chapter identifies and discusses current areas of need and future research that could be undertaken in the field of hurricane evacuation."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Current Needs", "text": "The survey of hurricane evacuation practices and procedures conducted for this study gave transportation officials an opportunity to express their needs by asking them if there were areas or problems that they considered require research investigation or that they would like answered. Overall, survey participants did not express a great need for information or research. However, those that did, expressed needs in the following areas: interstate coordination of evacuations, flow rates for contraflow, education, integration of weather information with transportation management systems and guidelines for signing and ITS devices on evacuation routes. The following sections discuss these needs."}, {"section_title": "Interstate Coordination", "text": "The need for interstate coordination became more evident during the Hurricane Floyd evacuation in September 1999. During this evacuation, tremendous numbers of evacuees moved up the east coast from Florida to Georgia and into South Carolina, causing near gridlock conditions (Wolshon, 2001). Due to lack of coordination and communication between states, transportation officials from each state were not able to anticipate the heavy volumes of traffic moving away from the coastal areas. To avoid these conditions in future evacuations, an evacuation travel demand forecasting system has been developed by FEMA. The ETIS model consists of a web-based travel demand-forecasting model and includes every coastal state from Delaware to Texas. Another area where interstate coordination is needed is the Northeast Coast. Authorities expect that during a hurricane evacuation many southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island tourists would be returning home to Massachusetts. It is also expected that many Cape Cod tourists would be returning home to New York through Connecticut causing tremendous traffic congestion in both areas. None of these states have contraflow plans that might increase capacity and get more people out of risk areas. In fact in many of these States there is not a great sense of concern since hurricanes have not made landfall in their coastal areas recently. Therefore many precautions taken routinely in southern states are unknown in these areas. Louisiana and Mississippi have also experienced problems in the past, when a tremendous volume of evacuees moved from New Orleans to Mississippi. The Mississippi DOT and the Louisiana DOTD have come to an agreement that will allow the continuation of Louisiana contraflow operations into Mississippi. Mississippi authorities were reluctant to this agreement at first due to the potential harm that it could bring to its population by reducing the capacity of their evacuations routes and shelters. "}, {"section_title": "Integration of Weather Information with Transportation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Education and Exchange of Information", "text": "Education on hurricane evacuations is essential for both the public and the transportation community. The more informed the public is on evacuation routes, location of shelters and the use of contraflow routes, the smoother the evacuation could turn out to be. Evacuees need information not only before and during the evacuation, but also while they are in shelters and during the re-entry process. Moreover betterinformed transportation professionals could lead to better development of evacuations plans. In addition, there is also a need for the exchange of hurricane evacuation transportation related information. To address this need the FHWA has initiated a series of evacuation-related workshops. A Transportation Research Board subcommittee has also been formed to disseminate new research findings to the professional community. Additionally, ITS systems can also guide evacuees and communicate critical information such as secondary evacuation routes, exists lanes, detours, etc. Needs have also been voiced for guidelines that will help transportation officials determine where to place this type of sensitive systems, particularly in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Guidelines for Signing and ITS on Evacuation Routes", "text": "Not only are officials concerned with guidelines for the installation of ITS equipment, but also with its survivability during severe weather conditions. ITS systems are composed of sensitive devices that in many cases require special care. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rains and winds can lead to the malfunction or complete destruction of these devices. Additionally, these systems are also expensive; therefore, transportation officials are reluctant to invest in permanent systems that may be destroyed due the force of a hurricane. Thus there is a need for devices that can resist adverse weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rains."}, {"section_title": "Future Research Areas", "text": "Many of the needs previously identified can be met by the allocation of more funding to these areas; however, some areas may also require research. Research is essential to get better understanding on each specific area. The more understanding, the more practical and cost-effective methods that can be developed to address these needs. The following is a list of future research that might be undertaken in the future: 1. Hurricane practices and procedures directly affect evacuees; therefore, a survey can be undertaken among evacuees to obtain their feedback on transportation practices that they consider were effective/beneficial during an evacuation. 2. The last review of several behavioral studies was conducted more than ten years ago. A review of behavioral studies during the past ten years should be undertaken to study if new trends have emerged. This could help transportation planners in the development of travel demand forecasting models. 3. Include more transportation questions in behavioral surveys. 12. Develop a rural ITS architecture that will serve to disseminate information during hurricane evacuations and routine travel conditions. 13. Develop plans for use of mass transit during evacuations, not only for special needs populations, but also for other low mobility groups such as tourists and homeless. For this study, surveys were mostly distributed to state emergency management agencies and DOTs. For future studies it is recommended that local emergency management agencies and law enforcement officials be contacted because of the active role that they play in the evacuation process. Ideally, a follow up to this study should be undertaken every year before the hurricane season starts. This is because practices and procedures are usually reviewed at that time. In addition, agencies involve in the evacuation process usually conduct tabletop and functional exercises right before the hurricane season. Thus, depending on the success of the tests modifications to plans are made."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6. Conclusions", "text": "Hurricane evacuations in the US have been changing, primarily due to the explosion in population growth along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts over the past decades. Because of this, evacuations have evolved from localized events to more regional events involving several states and millions of evacuees. Despite this growth in coastal population, the roadway infrastructure to support evacuations has remained relatively unchanged over the same period. Therefore, evacuations have become challenging processes that require not only the involvement of emergency management officials, but also great level of involvement from the transportation community. The results of this study showed that published literature on hurricane evacuations, in general, is mostly in the domain of the social and behavioral sciences. Specific transportation-related literature remains limited and unpublished. Until now, information regarding hurricane evacuation policies and plans has been mainly available through local or state agencies in the form of DOT reports, emergency management operational manuals and other local agencies and private engineering firms. These reports are often difficult to access. This thesis provides background information on hurricane evacuations in the US mainland since the beginning of the 20 th century, and transportation-specific information on current evacuation plans and policies. The results of the study have demonstrated that since the Hurricanes Georges therefore, their performance during hurricane evacuations remains unknown. The results from the survey showed that the most important issues faced by the transportation community are increasing the capacity of evacuation routes, and collecting and communicating real-time traffic information during evacuations. Significant results obtained from the survey include: \u2022 Governors have the authority to issue evacuation orders in every coastal state, but usually authority is delegated to local officials. \u2022 Every coastal state considers the forecast storm information from the NHC and the evacuation clearance and pre-landfall times as criteria governing the decision to evacuate. \u2022 Pre-planned evacuation times vary widely by location. Most of these times were around 24 hours; however, many states required additional time for stronger storms. \u2022 Types of evacuation and terminology vary by state. Eight states have mandatory evacuations, seven states have voluntary evacuations, and only five states have recommended evacuations. \u2022 In every coastal state local emergency management agencies coordinate the movement of low mobility groups. The most common type of mass transit used during hurricane evacuations is the bus. Buses are planned for use in 12 of the 18 coastal states to transport low mobility groups. \u2022 Twelve of the 18 Atlantic and Gulf coast states plan to implement contraflow to increase capacity. Nine states plan to reverse all lanes for evacuation, two states plan to reverse one lane and only one state plans to reverse a shoulder lanes. \u2022 Southeastern states are more likely than New England states to implement contraflow operations during hurricane evacuations. \u2022 Governors have the authority to order the implementation of contraflow operations in eight states, two states give this authority to law enforcement officials, and only one state give authority to transportation officials. \u2022 There are no standars as to where to start or end contraflow operations. Beginning and termination points vary by location. \u2022 All 18 coastal states consider safety as the most important operational issue in the implementation of contraflow operations. \u2022 All 18 states agree that the most important consideration in any evacuation is to keep evacuees from being stranded on the highway. \u2022 All coastal states have plans to enhance existing and develop new ITS systems for use in hurricane evacuations. Fourteen of the 18 states use CCTV cameras, 15 states use VMS, 13 states use HAR, and 11 states use real-time or near real-time count stations. \u2022 Only three DOT websites include comprehensive hurricane evacuation related information. \u2022 Only one state is planning the implementation of contraflow operations for re-entry. \u2022 Evacuations remain politically sensitive issues; therefore, during the evacuation process many decisions are influenced by politicians who are not experts in the evacuation process. Although progress has been made, there is still a need to address specific transportation-related issues regarding hurricane evacuations. These include accommodating traffic through work zones, movement of low-mobility groups and the use of mass transportation during hurricane evacuations. Moreover, the need for public education on these practices and better exchange of information among local and state agencies also exist. Limited warning times hinder the evacuation process. Therefore, evacuation plans need to allow for flexibility. This is because when evacuation orders are issued to the public and last resort options call for implementation, many of the considerations written into plans undergo modifications. Even though this particular study focused on hurricane evacuations, many of the issues addressed in this study would be relevant to planning for mass evacuations for other hazards. This study could also be beneficial when updating evacuation plans and considering the implementation of new practices and procedures. In addition, this information can serve as a guide for transportation officials in other vulnerable areas around the World. 27. Does your state make any special provisions for notifying tourists and/or business travelers who may be unfamiliar with regional evacuation routes, procedures, etc.? YES / NO If so, briefly describe them."}]
