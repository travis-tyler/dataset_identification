Recently, research criteria have been proposed to identify AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by their biomarker status, referred to as prodromal AD by international working group-2 (IWG-2) (Dubois, et al., 2014) and MCI due to AD by the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) (Albert, et al., 2011) . It remains uncertain whether risk factors are associated with prodromal AD/ MCI due to AD, and whether they influence the rate of cognitive decline. This information could improve early diagnosis and lead to new targets for secondary prevention strategies.\nAmong the best-validated risk factors for AD are atherosclerosis, depression, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, lacunar infarcts, stroke, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption (Breteler, 2000; de Bruijn and Ikram, 2014; Deckers, et al., 2015) . Diabetes mellitus, depression, hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular diseases have also been associated with an increased risk of progressing from cognitively normal to MCI (Pankratz, et al., 2015; Roberts, et al., 2015) . Moreover, an association with cognitive decline has been found in both cognitively normal and MCI subjects (Jefferson, et al., 2015; Kaffashian, et al., 2013) .\nTherefore, we hypothesize that risk factors will occur more frequently in individuals with prodromal AD/MCI due to AD. We also expect that risk factors will increase the risk of progression to dementia."}, {"section_title": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "We aim to investigate the frequency of several risk factors in individuals with prodromal AD/MCI due to AD, classified according to the IWG-2 and NIA-AA criteria, relative to subjects who do not meet these criteria.

In the group without prodromal AD we found higher frequencies of depression (34% vs. 16%, p=0.009, FDR p=0.045) and obesity (17% vs. 8%, p=0.007, FDR p=0.045) compared to the group with prodromal AD (Supplemental Table 3 ).\nContrary to our hypothesis we found higher frequencies of depression, hypercholesterolemia and obesity, in the group without prodromal AD and in the low-AD-likelihood group. This suggests that subjects without prodromal AD or low-ADlikelihood had cognitive impairment due to other causes than AD, such as depression or vascular disorders (DeCarli, 2003; Gorelick, et al., 2011) . It is also possible that low cholesterol or low body mass index are risk factors for prodromal AD in this elderly sample. While obesity and hypercholesterolemia in middle age have been\nshown to be predictive for AD (Deckers, et al., 2015; Kivipelto, et al., 2005) , other studies showed that this association is reversed at older age, such that low body mass index and low cholesterol increase the risk for AD (Anstey, et al., 2008; Johnson, et al., 2006) . When we compared the frequencies observed in the current study to the prevalence of risk factors reported in meta-analyses and population-based cohort studies (Supplemental Table 6 ), we found that the frequencies of obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the high-AD-likelihood group were decreased, while frequencies were similar in subjects with a low-AD-likelihood. On the contrary, the frequency of depression in the high-AD-likelihood group was similar to that in the general population while it was higher in the low-AD-likelihood group compared to the population-based studies. This would suggest that the difference in frequencies of obesity and hypercholesterolemia between the low and high-AD-likelihood in our study results from a decrease of obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the high-ADlikelihood, rather than from an increase in the low-AD-likelihood. Conversely, the difference in frequency in depression between groups could result from an increase in frequency of depression in the low-AD-likelihood. This indicates that depression can be a possible cause of MCI in the studied population (DeCarli, 2003; Defrancesco, et al., 2009) . Clearly there are methodological differences in the inclusion of subjects, definition and method of ascertainment of risk factors and age range between the current study and the population based studies. Studies that directly compare frequency of risk factors in prodromal AD to cognitively normal subjects are needed to further clarify this."}, {"section_title": "Effect of risk factors on cognitive decline", "text": "In the total group of subjects with both amyloid and neuronal injury markers, alcohol use was associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline (HR=1.5, p=0.003, FDR Table 4 ).

Although this finding is in line with several previous studies (Deckers, et al., 2015; Jauhar, et al., 2014) that identified alcohol as a risk factor for cognitive decline, other studies have reported a protective or no relation to alcohol consumption with incident AD (Anstey, et al., 2009; Ruitenberg, et al., 2002) .\nThese conflicting results could be explained by differences in study population (MCI versus cognitively normal), definitions of alcohol consumption (dichotomous versus categories based on the amount of alcohol use) and the type of alcohol. When conversion to AD-type dementia was used as outcome instead of conversion to dementia or a decline on the MMSE, we found that the effect of alcohol was no longer significant.

Also, when comparing the effect of risk factors on cognitive decline we found similar outcomes when using the two sets of criteria. This shows that although the IWG-2 criteria only classify neuronal injury based on tau in CSF and the NIA-AA criteria also include other neuronal injury markers, this did not influence the results.\nAlthough the outcomes were similar for the two sets of criteria, the NIA-AA criteria provided more insight into which specific biomarker profile was associated with a higher frequency of a certain risk factor, which could be useful to give a more refined diagnosis and prognosis of early AD and age-related comorbidities."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations of the study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "Strengths of the study are the large sample size, the broad spectrum of assessed risk factors and longitudinal data on clinical outcome. There are also limitations to this study that should be mentioned. Some of the biomarker subgroups were small and some risk factors were only available in a subgroup or had a low frequency, which limited statistical power. The data used in this study was contributed by different centers and data was not collected using the same protocol. This might have led to variability, although it does reflect current clinical practice. Furthermore, the use of indirect measures (e.g. medical history) of risk factors could have introduced heterogeneity in classification. We were unable to study the potential interactions between risk factors, as not all centers contributed data on all risk factors. We had only limited data available on medication use, which did not allow us to control for this. Also, we could not correct for the duration and the severity of a risk factor, as we had no information on this. Although the mean follow-up was 2.3 years, some individuals likely would have shown cognitive decline at a later stage. Since these findings are based on clinical research populations, they may not be generalizable to other settings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we found that dementia risk factors were not associated with prodromal AD/MCI due to AD in subjects with MCI, and only alcohol increased the risk of cognitive decline, regardless of underlying pathology. Moreover, we found that a lower frequency of hypercholesterolemia or obesity may be indicative of early AD in an elderly population. Although our findings should be validated in future studies, Decline on MMSE at follow-up was defined as a difference of 3 points or more and was available in a subgroup of the samples: IWG-2 no prodromal AD n=237, prodromal AD n=223; NIA-AA M A N U S C R I P T "}]
