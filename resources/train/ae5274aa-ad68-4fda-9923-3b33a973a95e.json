The Carnegie Task Force on The Education of Young Adolescents (1989) recommends that schools proactively address the needs of these students through remedial instruction activities: Each middle school needs a plan for continuous correction to provide additional support for students needing more time, encouragement, or instruction to learn. This plan may require extending the school day, providing summer school or Saturday enrichment programs, specialized daily instruction, greater involvement of the home in learning activities, or combinations of these, depending upon a student's individual needs (p. 52.) This study examines the most common forms of remedial instruction in a national sample of schools that serve young adolescents. It considers differences in remedial activities in schools of different types, in different locations, and with different types of student populations. Further, the study uses measums of students' achievement in mathematics and reading to begin to address the question: \"Are the activities that are being implemented having positive effects on students?\" Recent research Epstein & Mac lifer, 1990) with a nationallyrepresentative sample of public middle grades schools has indicated that almost all public schools offer at least one remedial activity to students who fall behind. But schools vary greatly in the number of remedial programs that they offer and this variation is largely unassociated with grade organization, region, and family awl student nackground variables . Little data exist concerning the effects of different remedial instmction activities in the middle grades on students' outcomes. However, some limited evidence suggests that the practice of providing young adolescents who need extra help with an 1 extra subject period during the school day (e.g., instead of an elective or exploratory course) may be a particularly promising approach. This practice has some advantages compared to other more common remedial programs. Attendance is high because the elective period of academic instruction is part of the regular school day; it is not a pull-out program, so students do not miss regular academic instruction; and it does not stigmatize students because it is viewed as just another elective class to which students disperse. Also, principals in middle grades schools that use this approach to remedial instruction report lower expected dropout rates than do principals in comparable schools with comparable students when; this approach is not followed . In many schools, students have two or more periods for elective subjects, so students who receive extra help during one period are not excluded from exploring new subjects. In fact, previous research  indicates that public schools that use the extrasubject period approach to remediation have signricantly more extensive exploratory programs than do other public schools. In these schools, even though some students devote some of their \"elective time\" to catching up, substantially greater proportions of studena still receive the opportunity to explom traditional electives (e.g., foreign language and home economics) and take innovative minicourses in a variety of topics. Other potentially effective approaches to remediation include having adult tutors (Cooledge & Wurster, 1985;Wilks, T. J., & Clarke, V. A., 1988;Wasik & Slavin, 1990) or peer tutors (Devin-Sheehan, Feldman, & Allen, 1976;Palincsar, Brown, & Martin, 1987) work one-onone or one-on-two with students, especially if these tutors adapt the content and pace of instruction to the needs of individual students and if tutoring is provided in addition to regular classroom instruction and therefore adds to instructional time."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The analyses in this paper were made possible by merging data from the base year surveys of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (Ingels, Abraham, Rasinski, Karr, Spencer, & Frankel, 1990) and the Hopkins Enhancement Survey of NELS:88 Middle Grades Practices (Epstein, McPartland, & Mac Iver, 1991 In the end, usable data were obtained by mail from 826 schools and by telephone from 182 schools, for a participation rate of 98% of the eligible schools.

The most common remedial activities are extra work or homework (in 56% of the schools that contain 8th-graders), pull-out programs in reading or English (50%), after-or before-school coaching classes (46%), peer tutoring (45%), pull-out programs in math (43%), and summer school (41%). Schools are less likely to offer students adult tutors to work with them one-onone (35% in Math, 34% in English) or an extra subject period in lieu of an elective or exploratory course (17%), and rarely offer remediation through mentoring programs (6%) or Saturday classes (3%)."}, {"section_title": "Antecedents of Remedial Activities", "text": "Linear probability analyses using Goldberger's (1964) weighted least squares (WLS) approach were performed to identify significant antecedents of offering remedial activities of different types.

Other regional differences include: (a) schools iii the Northeast are slightly less likely than schoda in other regions to offer Saturday classes, (b) after-school or before-school classes, peertutoring, and summer school programs are more common in the West than in other regions, 2nd (c) use of adults to provide one-on-one tutoring is significantly more common in the Western and North Central states than in the Northeast."}, {"section_title": "Urbanicity", "text": "After-or before-school classes are more common in urban areas than in other settings, perhaps because the greater availability of public transportation in urban areas allows students to travel more easily to or from school before or after the regular school buses have departed.

The exception is summer school. Allminority schools are 35% more likely than allwhite schools with similar socio-economic and ability profiles to offer a temedial summer school. Perhaps because schools that serve higher concentrations of students living in poverty are more likely to receive federal and state compensatory education funds, these schools are mote likely to offer pull-out programs. Summer school programs --which are not common in compensatory education (Means, Schlager, & Knapp, 1990) --are less likely in sthools that have higher percentages of students living in poverty. On the other hand, schools that have high proportions of students living in poverty are more likely than other schools to adopt peer tutoring plans. Ironically, after taking account of the effects of other antecedents, the likelihood of finding pullout programs, after-school programs, summer school, and adult reading tutors in a school is higher when the average ability of students upon entry to the school is higher. For example, pullout programs in reading or English are 16% more likely in schools where the average entering ability of students is at the national norm than in schools where it is considerably below the national norm. These findings mplicate earlier results with a national sample of public schools that serve seventh-graders (Mac Iver & Epstein, in press)."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Remedial Activities on the Achievement of Public School Students", "text": "Because most educationally disadvan:aged students attend public schools (and because of the difficulty of adequately controlling for sector differences in students' characteristics), the analyses in this section include data from the public sector only."}, {"section_title": "Math Achievement", "text": "To estimate the benefits of different types of remedial activities on students' achievement in math, one must first identify the students who are receiving remedial help. The NELS:88 student questionnaire asked students to indicate whether they attend \"a remedial math class at least once a week.\" Students who answer this question affirmatively ate almost certainly participating in at least one of their school's remedial programs. The analyses presented in this section focus on these students only. For each remedial activity, we estimated the effect on students' math achievement test scores of being in a school that offemd that activity. These estimates were obtained after controlling for five other school characteristics (% minority students in the school, % free lunch students, grade organization, urbanicity, and region) and six student characteristics (socio-economic status, past math grades, past participation in handicap program, current participation in handicap program, sex, and race.) None of the other remedial programs included in the survey are significantly associated with the math achievement scores of thesc studcnts. Thus, there is no evidence that pull-out programs in math, peer-tutoring, after-school classes, or mentoring programs, as typically implemented, are producing positive benefits for students in the target population studied here (e.g., students who mport attending a remedial math class once a week.) The null results found for these types of remedial activities replicate even if a broader definition of the target population is used (e.g., if the analysis is conducted using all students with poor past math grades tegardless of whethcr or not they report attending a remedial math class). Insert Table 3 about here The student-level regression analysis reported in Table 3 ignores the multilevel nature of the NELS:88 data and the dependence among students' responses in the same school. Therefore, a follow-up analysis was conducted using a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to take account of the multilevel data structure and to combine individual-and group-level analyses into a single apptopriate analytic model. At level-1, the units were students and each student's math achievement was represented as a function of two individual characteristics (i.e., L;ocio-economic status and past math gradcs). At level-2, the units were schools, and the school's adjusted mean on the mathematics achievement tcst for students who attend remedial math was the outcome variable hypothesized to depend on specific school characteristics (percentage of freelunch students, percentage of minority students, region) and remedial offerings. In order to obtain estimates, it was necessary to use fewei controls in the HLM model than in the earlier regression model. One reason is that the level-1 model is estimated within each school and few students within each school's sample f111 in our target population (i.e., on average, only about 2 out of the 24 studcnts in each school's sample indicated that they attended remedial math classes). Table 4 reports HLM estimates of the effects of offering extra-subject period classes, Saturday classes, summer school, and adult one-to-one tutoring on the adjusted mean math achievement of students who report attending remedial math. The results closely parallel the OLS results presented earlier and suggest that each of these four types of remedial activities is associated with better student achiever tnt in mathematics. In the HLM analyses, the estimated benefits of Saturday classes are somewhat smaller than those obtained earlier and the estimated benefits of summcr classes arc somewhat larger. As was true in the OLS analysis, additional HLM models testing the benefits of other remedial activities (e.g., pull-out programs in math or after-school classes) yielded no evidence that these other approaches to remediation were predictive of achievement in this subpopulation of students. Insert Table 4 about here Sebols differ in the numbcr of effective remedial programs that they offer to help students catch up in mathematics. A composite variable was created measuring the number of those remedial programs listed in Table 4 that schools' offered to their eighth-graders. An HLM analysis (controlling for the same between-and within-school variables listed in the note to Table 4) was performed to estimate the effect of the number of effective mmedial programs offered on the math achievement of public school eighth-graders who attend remedial math. The results indicated that schools with extensive programs obtained substantially better math achievement than did schools with limited or non-existent remedial programs (GAMMA = 1.00, p < .0005). For example, in a school offering all four of the. remedial programs listed in Table 4, the math achievement of target students is predicted to be over two-fifths of a standard deviation higher than in a school offering only one of these programs."}, {"section_title": "Reading Achievement", "text": "The NELS:88 student questionnaire did not ask students to describe their past performance in reading or to indicate whether they regularly receive extra help with reading. Students were asked, however, to indicate their past English grades and to report whether they attend a remedial English class at least once a week. Students who have past English grades of mostly C's or worse and students who attend remedial English classes are quite likely to be among the main recipients of schools' remedial program services in reading and language arts. The analyses reported in this section include data from these \"targeted\" students only. For each remedial activity, we estimated the effect of being in a school that offered that activity on the reading achievement of targeted students. Table 5 reports both OLS and HLM estimates. The estimates s;:ggest that extra subject periods, summer classes, and pull-out programs in reading or English are all effective in raising the average reading achievement levels of these students. The effects are modest in size, but this is not surprising because they are \"lower bound\" estimates.1 The positive effect on reading achievement associated with being in a school which offers after-or before-school coaching classes was significant in the student-level OLS analysis but not in the multi-level HLM analysis. Insert Table 5 about here One final HLM model examined how the reading achievement of target students was associated with the extensiveness of a school's remedial activities (after controlling for the same betweenschool and within-school variables as the HLM analysis in Table 5). In this model, the number of remedial practices from Schools that offered more extensive remedial programs obtained better reading achievement from these studcnts than did other schools (GAMMA = .57, p < 0005). For example, in a school offering all four of the remedial programs, the reading achievement of target students is predicted to be almost one-fifth of a standard deviation higher than in a school offering only one of these programs."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our analyses provide a national description of remedial instruction activities in middle grades and identify activities that am predictive of Overall, the results suggest that several remedial activities that schools sometimes offer raise the achievement levels of public middle grades students who are struggling in math or reading. For example, the results suggest that by offering extra subject periods or summer classes, schools can increase students' achievemlint in math and reading. Both of these approaches to remediation guarantee that students who need extra help receive a substantial \"extra dose\" of instruction in areas in which they are struggling. In addition, the provision of Saturday classes and adult tutors was related to higher mathematics achievement, and the implementation of pull-out programs in reading or English was associated with higher reading achievement. Programs that offered a variety of reraecHal activities were more effective than were programs that offered d less extensive set of activities. On the other hand, certain activities --such as peer-tutoring, mentoring programs, and after-or before-school coaching classes --were not reliably effective in increasing student achievement. As typically implemented, these approaches may not be helping enough students who have fallen behind to make significant strides toward catching up to their peers. Schools whose current programs include only these approaches to remediation might consider additional activities that provide more expert help in larger doses to larger numbers of students. Some evidence suggests that pull-out programs and tutoring programs are, on average, somewhat less effective than the extra-subject period approach to remediation. Some of the apparent advantages of the extra-subject period approach to these more common approaches have already been mentioned. In addition, the extra subject period approach may be more cost-effective than pull-out and tutoring approaches because it is able to serve a greater number of students without requiring any additional staff or volunteers. A middle school that currently offers elective and exploratory courses to all students can institute a meaningful extra-subject period program that can serve 150 or more students by hiring one fewer elective-subject teacher and one more academicsubject teacher than in the past. Whereas the typical pull-out program or one-on-one tutoring program serves only between 15% to 17% of a school's eighth-graders, the typical extra-subject period program serves almost 30% of a school's eighth-graders. Perhaps the most obvious limitation of this study (and of other studies examining naturallyoccurring associations between instructional offerings and students' outcomes) is that some of the observed relations may be spurious. Although the analyses controlled for a reasonable set of the most obvious \"confounding variables,\" other importatti variables may have been ignored. Thus, the conclusions presented here must be viewed as tentative, rather than as definitive. The conclusions should be seen as working hypotheses to be further tested. Another limitation of the current study is that the level of detail obtained fram principals concerning their schools' remedial practices was fairly shallow. For example, the measures allow us to distinguish schools who use any variety of an extra-subject period approach from schools who do not offer extra subject periods, but the measures do not allow distinctions between schools with different types of extra-subject programs. Thus, schools that provide intensive help during the extra subject period are lumped together with schools that provide little direct instruction during the extra subject period (e.g., schools in which the period is more like a \"study hall\" than an extra dose of academic instruction). The benefits of having extra-subject periods of intensive, well-organized instruction are undoubtedly larger than the \"average benefits\" of generic extra-subject periods. Future research needs to examine the variation across schools in how the major types of remedial programs are implemented, in order to find out whether there is significant variation between schools in how pull-out, after-school, and tutoring programs 'ire organized and whether this variation is associated with students' outcomes. For example, although math pull-outs were not generally effective in increasing students' math achievement, it may be that some schools have developed an effective version of this approach. Schools need additional and more detailed information than is currently available to guide their efforts at identifying, developing, and evaluating effective programs for middle grades students who have fallen behind. Such information will help our nation's schools to equip a greater proportion of young adolescents with lir knowledge and skills that they need to succeed as effective learners, workers, and citizens.
