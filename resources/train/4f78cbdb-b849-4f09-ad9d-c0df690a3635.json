[{"section_title": "", "text": "The relationship between teenage childbearing and young women's educational and occupational attainment has been well established. In general, young women who give birth as teenagers are less likely to complete high school than women who delay childbearing until their 20s (Mott and Marsiglio 1985), regardless of a teenage mother's marital status (Teti and Lamb 1989). This Statistics in Brief describes the parental and marital experiences of the female members of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort (those females who were eighth-graders in 1998) as of 1994; it also describes their high school completion rates, as well as the timing of first births and first marriages in relation to June 1992, when most of this cohort should have completed high school. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS :88), a nationally representative sample of 1988 eighth-graders who were followed up 2 years later in 1990 and again in 1992 and 1994, provides an opportunity to consider how motherhood and marriage were related to the educational attainment of the 1988 eighth-grade females. Findings include the following: By June of 1992, when this cohort of female students was scheduled to complete high school, 11 percent had given birth to at least one child and 5 percent had been married at least once (table 2). Being an unwed mother before scheduled graduation was more detrimental to eventual high school completion than getting married before graduation-58 percent of females who had a child before June 1992 but never married had completed by 1994, compared with $4 percent who had married before scheduled graduation but did not have children (table 3). Approximately 95 percent of females who were neither married nor had children by 1994 (2 years after scheduled graduation) had completed high school by 1994 (table 3) and 14 percent had been married at least once. Furthermore, 11 percent of all 1988 eighth-grade females had their first child before June 1992, when this cohort of eighth-graders was scheduled to complete high school. In contrast, 5 percent had been married at least once by June of 1992. About 7 percent had children before June of 1992 and had not married by 1994, while less than 1 percent married before June 1992 and not had any children before 1994. About 3 percent married and had children before June of 1992. Some 38 percent of females who had a child by 1994 were also married by 1994 (38 percent or 8.3/21.8 in table 1). One advantage of NELS:88 over previous longitudinal studies are the relatively large samples of Asians and Hispanics. Past research on this topic has generally been confined to racialethnic comparisons between blacks and whites; however, interesting patterns among racialethnic groups emerged from these data. The samples of non-white racialethnic groups are still too small to give reliable estimates for combined marriage and childbearing separately for each group. Therefore, the following analysis examines the characteristics of marriage and childbearing separately for these groups. For example, table 2 displays the parental and marital experiences of female members of the eighth-grade class of 1988 by various demographic characteristics. Asian eighth-grade females were least likely among all racialethnic groups to have had a child by 1994, with 9 percent having had at least one child (table 2). Moreover, white eighthgrade females were less likely than their Hispanic and black counterparts to have had a child (17 percent compared with 34 and 39 percent, respectively). Examining first marriages, however, reveals a different pattern. By 1994, 7 percent or fewer of both Asian and black 1988 eighthgrade females had been married at least once, compared with 20 percent of Hispanics and 15 percent of whites. The likelihood of 1988 eighth-grade females having at least one child or marrying at least once by 1994 was also related to family socioeconomic status (SES). Ninety-three percent of females from families with high SES had not given birth to a child by 1994, compared with 81 percent from middle SES families and 63 percent from low SES families. Likewise, 94 percent of females from high SES backgrounds had never married, compared with 85 percent of those with middle SES and 79 percent with low SES. Future research should examine whether these students became pregnant after they dropped out or whether they dropped out following their pregnancies. The purpose of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 is to collect trend data on students, dropouts, parents, teachers, and schools. The 1988 sample consisted of more than 24,000 eighth-grade students and more than 1,000 eighth-grade schools. For a detailed description of NELS:88, see Ingels et al. (1994)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis sample", "text": "The results of this report can be generalized to the female members of the eighth-grade cohort of 1988. These students were identified with the variable F3SEX, and the analysis was performed using a final unweighted sample of 7,286. Of this total, 1,012 (312 prior to June 1992) had given birth and 1,399 (683 prior to June 1992) had been married by the spring of 1994. In addition, 600 (221 prior to June 1992) had both given birth and were married by the spring of 1994. Although included in the totals, American Indians/Alaskan Natives were excluded from the racialethnic analysis because the sample size was too small for reliable estimates. Data were weighted with F3QWTG8."}, {"section_title": "Variables Used in the Analysis", "text": "The student background variables used in this analysis include F3RACE (student racialethnic identification); G8URBN (urbanicity); G8REGON (region); and BYSESQ (family SES). To produce three categories of SES, the two middle quartiles of BYSESQ were' collapsed into one category to be identified as \"Middle SES.\" The variable F3CHLLDT was used to identify those students who had given birth to at least one child. This derived variable contains the date of birth for the respondent's first child. It also identifies those who had at least one child, but the child's birthdate was unknown. Finally, it identifies those who did not have any children. A respondent was considered to have had at least one child if she had a valid birthdate for this child, or if she was identified as having a child, but the birthdate was missing. To understand first marriage patterns, the variable F3MARDT was used. For the purpose of this report, respondents were considered to have been married at least once if they had a valid marriage date, or if they were identified as having been married, but the date of marriage was missing. High school completion status was measured with the variable F3DIPLOM. For the purpose of this report, \"Received GED\" and \"Received Certificate\" were combined with \"Received a Diploma\" into one category to describe those who had completed high school as of 1994."}, {"section_title": "Statistical procedures", "text": "All comparisons discussed in the text of this report have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences did not occur by chance.
