Together these analyses demonstrate that longitudinal rs-fcMRI using TBR can capture disease-relevant network disruption in a clinical population.\nIntroduction: Network sensitive imaging techniques, especially resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), have become increasingly important tools to investigate the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), initial reports of decreased default network connectivity in sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD) have been replicated across a wide spectrum of impairment (Buckner et al., , 2008 Greicius, 2013; Greicius et al., 2003; Hedden et al., 2009; Seeley et al., 2009; Sorg et al., 2007; Sperling et al., 2009; Supekar et al., 2008) . In addition to LOAD, decreased default network connectivity has also been well-described in early onset AD (EOAD; (Lehmann et al., 2013) ) and genetically-driven, autosomal dominant AD (ADAD; (Chhatwal et al., 2018b (Chhatwal et al., , 2013 Thomas et al., 2014) . More recent studies that examine multiple networks in the same sample suggest that the degradation of the default network across the spectrum of AD is accompanied by decreased connectivity in a subset of other networks, particularly the salience, dorsal attention, and control networks (Chhatwal et al., 2018b; Thomas et al., 2014) , and that the variation in clinical presentation in AD corresponds to variations in networks targeted by the disease process (Lehmann et al., , 2013 Ossenkoppele et al., 2015) . Importantly, several reports have closely linked connectivity in AD-targeted networks to memory performance (Chhatwal et al., 2018a; Fjell et al., 2016 Fjell et al., , 2015 Gilmore et al., 2015; Salami et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2015; Staffaroni et al., 2018; Ward et al., 2014) , suggesting that rs-fcMRI may provide an intermediate measure linking AD pathology to cognitive decline. However, despite relatively consistent findings of altered rs-fcMRI in AD using multiple analytic methods and cohorts, the development of rs-fcMRI metrics as usable biomarkers in clinical and translational research settings has been slowed by difficulties with measurement reliability and longitudinal rs-fcMRI analysis. Owing to a variety of analytic and technical obstacles, reports of longitudinal fcMRI have been fairly few in number, with many focusing on age-related longitudinal change (Fjell et al., 2015; Ng et al., 2016; Persson et al., 2014; Salami et al., 2016; Staffaroni et al., 2018) . With respect to AD, longitudinal reports of rs-fcMRI changes over time (Deng et al., 2016; Hafkemeijer et al., 2017; Serra et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2012; Zhan et al., 2016) have not specifically assessed how the presence and amount of \u03b2-amyloid (A\uf062) pathology relate to longitudinal network degradation, an omission which is particularly problematic given that elevated A\uf062 is one of the defining neuropathologic features of AD. In the present report, we begin to address these issues by leveraging a sample of mildly-impaired older adults followed with longitudinal rs-fcMRI and with available amyloid PET to assess fibrillar A\uf062 burden. This clinically relevant group has been followed closely with longitudinal cognitive measures; Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), as well as structural MRI, allowing us to place rs-fcMRI changes in the context of commonly used clinical measures and imaging biomarkers. This cohort (N=24) has the additional advantage that rs-fcMRI was assessed on a relatively frequent basis during longitudinal follow-up, with the median participant having 5 available rs-fcMRI sessions over approximately 3 years of follow-up.\nWe utilize template based rotation (TBR) and the network templates derived from Chhatwal et al., 2018a Chhatwal et al., , 2018b Schultz et al., 2017 Schultz et al., , 2014 Shaw et al., 2015) , in which we have previously demonstrated: cross-sectional relationships between functional connectivity in cognitive networks and cognitive performance Chhatwal et al., 2018a Chhatwal et al., , 2018b Shaw et al., 2015) ; an association between baseline rs-fcMRI and longitudinal decline on the preclinical Alzheimer's disease cognitive composite (PACC), particularly in high A\uf062 individuals ; AD specific profiles of network disruption (Chhatwal et al., 2018b) ; crosssectional relationships to A\uf062 and tau pathology in cognitively normal elderly Chhatwal et al., 2018a Chhatwal et al., , 2018b Schultz et al., 2017 Schultz et al., , 2014 Shaw et al., 2015) ; and sensitivity to manipulation of the cholinergic system with scopolamine, including a strong relationships between change in rs-fcMRI and subsequent changes to mnemonic memory performance (Chhatwal et al., 2018a) . In addition to the standard network descriptions from Schultz et al. (2014) , which include an anti-correlated default mode and salience networks, we also include new template maps for independent default mode and salience networks.\nUsing this densely-sampled cohort, we test for difference in longitudinal rs-fcMRI change between low and high A\uf062 subjects. We then compare the fcMRI results to MMSE and hippocampal volume in order to compare the size and independence of the rs-fcMRI effects. To be included in this study, participants were required to possess at least four rs -fcMRI scans (one completed four scans, twelve completed five scans, three completed six scans, and eight completed seven scans; median = 5 scans) over a period of approximately 3 years. The mean followup period was 2.75 years (\u00b15 months, minimum = 1.6 years, maximum = 3.2 years) for a total of 138 observations across the 24 participants. MRI scans were obtained at baseline, 3 -months, 6-months, 12-months, 18-months, 24 months, and 36 months, though resting state fMRI data was not collected at every session. For the sample being used here, we have 15 baseline observations, 20 at 3 -months, 16 at 6-months, 24 at 1 year, 23 at 18-months, 19 at 24 months, and 20 at 36 months (see Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "For subjects without an fcMRI measure at baseline, the zero time was set as the first resting state fMRI scan.\nAdditionally all 24 participants were required to demonstrate clinically-significant cognitive impairment during the study period. None of the participants were clinically demented at baseline, and met ADNI criteria for MCI at the first instance of CDR 0.5. Accordingly, participants were required to have a baseline global CDR of 0.5 (N=22) or have progressed to a global CDR of 0.5 (N=2) by the end of the study. These 24 subjects were then stratified according to their level of A\uf062 burden using previously published PiB-PET thresholds (see below). Using this approach, 12 participants were categorized as low-A\uf062 and 12 as high-A\uf062. Six of the subjects were APOE \u03b54 carriers, 11 were \u03b54 negative, and 7 did not receive APOE genotyping. Baseline demographics, including breakdowns by A\uf062 status can be found in Table 1 .\n[ Table 1 and Figure 1 All resting state data were processed using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Each run was slice-time corrected, followed by a single realignment and coregistration across all timepoints, where each volume was realigned to the first volume of each run, then realigned to the first session.\nThis was followed by a second pass realignment to the mean EPI image across all sessions. The meanacross-time EPI image was then directly normalized to MNI space using the SPM12 unified segmentation and normalization routine (Calhoun et al., 2017) and then applied to the data. Spatial normalization to template space was followed by spatial smoothing with a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, followed by removal of temporal frequencies below 0.08 Hz, and temporal z-scoring of each time course.\nFunctional connectivity measurements were made using Template Based Rotation (TBR - ). Briefly, TBR works by mapping variance from a given subject's fMRI run to a set of a priori template maps. Template maps are derived from a large outside sample. The process produces a least squares fit to the template maps via a weighted linear summation of functional volumes. The weights associated with each functional volume can be interpreted as a time series that best recapitulates the spatial pattern in the templates. Full details can be found in Schultz, et al., 2014. Measures were derived for the following cognitive networks: normalization. This resulted in separate components for the DMN and SAL (see Schultz et al., 2014 for details about row-based normalization and the derivation of the template maps). Figure 2 shows the separate DMN and SAL templates as well as the combined DMN/SAL template used for the main analyses. The addition of these two additional templates allows us to more directly assess differences between DMN and SAL networks relative to a unitary DMN/SAL network axis. Detailed depictions of the other template maps can be found in Chhatwal et al., 2018) .\nTemplate maps and relevant code for TBR are publicly available at mrtools.mgh.harvard.edu. TBR connectivity measures for each session and each network were calculated by using a spatial correlation to compute the similarity of the connectivity map from each fcMRI session to the template map. One time-point from one subject was dropped due to abnormally low connectivity measures, both with respect to the subject and with respect to the sample as a whole. Manual inspection of the scan revealed notable spatial artifacts.\n[ Figure 2 about here]\nAs with spatial group independent component analysis (ICA), when using TBR there is no explicit requirement to clean data (Power et al., 2014 ) (e.g. motion correction, data scrubbing, nuisance regression) in advance of analysis . ICA can be written in matrix algebra as IC = X\u2022M where IC is the independent components (m-voxels by n-components), M is the unmixing matrix (m-volumes by n-components), and X is the empirical data (m-voxels by n-volumes). Starting with only X, M must be discovered which then provides IC. If IC is already known, then the derivation of M is a straightforward algebraic problem that can be solved as M = X -1 \u2022IC, which is precisely the TBR formulation (where X -1 is the pseudo-inverse of the matrix X). The only assumption is that a given IC, derived on an independent dataset, is a sufficiently close approximation to a true source in X, and is independent of nuisance variance sources. This provides TBR with an implicit ability to perform blind source/signal separation even when not explicitly modeling all sources. Additionally, prior work strongly suggests that nearly all approaches to cleaning fMRI data result in lower measurement reliability (Shirer et al., 2015) , a potentially critical problem in longitudinal analyses. Given the focus here on longitudinal change in fcMRI measures and the inherent source/signal separability of TBR, we minimized data cleaning as much as possible to avoid diminished measurement reliability as a source of spurious within-subject variability across time.\nPET Imaging. Acquisition of 11 C Pittsburgh Compound B PET data has previously been described in detail (Becker et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2007; Sperling et al., 2009 ). In brief, PiB PET images were acquired with an 8.5 to 15 mCi bolus injection followed by a 60-minute dynamic acquisition in 69 volumes (12x15 seconds, 57x60 seconds). PET data were reconstructed, attenua tion corrected, scatter corrected, and evaluated for excessive head motion. Data from the first 8 minutes post injection was used to co-register the data to the T1 image for each subject using a 6 DoF rigid body registration. A summary distribution volume ratio (DVR) computed with Logan plotting was derived from a target region composed of frontal, lateral and retrosplenial tracer uptake (FLR) and a cerebellar grey reference region. The regions comprising the FLR are known to show elevated PiB binding in AD dementia patients (8). The cutoff of PiB FLR DVR>1.186 for A\u03b2 positivity was derived on a reference sample using Gaussian mixture modeling as previously described (Mormino et al., 2014a (Mormino et al., , 2014b .\nClinical measures. The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) and CDR (Morris, 1993) were obtained annually at baseline, 12-months, 24 months, and 36 months. Due to missing observations relative the MRI acquisitions, intermediate measures for MMSE were temporally imputed to align with MRI data.\nWithin subject temporal imputation utilized resampling with a shape preserving piecewise cubic spline interpolation.\nAnalyses. Analyses were performed using linear mixed effects (LME) models using the fitlme routine in the MATLAB 2018b statistics package using default settings. Subject level random effects for both intercept (subject) and slope (time) were included in all LME models. Models were constructed to ascertain the relationship of baseline A\u03b2 to longitudinal change in rs-fcMRI networks. The primary effect of interest was the PiB\u2022time interaction term. We chose to use PiB-PET as a continuous measure rather than dichotomizing, and time was based on the dates of the the MRI acquisitions with 0-time set as the first rs-fcMRI scan. To control for spurious and confounding effects we included between-subjects covariates for age, sex, and years of education, including interactions with time. We also included time-varying estimates of subject motion, time-varying cortical gray matter volume, and time-varying intracranial volume to correct for variability in the FreeSurfer recons, gross differences in head size, and cortical atrophy. Subject motion was computed as the average framewise displacement across the function run. To achieve this we computed the Euclidean distance between each frames origin as estimate by the realignment procedures, and then computed the average distance moved between frames. Due to between subject distributions of motion tending towards positive skew, these measures were log-transformed to generate normal distributions.\nOur dependent variables included multiple fcMRI networks including the default mode with anticorrelated salience network (DMN/SAL), DMN, SAL, the dorsal attention (DAN), left and right frontoparietal control networks (rFPCN and lFPCN), primary visual (VIS), and motor (MOT) networks. To help contextualize the results, and to investigate whether fcMRI signal was capturing a unique channel of information, we also performed analyses using longitudinal hippocampal volume (HV), and longitudinal MMSE. Raw data plots (as a functional of age) depicting the data being modeled are shown in Figure 3 for the DMN/SAL ( Figure 3A) , DMN ( Figure 3B ), MMSE ( Figure   3C ), and HV ( Figure 3D ).\n[ Figure 3 about here]"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effect of AB on longitudinal change in fcMRI network strength.", "text": "The only network to show a significant PiB\u2022Time effect was the DMN/SAL network where we observed that higher PiB-PET signal is associated with a greater rate of decline in DMN/SAL network coherence (t(125) = -3.15 p=0.002; Figure 5A ), indicating that the DMN and SAL networks are becoming less coordinated and more orthogonal. Left and Right FPCN both showed trend level effects (lFPCN: t(125) = -1.89, p = 0.063. rFPCN: t(125) = -1.65, p=0.102). Neither the DMN alone (t(125) = -1.02 p=0.310; Figure 5B) nor SAL alone templates (t(125) = -1.25, p=0.213) showed a significant effect on their own, suggesting that incorporating the strength of inter-network connections between the DMN and SAL improves the ability to detect change along an AD trajectory. Standardized beta estimates with error bars for all dependent variables are shown in Figure 4 .\n[ Figure 4 about here]"}, {"section_title": "Effect of AB on longitudinal change on MMSE and Hippocampal Volume.", "text": "To contextualize the size of the DMN/SAL effect, we also ran the same model using an established AD clinical measure, the MMSE, and an established imaging marker of AD neurodegeneration, hippocampal volume ( Figure 4) .

These values correspond to a Cohen's D of 0.56 for DMN/SAL, 0.46 for MMSE, and 0.62 for hippocampal volume, where .2 is considered a small effect, .5 a medium effect, and .8 a large effect.\n[ Figure 5 about here]"}, {"section_title": "Does longitudinal variance in DMN/SAL fcMRI overlap with MMSE or HV?", "text": "To address this question we re-ran the longitudinal LME from above with DMN/SAL fcMRI as the dependent variable and then added time-varying MMSE and HV as covariates in the model.

Due to concerns with nuisance variance", "text": "and confounding factors we took a conservative approach to controlling for potentially confounding sources of variance. The models utilized here included time-varying motion, time varying cortical volume, and time varying intracranial volume. Additionally, we controlled for between subject variance in age, sex, and education (including interactions with time). As such we also wanted to report results from the simplified model: DMN ~ PiB\u2022Time + (Time|Subject). As expected without the addi tional covariates the PiB\u2022Time effect was more robust (t(134) = 4.02, p < 0.001, D=0.69)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We observed that progressive degradation of the coordinated Default-Salience network axis over a three-year period distinguished high from low A\uf062 clinically impaired individuals during longitudinal follow-up. Further, we observed that DMN/SAL network measurements which incorporate both within and between network connectivity were superior to measures that only assessed within-network change in the DMN or SAL. No other network showed a significant relationship between A\uf062 burden and longitudinal change of functional connectivity. The effect of A\uf062 burden on longitudinal change of DMN/SAL network coherence was similar in effect size to change in hippocampal volume and MMSE, and the DMN/SAL effect was nearly fully independent of change on both the MMSE and hippocampal volume. This suggests that DMN/SAL rs-fcMRI is capturing a unique channel of information regarding AD progression that is not reflected in hippocampal volume or MMSE.\nOf the prior reports on longitudinal rs-fcMRI, our results are most comparable with Zhan et al., 2016, where inter-network correlation between the DMN and SAL was disrupted, particularly in the early MCI cohort. The significant PiB\u2022Time effect for the DMN/SAL is also consistent with prior reports using this DMN/SAL network template Chhatwal et al., 2018a Chhatwal et al., , 2018b Schultz et al., 2017 Schultz et al., , 2014 Shaw et al., 2015) . Though more work is needed to further develop maximally sensitive connectivity metrics, these results are promising for fcMRI as a longitudinal marker. This is especially intriguing given that many current and upcoming clinical trials are collecting resting state fMRI data for use as an exploratory secondary outcome measure, providing fertile ground for further development of fcMRI as an AD biomarker.\nThe results presented and best understood in the context of several important limitations. First, these results are from an early symptomatic cohort; it remains to be seen whether these results will translate to earlier preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Second the sample size is relatively small, consisting of 24 subjects. Accordingly, the observed effect sizes should be interpreted with caution and replication in other samples will be important to confirm these results. It should also be noted the small sample size is compensated by an average of 5 observations over approximately three years. This dense sampling makes this a unique cohort relative to most currently published reports on longitudinal functional connectivity. Third, prior work strongly suggests that tau pathologic burden may be more tightly correlated with cognitive impairment as compared to A\uf062 burden. The lack of tau-PET imaging in the sample studied here leaves open several questions regarding the link between tau pathology and change in the DMN/SAL fcMRI that will need to be addressed in future studies.\nWe find these results encouraging for the use of fcMRI as a longitudinal measure of amyloid related pathological change. While rs-fcMRI is not without flaws, it remains a powerful technique for observing and measuring brain function in-vivo, provides a good balance of spatial and temporal resolution, uses no ionizing radiation, and is relatively low cost. This is especially true in the context of clinical trials where MRI is needed for safety monitoring, and structural MRI is used for processing of other modalities such as PET imaging. The addition of rs-fcMRI adds very little additional subject burden and is being acquired in many current and upcoming clinical trials. Although rs-fcMRI has shown promise as a functional brain measure, it has yet to fulfill its potential as a clinically useful measure for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This is largely due to relatively poor measurement reliability which is a product of both the high degree of dynamicity inherent to fMRI, coupled with multiple sources of nuisance variance and measurement noise. Our findings support the further development of rs-fcMRI as an AD biomarker and, more broadly, suggests that rs-fcMRI may be usable as an exploratory outcome measure in neuropsychiatric disease clinical and translational research.
