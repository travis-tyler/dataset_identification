Traditionally, agriculture used energy both directly in the form of fuel and electricity and indirectly through use of energy-intensive inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. However, record-high energy prices and expanding biofuel policies have substantially increased the demand for agricultural products as renewable fuel feedstocks since the mid-2000s. As of 2012, corn-based ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel supplied almost 6 percent of U.S. transportation fuels, consuming 42 and 1 percent of U.S. corn and soybean production, respectively. Corn used for ethanol does generate a co-product, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), which is sold into the market as livestock feed.\nEven so, changing market economics and policies have brought about higher agricultural commodity prices and have increased the costs of agricultural production.

Consequently, changes in energy prices can greatly affect all facets of the economy, including the agriculture sector. Agricultural producers purchase energy inputs, such as fuel and electricity (referred to as direct energy inputs), as well as energyintensive inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Because the energy products from which these agricultural inputs are produced are oil and natural gas, we focus first on the price history for these energy sources, particularly over the 2001-2012 time period. is largely attributed to a combination of falling U.S. oil production, rising global demand, and increased speculation in financial markets (Hamilton, 2009) ."}, {"section_title": "Energy Price Changes", "text": "Energy price volatility also increased as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) (see box, \"The Importance of Volatility\"). The CV for oil prices was 0.39 for 2001-2012, versus 0.21 for 1991-2000 . Volatility in natural gas prices (in real terms) also increased from 2001-2012 ( fig. 1) , although by 2012, natural gas prices had returned to early 2000 levels. The overall decrease in natural gas prices since 2010 is largely a result of greater supply, mainly due to improved extraction technologies such as hydraulic fracking. Natural gas represents approximately 70 percent of the cost in manufacturing fertilizer (Gellings and Parmenter, 2004) , so the price trends tend to be parallel for natural gas ( fig. 1 ) and fertilizer ( fig. 2 ). The fertilizer price index (base year = 1990-92) increased from 135 in January 2001 to 253 in December 2007, and peaked in September 2008 (at 479). Although both natural gas and fertilizer prices have since declined, unlike natural gas prices, fertilizer prices did not fall back to their 2001 levels, partly due to high U.S. and global demand for fertilizer (Schnitkey, 2011) coupled with production constraints that limited expansion of U.S. fertilizer production as natural gas prices fell.\nVolatility refers to the movement of a series away from its average. Volatility is high if the price moves up and/or down frequently or by a large amount. Volatility is low if prices remain stable over time. One measure of volatility is the coefficient of variation (CV), which is constructed by dividing the standard deviation of a series by the average of the series-a larger CV indicates a larger distribution in prices. The CV is also a useful measure when comparing variation in one series to another. Volatile prices affect farmers due to the risk and uncertainty they introduce into production expenses and commodity prices. Electricity is the other main direct energy input used by agricultural producers. Figure 3 shows the inflation-adjusted annual national average retail price for both residential and commercial sectors-the two sectors most relevant for agricultural operations. Retail electricity prices vary little in the short term, relative to fuel (and fertilizer) prices, because retail electric rates are generally based on longer term averages of the cost to provide the power, which is dominated by the fixed costs of power plant construction (Energy Information Administration, 2011b; Gordon and Olson, 2004) .

This heightened demand raised production levels and prices of major field crops across the United States."}, {"section_title": "Biofuel Production", "text": "At least 1 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol has been produced annually in the United States since 1992 (USDOE/EIA, 2012a). Production was limited until the mid-2000s, at which point it began increasing rapidly ( Biodiesel consumption is also mandated in the RFS2. The mandated levels are much lower than for ethanol because biodiesel production has historically been much smaller than ethanol production, and diesel is used much less than gasoline in the United States. U.S. biodiesel production increased gradually through 2008, then fell due to unfavorable market economics (USDOE EIA, 2010) before recovering to more than 1 billion gallons in 2011 and 2012 (table 2). The share of soybeans allocated to biodiesel production was a little more than 1 percent in 2012. (Soybeans provide a little more than half of biodiesel feedstocks, along with corn oil and animal fats.) "}, {"section_title": "Crop Responses to Biofuel Production", "text": "The increase in biofuel production relied on an increasing amount of agricultural commodities used as feedstocks. In 2012, 4.5 billion bushels of corn were used as ethanol production feedstock-absorbing more than 42 percent of corn production ( fig. 4 ). This major new component of demand is competing with traditional uses of corn-including for food and livestock feed, both within the United States and for export. In particular, the share of corn allocated to both exports and feed declined by more than one-third between 2001 and 2012. Corn used for ethanol does generate a co-product, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), that is used for feed. This helped cushion livestock producers from the full effect of demand-driven feed-price increases.\nThe increased demand for corn exerted upward pressure on corn prices, which increased 90 percent ( Trostle (2008) notes that the increase in agricultural commodity prices was also due to slower production growth, rapid global demand for agricultural commodities, and a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. These higher corn prices encouraged farmers to increase corn production. Between 2001 and 2012, U.S. corn production increased by 13 percent (from 9.9 billion bushels to 10.8 billion bushels, after peaking at 13.1 billion bushels in 2009) ( fig. 6 ).\nFarmers responded to the demand for corn partly by planting it on more acres, partly through expanded double-cropping, and partly through more intensive use of land and other inputs. (See Wallander et al., 2011 , for a detailed discussion on these changes.) The expanding demand for land to produce corn and, to a much lesser extent, soybeans for energy feedstocks meant other crops faced increased competition for land. All major field crops but corn, soybeans, and wheat experienced a decline in acreage over [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] [2011] [2012] . Farms specializing in soybeans contributed most of the increase in corn acreage, while other farms shifted to soybeans (Wallander et al., 2011) . As a result of the increased competition, the prices of non-feedstock crops were bid up along with the prices of feedstock crops. Most major field crops experienced price increases (in real terms) of over 100 percent between 2001 and 2012 (fig. 5 ).

And while the agriculture sector's demand for energy is historically less than 2 percent of total U.S. energy consumption, energy and energy-intensive inputs account for a significant share of agricultural production costs. Corn, sorghum, and rice farmers allocated over 30 percent of total production expenditures on energy inputs in 2011."}, {"section_title": "Direct and Indirect Uses of Energy", "text": "The use of energy on agricultural operations is typically separated into direct use of fuels and electricity and indirect use of energy through energy-intensive inputs, most notably fertilizer and pesticides. From 2001 through 2011, direct energy use consistently accounted for the majority of total energy use on agricultural operations ( fig. 7 ). In 2011, direct energy use accounted for 63 percent of agricultural energy consumption, compared with 37 percent for indirect use."}, {"section_title": "Direct Energy Use", "text": "The dominant share of direct energy use on U.S. farms is fuels (including diesel and gasoline) to run machinery for field operations such as planting, tilling, and harvesting; to dry crops; for livestock use; and to transport goods ( fig. 8 ). Fuel energy use was relatively consistent-with a slight upward trend-during the 2000s; however, the combination of lower fuel prices ( fig. 2 ) and high commodity prices in Direct, indirect, and total energy consumed on U.S. farms, 2001-11\nTrillion btu of energy Note: Direct uses include onfarm use of fuels and electricity; indirect uses reflect the embodied energy in farm inputs, including fertilizer and chemicals. Energy consumed is calculated by taking the total yearly expenses, divided by the average yearly price and multiplying this amount by the energy conversion ratio. Average yearly prices are used, and years when intra-year prices are more volatile, such as 2006-09, should be viewed with more caution. This is because it is possible that purchases of energy were done when prices were at the low (high) end of the price range, which would skew the use of energy upwards (downwards). Btu = British thermal units.\nSource: Miranowski (2005) In contrast, electricity use remained steady across 2001-11, perhaps due to relatively stable prices ( fig. 3 ). Electricity is often used for heating and cooling in livestock and dairy operations (Miranowski, 2005) . For crop producers, irrigation pumps can be a large user of electricity. In 2007, 7.5 percent of U.S. cropland and pastureland acres were irrigated, but these acres were highly concentrated in the West (Schaible and Aillery, 2012) . Less than 12 percent of corn acres were irrigated in 2010, and only 8.6 percent of soybean acres in 2006 were irrigated (ERS, 2012b)."}, {"section_title": "Indirect Energy Use: Energy-Intensive Inputs", "text": "Fertilizer, an energy-intensive agricultural input, accounted for slightly more than half of indirect energy use on U.S. farms in 2011. Some of the decline in farm indirect use of energy over 2001-2011 (fig. 7 ) is a result of fertilizer manufacturers becoming more efficient in the use of natural gas feedstocks and energy in the production of fertilizer (Gellings and Parmenter, 2004) . "}, {"section_title": "Changes in Production Input Intensity", "text": "The quantity of energy or energy-intensive agricultural inputs purchased tends to increase as output increases. However, improvements in the quality of inputs or Fungicides production technologies and practices can reduce the quantity of inputs per unit of output. For example, increasing the efficacy of pesticides or the active ingredient content of fertilizers means the same outcomes can be achieved with lower quantities of chemicals, as measured in physical units. Further, as the prices of particular inputs increase (or policies are adopted to discourage use of particular inputs), producers may alter production practices accordingly. For example, in response to higher energy prices, farmers may acquire more energy-efficient vehicles or adopt production practices that require fewer trips across the field.\nU.S. farmers reduced quality-adjusted 1 energy inputs per unit of output over the last decade ( fig. 11) For the analysis, we use data from the ERS agricultural productivity dataset, where inputs are quality-adjusted. Consequently, as quality increases, the quality-adjusted quantities increase faster than quantities in physical units.

However, exposure to higher energy prices varies widely across crops. Figure 13 illustrates the share of production expenses spent on energy and energy-intensive inputs over two periods: 2001-05 and 2006-11 (see box, \"ERS Costs of Production\"). The second period corresponds to the large changes in input prices that occurred in the latter half of the 2000-2011 period. Among the major field crops, corn and rice-with sorghum and cotton close behind-had the highest cost shares for direct and indirect energy inputs over 2000-2011. Energy cost shares increased the most between periods for sorghum and wheat. In the latter period, the average share of energy inputs in total production costs was highest for corn, rice, and sorghum (33-34 percent), and lowest for soybeans (17 percent).\nIndirect energy expenditures saw large share increases relative to direct energy expenditures between periods I and II, primarily due to higher fertilizer expenditures. For example, in period I, fertilizer expenditures were 15 percent of the average corn production costs; under the high energy prices of 2006-11, the share of fertilizer expenditures in total corn production costs increased to 22 percent. Rising fertilizer cost shares indicate that, though fertilizer use declined from 2006 to 2011, compared with 2001-05 ( fig. 9 ), the percentage decline in quantity of fertilizer was less than the percentage increase in prices. Though direct energy use constitutes a larger share of the energy content consumed on farms ( fig. 7) , expenditures on indirect uses represent a larger share of farm expenses ( fig. 13 ). This is simply because indirect energy inputs cost more per unit of energy than direct energy purchases. Figure 14 illustrates this point, showing expenditures on inputs in 2011 as well as their cost per unit of energy.

"}, {"section_title": "Expenditures on Energy and Commodity Inputs by Livestock Producers", "text": "Livestock producers are uniquely affected by the volatility in commodity and energy prices as they use agricultural outputs (for example, corn) as inputs-feed. Feed prices trended upward over 2001-2012 (fig. 15 ). Corn represents a little more than half of all livestock feed; thus, it is not surprising that changes in feed prices generally track corn price changes ( fig. 5 ).\nHigher feed and direct energy input prices affected livestock producers' average expenditures for these products. Livestock producers' expenditure on feed more than doubled from $24.8 billion in 2001 to $54.6 billion in 2011 (NASS, 2012) . The share of direct energy inputs in production expenses saw modest increases for milk, hog, and cow-calf operations ( fig. 16 ), whereas feed experienced a larger increase in share.

To better understand the trends, it is useful to look at changes in rates of adoption of farm production practices that affect use of energy-intensive inputs.\nThe extent to which producers can substitute away from energy-related inputs without compromising output levels depends on the availability of alternative production practices and technologies, assuming the cropping mix is fixed. Because some alternative technologies may involve investments in capital equipment or information technologies, the degree of substitutability tends to increase with longer timeframes for making adjustments, and the full impact of the recent price volatility may not be realized for some years to come.\nVarious USDA conservation programs provide economic incentives-including financial incentives, technical assistance, and education for farmers-to adopt practices that conserve on use of energy and other inputs.

Across all crops, the most frequent response to higher fuel prices was to reduce the number of field operations-such as tillage, cultivation, or nutrient and pesticide applications-that use fuel to run machinery ( fig. 19 ). For corn producers, 16.6 percent indicated in 2010 that they reduced the number of field operations in response to higher fuel prices. Among cotton producers, 40 percent indicated that they reduced the number of field operations in 2007, which coincides with the initial spike in fuel prices ( fig. 2 ).\nIn response to higher fertilizer prices, the most frequent adjustment reported by commodity producers was to reduce the application rate of nitrogen ( fig. 20) , followed by managing fertilizer application more closely (for example, with soil testing, split applications, variable-rate applications, or soil incorporation). Soybean producers had the lowest response rates to these two questions, most likely due to lower fertilizer use on soybeans relative to the other surveyed crops. Some farmers also indicated that they increased the use of manure as a substitute for other fertilizer products. More corn producers (5 percent) than any other type of producer responded that they increased the application rate of manure, which is not surprising because they are the largest users of manure as fertilizer (Beckman and Livingston, 2012) . Wheat producers (2009) reported that they reduced fertilizer use the most and by the largest amounts. These responses by individual crop producers are consistent with the national reduction in fertilizer use over 2005-11 (fig. 9 ).\n4 Each year a different set of crops is surveyed. To be classified, for example, as a corn farm, more than 50 percent of a farm's value of production must be from corn; consequently, total production on corn farms is not the same as total corn production.

Reduced tillage (versus traditional intensive tillage) may result in decreased trips over the field due to lower cultivation rates, but also increased use of the energy-intensive inputs-particularly pesticides-on HT seed varieties. Recent analysis using ARMS data reveals that one form of reduced tillage, no-till 5 , generally increased over 2000-07 (Horowitz et al., 2010; authors' calculations) A field is said to have no-till operations if none of the following categories of machinery are used on the field between harvest of the previous crop and the current year's planting: plows and disks, including moldboard plow, offset disk, and tandem disk; cultivators; harrows; bedder-shapers; packers; and any miscellaneous tillage equipment such as Land-all, Do-all, Mix-n-till, mulch treader, rototiller, soil finisher, or stalk puller. One way to increase efficiency in agriculture is through the adoption of precision technologies, which use information gathered during field operations, from planting to harvest, to calibrate the timing and location for applying inputs and economize on fuel and fertilizer use. Recent ARMS data show that use of yield monitors by corn farmers, often a first step in using precision technology for grain crop producers, has grown rapidly (Schimmelpfennig and Ebel, 2011 Adoption of the complementary technologies that capitalize on the detailed information collected by yield monitors has increased, but it still lags behind yield monitor adoption. Adoption of variable-rate input (VRT) applicators increased from 9 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2005 and 23 percent in 2010 (or about onethird of those who had adopted yield monitors in 2010).

The adoption of renewable energy technologies has been increasing. In 2008, an estimated 17,358 U.S. farms produced energy from \"wind or solar technology, methane digester, etc.\" (ERS, 2008) ; by 2011, this number had nearly doubled (ERS, 2011a).\nAdoption of these technologies on farms could have one of two impacts for onfarm energy use. The renewable energy installation could be used to offset energy use, thereby reducing the amount of electricity previously purchased from an electric utility. Or installed renewable energy technologies could supply power to farming operations or activities that previously were not powered.\nAccording to a national survey of renewable energy-producing farm operators-the 2009 On-Farm Renewable Energy Production Survey (OFREPS) 6 -solar energy production is the most prevalent form of onfarm renewable energy, with an estimated 93 percent of farms with renewable energy generation reporting solar electric or solar thermal generating capacity ( fig. 22 ). Solar technologies employed by farmers include photovoltaic (PV) panels, which generate electricity, and thermal solar panels used for such applications as crop drying, space heating, and water heating.\nWind is the second most prevalent onfarm renewable fuel source; 17 percent of farms with renewable energy capacity had wind generation in 2009 (USDA NASS, 2011a). Wind technologies can be used similarly to PV technology. For example, wind turbines can charge batteries for remote applications, or can be used to pump water for animals. Wind turbines can also be connected to the electric grid to offset electric purchases from the utility company (DOE/NREL, 2003) .\nA final source of onfarm renewable energy production is methane digesters, which collect and store manure for heat and electricity generation (Key and Sneeringer, 2011) . The U.S Environmental Protection Agency AgSTAR program estimates that, as of September 2012, there were 192 operational anaerobic digesters in the United States, of which 178 generated electric or thermal energy (EPA, 2012) . Farm operations with anaerobic digesters (1.4 percent of farms with renewable energy) are far less common than those with either wind or solar capacity (USDA NASS, 2011a). The economic incentives for installation and management of an onfarm methane digester result from the comparison with alternative waste management systems, and not primarily energy savings (Schnepf, 2007) . To date, this technology 6 The first national survey of renewable energy producing farm operators (2009 On-Farm Renewable Energy Production Survey (OFREPS)) obtained information on renewable energy production on U.S. farms and ranches (NASS, 2011a) . This survey provides an overview of renewable energy applications on U.S. farms. is most cost effective for large livestock operations; therefore, where adopted, the electricity output is often substantial relative to onfarm wind and solar generation. Rising energy prices, carbon offset sales, renewable energy legislation and revenues from co-products such as recovered nutrients and fiber could make this technology increasingly attractive to more farm types and sizes (for example Key and Sneeringer, 2011; Wang et al., 2012) . Over 80 percent of the digesters are located on dairy operations, 12 percent on swine farms, and the remainder on poultry and beef farms (EPA, 2012).\nAlong with higher energy prices, favorable policies and funding may have induced the increase in renewable energy adoption (see Appendix). Almost 25 percent of farms with renewable energy reported that they received Federal funding for its production.

This report investigates the recent changes in the agriculture sector's relationship with energy-both using energy as an input into agricultural production and supplying agricultural feedstocks for use in biofuel production. As these changes are occurring simultaneously with other (nonenergy-related) market and policy developments, additional research is required to identify the relative strength of each factor in influencing the patterns of farmer decisions and aggregate outcomes."}]
