The neurodegeneration that ultimately leads to dementia in AD begins in the medial temporal lobe, before going on to involve neocortical regions [Braak & Braak, 1991; Braak, de Vos, Jansen, Bratzke, & Braak, 1998 ], and manifests as atrophy on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Sabuncu et al., 2011 Sabuncu et al., , 2012 . Consequently, quantitative MRI volumetry of the hippocampus has long been proposed as a sensitive and objective biomarker in AD. Smaller hippocampal volume has consistently been associated with a diagnosis of AD [Coupe et al., 2011b; Mouiha & Duchesne, 2011; Sabuncu et al., 2011] , while many studies report that the rate of hippocampal atrophy over time is accelerated in patients with AD compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy controls Mouiha & Duchesne, 2011; Sabuncu et al., 2011] . Furthermore, it has been suggested that hippocampal atrophy may more sensitively and precisely track disease progression in AD than clinical measures of cognitive function [Apostolova et al., 2010; Cavedo et al., 2014; Mielke et al., 2012; McLaren et al., 2012; Sanchez-Benavides et al., 2014] . As a result, a decrease in the expected rate of hippocampal atrophy in AD patients-or a hippocampal atrophy rate more closely approximating that observed in normal aging-may be considered surrogate evidence of a disease-modifying effect in trials of novel AD therapies. On this basis, hippocampal atrophy has been included as an outcome measure in several clinical trials of candidate disease-modifying drugs in AD [Frisoni et al., 2010] .\nHippocampal volume and atrophy rate are typically computed from T1-weighted volumetric MRI data. Several manual segmentation protocols-in which the outline of the hippocampus is traced by an experienced observer-have been developed for this purpose [Pruessner et al., 2000; Boccardi et al., 2011b; Watson et al., 1997] . To date, it has been difficult to determine the superiority of any one protocol over another [Boccardi et al., 2011a] . A harmonized consensus protocol has recently been developed it is yet to be widely adopted [Boccardi et al., 2013a [Boccardi et al., , 2013b . Despite being considered the neuroanatomical \"gold standard\" for structural image analysis, manual segmentation has several pitfalls. Primarily, manual segmentation is extraordinarily labor-intensive and time-consuming, and is, as such, impractical for computing hippocampal volume in large patient samples. Furthermore, the adoption of any protocol requires careful assessment of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability to ensure the concordance of hippocampal volumes between different observers, and the stability of volume estimates from any single observer over time [Pruessner et al., 2000] . In response to these drawbacks, several semiautomated and fully automated hippocampal segmentation algorithms using libraries of manually segmented hippocampi as training data have been developed and are now freely accessible through popular neuroimaging software packages [Fischl et al., 2002; Patenaude et al., 2011; Pipitone et al., 2014] . These algorithms permit hippocampal volumes and atrophy rates to be computed in large imaging datasets at the click of a mouse button or through the use of a few simple commands, while minimizing any potential impact of human bias [Mouiha & Duchesne, 2011; Pipitone et al., 2014; Sabuncu et al., 2011] .\nAs different segmentation algorithms use slightly different a priori anatomical information to identify the boundaries of the hippocampus, there are, predictably, slight differences in absolute hippocampal volume and absolute rate of hippocampal atrophy generated by each individual algorithm for a given set of subjects [Barnes et al., 2009; Mulder et al., 2014] . Such absolute differences can be tolerated provided that hippocampal volumes and atrophy rates are at least concordant across algorithms, that is, those subjects whose hippocampi are larger at baseline, or in whom hippocampal atrophy is occurring more rapidly over time, ought to be consistently be identified by each individual algorithm. In the absence of a single gold-standard r Sankar et al. r r 2876 r algorithm, this type of inter-algorithm concordance would greatly strengthen our confidence in the use of hippocampal volume as a biomarker to assess the impact of therapies directed at AD, or perhaps even to track disease progression at the individual subject level in clinical practice. To date, there has been a relative paucity of studies addressing the concordance between hippocampal atrophy rates generated across various automated segmentation algorithms [Mulder et al., 2014] . The need for these types of studies is ever more pressing because of easier access to hippocampal segmentation algorithms and high-performance computing hardware by clinicians and scientists who may lack expertise with quantitative neuroimaging. The need is heightened by the ongoing development of new segmentation algorithms, and the development of turnkey commercial services which take unprocessed MRI data from patients and generate hippocampal volumes and atrophy rates in a \"black box\" manner.\nThe work in this article is inspired by an observation made by our group during our study of hippocampal volumes derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://www.adni-info.org), a large-scale, multisite, longitudinal study of the natural history of AD, in part designed to determine the utility of various imaging biomarkers in detecting and tracking AD [Mueller et al., 2005; Holland et al., 2009; Weiner et al., 2012] . While brain imaging data from ADNI is made freely available to researchers, the ADNI database also contains a list of longitudinal hippocampal volume estimates, generated by different semi-automated and automated methods, for most subjects. We observed, unexpectedly, that ADNI-reported hippocampal volumes increased over time in a number of subjects across the AD, MCI, and healthy control groups. This observation runs counter to the expected progressive atrophy of the hippocampus in AD and MCI, and to a lesser extent, in normal aging [Mouiha and Duchesne, 2011; Sabuncu et al., 2011] . We therefore undertook a study to determine the incidence of hippocampal volume increases over time in the ADNI cohort, by each of five different semiautomated or automated hippocampal segmentation algorithms. Finding a surprisingly large proportion of patients with hippocampal enlargement, we then examined whether patients demonstrating volume increases are identified independently and consistently across these algorithms. Based on these observations, we examined whether these volume increases could be explained by well-known sources of variability in hippocampal segmentation, such as scan-rescan reliability, or factors influencing MRI acquisition, such as field strength. Given the use of hippocampal volume and atrophy rates as biomarkers for disease progression and transition from NC to MCI to AD [Amaral et al., 2016; Wolz et al., 2010a; 2010b] , the use of atrophy rates may also provide diagnostic classification accuracy. We further tested if this was true across the algorithms examined in this study. Our findings raise some concerns about the reliability of current segmentation algorithms in assessing hippocampal atrophy rate, and as such serve as a cautionary note to end users of these algorithms, especially those investigators designing clinical trials in AD, or clinicians who may be tempted to apply their output as a biomarker at the individual patient level to aid in clinical decision-making."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Acquisition", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether longitudinal MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI-1 has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nFrom the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5 T standardized dataset and ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 3 T standardized dataset, we identified 650 and 142 subjects respectively for whom a baseline and a 1-year follow-up MRI scan had been completed. ADNI investigators acquired MRI data using 1.5 T or 3.0 T scanners (General Electric Healthcare, Philips Medical Systems or Siemens Medical Solutions) at multiple sites as described .

Quality control of segmentations generated by these algorithms was already available through the ADNI database and subsequently used in our evaluations. We also chose two other segmentation algorithms not already available in the ADNI database, namely FSL FIRST (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIRST) [Patenaude et al., 2011] , and a newly derived multi-atlas segmentation algorithm from our group, MAGeT Brain Pipitone et al., 2014] . FSL FIRST was chosen due to its popularity in the field and in other neuroimaging studies of the hippocampus, for example the recent ENIGMA genome-wide association meta-analysis study [Stein et al., 2012] . MAGeT-Brain was chosen due to our familiarity with the methodology and our assessment of its overall quality in comparison to FreeSurfer, FSL FIRST, and SNT methods [Pipitone et al., 2014; Treadway et al., 2015] .

This is followed by a nonlinear registration phase to match longitudinal images using a linear elasticity model which estimates a well-regularized displacement field to align two images [Holland and Dale, 2011] . The displaced transformed image will deform cubic voxels into irregular hexahedra in order to estimate volume changes. This is done in a hierarchical iterative procedure in order to capture subtle volumetric differences between longitudinal data from the same individual. FreeSurfer-based segmentations (as above) were used to create the baseline definitions of the hippocampal segmentations.

In our implementation we used five high-resolution atlases of the hippocampus [Winterburn et al., 2013] as input. MAGeT Brain uses a subset of the data to be segmented to automatically generate a template library so that the segmentation process can be bootstrapped using a subset of the data. Template library images were chosen based on a representative sampling of subject diagnosis, age, and sex to model neuroanatomical variability within the ADNI cohort. Seven subjects from each diagnostic group (AD, MCI, healthy control) spanning the age range within each group were chosen. The template library is generated through automated nonlinear registration between each of the atlases and each of the subjects in the template library, yielding five candidate segmentations for each hippocampus. The template library now acts like regular input segmentations in a regular multiatlas procedure. Each of the subjects is then matched to each of the subjects in the template library to yield 105 candidate segmentations. The final segmentation is created by selecting the most frequently occurring label at each voxel location [Collins and Pruessner, 2010] . All images were converted into the MINC file format (http:// www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/MINC) and all nonlinear registrations were performed using symmetric normalization and a cross-correlation objective function as implemented in the ANTs toolbox [Avants et al., 2008] .\nVolumetric data generated from the FreeSurfer, UCSD, and SNT methods were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu) between March 2012 and December 2012.

Hippocampal \"growers\" were classified as unilateral (i.e., increase over 12 months in volume of either the right or left hippocampus), bilateral (i.e., increase over 12 months in volume of both right and left hippocampi), or average (i.e., increase over 12 months in mean volume of both hippocampi)."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control", "text": "Quality control (QC) assessments were performed to identify and eliminate subjects with hippocampal segmentation failures which could impact our hippocampal growth analysis.

QC could not be assessed for the SNT algorithm. A detailed description of QC methods follows below.\nFreeSurfer QC information for individual hippocampal segmentations was obtained from the ADNI database. According to ADNI, QC assessment was carried out as outlined in the ADNI protocols (http://adni.bitbucket.org/docs/UCSFFRESFR/ UCSFFreeSurferMethodsSummary.pdf). QC was assessed in both regional and global registration and segmentation accuracy. For the purposes of this study, we focused on the ADNI-reported \"Overall QC\" metric, which is the most rigorous QC measure, meant to reflect the quality of cortical and subcortical segmentation across the entire brain volume. Specifically, we considered a given hippocampal segmentation in a given subject as acceptable only if that subject achieved an Overall QC metric of \"PASS.\" UCSD QC information in the form of a simple two-point scale was obtained from the ADNI database, an ADNI-reported rating of \"0\" denoted segmentation failure, while a rating of \"1\" indicated a passing segmentation."}, {"section_title": "SNT", "text": "Formal QC was not reported in ADNI, and was not performed considering that the SNT algorithm is semiautomated, depending in part on the selection of anatomical landmarks on the hippocampus by an expert observer.

Resulting segmentations and volumetric differences between repeat scans are then typically used to quantify error limits within the segmentation algorithm.\nWe addressed scan-rescan reliability in two ways. First, we determined literature-reported mean scan-rescan reliability data for each algorithm:\nFreeSurfer, FSL-FIRST, and UCSD Scan-rescan data were estimated from a previous study that compared FreeSurfer and FSL segmentations [Morey et al., 2010] .

Subjects from ADNI with atrophy rate outside the right-tail 90 th percentile of the scan-rescan distribution were considered as an alternate definition for identifying candidate \"growers.\" We chose a more liberal 90 th percentile threshold based on the assumption that the scan-rescan distributions we computed likely undersample the true population variance in scan-rescan values. By generating a null distribution of test-retest reliability error we considered that single individuals that fell to the edges of this distribution would be the most likely candidates to demonstrate plausible biological growth over the course of 1 year. Moreover, if these individuals were most likely to exhibit hippocampal growth over 1 year, we hypothesized r Sankar et al. r r 2880 r that this phenomenon should be captured through the different algorithms tested in this manuscript.\nIn this particular case, it may be more beneficial to identify high rates of atrophy using a whole-brain or temporal lobe measures (such as a medial temporal atrophy score).

The substantial number of segmentation failures, naturally, caused several subjects to fail more stringent QC assessment. At 1.5 T, across all diagnostic categories, only approximately half (202 out of 398, 50.8%) of those subjects with scans available at baseline and 12 months passed across-method QC (i.e., had acceptable hippocampal segmentations at both time points by all algorithms). Overall, the proportion of AD patients passing across-method QC was significantly lower than that of the NC subjects (37.8% vs 58.9%, v 2 5 9.95, P 5 0.007), but not significantly lower than that of MCI subjects (51.4%). At 3 T, 58.1% (36 out of 62) of all subjects passed across-method QC overall; as at 1.5 T, the proportion of AD patients passing acrossmethod QC was significantly lower than that of the NC subjects (40.0% vs 78.2%, v 2 5 6.26, P 5 0.04) but not that of the MCI patients (50.0%).\nWe considered the possibility that segmentation algorithms might be less accurate when applied to MRI scans of increasingly atrophic brains.

Our assessment of five different semi-automated or automated hippocampal segmentation algorithms-including three (SNT, Freesurfer, and UCSD) which were used to generate publicly reported hippocampal volume data in ADNI-showed that a considerable proportion of ADNI patients demonstrated volumetric hippocampal growth over 1 year by all algorithms spanning AD, MCI, and NC groups. We also closely analyzed hippocampal segmentation quality for each algorithm and examined concordance between algorithms. We found a considerable incidence of hippocampal segmentation failures for each method across all diagnostic groups. Interestingly, even when stringent QC measures were used to exclude erroneous segmentations, each algorithm still identified a number of candidate hippocampal \"growers.\" Adjustment for scan-rescan reliability error further reduced the number of candidate hippocampal growers, but did not eliminate them entirely. Ultimately, we found that hippocampal growth was inconsistently identified in the same subjects by all algorithms, and that 1-year hippocampal atrophy rate estimates-as opposed to crosssectional, single timepoint estimates of baseline hippocampal volume-were poorly concordant across algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate that there is also no concordance between algorithms at the level of the single subject.\nWhile there have been several previous studies in the literature addressing issues of error, variability, and reliability in automated hippocampal segmentation [Morey et al., 2010; Mulder et al., 2014; Mouiha & Duchesne, 2011; Pipitone et al., 2014] , our study is unique for three reasons:\n(1) we frame the issue in the context of hippocampal \"growth\" over time; (2) we are primarily concerned with inter-algorithm concordance in hippocampal atrophy rate, which is a popular longitudinal biomarker for studies of putative disease-modifying therapies in AD; and (3) we assessed five separate segmentation algorithms, including, but not limited to, those algorithms used to generate hippocampal volume data in ADNI.\nTo our knowledge, there have to date been no studies specifically examining the phenomenon of hippocampal growth over time, either in the setting of AD or in data obtained from ADNI. A closer look at the literature, however, does hint at its occurrence without explicit mention. In one example, Mouiha and Duchesne [2011] examined hippocampal atrophy rates in the ADNI dataset using SNT and Freesurfer, and found that for the SNT algorithm, the mean monthly hippocampal atrophy rate between 6 and 12 months after baseline was greater than zero for both the left and right hippocampi in HC subjects. Put differently, the hippocampi of healthy subjects, segmented by SNT, at a group-wide level, demonstrated a mean increase in volume over a 6 month interval. Notably-and in keeping with the pattern of nonconcordance we identified-Freesurfer did not find evidence of groupwide hippocampal growth when applied to the same group of HC subjects. However, unlike in our study, these authors did not report the results of QC on any segmented images, and only considered scans acquired at 1.5 T. Scan-rescan reliability error is perhaps the most straightforward explanation to account for hippocampal growth we encountered in this study. Repeated MRI scanning of the same subject, even under identical scanner and acquisition parameters (as in ADNI), does not necessarily generate identical images, because of small changes in the position of the subject's head within the MRI coil, as well as instabilities in the magnetic field even on stringently monitored scanners [Morey et al., 2010] . As a result, hippocampal segmentations may be different between successive scans of the same patient even when no actual volume changes have occurred. Note that, by contrast, the output of automated hippocampal segmentation algorithms is thought to be almost perfectly reproducible when applied to the same scan at different times, whether one uses different computing platforms, or runs algorithms in parallel on the same platform [Gronenschild et al., 2012] . Thresholding by scan-rescan error, however, still did not completely eliminate hippocampal growers. There are several potential reasons for this finding. First, it is possible that we underestimated the degree of scan-rescan variability. For subjects in ADNI, actual scan-rescan variability for any given algorithm may well be greater than literature-reported values or our own internally generated variability distributions, as these values were obtained using different scanners than in ADNI, and from different populations free of older subjects or AD patients (exception is Hsu et al. [2002] ). Second, while the effect of the duration between repeated scans on scan-rescan variability in hippocampal volume is poorly understood [Holland et al., 2009; Holland & Dale, 2011] , it would seem intuitive that a longer interval between scans-such as the 12-month interval in this study-might increase the likelihood of larger interscan variability, thus, the thresholds we identified from the literature may be underestimates. Finally, it is possible that scan-rescan variability is simply larger than average for those specific individual subjects whom we identified as \"candidate\" hippocampal growers.\nOne intriguing alternative to the scan-rescan reliability explanation is the possibility that hippocampal growth as we have observed it represents a true biological phenomenon. The hippocampus has a notable capacity for plasticity and regeneration, and several quantitative human MRI studies have suggested that it may enlarge in response to physical and mental training paradigms, or during recovery from neurological disease states (see Fotuhi et al. [2012] for a review). To our knowledge, there is only one published instance of therapy-related hippocampal enlargement in AD, reported in a subset of patients with mild AD treated using deep brain stimulation of the fornix (Sankar et al., [2015] ). Though these preliminary findings have yet to be replicated, it is conceivable that in a certain subset of AD or MCI subjects that hippocampal volume may increase over time as a compensatory response to Alzheimer's pathology or aging. Also, the accumulation of amyloid pathology within the hippocampi could theoretically produce a spurious increase in hippocampal volume in selected patients (analogous to data in some rodent models of AD [Lau et al., 2008] ). Obviously, these possibilities are purely speculative, and we certainly do not have any convincing evidence from Figure 6 . Receiver operating curves and area under the curve measures for ADNI-1 data passing stringent, across method QC for classification of (A) AD vs NC; (B) MCI vs NC; and (C) MCI vs. AD. LR_L1 5 Logistic regression with lasso; SVC5 support vector machine classification; RFC 5 random forest classification.\nr Caveats of Longitudinal Automated Hippocampal Volumetry r r 2889 r our data to support their existence. In a set of post-hoc analyses not shown, we could not identify any characteristic clinical traits or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features unique to hippocampal growers for any given method, including those who showed growth over and above scan-rescan variability thresholds. Perhaps more importantly, in the absence of any real ground truth in hippocampal volume change for each patient, and because agreement between segmentation algorithms in identifying hippocampal growers was so poor, it is a challenge to know in which patients one ought to even begin looking for evidence of biological hippocampal growth.\nA particularly significant finding of our study is that the automated hippocampal segmentation algorithms we assessed are in good agreement regarding baseline hippocampal volume, but in rather poor agreement regarding the magnitude and direction of hippocampal volume changes over time, for subjects in the ADNI dataset. Interestingly, poor concordance in hippocampal atrophy rate did not appear to be remedied by increasing field strength (which should increase signal-to-noise and tissue contrast in the hippocampal region) nor by applying more stringent QC measures. Taken together, these data suggest more generally that a given automated segmentation algorithm may have a particular bias toward exaggerating or underestimating volume change relative to other algorithms for a given subject with a unique hippocampal morphology. This may most convincingly be explained by a combination of two key factors. First, different segmentation algorithms use different a priori anatomical definitions of the hippocampus; as an example, some algorithms exclude surrounding white matter such as the alveus or fimbria (Pipitone et al., 2014] , while others incorporate these into the hippocampal volume [Collins and Pruessner, 2010; Pruessner et al., 2002] . This fact alone would not necessarily worsen interalgorithm concordance if hippocampal atrophy in AD, MCI, and aging were evenly distributed across the hippocampus. The second key factor, however, is that hippocampal atrophy may proceed at different rates within different regions of the hippocampus, as evidenced by recent work using hippocampal subfields as outcome measures La Joie et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2010] . Accordingly, various algorithms may be differentially sensitive to-and their atrophy rate estimates differentially influenced by-the subjectspecific spatial distribution of atrophy within the hippocampus, leading to significant discrepancies in the calculated magnitude of longitudinal hippocampal volume change.\nApart from possibly being driven by differences in neuroanatomical definitions, the lack of concordance between atrophy rates may have significant implications in studies of aging, pathological aging, and in clinical trials using hippocampal volume as a primary outcome measure. Given the confounds over not only the specificity of hippocampal volumes at the individual subject level in a longitudinal setting but also the concordance between atrophy rates as well, the choice of algorithm will have a clear effect on outcome measures and the acceptable range of values in research and clinical trial settings. We previously reported the effects of proportional biases on hippocampal volume estimation in Pipitone et al. [2014] , where we observed that FSL and FreeSurfer, in particular, tended to overestimate the size of larger hippocampi while underestimating the size of smaller hippocampi. We noted the opposite, and more conservative bias, in MAGeT and SNT algorithms. Thus, the next step, which is outside the scope of this article, would be to elucidate if there is a homologous proportional bias related to atrophy rate. Importantly, researchers may want to consider the use of different algorithms for different purposes based on the data we have presented here and depending on the overall endpoints for their studies or clinical trials.\nOverall, our rigorous and comprehensive approach to QC resulted in the rejection of a large number of hippocampal segmentations across algorithms, and merits some comment. For the Freesurfer and UCSD algorithms, we made the decision to use QC data reported in ADNI, since these data are publicly accessible. Since many studies consider SNT segmentations to be a \"gold standard\"-given that they require observer input and correction during their computation-we did not consider QC for SNT [Leung et al., 2010; Wolz et al., 2010a] . For those algorithms lacking QC information in ADNI (i.e., FSL and MAGeT), we performed a detailed visual inspection of segmentation quality in each subject. Given the absence of a standard consensus method to assess the quality of hippocampal segmentations, we erred on the side of a strict approach, limiting as much as possible the potential influence of spurious segmentations on the measured incidence of hippocampal growers. As an example, for the FreeSurfer algorithm, we classified a particular subject as a hippocampal segmentation failure if that subject showed evidence of segmentation inaccuracies anywhere in the brain across a multitude of cortical or subcortical regions (i.e., if that subject failed \"overall\" QC). Our rationale was that evidence of poor tissue classification or poor delineation of anatomy anywhere in the brain might introduce doubt about the accuracy of hippocampal segmentations as well. No doubt this contributed to the high failure rate we found for the FreeSurfer algorithm. Note that we are neither advocating any particular approach to assessing hippocampal segmentation quality, nor are we suggesting that the ideal approach needs to be as stringent as the one we employed. That being said, our QC data are consistent with recent reports in the literature suggesting that the influence of failed segmentations may have the effect of significantly reducing the reproducibility of hippocampal volume change estimates in longitudinal studies [Mulder et al., 2014] . Indeed, our findings underscore the need to reevaluate the validity of the oft-used argument that it is too costly to perform rigorous QC of hippocampal segmentations in large datasets. At the very least, our results would argue that in studies using ADNI-reported hippocampal values, the (easily accessed) accompanying QC data ought to be considered as well. One open question based on the findings presented in this article is the ability of these algorithms to classify individuals by their diagnosis. While this could be an important undertaking in the context of the hippocampal volume segmentation, such analyses are a topic of hot debate in the literature [Coupe et al., 2011a,; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Eskildsen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010] . Such a problem would require several design choices, which themselves will be controversial, each of which could easily account for a source of detailed investigation. For example, should the input data that is used consist of baseline volumes only, atrophy rates, or volumes from both time points? Should data that passes QC on a permethod basis be used or should the dataset consist of only those subjects that have passed QC across several methods? The impact of image processing techniques on multi-variate/ machine learning applications is an open question in the literature that requires further investigation, but is, ultimately, outside the scope of this article.\nNevertheless, based on our segmentation results, we also performed classification of the different diagnostic categories using three commonly used classifiers (logistic regression with lasso, random forests, and support vector machines). Other groups have used classification techniques to better identify diagnostic groups. For example, Wolz et al [2010b] achieve a correct classification rate of 82% between AD and NC and they also demonstrate they can identify MCI patients who progress to AD (with an accuracy of 64%) based only on 1-year atrophy rates. Although we did not perform this latter comparison, it could be further explored using the framework in this manuscript. However, given the large number of comparisons, segmentation algorithms, and classifiers already explored in this manuscript, it would have been difficult to treat the latter question (MCI-to-AD conversion) appropriately while maintaining equivalent datasets across methods (given the significant issues with quality control that we observed). It is important to note that there are other studies that examine the utility of hippocampal volume as a biomarker based on the relationship between hippocampal atrophy and established biomarkers related to AD pathophysiology. These include the observations that longitudinal atrophy rates measured using surface-based [Morra et al., 2008] and volumetric techniques [Schuff et al., 2009 ] have a strong relationship with known AD-specific risk factors (such as being positive for apolipoprotein e4 isoform and low education status) and CSF biomarkers.\nAnother open question that remains is how to deal with the lack of concordance between methodologies. While many groups have started to move to standardized datasets and practices in evaluating hippocampal and hippocampal subfield volumes, further investigation may be necessary [Boccardi et al., 2013a; Schoemaker et al., 2016; Yushkevich et al., 2015] . Heterogeneity in scientific methodology is acceptable, so long as methodologies have been stringently validated (as is the case with algorithms that have been evaluated here). Furthermore, our understanding of group effects certainly benefits from many groups asking similar questions but answering them with different tools. While these algorithms show accurate results at the group level (significant cross-sectional and longitudinal differences), it is clear that their precision (i.e., treatment of single subjects, atrophy rates) varies substantially. This is important and requires further replication and research with the use of open-source software and shared datasets.\nIt may also be worth considering the differences between the design of the different methods. In this study, two of the methods that were used were explicitly designed for the analyses of longitudinal datasets. Previous work by Jovovich et al. [2014] examined the reliability of the FreeSurfer crosssectional and longitudinal processing streams in a multisite setting and demonstrated far more variability in the crosssectional scheme across sites for hippocampal volumes. These results are reflected in our results as well, after stringent QC of all methods is performed, we observe a slightly larger number of candidate \"growers\" in methods not optimized for longitudinal data. The UCSD method appears to perform better in this regard and shows a small number of growers across QC methods. Nontheless, it is somewhat puzzling why in some instances FreeSurfer demonstrates a substantial number of candidate growers (>7% in some cases; see Table III ). It is possible that this can be attributed to older imaging (1.5 T) and image processing pipelines (older FreeSurfer versions) that were used in the processing of the data. It remains to be seen if newer versions of the FreeSurfer pipeline may behave differently with these data.\nOne limitation of our study is that we did not compare the incidence of hippocampal growth in ADNI by manual tracing to that observed with automated segmentation algorithms. Manual tracing by trained observers is considered by some to be more accurate than automated methods in determining either hippocampal volume or atrophy rate [Barnes et al., 2008; Boccardi et al., 2011a Boccardi et al., , 2013a Nestor et al., 2012; Pipitone et al., 2014; Pruessner et al., 2000] , and segmentations generated manually are usually considered the gold standard against which automated methods are validated [Mulder et al., 2014] . In addition, manual tracing is less susceptible to gross segmentation errors [Morey et al., 2010] . At first glance, therefore, manual tracing would appear better suited to predicting the true incidence of hippocampal growers-if they actually exist-provided manual segmentations could actually be completed on all subjects in ADNI. Unfortunately, doing so would most likely be prohibitively time-consuming. Even if it could be done, it is not necessarily true that the results obtained would be more valid than for automated segmentation. First, unlike automated segmentation algorithms, the reproducibility of any hippocampal manual tracing protocol is influenced by intra-rater reliability, as observer interpretation of identical imaging data may drift over time and due to human factors such as fatigue [Morey et al., 2010] . Second, inter-rater reliability for the same protocol may vary even between expert observers [Chupin et al., 2009; Pipitone et al., 2014] . Third, in the r Caveats of Longitudinal Automated Hippocampal Volumetry r r 2891 r absence of widespread adoption of a harmonized protocol, there are at least as many manual protocols as there are automated segmentation algorithms [Boccardi et al., 2013a [Boccardi et al., , 2013b . Accordingly, depending on the specific hippocampal boundaries used in each protocol, the subject-specific spatial distribution of atrophy within the hippocampus may influence inter-protocol concordance in hippocampal atrophy rates in a manner similar to that observed with automated algorithms.\nA second limitation concerns the results reported by thresholding for true growth using literature-based values. These values represent a mean error on the reliability of the measurement of hippocampal volume; consequently, any threshold defined by this method is liberal as it is possible that scan-rescan reliability for any given subject may exceed the group mean. Indeed, we would caution against overinterpreting results that exceed mean scan-rescan reliability thresholds in cases where information about a single subject is desired. Nonetheless, our results based on this type of thresholding still demonstrate a lack of concordance between many commonly used algorithms in the literature. A final limitation pertains to our analysis of atrophy rates. While it is possible that atrophy rates may not theoretically conform to a normal distribution (as atrophy rate is the ratio of normally distributed variables), this is not what we observe in our data, (except for UCSD data at 1.5 T), we chose to use Gaussian statistics for analysis of atrophy rates.\nTaken together, our findings raise some concerns in the use of hippocampal volume as a biomarker in studies of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. First, QC may have a major impact regardless of segmentation algorithm, field strength, diagnosis, and hippocampal boundary definitions. The high rate of QC failures in this study brings into question whether current and prior \"black-box\" approaches to hippocampal volumetry applied in certain studies and clinical trials, where patient MRIs are analyzed using either commercial or publically available software without any standardized QC measures reported, can be entirely trusted to yield meaningful results. Second, our data indicate that relative longitudinal hippocampal volume change, calculated in an automated manner, may be a suboptimal biomarker to track disease progression or response to therapy. This appears to hold true even for algorithms that have been optimized for longitudinal volumetric processing, such as FreeSurfer and the UCSD method; we found these algorithms to be poorly concordant with one another and with alternate algorithms. Our data further suggest that it may be ill-advised to trust normative or pathological rates of hippocampal volume change derived only a single algorithm; conversely, it is possible that the use of several different algorithms could, at worst, produce altogether divergent results."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In an assessment of five different automated or semiautomated segmentation algorithms designed to measure hippocampal volume from structural MRI data, we found an unexpectedly high incidence of subjects in the ADNI database who demonstrated hippocampal growth over time. For no individual algorithm could this counterintuitive finding be entirely explained by gross segmentation errors, scan-rescan variability, or field strength of MRI acquisition. Furthermore, algorithms did not consistently identify the same subjects as hippocampal growers, and more generally our analysis revealed poor concordance between algorithms in their estimates of the magnitude and direction of hippocampal volume change over time, which precluded a meaningful analysis of whether hippocampal growth could be a true biological phenomenon. These findings suggest that, in patients with either AD or MCI, or age-matched elderly controls, longitudinal hippocampal volume change should be interpreted with considerable caution as a biomarker at the individual subject level, and may have important limitations at a group-wide level as well.
