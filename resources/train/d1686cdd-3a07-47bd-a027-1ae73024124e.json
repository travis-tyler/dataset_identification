The time from spawning until harvest for this species is usually less than 1 year (Cook and Lindner 1970). Adult brown shrimp spawn offshore with peak activity at depths of 27 to 46 m from October to December and March to May (Christmas and Etzold 1977;Renfro and Brusher 1982). Eggs hatch within 14-18 hours (Cook and Lindner 1970), and after passing through several larval stages (Lassuy 1983), postlarvae move into estuaries settling as juveniles in inshore bays (Dall et al. 1990;Fry 2008). Juveniles grow rapidly to sub-adult size then migrate offshore to complete their growth and spawn (Temple and Fischer 1967). Recruitment of juveniles to the sub-adult (inshore) and adult (offshore) fishery appears dependent upon processes that take place during the estuarine phase of the shrimp's life history (Minello et al. 1989;Minello and Zimmerman 1991;Haas et al. 2001). There is little or no correlation demonstrated between number of spawners and number of recruits to the fishery (Neal 1975;Nance and Nichols 1988) or between abundance of postlarvae entering bays and subsequent offshore landings (Berry and Baxter 1969;Ford and St. Amant 1971;Baxter and Sullivan 1986). However, positive correlations were found between abundance of juveniles and adults (Berry and Baxter 1969), and a strong correlation was identified between numbers of sub-adult/bait-sized brown shrimp caught and annual offshore landings of adults (Baxter and Sullivan, 1986). These relationships suggest that mortality is high and variable during the estuarine phase of brown shrimp life history and that year-class strength is fixed before migration into open bays (Minello et al. 1989). Estuarine habitats in the northern GoM vary considerably and include intertidal marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, oyster reef, mangroves, tidal mudflats, and subtidal bay bottom (Clark et al. 2004). Understanding the relative value of juvenile habitats and potential nurseries is critical to the management of adult populations (Beck et al. 2001;Adams et al. 2006). Beck et al. (2001) defined nurseries as juvenile habitats whose \"contribution per unit area to the production of individuals that recruit to adult populations is greater, on average, than production from other habitats in which juveniles occur.\" The contribution of a habitat is measured through a combination of four factors: density, growth, survival of juveniles, and movement to adult habitats (Beck et al. 2001). Brown shrimp are present in several habitat and bottom types such as oyster reefs (Stunz et al. 2010) and shallow open water (Minello 1999;Fry 2008;), but are found in highest densities associated with seagrass and the emergent vegetation along the edge of salt marsh habitats Minello and Rozas 2002;Minello et al. 2003). Since there is relatively little seagrass in Galveston Bay (Clark et al. 2004;King and Sheridan 2006), estuarine marshes have been considered important nursery areas, providing shrimp with favorable environmental conditions. Salt marshes provide refuge from predators (Minello and Zimmerman 1983;Minello et al. 1989, Minello 1993) and abundant food to support rapid growth Zimmerman 1991, 1998;Whaley and Minello 2002). Salt marshes contribute substantially to the productivity of brown shrimp (Minello et al. 2008) and are identified as Essential Fish Habitat (Minello 1999;NMFS 2010)  The MSRA directs fishery management councils and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to identify Essential Fish Habitat for all managed fishery species (Minello 1999). The NMFS Habitat Assessment Improvement Plan (HAIP) introduced in May of 2010 draws upon the mandates of the MSRA, calls for the improvement of fisheries management through the integration of habitat science, and emphasizes improving stock assessment models and their data input Yoklavich et al. (2010). The modeling approach proposed here is an attempt to quantify habitat effects on juvenile brown shrimp populations. Although several brown shrimp models are in the literature including a spatial density model (Minello et al. 2008), Individual Based Models (Haas et al. 2004;Roth et al. 2008), a bioenergetics model (Adamack et al."}, {"section_title": "2012)", "text": ", and various correlative models (Barrett and Gillespie 1973;Turner 1992;Haas et al. 2001) their output is not directly compatible with current stock assessment models. Until recently, stock assessments for shrimp in the GoM have used Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) developed by Nichols (1984). In 2009, an internal NMFS panel reviewed the pink shrimp VPA and deemed its use inappropriate given that current fishing effort is much lower than when the model was originally calibrated in 1994 (Hart and Nance 2010;Hart, 2012). Hart and Nance (2010) suggested the adoption of Stock Synthesis 3 (SS-3), a widely used and peer reviewed assessment model (Methot 2009;Schirripa et al. 2009). Stock Synthesis 3 is accepted as a robust, reliable assessment modeling software by the Alaska, Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and Southwest Fisheries Science Centers (and their respective Fisheries Management Councils) for assessing other valuable fisheries (Hart and Nance 2010). In addition, SS-3 has the capability to incorporate habitat and environmental information, but as of this writing does not include inputs regarding juvenile habitat and environmental effects explicitly. The economic value of the GoM shrimp fishery has fueled over 50 years of research into population dynamics of brown shrimp (Haas et al. 2001) and mechanisms through which habitats influence growth and survival (Minello and Zimmerman 1991). Studies in Texas and Louisiana on juvenile brown shrimp have shown that growth and survival in estuarine nurseries depend upon temperature, salinity, and access to emergent marsh vegetation (Minello et al. 1989(Minello et al. , 2008Adamack et al. 2012). Modeling these highly dynamic variables and their interactions is a cognitively and mathematically complex task Grant and Swannack 2008). However, using a holistic instead of reductionist approach is essential when modeling complex systems (Costanza et al. 1993Miller et al. 2000). Fortunately, model software improvements include graphical programming languages and user-friendly interfaces specifically designed to facilitate modeling of nonlinear, dynamic systems Costanza and Gottleib 1998;Costanza et al. 2001;Ford 2010). The development and analysis of a simulation model is beneficial at both predictive as well as conceptual levels (Carothers and Grant 1987). Building models that represent the assumed structure of a system requires the synthesis of existing data and theory and can help identify and fill knowledge gaps or identify areas in which conflicting hypotheses or parameter estimates are apparent (Carothers and Grant 1987;Costanza and Gottleib 1998). My dissertation research has been divided into two separate but related manuscripts. Manuscript #1 describes the development of an individual-based model (IBM) that is an effort to estimate the annual influence of environmental conditions on juvenile brown shrimp production in GoM estuaries. Manuscript #2 discusses a field growth study we conducted in three Galveston Bay, Texas marsh ponds. We compared the data from the field study to simulations using the model described in Manuscript #1 in an effort to further evaluate the IBM, and identify factors that may improve model estimates. The life history and population dynamics of brown shrimp have been studied extensively, and processes occurring during the juvenile phase in coastal estuaries appear to be important in determining population size (Zimmerman et al., 2000). Brown shrimp usually spawn and are harvested within one year (Cook and Lindner, 1970). Adults spawn offshore with peak activity from October to December and March to May (Christmas and Etzold, 1977;Renfro and Brusher, 1982). Eggs hatch within 14-18 hours and pass through several larval stages Lindner, 1970, Cook andMurphy, 1971) before moving into estuaries as postlarvae and settling as juveniles in inshore bays (Fry, 2008). Juveniles grow rapidly to sub-adult size and then migrate offshore to complete their growth to maturity (Trent, 1967). Young brown shrimp in the northern Gulf of Mexico utilize shallow estuarine habitats and grow from postlarvae (10-15 mm TL) to subadults (55-80 mm TL) within a few months (Cook and Lindner, 1970). * Reprinted with permission from \"Simulating environmental effects on brown shrimp production in the northern Gulf of Mexico\" by Jennifer P. Leo, Thomas J. Minello, William E. Grant, and Hsiao-Hsuan Wang, 2016, Ecological Modelling, 330, 24-40, Copyright 2016 by Elsevier B.V. While brown shrimp juveniles occur in several habitat types including oyster reef (Stunz et al., 2010) and shallow open water (Fry, 2008;Minello, 1999), highest densities are found in seagrass and salt marsh (Minello et al., 2003;Stokes, 1974). Relatively little seagrass habitat exists in Galveston Bay or in many estuaries of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (Handley et al., 2007), and the majority of brown shrimp are found associated with emergent marsh vegetation (Minello and Rozas, 2002;. Indeed, brown shrimp commercial yield has been correlated on a large scale with the presence of intertidal vegetation (Boesch and Turner, 1984;Turner, 1977). The Galveston Bay system is the largest estuary in the state of Texas, U.S.A. (Figure 2.1) and the salt marshes and shallow water surrounding the bay are particularly important habitats for young shrimp (Minello et al. 2008). Spartina alterniflora is the dominant shoreline vegetation (Minello and Webb, 1997), and this intertidal habitat supports high densities of young brown shrimp when flooded . Some mechanisms linking salt marsh habitats with brown shrimp production have been identified (Zimmerman et al., 2000). Growth of juvenile shrimp is mainly a function of temperature and food availability (Zein-Eldin and Aldrich, 1965), with growth rates commonly reaching 1 mm day -1 (Knudsen et al., 1977). Young brown shrimp feed on benthic invertebrates such as amphipods and polychaete worms Zimmerman, 1991, 1998), which often are most abundant within marsh vegetation (Whaley and Minello, 2002). These studies support the conclusion that growth rates should be highest when the vegetated marsh surface is available for foraging (Minello and Zimmerman, 1991). Shrimp access to the vegetated marsh surface is dependent upon tide height and marsh surface elevation (Childers et al., 1990. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, tides are microtidal (<1 m), predominantly semi-diurnal, and strongly wind driven, resulting in water levels that regularly deviate from predicted tides (Minello et al. 2012;Rozas 1995). The increased growth rates associated with access to the vegetated marsh surface also may reduce the total time shrimp are available to predators (Rozas and Zimmerman, 2000), since mortality rates due to predation appear to decrease as shrimp grow (Minello et al., 1989). Fish predation appears to be the primary source of mortality of young brown shrimp (Minello et al. 1989;Minello and Zimmerman, 1983), and vegetative structure also provides protection from such predation, likely resulting in greater survival when on the marsh surface (Kneib, 1995;Orth et al., 1984;Minello et al., 2003). Salinity effects on shrimp survival and growth are less clear. Laboratory experiments have shown little correlation between shrimp growth and salinity (Zein-Eldin, 1963, Zein-Eldin andAldrich, 1965), but caging experiments along a salinity gradient in Barataria Bay, Louisiana suggest that low salinities result in slower growth rates in estuarine habitats (Rozas and Minello, 2011). Brown shrimp production from the Galveston Bay system, or any given bay system in the northern Gulf of Mexico, is highly variable from year to year. Hence, it is difficult to predict annual commercial harvests from the Gulf or to assess the current status of brown shrimp stocks. The recent Habitat Assessment Improvement Plan (HAIP) of the NMFS calls for adjustments to the current stock assessment methodology, and the improvement of fisheries management through the integration of habitat science (Yoklavich et al., 2010). Since recruitment of juveniles to the fishery appears dependent upon processes that take place during the estuarine phase of the shrimp life cycle, the incorporation of juvenile habitat effects on production should support a more complete stock assessment methodology. Several recent models using a variety of approaches have focused on the production of juvenile brown shrimp. These have ranged in complexity from a relatively simple spatial density model estimating brown shrimp production from Galveston Bay marshes using an equilibrium yield approach (Minello et al., 2008), to a bioenergetics model examining the potential impacts of freshwater diversions of the Mississippi River on the production of juvenile brown shrimp (Adamack et al., 2012), to spatially-explicit individual-based models (IBMs) investigating the effects of habitat fragmentation and inundation on brown shrimp production (Haas et al., 2004;Roth et al., 2008). These IBMs simulate individual shrimp movements at a high spatial resolution (1 m 2 cell size) over relatively small areas (1 -25 ha), and require long simulation times on relatively sophisticated computers. In this paper, we present a spatially-explicit, individual-based model which simulates the cumulative effects of temperature, salinity, and access to emergent marsh vegetation on the growth and survival of young brown shrimp. We developed our model to estimate annual shrimp production from bay systems in the northern Gulf of Mexico and parameterized the model using 30 years of environmental data for Galveston Bay. We first describe model structure and function (Section 2), model calibration (Section 3), baseline simulations (Section 4), and sensitivity analyses (Section 5). We then use the model to explore the uncertainty in estimations of shrimp production resulting from uncertainty in the timing of shrimp recruitment to the bay system (Section 6). Model production also was compared with abundance (CPUE) estimates from Galveston Bay and coastal Gulf waters as one means of assessing model performance (Section 7)."}, {"section_title": "Model description", "text": "The model, which is spatially-explicit and individually-based, simulates the biomass production of brown shrimp in salt marsh habitats of the northern Gulf of basis; their distribution is based on relative densities observed in salinity-habitat combinations (Minello 1999). No shrimp are recruited directly into marsh habitat. A Rules representing the movement of individuals, described in the preceding paragraph, are probabilistic. Each hour when the marsh is flooded, each individual located in either the marsh or the non-vegetated marsh edge has a 69% probability of moving to a cell with the same salinity in the marsh vegetation and a 31% probability of moving to a cell with the same salinity in the non-vegetated marsh edge. If there is no cell with the same salinity, the individual moves into a cell with the salinity closest to the salinity of the cell from which it moved. Thus, any given individual may move back and forth between these two areas during periods of marsh flooding, but is likely to spend slightly more than twice as much of this time in the marsh vegetation. These values were based on relative densities in these habitats at flood tide reported by Minello et al. (2008). Growth is a function of the water temperature, salinity, and habitat type (i.e., marsh, non-vegetated marsh edge, shallow open water) to which an individual is which is different for each of the three habitats (1.28, 1.14, and 1.0 for marsh, nonvegetated marsh edge, and shallow open water, respectively). These values are based on based on experimental growth rates from field studies and infaunal prey distributions (Minello and Zimmerman, 1991;Rozas and Minello, 2011;Whaley and Minello, 2002) Mortality (probability of dying) is a function of a base instantaneous rate (0.00083 hr -1 ) multiplied by two indexes representing 1) a shrimp size effect and 2) a habitat effect (Figure 2.3). Mortality is reduced as shrimp grow, and the size effect is calculated as 53.092 * (total length in mm) -1.1163 . The habitat effect is represented as a constant, which is different for marsh vegetation (0.69) versus the two areas of nonvegetated water (1.38). Input data required by the model for each calendar year being simulated include 1) current elevation of the marsh edge 2) hourly tide heights, 3) daily median air temperatures, and 4) monthly distribution of salinity zones among habitat types for the calendar year being simulated.

Mean annual (January through August) production ranged from 27.5 kg ha -1 in 1997 to 43.5 kg ha -1 in 2012, with an overall mean of 34.8 (\u00b1 0.70 SE) kg ha -1 (Figure 2.7, see Figure A2.1, Appendix 2, for results of individual simulations)."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity analyses", "text": "We examined the sensitivity of model estimates of annual brown shrimp production to changes of \u00b110% relative to baseline in values of key model parameters (growth rate, probability of mortality, and probability of moving into marsh vegetation of individual shrimp) and values of environmental input data (tide heights, median air temperatures). We also performed simulations in which the salinity of the entire bay was designated low (0-10 PSU), intermediate (10-20 PSU), or high (>20 PSU). For all analyses we ran 10 replicate stochastic simulations of each scenario for each year from 1983 through 2012 and compared the mean production of the treatment to the corresponding year's mean baseline value (Table 2."}, {"section_title": "1).

Seasonal trends in relative population size and structure were verified against field data collected in Galveston Bay at Galveston Island State Park (GISP) from 1982-1992 (Rozas et al., 2007). We compared field data to our model output of the monthly mean size of shrimp, the size frequency distribution, the population size, and the standing biomass. Since the GISP data were used to derive some of our growth and mortality parameters (Minello et al., 1989;Minello et al., 2008;Roth et al. 2008 et al., 2007), we used the comparisons as a method of verifying that the model processes were reproducing patterns that characterize the systems internal organization. The modeled monthly means for shrimp size, and standing biomass followed patterns similar to the GISP data set (Figures 2.9 and 2.10). Size distributions also were similar over time. Minello et al. (2008) estimated a mean standing crop of 19,382 shrimp ha -1 in the polyhaline marsh complex over the period of April through November. Our model estimates a mean of 22,848 shrimp ha -1 in the polyhaline marsh (Zone 3) over the period of April through August for the years 1893 through 2012. We estimated that secondary production lost to predation (shrimp that die in the model) was a mean of 28% of the total production (kg ha -1 ). This is less than the estimate from Roth et al. (2008) of 37%. Several data sets estimating brown shrimp abundance were used to evaluate our model output. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department collects shrimp using trawls at random locations in Galveston Bay every month (Brown et al., 2013;Martinez-Andrade et al., 2005), and monthly catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from 1982 through 2011 were available for model comparisons. Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) summer trawl surveys provided another fishery independent source of abundance data (CPUE) available for most years of our simulations . We looked for general trends in inter-annual variability to facilitate comparison of our modeled production estimates (kg ha -1 ) against catch data. From 1982 through 2011, the mean size of shrimp caught by the TPWD trawls was 87.4 mm TL (Brown et al., 2013), and we assumed that their samples represented shrimp that had recently left the marsh complex and moved into open bay habitats. We compared TPWD CPUE from March through September with the modeled monthly production in kg ha -1 (Figure 2.11), and there are similarities in the seasonal pattern. Months of peak production in the model generally coincided with months of peak CPUE. Our estimates of annual production only include production through August, since TPWD data show that there are very few brown shrimp caught in the bay after this time. Annual variability in modeled production was lower than expected when compared to TPWD data, and there was a poor relationship between our annual model output and TPWD mean CPUE for each year. A linear regression was not significant with an R 2 value of only 0.005. SEAMAP trawl surveys follow a stratified random sampling method and sample across the northwestern GoM from near shore out to the border of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Linear regression analysis of SEAMAP summer survey CPUE with our model's annual output was significant (p = 0.0005) and had an R 2 of 0.40 ( Figure 2.12). Since the SEAMAP summer survey is conducted in June and July, we also examined the relationship with our model output up until May of each year from 1987 through 2012. We expect shrimp that emigrated from the marsh complex in May would be available to the SEAMAP survey in June and July. The May model output has a mean production of 9.2 kg ha -1 , is more variable than the August production estimates, and ranges from 3.5 to 18.8 kg ha -1 . Regression analysis of the model's May production with the SEAMAP summer CPUE was significant (p = 0.002) and had an  The importance of interaction between environmental conditions within and outside the bay system in generating this year-to-year variability in brown shrimp production was emphasized by simulations in which we shifted the seasonality of recruitment. Over the range of seasonal shifts simulated (from 28 days earlier to 42 days later in the year), the lowest production estimate was approximately 70 percent of the highest estimate. These simulations suggest that shifts in seasonality of recruitment caused by environmental conditions outside the bay may cause differences in production in any given year equal to those resulting from differences in environmental conditions within the bay. Furthermore, although earlier recruitment generally results in relatively lower production and later recruitment in relatively higher production (undoubtedly temperature-related), recruitment delayed beyond some threshold, which depends on conditions within the bay, may result in relatively lower production. In our simulations, waters (Benfield and Downer, 2001;Wenner et al., 1998). Additionally, brown shrimp may actively delay their emigration from the Gulf to shallow water habitats in response to cold frontal passages via vertical migration (Rogers et al., 1993). Hughes (1969) suggested that pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum sense changes in salinity and tide state as cues to enter estuaries, and Blanton et al. (1999) found evidence that white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferous likely utilize a set of cues that include tidal phase, water temperature, and wind. It also has been suggested that timing of recruitment may be affected by endogenous rhythms that control the swimming activity of postlarval penaeids (Ogburn et al., 2013). Superimposed on effects of timing of recruitment on shrimp production are effects of differences in magnitude of recruitment, which we held constant in all our simulations. This simplifying assumption facilitated identification of the relative effects on production of environmental conditions within the bay, in which we were most interested. This assumption could be relaxed in future work with the model. Data from years of sampling postlarvae entering Galveston Bay (Matthews, 2008) suggest that annual peak abundances may be as much as 80 times the mean annual abundance, and peak annual population estimates of small shrimp (12-20 mm total length) based on data collected at the Galveston Island State Park over an 11-year sampling period differed by as much as five times (Rozas et al., 2007). Our model calibration exercises suggested a linear relationship between model estimates of shrimp production and total number of shrimp recruited during a simulation. However, this linear relationship results from our representation of the growth, mortality, and movements of individual shrimp as being independent of shrimp population density. These also are simplifying assumptions that could be relaxed in future work with the model, perhaps drawing on some of the belowmentioned studies.  (Beseres and Feller, 2007;Zimmerman et al., 2000). Field caging experiments have shown some evidence of food limitation of growth (Rozas and Minello, 2009;Rozas et al., 2014), and as shrimp population density increases, per capita availability of food will become limiting at some point. Documenting a densitydependent effect on shrimp growth, however, is difficult because brown shrimp may move to avoid areas of low prey density and may consume alternate food items such as benthic algae and phytoplankton during periods of low infaunal abundance (Gleason, 1986;Gleason and Wellington, 1988;Gleason and Zimmerman, 1984). Brown shrimp mortality appears to result mainly from predation, and laboratory experiments do not suggest a strong relationship between brown shrimp density and mortality (Minello et al., 1989). While the functional response of fish predators may be affected by shrimp density (Holling, 1959), it is likely that such a relationship is sizerelated, since smaller shrimp are found in higher densities than larger shrimp; our model includes a size-related mortality function. However, seasonal and annual changes in fish predator abundance (Minello and Zimmerman, 1983;Overstreet and Heard, 1978;Rooker et al., 1998) likely change predation rates. The abundance and composition of brown shrimp predators also differs spatially within Galveston Bay, as well as among other bays of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Nelson et al., 1992). Primary assumptions in our model are that brown shrimp abundance and growth are higher in salt marsh vegetation than in shallow open water. High densities of brown shrimp on the marsh surface and particularly at the marsh edge have been consistently found in Galveston Bay and other Texas estuaries (Minello et al., 2008, but this pattern may not occur in all estuarine systems and may be related to tidal flooding characteristics (Minello et al., 2012;Rozas and Minello 2015). Information on habitat-related shrimp growth is limited, but there is some evidence from caging experiments that brown shrimp growth is increased in marsh vegetation Zimmerman 1991, Rozas andMinello, 2009). Populations of benthic infaunal prey also are higher in marsh vegetation than adjacent open water and generally highest at the marsh edge (Whaley and Minello, 2002). This edge effect has not been incorporated into our model, and the model could perhaps be improved by separating marsh edge habitat from the rest of the marsh. Delineation of the area of marsh edge habitat, as opposed to the area of marsh vegetation inundated at high tides, as currently represented in our model, would require finer-scale spatial resolution of habitat distribution in the bay. Such an approach would allow us to simulate the effect of changes in marsh edge on shrimp production, but the explicit inclusion of such fine spatial resolution also would result in longer simulation run times. Future work with the model will be directed at potential incorporation of modeled environmental effects into the Gulf of Mexico brown shrimp stock assessment model (SS-3, Hart, 2012). We expect to explore the relative benefits of relaxing some current model assumptions and also re-parameterize the model to represent conditions in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Linking living marine resources and their habitat is essential to fisheries stock management (Yoklavich et al., 2010). Ultimately, we hope our model will provide a useful tool, both conceptually and quantitatively, for exploring the linkages between environmental conditions in estuarine nursery habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico and the production of shrimp species utilizing these habitats (Beck et al. 2001;Boesch and Turner, 1984 (Fry, 2008;Minello et al., 1989); adults spawn offshore and postlarvae are transported by currents to estuarine habitats (Cook and Lindner, 1970;Temple and Fischer, 1967). Juveniles grow rapidly for several months in estuaries before they emigrate offshore as subadults (Christmas and Etzold, 1977;Renfro and Brusher, 1982). The inshore, estuarine-dependent phase is a period of high and variable growth rates and likely determines overall shrimp production and fishery yield (Haas et al., 2001;Minello et al., 1989;Minello and Zimmerman, 1991). In Leo et al. (2016) we described an individual-based model (IBM) that uses temperature, salinity, and access to estuarine salt marsh habitat to estimate brown shrimp production from the shallow waters of Galveston Bay, TX. The growth rate of shrimp at an hourly time step is an important aspect of the model and has a large influence on production estimates. Additionally, since mortality rates are size-dependent, shrimp that grow faster are more likely to survive. All of the environmental drivers in the model affect growth, including temperature, salinity, and tidal access to salt marsh habitat. The model has reproduced biomass and size distribution patterns observed in data from Galveston Bay from 1983 to 2012, and the annual production estimates correlate with fishery independent estimates of abundance from offshore northern GoM trawls. There was no correlation, however, between model production estimates and trawl data collected in Galveston Bay. These comparisons between the model output and field studies suggest that although temperature, salinity, and flooding patterns may influence production generally from estuaries along the northern GoM, there are other factors affecting production that are spatially and temporally variable within individual bays. Juvenile shrimp are known to feed on benthic infauna from marsh sediments Zimmerman, 1991, 1998), and the abundance and biomass of infauna are highest within the marsh vegetation (Whaley and Minello, 2002). Although growth increases in our IBM when shrimp are within vegetated habitat, there is no explicit relationship between infaunal biomass and shrimp growth (Leo et al. 2016). Since infaunal abundance, composition, and biomass can be both spatially and temporally variable (Manino and Montagna, 1997;Whaley and Minello 2002), we identified infaunal distribution as a potential source of variability between modeled growth and observed growth in the field. We conducted a mark-and-recapture study in three marsh ponds to estimate juvenile shrimp growth and further evaluate model performance. During the study period over several months in the spring/summer of 2011we recorded water temperatures and water levels at hourly intervals. Salinity was measured during each tagging interval, and we sampled benthic infauna at the beginning and end of the study. We assessed how well the model estimates of water temperature and tidal flooding of the marsh represented the observed data from the ponds. We compared shrimp growth estimates from the study to estimates from the model and examined benthic infaunal biomass distribution as a potential cause of variability.\nWe ran 10 simulations of the Leo et al. (2016) model using temperature (median air) and tide (Pier 21) data available for 2011. These inputs generated expected hourly temperature and flooding in the model. We plotted the expected temperature values and expected flooding for comparison with observed temperature and flooding values recorded in each pond. We parsed the modeled hourly growth rate output into habitat type, and examined only the output from the marsh complex habitat (marsh vegetation and nonvegetated marsh edge). Then we calculated the mean modeled or expected daily growth rate during the period specific to each pond (Table 3.2). We compared the expected growth rate with the observed growth rate estimate from each pond. We then re-parameterized the model three ways: 1) with observed temperature and flooding inputs specific to each pond; 2) with expected temperatures and pond-specific observed flooding; and 3) with pond-specific observed temperatures and expected flooding. We ran 10 simulations under each of these sets of tide and temperature conditions, and determined the pond-specific expected growth rates.\nThe duration of the growth study at GISP-Small was from April 12 to June 7, 2011. Modeled shrimp growth averaged 1.13 mm d -1 TL (SE = 0.011) during that time. Estimated hourly water temperature ranged from 16.8 to 38.7\u00b0C with a mean of 27.6\u00b0C, which compared well with actual temperatures in GISP-Small (R 2 = 0.827, p < 0.0001, Figure 3.5, Table 3.2). The estimated marsh flooding occurred 77.1% of the time, compared to actual flooding 75.4% of the time at GISP-Small ( Figure 3.6, Table 3.2). Our growth study ran from April 21 to June 1 at GISP-Large. The mean modeled growth rate was 1.15 mm d -1 TL during that time (Table 3 At Moses Lake, our growth study ran from April 20 to June 2. The mean modeled growth rate was 1.15 mm d -1 TL during that time (Table 3.2). Estimated temperatures ranged from 13.6 to 36.7\u00b0C with a mean of 27.0\u00b0C (   When the water depth reaches 10 cm over the marsh edge, shrimp in the model simulation can move into marsh vegetation. The model predicted marsh flooding correctly 90% of each study period at GISP-Small and GISP-Large, and 82% of the study period at Moses Lake. flooding (Figure 3.6). In the Moses Lake pond, the model correctly predicted flooding 82% of the time. When the model was re-parameterized to use pond-specific actual temperature and flooding values, modeled mean growth rates were 1.22, 1.23, and 1.14 mm d -1 TL for GISP-Small, GISP-Large, and Moses Lake, respectively (Table 3.2). In GISP ponds, simulated growth increased when actual data was used as model input. However, the mean modeled growth rate at Moses Lake was reduced. When we used a combination of estimated temperature and pond-specific actual flooding values, the modeled mean growth rates were 1.15, 1.17, and 1.13 mm d -1 TL for GISP-Small, GISP-Large, and Moses Lake, respectively. In both GISP pond simulations, this resulted in higher modeled growth rates than when we used exclusively estimated values, but slower growth rates than using exclusively actual values. The combination of estimated temperature and actual flooding values further depressed Moses Lake's modeled growth rates. When we used actual temperature values and estimated flooding, the mean modeled growth rates were 1.21, 1.20, and 1.16 mm d -1 TL for GISP-Small, GISP-Large, and Moses Lake, respectively (Table 3.2). Again, GISP pond modeled growth rates were higher than those in simulations using exclusively estimated values but not as high as when using exclusively actual data. Moses Lake modeled growth rates were highest using this combination of input data."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site selection and characterization", "text": "We selected three marsh ponds for our growth study.

The park is located along the shore of West Bay, a polyhaline water body of the Galveston Bay estuary (Rozas and Minello, 2009), and we designated the study ponds as GISP-Small and GISP-Large based on their relative sizes.

We collected sediment cores at 10 sites at each of three distances from the marsh edge: 1 m into the vegetation, 1 m into the nonvegetated pond, and 5 m into the nonvegetated pond. We selected these collection sites randomly along the length of the marsh edge interface. At each site we randomly collected three 5-cm diameter sediment cores from within a 1-m 2 quadrat and then pooled the three cores for further analysis.

(2016) model is a spatially-explicit IBM that simulates the cumulative effects of temperature, salinity, and access to emergent marsh vegetation on the growth and survival of young brown shrimp. The model is parameterized to represent the environmental conditions and habitat characteristics of Galveston Bay, Texas. Individual shrimp recruit to the system and may grow or die on an hourly timestep. Growth is driven by temperature, salinity, and habitat, while mortality is driven by size (mm TL) and habitat. Depending on the tide height, shrimp may move between vegetated and nonvegetated habitats at each time step. Shrimp that move into vegetated habitat benefit from a slight growth rate increase, and mortality risk decrease. All of the environmental drivers in the model affect growth including salinity, temperature, and tidal access to salt marsh habitat. Salinity input data in the model were developed from a salinity transport model (TxBLEND, Guthrie et al., 2014) that provided monthly estimates of area in each of three salinity zones: zone 1 (0-10), zone 2 (10-20), and zone 3 (>20). While juvenile brown shrimp can tolerate a wide salinity range (Saoud and Davis, 2003;Simmons, 1957;Zein-Eldin and Aldrich, 1965;Zein-Eldin and Renaud, 1986), they are found at highest densities in mesohaline (zone 2) and polyhaline (zone 3) regions of estuaries (Haas et al., 2001;Rozas and Minello, 2010;Zimmerman et al., 1990). For the purpose of comparing model output with our growth study, in which all three ponds remained polyhaline, all cells in the model were parameterized with zone 3 salinity. In all salinity zones, growth rates increase with temperature, peak around 30\u00b0C, and then slow substantially. Expected hourly water temperature values are determined by the model using the median daily air temperature (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdoweb/datatools) and relationships developed with daily median water temperature and a diel pattern of deviation from that median. Flooding of the marsh surface gives shrimp access to additional infaunal prey for increased growth (Roth et al., 2008;Whaley and Minello, 2002) and is a function of both tidal dynamics and marsh topography (Minello et al., 2012;Rozas, 1995). The model determines expected marsh flooding by comparing the elevation of marsh edge in Galveston Bay with hourly water level data from the NOAA tide gauge located at Pier 21 in the Galveston ship channel (station ID 8771450, https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8771450). When the tide gauge reads 10 cm higher than the marsh edge elevation, the vegetated marsh habitat cells become accessible to the modeled shrimp. The tide/elevation relationship is adjusted annually in the model for the effects of relative sea level rise. Appendix 1 in Leo et al. (2016) provides a complete model description in ODD protocol."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "We calculated mean growth rates for recovered shrimp in each of the three ponds.

The model was constructed to estimate annual production of brown shrimp from intertidal and shallow water estuarine marsh habitat. The model's estimate of mean growth rates during the field study was similar to growth rates observed in the field, demonstrating that the model is useful in predicting growth of brown shrimp at least within the tide and temperature parameters observed within the field study period. The mark-and-recapture approach to measuring shrimp growth in the field has the potential to overestimate growth through the selection of faster growing animals for recapture since survival rates are size dependent, and slower growing shrimp may experience higher mortality than relatively faster growing shrimp. Individual growth rate values observed from our recaptured shrimp however, were normally distributed and in a wide range (0.29 to 1.86 mm d -1 ). Additionally, our mean estimates of growth rate are comparable to the results of brown shrimp growth experiments using a variety of methodologies: field caging, laboratory growth experiments, von Bertalanffy growth curve construction, and other methods of mark-recapture (Chavez, 1973;Knudson et al., 1977;Rozas and Minello, 2011;Zein-Eldin, 1963). In the model, growth is driven by temperature and marsh flooding. The temperature submodel based on median air temperature performed well when we compared estimated temperature values with actual data from the individual ponds (R 2 = 0.827, 0.826, and 0.772 for GISP-Small, GISP-Large, and Moses Lake, respectively). In general, actual pond temperature maxima were cooler than estimated temperature maxima (Figure 3.5). The tide submodel determines when the marsh vegetation is flooded based on elevation data. Edge elevation profiles from all three ponds are well within the estimated mean edge elevations of Spartina marshes in Galveston Bay (Minello et al., 2012(Minello et al., , 2015. We compared the estimated tidal pattern of marsh to actual flooding in the individual ponds. The model predicted that marsh habitat would be flooded 77.1% of the time. This is similar to the GISP-Small actual flooding 75.4% of the time and GISP-Large flooding 78.2% of the time. Actual flooding at Moses Lake however, was 63.8% of the time. GISP-Small and GISP-Large modeled growth rates were over-estimated and modeled growth rates at Moses Lake were underestimated when compared to observed growth. The difference in actual versus estimated temperatures may explain the relatively slower growth rate observed in shrimp recaptured from GISP ponds, but the mean growth rate observed in Moses Lake was significantly higher than estimed by the model while temperatures were similar among the three ponds. We did not find a relationship between observed growth rates and actual water temperatures in the ponds. This result is likely due to the small range of mean daily temperatures that occurred over the period of the field study. When we used actual data in the model, the modeled growth rates increased at both GISP ponds. Since actual temperatures were cooler than estimated temperatures, modeled growth rates were probably higher due to the shrimp spending more time at optimal temperatures and less time at temperatures above 30\u00b0C at which point, growth slows considerably (see Leo et al., 2016). Simulations of Moses Lake using actual data resulted in slightly slower modeled growth than when using estimated values. This change was likely due to the decreased access to vegetated habitat. We would expect to see a slower growth rate because of the slightly limited marsh access, and when we parameterized the model with actual values, modeled Moses Lake growth rates were lower than those of either GISP pond. The observed mean growth rate at Moses Lake though, was significantly higher those observed at either the GISP pond, as well as the modeled mean growth rate. Although the modeled growth rates were similar to the observed mean growth of all tagged and recaptured shrimp (1.06 mm d -1 TL), we did see variability between observed growth rates in the ponds we studied. This difference suggests that growth rate is not strictly predicted by temperature and flooding patterns. Although shrimp in Moses Lake were exposed to lower temperatures than predicted by the model, as well as fewer opportunities to enter the marsh, they grew at a significantly higher rate than those in the model simulations. Additionally, there was very little hourly difference between temperatures observed in GISP ponds and those in Moses Lake. Not only did the GISP ponds have a similar temperature pattern (on average 0.33\u00b0C warmer), but the lower mean edge elevation resulted in longer and more frequent marsh vegetation flooding. Given those parameters only, one would expect estimates of growth rate at Moses Lake to be lower than that of either GISP pond. Still, the mean growth rate estimate at Moses Lake was significantly higher. We recognize that brown shrimp growth rates are dependent upon more complex interactions than those of tide and temperature, but the discrepancy between our modeled growth and observed growth becomes more apparent when scaling down from the whole of Galveston Bay to a single marsh pond. The model does not include parameters describing infaunal biomass, the main food source of brown shrimp (McTigue and . Whaley and Minello (2002) described a spatial pattern of benthic abundance at different distances from the marsh edge wherein abundance is highest in the first meter of vegetation. They also described a temporal pattern in which abundance is higher in spring and declines toward the end of summer (presumably the result of predation during the high tides of spring and summer). If infaunal prey availability is a primary driver of growth, then the significantly higher growth rate seen in Moses Lake shrimp could be explained by the significantly higher infaunal biomass sampled there. Although shrimp in Moses Lake experienced shorter periods of marsh vegetation flooding, the vegetated marsh sampled at Moses Lake had greater than three times the amount of annelid and crustacean biomass (Figure 3.3) than the vegetated marsh sampled at GISP ponds. This elevated infaunal biomass in the vegetated habitat may have been higher than the biomass on nonvegetated bottom as a result of a shorter period of flooding limiting shrimp access. However, the samples taken at 1 m and 5 m from the edge in the nonvegetated habitat also contained significantly more infaunal biomass than their counterparts in both GISP ponds. Therefore, it seems more likely that patterns of infaunal abundance vary among marsh locations within Galveston Bay and may significantly drive brown shrimp growth rates. Understanding what causes this variability, and to what extent it affects growth, has the potential to improve the quality of the brown shrimp production model."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The utility of ecological models is found in both the process of model development, as well as in the model itself (Grant and Swannack, 2008). While some ecological models have proven to be useful in predicting ecosystem changes, much of the discovery about system dynamics can be gleaned through the design and development of a model. The iterative progression in model development requires the designer to identify, examine, and quantify complex ecological linkages, and these are sometimes ephemeral and oftentimes unknown. Bounding the system of interest forces the designer to assess which cause-and-effect relationships are most influential to the question they are trying to answer, and what could be considered excessive detail. The resulting model is hopefully useful in its predictive capacity, but such models can be even more useful in their ability to identify knowledge gaps and potential leverage points as well as to compare conflicting hypotheses. The Leo et al. (2016) brown shrimp model output resulted in highly variable estimates of annual sub-adult production from Galveston Bay. Production increases were associated with parameters that increased individual shrimp growth and reduced mortality rates. Estimated production from Galveston Bay was significantly related to estimates of offshore, adult shrimp population size and may represent generic production trends in bays of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Model output, however, did not compare well with trawl data estimating shrimp abundance from Galveston Bay. This discrepancy requires us to look for a potential explanation within the design of the model. The current relationships between drivers and vital rates reflect values found in the published literature. There are, however, parameters that were excluded from the model (e.g., density dependent growth and mortality, spatial and temporal distribution of infauna) because there is a lack of data describing such linkages to brown shrimp vital rates. This becomes an issue when the model is scaled down to a single marsh pond. At that small relative scale, model estimates of growth rate were not similar to observed growth rates in our study ponds. Furthermore, observed growth rates were not similar among ponds (GISP v. Moses Lake). These differences indicate that some parameter, functioning at the pond-specific scale, has not been accounted for in the model. My results suggest that adding information on spatial and temporal variability in infaunal populations would likely improve the model. At the larger, bay scale, there is question as to the timing and magnitude of recruitment. Drivers of these parameters are outside of the bounds of the currently modeled system, however sensitivity analyses revealed that changes in either timing or magnitude of recruitment have a substantial effect on annual production estimates. Future research priorities designed to improve the model output might include addressing the spatial and temporal distribution of benthic infauna, the abundance and temporal variability of brown shrimp predators, and factors that affect the timing and magnitude of larval shrimp recruitment to the bay. Since stock assessment results provide the technical basis for setting acceptable fishing pressure, it is necessary to use the highest quality and most complete input data available (NMFS 2001), and it is imperative to incorporate the effects of habitat characteristics on the overall productivity of managed fishery stocks. Simulation modeling of system dynamics allows for these types of adjustments (Ford, 2010;Meadows, 2008;Grant and Swannack, 2008).

Salt marshes provide refuge from predators (Minello, 1993;Minello et al., 1989;Minello and Zimmerman, 1983) and abundant food to support rapid growth Zimmerman, 1991, 1998;Whaley and Minello, 2002). Here, we model the cumulative effects of these linkages."}, {"section_title": "Emergence", "text": "Population size, standing biomass, and size structure emerge from the model processes controlling growth, mortality, and movement of individuals.

The total population of shrimp in the bay, the shrimp density within each habitat type and salinity zone, and the standing biomass can be observed from the model. The production of shrimp per hectare of marsh complex and per hectare of shallow water also can be observed, as can the number of shrimp recruited to the open bay population.

The estimate of the average elevation of the marsh edge in 2013 was based on tide gauge station data from measurements at 12 marshes in 2013 (http://coops.nos.noaa.gov/). This elevation is adjusted for the year being simulated based on estimated changes due to relative sea level rise (Figure 5a).  Figures 2.1 and 2.2. The 100 habitat cells, each representing 1% of the total modeled area in Galveston Bay, were identified based on a GIS analysis of 2006 USFWS National Wetland Inventory (NWI) data and a bathymetry analysis for the bay. Habitat types from this analysis were classified as either marsh vegetation, or shallow water. Previous analyses in Galveston Bay estimated that the water (ponds and creeks) included within the marsh complex was 1.63 times the amount of vegetated area (Minello et al., 2008). We used this multiplier to estimate the total amount of water associated with the marsh vegetation identified in the NWI for the bay. The marsh complex, therefore, consisted of 45 patches (17 patches of marsh and 28 patches of NVME), with the remaining 55 patches of SOW. The appropriate number of cells in each habitat type is assigned to a particular salinity zone based on a GIS analysis of the TxBLEND model output for the month (see section on input data below)."}, {"section_title": "Input data (Figure A1.1)", "text": "Hourly tide heights, daily median air temperatures, monthly distribution of salinity zones among habitat types, and daily recruitment numbers are read from external files. We developed these input data for Galveston Bay based on analyses of data collected over the 30-year period from 1983 to 2012. Hourly tide heights (Figure 2.5b) were based on tide data from the Pier 21 NOAA tide gauge (NOAA Tides and Currents https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8771450). Daily median air temperatures (Figure 2.5c) were obtained from the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information, (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search). Monthly salinity values for each of the three salinity zones (Figure 2.5d), as well as the numbers of cells representing each salinity zone, were based on TxBLEND modeling of the Galveston Bay system (Guthrie et al., 2014). Salinity zones were categorized as low (0-10 PSU), medium (10-20 PSU), or high (>20 PSU) and salinities within these zones, as well as distribution cells representing these zones, were estimated monthly based on TxBLEND output. We assumed that daily salinities did not vary within months. Daily recruitment numbers (Figure 2.5e) were based on several studies of the magnitude and timing of postlarval recruitment, as well as our unpublished data, which indicated that shrimp begin to move through the passes into the bays in mid-March with peak recruitment numbers occurring in April (Baxter and Renfro, 1967;Berry and Baxter, 1969;Matthews, 2008). Abundance patterns from drop sampler data recorded monthly and bi-monthly over 11 years in the marsh complex within Galveston Island State Park indicated that abundance of settlers appears to peak two weeks after the average peak of postlarvae entering the bay (Rozas et al., 2007). We used the temporal pattern of recruitment from the passes with a delay of two weeks as a recruitment pattern for shrimp to the marsh. Since shrimp density in Galveston Bay differs depending on habitat type and salinity (Minello, 1999;Minello et al., 2008), we distributed the recruited shrimp among habitat cells based on the current spatial distribution of habitat types and salinity zones using a standardized relative density matrix (described in Table   A1.1). (Figure A1.1) 3.3.1 Update salinity zones (low, medium, high) The number of cells in each salinity zone in each habitat type is updated monthly based on input data, with each cell assigned a salinity zone probabilistically based on its habitat type and a salinity corresponding to its salinity zone (see data input section)."}, {"section_title": "Submodels", "text": "Relative densities observed in the field.

We first calculated mean hourly deviations of field data from mean daily water temperatures by month. Next we developed monthly regressions between the non-vegetated water temperature and the median daily air temperature. We then estimated hourly non-vegetated water temperatures functions by month and hour. Finally, we estimated hourly vegetated water temperatures based on an empirical relationship between the vegetated water temperature data and non-vegetated water temperature data."}, {"section_title": "Update tide height and calculate marsh flooding", "text": "Hourly tide height (Figure 2.5b) is based on hourly tide station data (NOAA gauge 8771450, Galveston Pier 21) and is used to determine if the marsh surface is flooded. In 2013, we measured flooding rates in twelve salt marshes of Galveston Bay, and related average water level at the marsh edge to an elevation of 1.477 m on the Pier 21 gauge (station datum). If the station datum was 10 cm higher than this marsh edge height in 2013, we considered the marsh to be flooded and accessible to brown shrimp. For other years, we adjusted this level on the Pier 21 gauge to account for relative sea level rise over the period of our model runs (Figure 2.5a). The bay experienced relatively high levels of subsidence over this period due to oil and groundwater extraction (Feagin et al., 2005). We plotted mean sea level on the Pier 21 gauge from 1970-2014 and determined that relative sea level on the station datum increased 5.4 mm/year over that period. We therefore adjusted the elevation of the marsh edge in relation to the gauge by this amount each year. This adjustment assumes that the gauge and the marshes are sinking relative to sea level at the same rate, and that the vertical location of the marsh edge is mainly determined by an inability of S. alterniflora to withstand further tidal inundation (McKee and Patrick, 1988;Minello et al., 2012;Tiner, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Calculate shrimp movements", "text": "Shrimp move between the NVME and marsh when the latter is flooded. Shrimp in the marsh move to the NVME when the former no longer is flooded. Shrimp in the SOW do not leave that area. Shrimp growth, emigration, and mortality occur in all areas, with growth rates and mortality probabilities differing among areas (and also depending on temperature and salinity, see Figure 2.3). The quantitative representations of movement, growth, mortality, and emigration of individual shrimp included in the model are summarized schematically in Figure 2.3. Rules representing the movement of individuals, described in the preceding paragraph, are probabilistic. If the marsh is flooded, each hour each individual located in either the marsh or the NVME has a 69% probability of moving to a cell with the same salinity in the marsh and a 31% probability of moving to a cell with the same salinity in the NVME. If there is no cell with the same salinity, the individual moves into a cell with the salinity closest to the salinity of the cell from which it moved. Thus any given individual may move back and forth between these two areas during periods of marsh flooding, but is likely to spend slightly more than twice as much of this time in the marsh."}, {"section_title": "Calculate shrimp mortality", "text": "Mortality (probability of dying) is a function of a base rate (0.00083 / hr) multiplied by two indexes representing (1) a size (of the individual) effect and (2) a habitat effect (Figure 2.3). The size effect is based on total length (53.092 * (total length in mm) -1.1163 ). Thus mortality decreases exponentially as total length increases, following the pattern described by Roth et al. (2008) and supported by field data from Minello et al. (1989). The habitat effect is represented as a constant, which is different for marsh vegetation (0.69) versus the two areas of non-vegetated water (1.38). The presence of marsh vegetation reduces brown shrimp mortality (Minello 1993;Minello et al., 1989). There also is some experimental evidence of temperature related mortality. Zein-Eldin and Alderich (1965) reported increased mortality at temperature extremes, especially for brown shrimp in low-salinity water (as high as 80% mortality in 11\u00b0C water that had less than 15 PSU). However, there is limited data on the behavior of shrimp under these conditions in the field, and potentially, they can avoid extreme temperatures through movement to deeper water or by burrowing in the substrate (Aldrich et al., 1968). Thus, we chose not to include temperature-related mortality in the model."}, {"section_title": "Calculate shrimp emigration", "text": "Individuals emigrate when they attain a length of 70 mm (they are recruited at a length of 10 mm) (Cook and Lindner, 1970)."}, {"section_title": "Calculate shrimp growth", "text": "Growth is a function of the water temperature, salinity, and habitat conditions (marsh, NVME, SOW) to which an individual is exposed (Figure 2.3).
