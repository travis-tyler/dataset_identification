[{"section_title": "", "text": "WITHIN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), fast imaging sequences are pivotal for time-critical applications due to their fast and efficient k-space sampling behavior. One particularly efficient sequence is spiral imaging (1). All data are sampled by traversing k-space along a spiral path through use of continuously changing gradients. During the last decades, several variations of spirals have been presented to optimize the spatial-and time-dependent sampling strategy (2)(3)(4)(5). Nevertheless, spiral imaging never became widely accepted in clinical practice. One reason may be that image quality strongly depends on the fidelity of the gradient encoding fields. Diminished or delayed gradient waveforms and linear phase drifts due to gradient field variations result in deformations of the k-space trajectory such as shifts or tilts. These are typically not accounted for by image reconstruction techniques. Instead, perfect gradient fields are assumed and hence idealized k-space trajectories are used. As a result, the reconstructed images often show reduced image quality. Knowledge of the actual gradient field and hence \"real\" k-space trajectory is likely to benefit fast imaging sequences, such as spiral imaging. The k-trajectory can be measured using a variety of calibration techniques. One popular approach is the self-encoding or peak-fitting technique (6 -9). This technique uses different phase-encoding steps prior the gradient waveform under test. Finding the signal maximum for each phase-encoding step derives the temporal behavior of the gradients. Other popular approaches examine signal phase originating from distinct locations within the volume of interest (10 -17). Duyn et al and successors (10 -13) examined the phase evolution of signals acquired from thin slices excited at different off-isocenter positions along the gradient axis of inter-est. By adding a gradient field, the coherent spin phasing changes and is used to determine the gradient field. As this technique is used as reference method, it is given the acronym Duyn calibration technique (DCT). Mason et al (14) proposed using small point phantoms to measure the k-trajectory within a precalibration step. Here, the phantom is manually moved within the bore for each calibration step. Magnetic field monitoring (MFM) (15)(16)(17) is based on an extension of the latter concept, where multiple nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes act as external sensors and take advantage of multireceiver detection in parallel to data acquisition to concurrently measure gradient field variations. DCT is commonly used at different MR research sites to measure and correct for gradient delays in a set of different applications (for typical uses, see Refs. 5,[18][19][20][21]. DCT is fast and easy to implement and adaptable to many different applications. Compared to other methodologies, eg, the self-encoding technique, the calibration itself is very fast. Only one calibration run prior to data acquisition is needed within one experiment. Furthermore, it can be directly performed on the object under test, where no additional calibration phantom is utilized. In addition to the described advantages and established nature of DCT, DCT is based on the same physical principal as MFM. Therefore, DCT is used here as the reference technique. MFM was examined as a correction technique for spiral imaging. For DCT, the calibration takes place before real data acquisition, whereas for MFM the changes in gradient fields are monitored in real time and are repeated for each scan without additional calibration time. Besides the real-time calibration, MFM is sequence-independent, avoiding pulse sequence implementation changes. We established and compared MFM with DCT to determine whether MFM is a viable alternative calibration technique. In addition, the advantages and limitations of MFM over DCT and accuracy tests of the obtained results were investigated using both simulation and phantom experiments. General error sources, eg, timing delays, eddy currents, k-space offsets, and k-trajectory error propagation were evaluated. In addition, image distortions based on signal-tonoise ratio (SNR), object shift, and scaling were determined using a quality assurance phantom. Finally, image quality was assessed by image entropy, a quality metric that allows specifying the texture of the image (22). Finally, the reader is given an overview about implementation and setup, as well as encountered problems in the form of a discussion."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of Calibration Techniques", "text": "Both DCT and MFM derive time-resolved image encoding information by tracking signal phase evolution of a subset of excited spins at different locations according to: and Here, (t) describes the phase evolution of the received or acquired signal over time t with a constant phase offset offset . offset is eliminated by repeating the imaging experiment with inactivated gradients and by subtracting the constant phase from the original signal. \u232cB0 (t) describes the phase errors induced due to timedependent B 0 fluctuations and k(t) the k-space trajectory dependent on time and gradient amplitude G axis in the x or y direction. The latter is primarily considered within this work. For DCT, r describes the offset position of the excited slice, which needs to be within the desired field of view (FOV) to prevent phase wrapping effects and increase to acceptable SNR levels (10). For each axis of interest, the DCT calibration consists of three measurements for two thin slices at equidistant positions from isocenter. The equidistant slice positioning is achieved by negating the slice select gradient only. To ensure that all spins experience the same gradient field variation, the readout gradient waveform is run perpendicular to the excited slice within all calibration steps. The first acquisition runs the calibration with the gradient waveform under test (A calibration). As a second step in the calibration process, for both MFM and DCT, the sequence is run as on the first step, with the only exception that the readout waveform is turned off (B calibration). Finally, the calibration is repeated with negated gradient waveform (C calibration) (Fig. 1a). The final phase evolution can be calculated by combining the phase of the different acquisitions. First, subtracting the B calibrations from the A calibration eliminates offset . Second, subtracting the C calibration difference from positive and negative readout gradient waveform acquisition from the offset corrected phase of the previous step eliminates phase accumulation due to concomitant gradient fields (12,23). Finally, by subtraction of the corrected phase measurements of the two different slices, the phase evolution as described in Eq. [1] is obtained. For MFM, r describes the sensor position and is precalibrated by a conventional gradient echo scan. MFM derives the same image encoding information simultaneously to the data acquisition by using optimized NMR probes acting as external sensors. For 2D imaging, a minimum of three probes is needed to solve for the three unknowns k(t) including x and y as well as \u232cB 0 (t) by inverting the equation system in [1]. 3D experiments, or experiments aiming to solve for higherorder field variations, require more NMR probes (17). The sensors consist of a copper coil conductor (2 mm in diameter) and a water signal droplet (1 mm in diameter, 2 mm long, Fig. 1b). Both are cast into an epoxy block in the form of a long cylinder. Long imaging sequences with high sampling rates require long readout times of the MFM sensors, and hence the sensors must be protected from rapid T2* decay. The water droplet within a small glass capillary is delimited with epoxy plugs. To minimize T2* decay due to susceptibility mismatch, the epoxy is doped with paramagnetic Er3\u03e9 ions. By doing this, epoxy is matched to the susceptibility of water and signal readout times on the order of 120 -200 msec are enabled. Further susceptibility matching techniques have been proposed by Barmet et al (26). The electronic components of the sensors receive system contains tuning and matching capacitors to adjust each coil to the Larmor frequency and match the coil to noise minima of a low noise amplifier. The signal droplet gets excited during image acquisition by the conventional radiofrequency (RF) coil and a signal gets induced into the receive coil. The detected signal is treated as balanced source so that balanced-to-unbalanced (BALUN) techniques are added in the receive system (17). The external sensors must be placed in-plane in order to get excited by the slice-selective RF pulse ( Fig. 1c,d). To sidestep the need for careful placement of MFM probes, it is possible to use transmit/receive probes (24,25), but these were not considered in this work. The external sensors are connected to the receive part of the MR system, as well as the receiver coil, so that data acquisition is fully synchronized. The obtained data from the MFM sensors and receive coil are sampled (every 4 s) and stored in raw data format. This raw data file is used for further postprocessing and image reconstruction. Calibration measurements are dependent on slice thickness and NMR sample size, and are biased by B 0 field inhomogeneity. For larger excitation areas, the phase difference of the excited spins at the slice or droplet edge, respectively, result in nonrecoverable signal losses. The water sample diameter of the MFM sensors was fixed to 1 mm. For comparison reasons, for DCT we picked a slice thickness of 1 mm. For DCT the slices need to be within the object of interest. We determined the optimal slice offset position to be 4 cm. Then, the linear region of the gradient field is covered and no additional inhomogeneity deformations are introduced."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Setup", "text": "The experiments were executed on a 3T GE Signa Excite HD system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) using a precision phantom commonly used for image artifact evaluations (DQA Phantom, Dielectric, Milwaukee, WI). The spiral acquisition is based on a uniform density implementation by Brian Hargreaves (27) implemented in MatLab (MathWorks, Cambridge, MA, v. 7,2005). Based on the large amount of varying spiral implementations and to confirm our evaluations on a phantom designed to measure geometric distortions, a subset of the test series was repeated using the GE product spiral and were executed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Magphan, EMR051, Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY, 2006) phantom (28). Using MFM and DCT, transient B 0 fluctuations can be captured, but does not solve for local inhomogeneities inside the sample, as these are subtracted out by the calibration routine. The two phantoms contain welldefined and specified structures and build a good basis to evaluate image distortions. Table 1 shows the application parameters used for the experiments. For MFM and DCT, a flexible software environment was developed. Different Matlab-designed gradient waveforms can be loaded from external files, bypassing time-con- Figure 1. a: A schematic overview of the DCT calibration process for x direction only. It consists of two steps that are repeated for an opposed second slice. First, the actual gradient waveform under test is examined.

(29) and uses MFM, DCT calibrated, and nominal trajectories (NomT) as input, respectively. Eddy currents are unwanted currents set up in conducting structures near gradient coils causing timedependent field disturbances. Precalibrated system values for gradient waveform preemphasis, and hence eddy current compensation, were taken and used for eddy current simulations based on Ref. (30). The eddy current compensation was turned off during image acquisition to ensure conformity with measured and simulated results. Timing delays of nominal to measured k-space trajectories were experimentally evaluated and corrected through application parameter-dependent time shifts (32). Figure 7 summarizes the results of the three investigated comparison categories: geometric distortions, image quality, and error propagation evaluations. Assessing image quality by looking at the SNR based on mean and standard deviation ratio helps to quantify quality improvements compared to NomT with respect to the used calibration techniques. In addition, image entropy (22) was used as a quality metric within the reconstructed images. Image entropy is defined as E\u03ed\u03ea i p i logp i , where p i summarizes the probability of a given event: here, the occurrence of pixels within the image. It states that the information gained from a pixel with specific probability is inversely related to its probability that this pixel occurs. In general, entropy is a unitless statistical measure of randomness to describe the structure of the image. The smaller the entropy value, the more accurate imaging values are spread within the picture. In addition, geometric distortions were measured based on pixel shifts (presented in mm) and object edge offset calculations (in percent) compared to phantom diameter specifications. The accuracy was compared to 0.5% as established in the phantom studies by Mallozzi et al (28). The measured k-trajectories were evaluated based on sampling distance deviations and k-space offsets compared to NomT (all given in percent). Inter-k-space sampling distances were evaluated based on Euclidean distance calcula-tions to specify the changing timing behavior along the full readout period."}, {"section_title": "Data Evaluation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The results of a multishot spiral sequence (12 arms, 4010 points) with a sampling bandwidth of \u03ee125 kHz and effective resolution of 1.5 mm are presented (UDS in Table 1). The measured and calculated trajectories based on Eqs. [1][2][3] were 15.7 msec long and showed a significant time delay of 8.4 s compared to the designed trajectory (Fig. 7). After correcting the time offset (Fig. 2a,b), and using the two measured k-space trajectories in the image reconstruction, respectively, image quality improved noticeably (Fig. 7). The typical spiral artifacts, blurring, and streaking in the reconstructed image using NomT (arrows in Fig. 3a) were visibly reduced when reconstructed with the measured k-space trajectories via MFM (Fig. 3b) or DCT (Fig. 3c). Although geometric distortions such as object deformations were reduced, DCT reconstructed images still suffer from residual streaking effects, as shown with the bright arrow in Fig. 3c. Within the geometric distortion calculations, the quantitative analysis showed an object shift of 2.3 mm (MFM) and 3.5 mm (DCT) relative to the NomT-reconstructed image. The ADNI group presented a quantitative evaluation of the phantom (28), where an accuracy value of 0.5% was specified and is considered as the reference in this work. The measurement was repeated for MFM only using the ADNI phantom and a conventional product multishot spiral sequence (PS in Table  1). For comparison, images of the phantom were acquired using a spoiled gradient echo scan (SPGR in Table 1). Figure 4b shows the resulting image produced by product reconstruction routines. Figure 4c,d shows the reconstructed images for MFM and NomT. The plotted lines indicate the slice profile, which is also plotted in Fig. 4e, and are used to demonstrate and characterize the object shifts and deformations based on noncalibrated versus calibrated reconstructions. Here, the gradient echo scan was used as the reference. Calculations delivered an object shift of 4.69 mm in the case of NomT, and 1.17 mm for MFM reconstructed images and 1.76 mm for the scanner reconstruction (Fig. 7). Determining maximum pixel intensity by evaluating the first and second derivative for each image line al- lows specifying the object borderline definition in the form of an edge representation. This way, the object deformation calculations were investigated and re-sulted in deviations from 1.87% for NomT, 1.79% for MFM, and 1.61% for DCT. In this example, the limit of 0.5% of accuracy was not achieved. However, a tendency of approximating the real object shape using calibration techniques is given and confirmed within the ADNI phantom experiment. Figure 4f shows the obtained phantom edge calculations for NomT and MFM, respectively. Here, the obtained diameter deviations of 0.74% (NomT), 0.37% (MFM), 0.79% (product sequence), and 0.39% (reference scan: spoiled gradient echo) were achieved, clearly demonstrating the improvement using MFM. Improved image quality is also demonstrated through image entropy. Two values were calculated for a small region of interest (boxes in Fig. 3) and for the whole reconstructed images. Entropy of NomT was 7.1/6.1; for MFM entropy resulted in 6.8/6.1; whereas DCT resulted in entropy values of 6.1/5.9 (box / full image, respectively). The calculated entropy for the spoiled gradient echo reference scan resulted in 2.43/2.41. Interestingly, SNR values were higher for the NomT reconstructed image, SNR \u03ed 14.0, whereas for MFM and DCT reconstructed images the SNR was 11.9 in both cases. Investigating absolute SNR values of the detected signal, where the mean value of the MFM sensors and receiver coils are taken, were 691/1116 at the beginning (MFM/DCT, respectively), whereas at signals end, SNR values of 672 and 431 occurred, resulting in SNR decays of 2.74% for MFM and 61.38% for DCT. Timing delays were evaluated by investigating interk-space sample distances. In case delays exist, the sampling is inaccurate and results in shifted or delayed k-space sample positions. To investigate the occurrence of such a delay, MFM and DCT were compared to the nominal trajectory with correct timings. Calculating the inter-k-space sample distances, deviations of 1.01% (MFM to NomT) and 0.75% (DCT to NomT) were obtained; DCT and MFM behaved alike. Timing delays in both techniques were smaller at the beginning of image acquisition but increased toward the sequence end due to stronger T2* effects at higher spatial frequencies. Calculating variance and standard deviations of a reference scan with no gradients running on both axes, x and y, an expected and acceptable error value was calculated to be 2%. Fitting DCT and MFM onto NomT,  respectively, resulted in errors of 3.33%/3.21% (MFM/ DCT) in the x direction and 2.98%/2.71% (MFM/DCT) in the y direction. Figure 5a,b shows the direct comparison of MFM and DCT within a Bland-Altman plot to compare whether the two measurement methods are in agreement. The upper and lower limits of agreement were determined to be 0.0021 and \u03ea0.0055, respectively, by calculating the mean (d) and standard deviation (s) of the difference of the two methods. The limits are defined as d \u03ee 2*s. By definition, two methods of measurement coincide if the difference between the gained results on the same subject using both methods is small enough to be within the upper and lower limits of agreement (31). The error propagation results are shown for absolute ( Fig. 5a) and phase value (Fig. 5b). The most severe distortions investigated in this study were based on timing delays due to gradient hardware imperfections and synchronization delays of analog-todigital converter and gradient switching. In this study, a time delay in the range of 80.8 s was established. Time delays can be corrected using pulse sequence adjustments and postprocessing strategies such as time shifts based on application parameters, eg, receiver bandwidth. In spiral imaging, increasing timing delays automatically increases blurring and distortions within the reconstructed image. Another reason for k-trajectory deviations is based on the occurrence of eddy currents. The linear term of eddy currents is characterized by their amplitude and timing values that are precalibrated for each system. Based on these values, the gradient waveforms get preemphasized to counteract the eddy current effect and are fed into the gradient amplifier. In this study, the system precalibrated values were used for simulation purposes. The investigated gradient waveform was convolved with the eddy current model as described in Ref. (30). The results clearly demonstrate that eddy currents shift the k-space trajectory about 64.6 s (Fig. 6), which closely matches the value obtained in timing delay evaluations. Figure 6a shows the measured trajectories MFM (circles) and DCT (dots). In addition, the uncorrected NomT (stars) and due to eddy current distortions resulting trajectories (black) are shown. The latter was used in image reconstruction, where image quality severely decreased and alike distortions arose."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In conclusion, the presented investigations show that DCT performs better in terms of closer approximation of the given specification values (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, we have shown that MFM shows similar behavior and performed even better in streaking and blurring reduction as compared to the \"gold standard\" DCT. SNR loss affects DCT stronger than MFM, where the object-dependent calibration might be the cause. Especially for long gradient waveforms with a readout time greater than 30 msec, both methods are sensitive to the T2* decay of the signal. MFM prevents that by improved susceptibilitymatched NMR probes, where T2* times up to 120 msec can be achieved (17). For DCT, slice thickness should be of the size of effective image resolution to prevent fast  MFM is strongly dependent on probe development, including the manufacturing process, eg, the hardware development itself, capillary production, and susceptibility matching. In our setup, air and dust are the limiting factors for the performance of the probes. In order to prevent air bubbles within the capillary, the sealed glass tubes are visually explored using a microscope. Using receive probes leads to setup building times of 1-2 hours for capillary preparation, and another 1-2 hours for probes positioning and evaluation. Capillaries can be used for \u03f71-3 days. Each setup includes a repeated probe evaluation, where T2* decay and SNR of the received signal are determined. Costs for probe manufacturing can be fairly small. With transmit/receive probes, probe adjustment and excitation are dramatically simplified (24,25). Additionally, MFM sensor signals couple into the surface coil, resulting in artifacts such as bright spots outside the object of interest (arrow in Fig. 4a). Especially for MFM, the bright spots are blurred (eg, arrow in Fig. 4c). If the sensors are closely placed to the object of interest, additional artifacts at border areas are intro-duced. Shifting probes further away might be one approach to correct for this effect but results in reduced k-trajectory calibration performance due to the additionally introduced gradient field inhomogeneity, and hence stronger dephasing at border areas of the magnetic bore. Shielded MFM probes or other coupling elimination techniques are highly desirable. Here, first approaches have been shown, for example, in Refs. 16 and 33. In conclusion, we introduce MFM as an effective and accurate correction technique for spiral imaging. Therefore, MFM was compared to DCT, an important k-trajectory calibration technique, which is commonly used to correct for gradient imperfections. The comparison was based on accuracy tests using simulations and phantom experiments, where both MFM and DCT effectively detect k-space offsets and k-trajectory error propagation and correct for general error sources such as timing delays. In object border areas, artifacts such as deformations and blurring were dramatically reduced and were evaluated by measuring SNR loss, entropy increase, and object shift and scaling. Additional simulations, based on system precalibrated eddy current specifications, underlined the usefulness of this technique, because it showed that timing delays might result to the most extent from eddy currents. Different applications call for different correction strategies. The presented results do not provide a definitive answer as to which method is better in all situations. What correction technique fits best to the dependent application needs to be decided by evaluating application characteristics and user capabilities. Spirals are very sensitive to off-resonance due to susceptibility effects at air-tissue interfaces and timing delays. The former was not tested in this work. Compared to spiral imaging, C13 imaging makes use of much stronger gradient systems and longer readout trajectories, eg, Rosette (35). Hence, T2* decay and eddy currents become a limiting factor. MFM seems to be a promising calibration strategy due to its improved probe development with respect to susceptibility-matching and other hardware specific adoptions. In addition, other approaches, eg, external excitation through an MRI add-on toolkit, or even integrated sensors at the MRI system, would help to automate a real-time calibration or, further, gradient system calibration.
