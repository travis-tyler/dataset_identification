[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The most sweeping federal education law in decades, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, requires states to administer standardized exams and to punish schools that do not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for the fraction of students passing these exams. While the literature on school accountability is well-established, there exists no nationwide study of the strong short-term incentives NCLB imposes for schools on the margin of failing AYP. We assemble the first comprehensive, national school-level dataset containing detailed performance measures used to calculate AYP, and demonstrate that idiosyncrasies in state policies create numerous cases where schools near the margin for satisfying their own state's AYP requirements would have almost certainly failed or almost certainly made AYP if they were located in other states. Using this variation as a means of identification, we examine the impact of NCLB on the behavior of school personnel and students' academic achievement in nationally representative samples. We find that accountability pressure from NCLB reduces teachers' perceptions of job security, especially among relatively inexperienced teachers. We also find evidence of reading and math specialist teachers working longer hours, generalist teachers (who teach multiple subjects) working fewer hours, a shift away from whole-class instruction, and reduced instruction in science and social studies. However, we also find that NCLB pressure has either neutral or positive effects on students' enjoyment of learning and their achievement gains on low-stakes exams in reading, math, and science."}, {"section_title": "On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law the No Child Left Behind (NCLB)", "text": "Act, which many consider the most significant federal intervention into education in the United States since the authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. Under NCLB, states were required to adopt school accountability systems based on student proficiency on statewide math and reading exams, and to measure proficiency within student subgroups (e.g., students from low income families, students with limited English proficiency). States must impose escalating sanctions on schools that fail to satisfy Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) requirements for exam proficiency, including allowing students to transfer to other public schools, forcing schools to pay for students from low-income families to enroll in after-school tutoring programs, and, ultimately, closing or restructuring persistently failing schools."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Most prior empirical research on school accountability focuses on the impacts of state and local systems, many of which preceded No Child Left Behind (e.g., Ladd & Zelli, 2002; Hanushek & Raymond, 2005; Chakrabarti, 2007; Rouse et al., 2007; Chiang, 2009; Rockoff & Turner, 2010) . Several studies find evidence that accountability pressure causes schools to reallocate resources in ways that raise average student achievement. However, schools have also been found to shift resources towards students and subjects that are most critical to the accountability rating (e.g., Booher-Jennings, 2005; Reback, 2008; Neal & Whitmore Schanzenbach, 2010) , teach to the test (Jacob, 2005; Figlio & Rouse, 2006) , remove low performing students from the testing pool (Figlio & Getzler, 2006; Figlio, 2006 , Cullen & Reback, 2006 , or cheat (Jacob & Levitt, 2003) .\nKnowledge about the impacts of NCLB is still nascent. Among the few studies that apply rigorous methods, most examine only student performance on high stakes tests in one state or one city (Springer, 2008; Krieg, 2008; Ladd & Lauen, 2010; and Neal & Whitmore Schanzenbach, 2010) . These studies have found that students enrolled in schools failing AYP tend to make greater than expected gains on high-stakes tests, though there is conflicting evidence concerning heterogeneous effects on students at different parts of the performance spectrum. Only two prior studies examine the impact of NCLB incentives in multiple states. Ballou and Springer (2008) examine variation in the grade levels tested for NCLB across seven states and find that students generally perform better on low-stakes exams during 2 years when they took high-stakes tests, particularly for students near the margin of passing their highstakes exams. Dee and Jacob (2011) find that students in states with no prior accountability policies experienced greater increases on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in some grades and subjects after NCLB was introduced. This paper expands on this literature by providing the first nationwide study of the impact of NCLB pressure on teachers and students. We investigate the links between the accountability pressure under NCLB and a wide array of outcomes measured for nationally representative samples. To this end, we assemble a new dataset on the determination of AYP status for schools nationwide during the introduction of NCLB, and use these data to measure the degree to which schools faced moderate or severe risks of failing. We exploit the fact that each state selects its own standardized tests and rules for satisfying AYP, generating numerous cases where a school near the margin for satisfying its own state's AYP requirements would have almost certainly failed or almost certainly passed AYP if it were located in another state. 2 This variation in state policy allows us to implement a cross-sectional identification strategy similar to a difference-in-differences approach. Specifically, we compare differences in outcomes between schools on and away from the AYP margin within a state to differences between similar schools that, because they are in other states, are not on the AYP margin. Our strategy is similar to Tyler et al. (2000) , who estimate the labor market value of a General Educational Development (GED) certificate using cross-sectional variation across states in the score needed to pass the GED exam. But our strategy differs in two ways from Tyler et al. First, we are interested in the pressure faced by schools that were at risk of failure, rather than the impact of passing or failing per se.\n3 Second, Tyler et al. make use of a single nationwide GED test, but, because each state uses a different set of NCLB exams and AYP rules, we must evaluate schools' probabilities of failing AYP on a state-by-state basis.\nWe illustrate this type of variation in Table 1 , which presents summary statistics for two similar pairs of schools, one pair in New Jersey and the other in Pennsylvania. While the pairs appear very 3 similar on observable dimensions, only in New Jersey do the two schools differ in our measure of NCLB pressure. Thus, our identification is akin to measuring the difference in student outcomes between the New Jersey pair and subtracting away the difference in outcomes between the analogous Pennsylvania pair. In our actual specification, we use continuous sets of controls, rather than a simple differences-indifferences framework, but the idea behind the identification is the same.\nOur analysis takes advantage of nationally representative data from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS), which, serendipitously, were collected on teachers and students exposed to the initial years of NCLB. We find that accountability pressure from NCLB reduces teachers' perceptions of job security, especially among relatively inexperienced teachers. We also find evidence of reading and math specialist teachers working longer hours, generalist teachers (who teach multiple subjects) working fewer hours, and all types of teachers shifting time away from whole-class instruction. The topics of instruction sacrificed include science and social studies lessons.\nWe find short-term NCLB pressure has either positive or neutral effects on student achievement in math, reading, and science on low-stakes examinations. Students enrolled in schools with a moderate risk of failing to make AYP score 0.08 standard deviations higher in reading than comparable students in similar schools that were well above the margin for making AYP. Estimated effects for math and science are statistically insignificant. We also find no evidence of differential achievement effects of NCLB pressure on low-stakes exams for students in particularly crucial subgroups or students with scores close to the passing threshold on their states' high-stakes examinations. In addition, achievement gains from short-term NCLB pressure do not come at the expense of students' reported enjoyment of learning or their anxiety over testing-if anything, enjoyment increases and anxiety decreases.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the NCLB data we have collected as well as the SASS and ECLS survey data. We present our methodology and results for predictions of AYP failure probabilities in Section 3, and our estimated effects of NCLB on teachers and students in Section 4.\nSection 5 concludes by discussing how these results may inform current policy decisions."}, {"section_title": "Data and Descriptive Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "To measure NCLB pressure faced by schools (and which subgroups and test subjects caused that pressure), our analysis requires a comprehensive, national database of schools' NCLB-related outcomes.\nBecause NCLB did not require states to report these data to the federal government, we painstakingly collected them from individual school report cards or state-level data files wherever available, and supplemented remaining states' data with two existing but incomplete public datasets. 4 These variables include whether each subgroup met testing participation requirements. We present the categories of data collected and their sources in Appendix 1.\nWe examine teacher-level outcomes from the 2003-2004 wave of the SASS and student-level outcomes from the spring 2004 wave of the ECLS, when most students in the ECLS were in the fifth grade. Both of these surveys are sponsored and distributed by the National Center for Education\nStatistics. We use the non-public-use versions of these data in order to link teachers and students to school-level measures of short-term pressure to make AYP.\nThe SASS surveyed teachers in all 50 states and allows researchers to construct nationallyrepresentative samples with the use of sampling weights. 5 For consistency with our examination of student outcomes in the ECLS, we limit the sample of teachers to those working in regular public schools that served at least five fifth graders as of [2001] [2002] .

The ECLS has the widest coverage and array of student-level outcomes of any nationally representative longitudinal dataset covering years before and after the passage of NCLB. Indeed, the timing of the ECLS survey is 4 These two sources of NCLB-related data are the Council of Chief State of School Officers' School Data Direct (http://www.schooldatadirect.org/) and the American Institutes for Research National AYP and Identification Database (http://www.air.org/publications/naypi.data.download.aspx). Whereas the first source includes AYP data in most states for the years 2002-2003 through the current year, the latter dataset includes states' yes/no determinations regarding 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 subgroups and schools' passage of AYP participation and proficiency targets. In addition to missing data for some states, these sources also contain discrepancies with states' school report cards. We prioritized school report card data where available since they are the final interface between schools and the public and should reflect final adjustments such as school appeals to states' determinations of AYP. 5 The SASS also surveyed administrators but these questions were not relevant to NCLB pressure. Although the ECLS surveyed teachers, the SASS offers a much larger sample size, surveys teachers across all grades levels, and asks them pertinent survey questions about their time use, attitudes toward their job, and future career plans. 6 We recoded teachers' reported work-related hours and instructional hours as missing if their reported 60 or more instructional hours, a suspiciously high level of reported instructional time given the typical five day school week.\n6 served at least five fifth grade students as of [2001] [2002] . We standardize students' scores within subject and year so that the national mean score equals zero and the national standard deviation equals one. 9 In addition to standardized exams, we examine students' reported enjoyment of math and reading, as well as reported anxiety over standardized tests.\n10 Table 3 provides descriptive statistics on control variables used in our regression analyses. We show statistics separately for our samples of public school teachers from the SASS and for public school students from the ECLS. Along with variables from these two surveys, we also use school characteristics from the Common Core of Data (CCD), compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and pre-NCLB aggregated student test performance variables from the National Longitudinal School-Level State Assessment Score Database (compiled by American Institutes for Research). 11 We standardize pre-NCLB test performance variables within states to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.\nIn addition to our analysis of the SASS and ECLS data, we examine a set of survey responses from the Implementing Standards-Based Accountability (ISBA) study, conducted by the RAND Corporation. As part of ISBA, principals and math teachers in three states (Pennsylvania, Georgia, and California) were surveyed regarding their views on NCLB-related policies and the implementation of these policies in their schools. While these data are not public, researchers at RAND generously provided us with cross-tabulations of survey responses on a number of items, broken down by our measure of NCLB pressure. We discuss our measure of pressure and present the ISBA results in Section 4."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Analysis of AYP Outcomes under NCLB", "text": "9 The ECLS data report t-scores of students' IRT-based \"theta scores,\" which are estimates of students' skill levels. These t-scores are already constructed so that the national (cross-sectional) mean equals 50 and the national standard deviation equals 10, so we simply subtract 50 from these scores and then divide by 10 to convert them to Z-scores. Our sample means and standard deviations for these variables are not exactly equal to 0 and 1, respectively, because we must exclude a small fraction of states and schools with missing data, and because we use longitudinal student sample weights rather than cross-sectional sample weights. 10 Answers to these specific questions, rather than an index based on a larger set of items, were obtained via special application to the National Center for Education Statistics. Due to copyright restrictions we cannot report the exact wording of these questions. For interest in and enjoyment of math and reading, we create dependent variables by summing the subject-specific numeric values for four relevant questions. We use only one question regarding feelings of test anxiety and create an indicator for reporting that such feelings were \"mostly\" or \"very\" true. 11 Tennessee did not report school level demographic information to the federal government after 1998-1999. Rather than drop Tennessee from our analysis, we use data from 1998-1999 in lieu of data from 2001-2002. For a school to make AYP, each of its numerically significant student subgroups must meet a test proficiency rate threshold in both math and reading in addition to a test participation cutoff of 95 percent.\nSecondary schools must also meet thresholds for graduation rates, and primary schools must also perform sufficiently well on a state-selected \"additional indicator,\" which is typically the attendance rate. Beyond this set of parameters, states have a great deal of flexibility in setting a number of other rules and regulations. Specifically, states must:\n\uf0b7 select standardized tests in math, reading, and (starting in [2007] [2008] science;\n\uf0b7 select which grade levels to test (until 2005-2006) 12 ;\n\uf0b7 establish proficiency rate thresholds, i.e., the percent of students that must score proficient or higher. Thresholds apply to the whole school as well as individual subgroups;\n\uf0b7 determine whether to calculate proficiency rates using all students across tested grade levels\nwithin each school or within tested grade levels;"}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "\uf0b7 determine whether to calculate subgroup proficiency rates using multiple years of testing;\n\uf0b7 define continuous enrollment, where only continuously enrolled students count towards calculation of subgroup size as well as test participation and proficiency rates;\n\uf0b7 select the minimum number of students that must be enrolled in tested grade levels for a student subgroup to be numerically significant and thus count towards a school's AYP determination;\n\uf0b7 determine the size of confidence intervals applied to student subgroups' raw proficiency rates, where larger intervals effectively lower proficiency thresholds needed to make AYP;\n\uf0b7 determine the nature of safe harbor provisions that allow schools to make AYP in spite of a subgroup not meeting the required proficiency rate that year; and, \uf0b7 decide upon the appeals process for schools to appeal their AYP status from the state.\nEven this long list does not fully capture all the minutiae of NCLB rulemaking. For example, while most states consider the performance of five ethnic subgroups (Asian/Pacific Islander, black,"}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "Hispanic, Native American, and white) in their AYP determinations, California and Alaska added additional subgroups (Filipino and Alaskan Native, respectively) while Asian/Pacific Islander is not an AYP subgroup in Texas.\nThese seemingly esoteric decisions have real implications for whether schools fail to meet the targets set for them under NCLB, as can be seen in the remarkable amount of variation in the fraction of schools in each state that made AYP. In 2003, most states' failure rates fell between 20 and 40 percent, but the range extended from roughly 1 percent in Iowa to 82 percent in Florida (see Figure 1 ).\nImportantly for our study, variation in the fraction of schools making AYP was mostly a function of states' rulemaking choices and bears little relation to measures of statewide academic achievement.\nFor example, the fraction of schools failing to make AYP by state is not significantly correlated with the fraction of students in the state deemed proficient on the state's own exams, because required proficiency rates were often set at the 20 th percentile of baseline (spring 2002) school performance. 14 More importantly, as shown in Figure 2 , there is little relationship between the fraction of schools failing to make AYP in a state and the state's average student achievement as measured on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a federal exam that has been administered to nationally representative samples of students in grades 4 and 8 for several decades. 15 States with the highest NAEP proficiency rates have slightly lower AYP failure rates than other states, but this relationship is not statistically significant and NAEP proficiency rates explain very little of the cross-state variation in AYP failure rates.\nWe have been unable to find any single aspect of NCLB design that can explain the wide variation in failure rates. However, by testing a number of factors we have come to the conclusion that the interaction of four features significantly influences the fraction of schools failing AYP: (1) state rules for the numerical significance of student subgroups (i.e., how large subgroups must be to count towards AYP); (2) within-school heterogeneity, which influences how many student subgroups are numerically significant; (3) the generosity of the state's confidence intervals; and (4) the generosity of the state's safe harbor provisions. The complex manner in which these policy details interact increases our confidence 14 However, there was even wide variation in how states calculated the 20 th percentile. For example, some states based the 20 th percentile measure on baseline school-wide pass rates and some used grade-specific and/or subjectspecific baseline pass rates. 15 Note that we plot AYP failure rates for schools serving fifth grade students, which is the type of schools we analyze in SASS and ECLS. In Figure 1 , AYP failure rates are shown for all schools that receive AYP designations.\nthat the wide differences in the apparent leniency of NCLB requirements across states can help identify its impact on schools and students."}, {"section_title": "Predicting the Probability of Failing AYP", "text": "In the first stage of our analysis, we use our assembled data set to determine which student subgroups and, by extension, which schools were on the margin of failing to make AYP in the first two years that NCLB was in effect. We begin by estimating state-and subject-specific probit regressions to generate predictions of the likelihood that each numerically-significant student subgroup would pass AYP proficiency targets in the spring of both 2003 and 2004 . To do so, we use school demographic characteristics (listed in Table 3 ) and subgroup-level/school-level test performance variables from the school year [2001] [2002] , which is the year after the passage of NCLB but prior to the first AYP determinations. 16 We conduct regressions separately by state, so that coefficients capture the nuances of how states' NCLB rules affect schools' chances of making AYP. Regressions are run at the student subgroup level and are restricted to those that were numerically significant in either 2003 or 2004. This means a single school will have as many AYP predictions per subject (math or reading) as it has numerically significant student subgroups. For states that further disaggregate subgroup results to the grade or grade span level, we also define subgroups at this disaggregated level-with separate observations for each subgroup-bygrade-level combination. Our variables differ somewhat across states due to variation in NCLB regulations. To be as consistent as possible, we applied a set of rules (described in Appendix 2) for how to specify our regressions conditional on the available data for that state.\nFor each subject s, we estimate state-specific regressions of the following form: use overall student test performance in subject s, and include interaction terms between test performance and the fraction of the overall student population at each school comprised of students in group k. In practice, we find that subgroup-specific and overall measures of pre-NCLB test score performance work equally well in predicting the likelihood that the schools' pass rates will be near the NCLB required cutoff in 2003-2004. 18 We use the restriction of having five fifth graders because some schools that should serve grade 5 according to grade level ranges indicated in the CCD actually enrolled no fifth graders. In cases where we use test performance from a grade other than grade 5 in the X jks02 vector, the regressions also include subgroups from schools serving the tested grade even if the school does not serve grade 5. percent of the U.S. population resides in one of the 41 states with sufficient data for our analyses."}, {"section_title": "Defining the AYP Margin", "text": "We use the predicted probabilities at the subgroup level from the Equation 1 regressions to construct school-level measures of accountability pressure under NCLB. Our measures are based on the following logic. Schools where all numerically significant subgroups have high chances of passing state proficiency targets in both math and reading likely faced little NCLB pressure. In contrast, schools where any numerically significant subgroup was close to the margin of passing are likely to have faced accountability pressure. However, schools where any subgroup has a very low probability of passing are unlikely to be able to do anything to change their AYP outcome in the short term.\nFollowing this logic, we construct the following school level measures of NCLB pressure:\nA school is classified as above the AYP margin if all numerically significant subgroups have a high chance of making AYP in both math and reading;\n(ii) A school is classified as below the AYP margin if it has at least one numerically significant subgroup with a low chance of making AYP in either math or reading;\n(iii) A school is classified as on the AYP margin for a particular subject if (a) at least one numerically significant subgroup in the school has a moderate chance of making AYP in that subject, and (b) no numerically significant subgroup in the school has a low chance of making AYP in either subject;\n(iv) A school is classified as on the AYP margin if it is on the AYP margin for math or reading.\nFor all of our analyses below, we define a \"moderate chance\" of a subgroup making AYP as between 25 and 75 percent, a \"high chance\" as above 75 percent, and a \"low chance\" as less than 25 percent. Our results are not very sensitive to using other cutoffs ranging from between 35 and 65 percent to between 15 and 85 percent. 12 percent for schools above the margin, 38 percent for schools on the margin, and 7 percent for schools below the margin, demonstrating that our specification has sufficient power to identify substantial variation in which schools were at risk of failing to make AYP. However, our analyses below are predicated on the idea that the risks of AYP failure were foreseeable to school administrators and teachers. To the extent that measurement error causes us to misclassify which schools believed they were on the AYP margin, our estimated effects of NCLB pressure may be biased towards zero. This possibility motivates the need to examine whether our estimates are related to teachers' and administrators' reported sense of accountability pressure, which we do below.\nThe results reported in Among subgroups that were numerically significant and thus accountable, the fraction we predict to have a moderate or low chance of making AYP varies considerably. The subgroups most frequently predicted to have a moderate chance of passing in reading were disabled and limited English proficient (30 and 37 percent, respectively) and, in math, disabled and Black (26 and 27 percent, respectively).\nDisabled student subgroups also have relatively high fractions (about 15 percent) predicted to have low chances of passing proficiency targets in both subjects, as do Native American subgroups (17 percent in math, 22 percent in reading) and Asian subgroups in reading (25 percent). In contrast, White subgroups are nearly always predicted to have a high chance of passing proficiency targets."}, {"section_title": "Variation in Predicted NCLB Pressure across States", "text": "Our identification strategy is based on the idea that similar schools faced different levels of NCLB pressure because of the state in which they were located. However, it is still broadly true that schools with high average achievement had greater chances of making AYP than schools with low average achievement. Figures 3a, 3b , and 3c illustrate these points. To construct the y-axis variables in 13 these figures, we pair each school with similar out-of-state schools to simulate the counterfactual NCLB pressure in math and reading that schools would face had they been located in other states. We find the most similar school in each other state based on an index of school characteristics, which includes student math and reading test scores from the spring of 2002, the number of total enrolled students in that year, the percent of students who are from low-income households, and the racial composition of students."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "We then calculate the fraction of paired schools that are on the AYP margin and the fraction below the AYP margin, and we use these calculations as our estimates of counterfactual AYP pressure in other states.

Yet the figures also illustrate that schools frequently would face different pressure in other states than they do in their own state. Substantial crossstate variation in NCLB rules creates substantial cross-state variation in AYP pressure.\nAlong the lines of a \"simulated instruments\" approach, we include these out-of-state counterfactual accountability pressure variables as controls in our analysis below-the estimated fraction of states in which the school would be on the AYP margin and the fraction of states in which the school would be below the AYP margin. The motivation for their inclusion is to isolate variation in schools' treatment status that depends on how their own states' rules differ from those in other states. Their inclusion ultimately has very little impact on our findings, though, because their correlations with outcomes of interest are mostly captured by other control variables. In all of our analyses below, we include flexible controls for schools' relative performance on statewide examinations in the school year [2001] [2002] . Thus, our identification is not based on the general tendency of low-scoring schools to face more NCLB pressure."}, {"section_title": "Assessing our Measure of NCLB Pressure in the ISBA Surveys", "text": "To get an initial sense of the validity of our measures of NCLB pressure, we examine aggregate statistics from surveys of principals and math teachers in California, Pennsylvania, and Georgia by the RAND Corporation in the school-year 2003-2004. While these cross-tabulations are only suggestivethe micro data from these surveys are not publicly available-these data are unique in that principals and teachers were asked specifically about NCLB pressure.\nWe examine principals' survey responses in 21 schools that we classified as on the AYP margin and 104 schools above the AYP margin; no principals were surveyed at any school that predicted to have a low chance of making AYP. Among principals working in schools above the AYP margin, 96 percent felt they would make AYP in the school year 2003-2004, relative to only 71 percent who worked in schools on the AYP margin. Indeed, among principals in schools above the AYP margin, 72 percent felt they would make AYP for the next five years, relative to only 48 percent in the marginal group (Table 5, Panel A). Principals in schools on the AYP margin were also between 9 and 14 percentage points more likely to say that they had taken the following actions: encouraged teachers to focus more time on tested subjects; distributed commercial test preparation materials; or distributed copies of previous state tests or test items. All of these differences in responses across principals in the two groups are statistically significant at approximately the one percent level.\nBecause of the larger number of teachers than principals surveyed, we can examine teachers working in schools we classify as below the margin (19 teachers), on the margin (224 teachers), and above the margin (1,074 teachers) of AYP. Relevant survey questions included probes about teaching test-taking strategies, focusing on students who are close to proficient on the high stakes test, emphasizing the topics and types of problems given on the state test, spending more time teaching content, and searching for more effective teaching methods. Teachers working in schools on the AYP margin were between 11 and 19 percentage points more likely than teachers working in schools above the AYP margin to report having taken these actions, while teachers in schools below the AYP margin were between 3 and 20 percentage points more likely to report having taken these actions than teachers in schools on the margin. All of the differences between responses from teachers in the schools above the margin and either of the other two teacher groups are statistically significant at the one percent level, and support the idea that our constructed measures of NCLB pressure align with principals' and teachers' reported perceptions."}, {"section_title": "Estimates of the Impact of Accountability Pressure Under NCLB", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "We use our measures of whether a school is below, on, or above the AYP margin to predict various outcomes for an individual i (i.e., a student or teacher) in school j and state q.

The latter difference is statistically significant and fairly large considering that 38 percent of teachers reported this concern overall. Point estimates for the pre-NCLB SASS sample are of the opposite sign, supporting the notion that our measure of NCLB pressure is valid and captures significant variation in school staff members' perceptions of pressure.\nLess experienced teachers should be most sensitive to issues of job security, given the prevalence of seniority-based layoff and transfer rules (see Boyd et al., 2011) . We therefore estimate regressions separately based on whether a teacher had more or less than 10 years of experience-roughly the sample median. The effects of accountability on perceived job security are much stronger for teachers with fewer than ten years of experience; relatively inexperienced teachers in schools on the AYP margin or under the AYP margin are, respectively, 10.1 percentage points and 17.0 percentage points more likely to report concern over their job security related to student test performance (Table 6 , column 2). These effects are statistically significant at the .10 and .05 levels respectively; they are also different from the falsification estimates based on the pre-NCLB SASS sample, with p-values of approximately .10 for these differences.\nRoughly three quarters of teachers in our sample state that they plan to teach \"until retirement,\"\nwhich we view as a measure of job satisfaction. We find that teachers in schools on or below the AYP margin are less likely to plan to teach until retirement than their counterparts teaching in schools with high probabilities of making AYP (Table 6 , Column 4), and these effects are especially strong for veteran 20 In cases of teachers covering multiple grades, we include the teacher if more than half of the teacher's covered grade levels were tested for NCLB in that teacher's state during the spring of 2004. One concern in this analysis is that we limit the sample to high-stakes teachers, and principals at schools facing NCLB pressure might strategically place teachers into high-stakes grades and subjects. While we cannot test this hypothesis, we believe such behavior would most likely create a bias against our findings. If principals facing strong pressure wish to boost high-stakes test performance, then they should assign their most talented teachers to high-stakes areas. Yet we find these teachers are more concerned about their job security, are less likely to plan to teach until retirement, and work fewer hours.\nteachers. Again, estimates from the falsification estimates based on the pre-NCLB sample wave are of the opposite sign and significantly different from the main estimates, supporting the idea that NCLB pressure had an impact on teachers' career plans. These results comport with findings by Feng et al. (2010) that schools in Florida that received low accountability ratings subsequently experienced higher rates of teacher turnover.\nWhile the SASS does not ask about plans to teach next year, we are able to examine short-run turnover for approximately 540 teachers from the NCES Teacher Follow-up Survey, which tracks a subsample of teachers from the prior year's SASS wave. Using the same specification as above, we estimated a linear probability model predicting whether teachers applied to non-teaching jobs or left the profession the next year. We estimate coefficients of 0.16 and 0.09 for being on and below the AYP margin, respectively, with the former coefficient statistically significant at the five percent level. This provides additional support to the notion that NCLB pressure affected teachers' job security and job satisfaction. Table 7 present results concerning how NCLB pressure affects teachers' self-reported total weekly work hours, whole-class instructional hours, and coverage of science and social studies. 21 The SASS surveyed teachers in the fall, well ahead of NCLB spring testing, and survey responses should reflect general shifts in instruction rather than last-minute preparation for high-stakes tests. Weekly reported whole-class instructional hours, which average 29 hours, are a subset of total reported weekly work hours, which average 53. Most teachers in these elementary and middle schools are generalists, meaning they cover multiple subjects and teach in self-contained classrooms where the same students remain for most of the day. Other teachers are specialists, such as math instructors who see several different groups of students during the same day. Given the different roles of these teachers, we divide our sample between generalist or specialist teachers when examining work time.\nWe find that greater accountability pressure is associated with a decrease in work hours among generalists but an increase among specialists, while whole-class instructional hours fall for both types of teachers. About half of the generalists' decrease in work hours is accounted for by fewer hours per week devoted to whole-class instruction. We cannot estimate impacts on instructional hours for the pre-NCLB wave of the SASS because this question was not asked, but point estimates for changes in total work hours in the pre-NCLB sample are insignificant, small, and significantly different than the main estimates for generalist teachers. Thus, in schools facing NCLB pressure, the overall trend is to have generalist teachers working less while their specialist colleagues work longer hours on activities other than wholeclass instruction. We can only speculate on the mechanisms for these time reallocations; one possibility is that specialists spend more time working with small groups of students and teachers on test preparation, student assessments, and tutoring. Regular teachers may tend to work slightly fewer hours due to the increased role of specialists and other factors, such as decreased teacher autonomy.\nFinally, we use the SASS data to explore shifts in instructional time across subject areas, using self-reports of whether the teacher taught a science lesson or a social studies lesson during the prior week.\nUnlike the estimates discussed above, we now include teachers in the sample regardless of whether they taught a high-stakes subject, which, due to the random sampling of teachers in the SASS, allows us to capture both shifts in the subject composition taught by generalists and shifts in the employment of specialists teaching low-stakes subjects. 22 The estimates suggest that schools facing accountability pressure reduce the frequency of science and social studies lessons (Table 7 , columns 5 and 6).\nCompared to teachers at schools above the margin, teachers are 8.5 percentage points less likely to have taught a science lesson in the last week and 4.9 percentage points less likely to have taught a social studies lesson. The former estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level but the latter estimate is not highly significant. The effects on science and social studies offerings in schools below the AYP margin are even larger: a greater than 14 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of either type of lesson.\nThese effects are substantial, considering that 59 percent and 62 percent of teachers in this sample taught science and social studies lessons, respectively, in the previous week. Our falsification results based on the pre-NCLB produce very small and statistically insignificant estimates for these models, suggesting that our main estimates are capturing responses to NCLB pressure. Schools may shift instructional time from science and social studies to reading and math in order to increase their chances of making AYP. 22 The results are similar if we instead limit the sample to generalist teachers: an estimated coefficient of being on the AYP margin of -0.09 (.04 bootstrapped standard error) for science lessons and -0.05 (.04 bootstrapped standard error) for social studies. This suggests that schools do not ramp up their use of social studies and science specialist teachers to compensate for the lower frequency of social studies and science lessons taught by generalists."}, {"section_title": "Impacts on Students", "text": "Using the ECLS data, we now turn to whether NCLB pressure affected student achievement, enjoyment of material, and test anxiety. Our specification is again shown by Equation 2, and studentlevel controls are listed in Table 3 . Importantly, we include third degree polynomials of the student's standardized math and reading performance in both the first and third grade waves of the ECLS. Thus, in addition to controls at the school level, our identification comes only from comparisons of students with very similar prior learning trajectories. In these regressions, we focus on the AYP margin for the most relevant subject(s): math for math test performance or enjoyment, reading for reading test performance or enjoyment, and \"either math or reading\" for science test performance and for anxiety about standardized tests. We lack power to separate relevant-subject and cross-subject effects using the ECLS.\nOur estimates reveal that NCLB pressure has either neutral or positive effects on student achievement growth in both low-and high-stakes subjects (Panel I of Table 7 may not be harmful for general learning, at least not in the short term.\nImportantly, our results also suggest that when schools face NCLB pressure, gains in achievement do not decrease students' enjoyment of reading or math and are likely to decrease anxiety 23 To test the joint significance of these test score estimates, we simulated estimations of these three models after randomly reassigning schools to different AYP status. Only 0.3 percent (3 out of 1,000) of these simulations produced a set of counterfactual estimates that had absolute values, from greatest to least, greater than the values of the actual highest, second highest and third highest estimate reported in the first three columns of the first row of Panel I of (significant at the 10 percent level), respectively. We also find statistically significant decreases of 9 and 14 percentage points in rates of students' reported anxiety over testing for schools on and below the AYP margin, respectively. While schools under pressure may focus more on testing-using practice exams, motivational techniques, etc.-these actions appear to alleviate student anxiety rather than exacerbate it.\nThe previous school accountability literature motivates the idea that the impacts of NCLB may differ across students within a school. We first examine whether our estimates depend on whether schools faced strong pressure to raise proficiency rates for the overall student population or for the focal student's own subgroup(s). Estimates presented in Panel II of Table 7 come from specifications where we replace the single \"on the AYP margin\" variable with three mutually exclusive indicators for whether the school was on the AYP margin due to: (1) the overall student group, (2) any one of the student's own subgroups (and not the overall student group as well), and (3) other subgroups (not the student's own subgroup or the overall student group). The point estimates in Panel II for reading performance are never negative, regardless of whether the students are members of subgroups whose performance is most critical to the schools' AYP ratings. The estimates for math and science performance are all statistically insignificant. The largest gains on low-stakes reading exams occur for students whose own performance will likely not affect their schools' chances of making AYP, but these differences in performance by group are not statistically significant. The large estimates for this group suggest that all students may improve their reading skills when their schools spend more time on reading instruction due to accountability pressure. In summary, our analysis using the highly reliable examinations in the ECLS provides assurance that NCLB pressure does not systematically lead to adverse achievement outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous Effects", "text": "While NCLB pressure does not appear to lead to adverse average effects on students, the effects could be negative for particular types of students or particular state policy settings. We next examine heterogeneity across students based on their proximity to the passing threshold, their families' socioeconomic status, and whether their state implemented NCLB on top of an existing test-based school accountability system."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "AYP is based on proficiency rates, and schools might therefore direct resources to students who are likely to score close to the threshold of passing the exam (Reback, 2008; Neal and Whitmore Schanzenbach, 2010) . We classify students as \"on the bubble\" for passing their state exam if their third grade test scores were estimated to be within 15 percentiles below or 5 percentiles above their states' NCLB exam passing threshold. 24 We then re-estimate the specification above adding an indicator for \"on the bubble\" and an interaction term between this indicator and whether the school is on the AYP margin.\nIn each case, the estimated coefficients for this interaction term are statistically insignificant. For reading, math, and science performance, these estimates are -.02 (.06 standard error), -.002 (.10 standard error) and .07 (.06 standard error) respectively. Students on the bubble of passing high-stakes exams thus do not perform very differently on low-stakes exams when their schools face strong NCLB pressure, although our estimates are too imprecise to rule out moderate differences.\nOne concern with school responses to accountability pressure is that schools might reduce their focus on real learning for traditionally underperforming students, such as students from relatively poor households. NCLB's use of subgroup-specific pass rates is intended to mitigate these effects, but they might still occur-especially for low-stakes rather than high-stakes test performance. We examine this notion by adding to our main specification an indicator for having family income of $35,000 or less and an interaction of this indicator with whether the school is on the AYP margin. The estimated coefficients for this interaction terms are all statistically insignificant, and they are very small for the reading and math performance models. 25 This provides reassuring evidence that greater short-term accountability pressure did not widen achievement gaps based on students' families' socio-economic status.\nIn many cases, NCLB was layered on top of states' pre-existing school accountability systems, and the impact of NCLB pressure might be dampened in states that already put schools under pressure based on student test performance according to the state's own rating system. On the other hand, schools 24 The National Center for Education Statistics (2007) estimates NAEP score equivalents associated with the passing threshold for most states' NCLB exams, and we obtained national percentile equivalents for these NAEP scores. We are unable to do this for eight ECLS states that were not included in the National Center for Education Statistics (2007) publication. Using ranges smaller than 20 percentiles would lead to highly imprecise estimates, and we use a wider range below the cutoffs than above the cutoffs because schools may have anticipated their capacity to improve student performance over time-i.e., most states experienced upward trends in proficiency rates over the first few years of NCLB. For reading and math outcomes our indicator is subject specific; for science tests and test anxiety we use an indicator for being on the bubble in either math or reading. 25 For models with reading, math, or science test performance as the dependent variable, the estimated coefficients of the interaction terms are -0.02 (.06 standard error), 0.004 (.07), and -0.05 (.06) respectively. These estimates continue to be statistically insignificant if one instead uses a smaller income cutoff of $20,000 instead of $35,000."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "in states with pre-NCLB accountability systems might have more experience quickly mobilizing their resources to meet performance targets. Dee and Jacob's research (2011) supports the former hypothesis, since they find that states lacking strong accountability systems prior to NCLB had stronger upward trends in 4 th grade students' math performance comparing pre-and post-NCLB cohorts. They do not find a similar trend for reading performance.\nUsing Dee and Jacob's classifications, we add to our main specification an interaction term between the state having a strong pre-NCLB accountability system and the school being on the margin for making AYP. Our estimates are consistent with Dee and Jacob's findings-math AYP pressure had a more positive effect on students in states lacking strong accountability systems prior to NCLB, and this difference is significant (p=.07). We do not find statistically significant differences in effects of pressure on reading or science performance across states with or without strong pre-NCLB accountability. While our estimates are too imprecise to determine the extent to which these schools contributed to their states' upward math performance trajectories, these results suggest that the upward trends in math performance observed by Dee and Jacob (2011) may have been driven by schools facing the greatest short-term pressure to increase math pass rates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "As a result of the No Child Left Behind act, virtually every public school in the U.S. is now accountable for meeting targets for student test performance. To further our understanding of the impact of NCLB on such a wide set of schools, we assembled an extensive national data set of school and student subgroup performance on the examinations required under NCLB, and we exploit the extensive crossstate variation in states' rules and standards to examine how the threat of failing under NCLB affects school personnel and students. In schools facing NCLB pressure, we find that teachers report greater concern over how student test performance will affect their job security and they expect to leave the profession sooner. We find changes in work hours suggesting a shift towards teachers who specialize in single subjects and away from instruction of low-stakes subjects like science and social studies.\nNevertheless, we find that students perform at least as well academically in schools facing strong short-term pressure from NCLB as those in comparable schools that do not face such pressure. In schools facing stronger short-term incentives to improve student proficiency rates on high-stakes exams, students raise their achievement by 0.08 standard deviations on low-stakes reading exams, do similarly on lowstakes math and science tests, report more enjoyment of math, do not report less enjoyment of reading, and report less test anxiety. We can also rule out substantial negative effects for various types of students-students in/out of subgroups that have greater influence on whether their schools meet NCLB requirements, students who will likely score close/far from the passing score on their states' high-stakes exam, and students who are from poorer/wealthier families.\nOur finding that short-term NCLB pressure does not negatively affect student learning or enjoyment of learning is quite important, given widely held concerns about the use of test-based accountability systems. On the other hand, our results also raise questions concerning whether NCLB pressure discourages the work effort and career length of teachers working in schools with little chance of meeting student performance standards. In addition, our finding that these schools reduce instruction in low-stakes subjects may have negative consequences in the longer term.\nThese issues loom larger every year as NCLB standards become more stringent and more schools fail to meet those standards. NCLB requires states to set targeted student proficiency rates at 100% by 2014. In view of ballooning AYP school failure rates, the U.S. Department of Education has been granting waivers to states so that schools can avoid AYP failure designations in spite of less than perfect proficiency rates (U.S. Dept. of Education, 2012). These waivers are conditional on broad education policy reforms that some states view as too costly to implement (L.A. Times, 11/12/11). Even across the states that have received waivers, there is variation in the types of performance targets used to determine AYP and whether AYP designations are used at all.\nPolicymakers may also want to consider the large differences in rules and regulations across states, which we as researchers used to identify the effects of NCLB pressure on schools. Thus far, the minutiae of state rules rather than student proficiency (as measured by national exams) have largely determined the difficulty of meeting AYP. Although a majority of states have adopted \"Common Core\nState Standards\" that may increase the consistency of student achievement tests across states, most of the current variation in AYP failure rates across states is not driven by the difficulty of state exams. If policymakers would like to establish more uniformity across states' school accountability standards, then federal policy reforms must address the often overlooked sources of variation within state formulae."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "Ideally, accountability pressure should stem from the performance of students along the entire distribution of achievement, rather than the idiosyncrasies of opaque state AYP rules. Congress has an opportunity to revisit the design of school accountability systems when they enact revisions to NCLB, which will likely occur after the 2012 Presidential election. When so doing, policymakers may wish to ensure that schools along the entire performance spectrum face more continuous incentives to improve along a wide array of outcomes. Revised accountability systems could also provide schools with incentives to improve student performance regardless of students' prior achievement levels and the scaling of their test scores.

SASS and ECLS to produce nationally representative estimates. The sample is restricted to observations used in the main analyses: teachers in 41 states for the SASS sample and students in 35 states in the ELCS sample. The sample sizes are approximately 2,800 teachers for the SASS sample (high-stakes teachers only) and approximately 6,870 students for the ECLS sample, each rounded to the nearest 10 due to restricted-use data reporting requirements. Standardized variables are Z-scores that were standardized based on the national, cross-sectional student distribution; their means and standard deviations above differ from zero and one respectively because some states/students are omitted due to missing data and because we use longitudinal sampling weights rather than crosssectional sampling weights. \u2020We set teachers' work-related hours and instructional hours to missing if their reported instructional hours were 60 hours or greater, a suspiciously high level of reported instructional time given the typical five day school week. The work hours per week variable is based on teachers' self-reported hours spent on \"all teaching and other school-related activities during a typical full week.\" Table 5 : Percentages shown in this table refer to the percentage of respondents who agreed with the corresponding statement. Above, on, and below the AYP margin correspond to our classifications of how likely the school was to make AYP in 2003 and 2004 . See Section 4 of the paper for details. No principal surveyed was in a school classified by our analysis as below the AYP margin. All of the differences in rates between the groups above the AYP margin and either of the other two groups are statistically significant at approximately the .01 level or better. Differences in rates between teachers in schools above the AYP margin and those in schools on the AYP margin are statistically significant at the .05 level for \"I focus more effort on students who are close to proficient,\" and at the .01 level for \"I look for particular styles...\" and \"I search for more effective teaching methods.\" who were working in high-stakes grades/subjects. The falsification samples includes teachers sampled in the 1999-2000 wave of the SASS who were working in grades/subjects that later became high stakes for NCLB. For the falsification regressions, schools are classified as \"On AYP Margin\" or \"Below AYP Margin\" if they later had that status during the main sample period. To facilitate comparisons with the ECLS analysis in the remainder of the paper, we limit both samples to teachers in public schools that serve 5 th grade students. All models control for the independent variables listed in the \"SASS sample\" column of Table 3 , and also control for state fixed effects, the fraction of states in which the school would likely be \"On the AYP Margin,\" the fraction of states in which the school would likely be \"Below the AYP Margin,\" a squared term for the number of Limited English proficient students in the grade, a squared term for the teacher's years of experience, and squared and cubic terms for schools' within-state standardized 2001-2002 test score performance in both math and reading. All models use the SASS cross-sectional sample weights to make the estimates nationally representative. Bootstrapped standard errors, adjusted for school-level clustering using 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations of both the first-stage and second-stage models, are displayed in parentheses below each estimate. Sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 10 to comply with restricted-data reporting requirements. *** significant at .01 level; ** significant at .05 level; * significant at .10 level. Notes to Table 7 : See Notes to Table 6 . To capture the full effects of shifting of instruction across subjects, the models used for columns 5 and 6 above do not limit the sample to teachers of high-stakes subjects. The Pre-NCLB Sample Wave of the Schools and Staffing Survey did not include a question about instructional hours in a typical week. Specialist teachers are defined as those whose classroom organization is reported as departmentalized instruction or elementary enrichment (i.e., not a selfcontained classroom). All other teachers are classified as generalists. *** significant at .01 level; ** significant at .05 level; * significant at .10 level. In two states which lacked 2002-2003 proficiency target data from all three sources of data, we constructed the variable using each state's published raw subgroup proficiency rates, which we adjusted using the state's documented confidence interval methods (if applicable) to determine whether each subgroup passed, failed, or was not applicable. This approximation method had greater than 90% accuracy when tested it in two populous states with complete data."}, {"section_title": "MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI MI
