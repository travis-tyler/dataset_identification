[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A huge literature studies educational attainment and the return to education, with the more recent work focussing on heterogeneity in the return. 1 There is much less work on why indviduals choose dierent types of education or on the career consequences of those choices. This is surprising, because the question of what kind of education should be provided receives an enormous amount of attention in policy discussion and is a decision that every student must make, particularly at the post-secondary level. Periodically, there are calls for reform of the high school curriculum, often in response to concern about the readiness of students for the work force. An important example is A Nation at Risk (Gardner (1983)). As we discuss below, the report advocated a focus on the new basics, with an increase in the number of courses in key academic subjects such as math and science. But despite the perennial debate about what students should study and many calls for better math and science instruction, there is surprisingly little hard evidence about the labor market consequences of specic high school courses."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "At the college level, dierences by eld of study have received much less attention in the academic literature than the average return to post-secondary education. This is true even though the dierence in returns across college majors rivals the college wage premium. For example, using the data from the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS), we nd that after adjusting for basic demographics, potential labor market experience, and graduate education, the gap in log wages rates between male electrical engineering and male general education majors is 0.561 (0.016). This is nearly as large as the 0.577 (0.003) dierence between college graduates and high school graduates. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the return to various majors is 0.177 for menabout double the typical estimate of the value of the year of school. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2012) is the latest in a series of policy reports calling for a major increase in college graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. However, the extent to which these dierences reect unobserved dierences in high school preparation and worker ability or represent compensating dierentials for nonpecuniary aspects of jobs is not well-established. Understanding these dierences is important for understanding the role of education in economic success and even for providing advice to students who are deciding on a course of study. In keeping with the treatment of schooling as homogeneous, most of the literature in labor economics on career earnings focuses on the return to general experience, job tenure, and job mobility. However, there is an important and growing literature concerned with the implications of occupation-specic human capital for wages and mobility. Field of education conditions occupational paths. In this paper, we provide a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on the heterogeneous nature of education and its link to particular occupation paths. First, we combine elements from several papers to provide a theoretical model of education choice, occupation choice, and wages. The model has ve key features. First, preferences, innate ability, and the initial vector of skills and knowledge early in high school shape the feasibility and the desirability of particular education programs. Second, individuals only learn gradually about their preferences 1 See Card (1999) and Meghir  and ability and are uncertain about wages. Third, the type of education program shapes what one learns during a schooling period. Fourth, education programs and occupations have dierent skill and knowledge prerequisites that inuence learning and job performance. Switching elds in response to new information about ability, preferences, and returns is costly. Finally, knowledge accumulation is stochasticstudents cannot simply decide that they are going to complete a program of study. We draw out a number of implications of the model that have been discussed in the literature, including an important distinction between ex ante and ex post return to an education choice. We also use the model to discuss some of the econometric diculties that sequential choice in the presence of learning poses for estimating the causal eect of eld of study on wages. We then turn to the empirical literature on the demand for and return to particular types of education, beginning with high school curriculum and then turning to college major. We place particular emphasis on the determinants of college major and the eects of high school courses and college major on wage rates. 3 We supplement the existing literature with an analysis of the returns to college major using the ACS, which is large enough for us to consider narrowly dened majors and 5-digit occupation categories. Due to space constraints, we focus primarily on the literature for the US. We conclude with some theoretical and econometric implications of the model as well as suggestions for future research. 2 Lifecycle decision making: a theoretical model and some empirical implications The aim of the following section is to describe a theoretical model that brings together the educational choices with the labor market careers that follow them. This sets the scene for interpreting the review of empirical results that follows. From an econometric point of view this unied framework can help identify the assumptions required for empirical analysis. As a setup, this model is not new and brings together elements of Altonji (1993) and Arcidiacono (2004), who emphasize the dynamic decisions about type of education, as well as Keane and Wolpin (1997), Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) and Violante, Gallipoli, and Meghir (2005), who also include risk considerations and examine the role of parents. We conclude this section with a discussion of the implications of the model and the important empirical challenges that this eld faces. Almost all of the empirical literature we describe is either based on OLS regression or on instrumental variables strategies and focuses on specic aspects of educational choice. This work is very important, and we expect that going forward IV style approaches will continue to play a dominant role given the diculties with structural modelling. However, the model implies that when agents are making a sequence of choices among multiple education options, the use of single equation methods to estimate ex ante and ex post returns to education choices requires strong assumptions. These methods also lead to incomplete measures of such returns, since costs are ignored. Readers who are primarily interested in the empirical work may wish to skip to Section 3 on a rst pass through the paper. We now describe the sequence of decision phases for the individual. We start from the end point where individuals make labor market decisions; we then go back through the education choices and end up at the beginning, when parents can make transfers and inuence their children's decisions."}, {"section_title": "Preliminaries and notation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The state space", "text": "We dene the state space, i.e. the set of relevant variables describing the history of events and choices made by the individual up until the current point, by \u2126.

Once in the labor market, \u2126 will track labor market history, including wages and the occupational choices that help determine the vector of skills K, which drives achievement in school and wages. We use the subscript \u03c2 to denote educational stages, i.e. high school, rst part of college and second part of college. When the individual enters the labor market, we switch to a subscript t which denotes years in the labor market.

Both are unknown to the individual and are a source of uncertainty. The individual learns about ability and preferences through environment and through experience, such as trying a set of courses or switching occupations in the labor market. This is helpful in explaining switches between elds of study and between occupations, as individuals learn what they can and cannot do well and what they like. We start with prior beliefs summarized by the distribution F (a, \u03b8). These are updated according to Bayes' rule, i.e.: where \u03c4 denotes stage (such as high school, college, or labor market period). G(\u2022) is the likelihood function of the information set \u2126 \u03c4 . At the initial stage, which is the end of statutory schooling, \u03c4 \u2212 is taken to be I, the information set is \u2126 I , and F I (a, \u03b8|\u2126 I ) = F (a, \u03b8), i.e. the prior distribution.

Finally, the separate dependence on educational history reects the fact that the level and type of education may lead to a permanently dierent type of human capital which is not perfectly substitutable with other types and which commands its own market price. For example, medical training allows one to become a surgeon, a skill not obviously substitutable with skills of individuals of a dierent educational background."}, {"section_title": "Labor market", "text": "The labor market is competitive and includes L dierent occupations, each paying an occupation-specic wage \u03b1 lt per eciency unit of human capital.

The resulting individual wage is where u ilt is an idiosyncratic shock to eciency units for the lth occupation. In practice, one would have to nd ways to restrict and rene the information set. However, this implies that factors aecting learning from individual experience will determine wages despite the fact that they have no inuence on productivity itself. For example, math grades in high school may aect lawyers' wages. (See Farber and Gibbons (1996), Altonji and Pierret (2001) and Lange (2007) for work on employer learning about productivity with only general education.) Wage equations may dier for men and women, although this has not been made explicit in the above equation. One traditional way of parametrizing the above wage equation is as follows: where T l it is person i's current tenure in occupation l and X it is total labor market experience. We use the loose notation\u00e2 it to denote the expectation about ability at t. The subscript s indicates that the coecients of the wage equation depend on education history including the sequence of eld choices and highest degree. Finally, v islt is an idiosyncratic stochastic shock. This equation is an approximation obtained by substituting out for the vector K using (1), (2), and (3). Tenure in other occupations would also belong in the equation to the extent that productivity in occupation l depends on skills learned in other occupations.

The labor market choices are repeated in each period and the value functions are indexed by t, which denotes length of time in the labor market and emphasizes that this is a non-stationary lifecycle problem. The terminal condition is left unspecied here. An individual possesses a utility function, which expresses her preference over consumption and occupations. This is denoted by u l (c t |\u03be l t , a, \u03b8), where c t is consumption and the index l denotes occupation.

Important factors in practice are frictions and occupational shocks, such as exogenous job destruction. From a substantive point of view these can be important particularly if the extent of frictions dier from sector to sector. Given that individuals are risk averse, dierent risk characteristics may aect occupational and by implication educational choice.

We suppose that while the child makes her own decisions, they can be inuenced by parents. Part of the inuence is through genetic and cultural factors that are not the subject of conscious choices by the parent. Part is through decisions that inuence the health, educational and broader social experiences of the child prior to high school. 10 These are all implicit in the original information set \u2126 I , and although some may be the result of earlier choices, we do not have much to say about them here. However, one important source of inuence is nance: parents choose how much to transfer to their children, either unconditionally or conditional on desired actions by the children (such as attending high school or college). This is a crucial source of funding for children who may not have other access to nancial sources. From a policy perspective, understanding such transfers lies at the heart of understanding the extent to which outcomes can be inuenced through government transfers. Parents possess assets A P . They need to choose how much to transfer to their children, given that they will fund high school and given that they may care about the child's welfare as well as whether the child completes high school. We denote by A U transfers oered if the child drops out of school and by T transfers given if the child continues schooling. Given these, parents solve the problem where V P is the parents' value function, HS is a binary indicator for high school attendance, and A U and T are part of \u2126 I aecting the child's education decision. Note that we assume that transfers cannot be negative; for example, the parents cannot ne the children to induce them to attend high school. Finally, \u03ba is the weight attached by parents to child utility. In a standard altruistic model, transfers will increase with A P but will be lower for higher ability children, who can achieve higher value V H . This is a more complicated model because of the parents' preference for their child to attend high school and their resulting willingness to use transfers to distort the child's choice towards education. The key point here is the link that this model creates between parental wealth and education in a world with liquidity constraints: wealthier parents will make more transfers enabling childen to study, whereas equal ability children from lower income backgrounds may be unable to do so if they cannot borrow. Conditional parental tranfers can easily be incorporated into the college stage of the model. 11 See Altonji (1993) for proofs of the claims in this section using a stripped-down version of the model sketched in this section. Consequently, this higher wage will increase the number of persons who spend the rst period of college in a program geared toward completing a degree in engineering by more than it reduces the number who start college in a program geared toward a humanities degree. If enough of the college entrants who start in engineering ultimately conclude that they prefer the humanities major and the occupations it leads to, and/or enough conclude that they are much more likely to be able to meet graduation requirements in humanities than in engineering, then the ow into humanities following the rst period of college could be enough to oset the smaller number who start college with the intention of pursuing a humanities degree. The role of risk aversion brings forward two important empirical issues. First, individuals will also care about uncertainty in ability and the eect of this uncertainty on alternative degrees or courses of study, possibly avoiding ones where ability might matter a lot. In general we will see a risk-return trade-o induced not only from the macroeconomic environment and the possible volatility of returns but also because of uncertainty in individual ability and microeconomic uncertainty in wages within each sector."}, {"section_title": "The returns to education paths", "text": "The model oers a systematic way of dening and measuring returns to education. Thus, for example, the returns to a major j relative to dropping out of college and working is dened as This depends on individual heterogeneity, known to the individual but not to the econometrician. The estimated return will be an average of this function and will depend on individual history. Thus, we can document how the returns dier across individuals with dierent choice history of courses, grades, etc. The ex ante heterogeneity of returns is driven partly by these dierences in early experiences and partly by the way that they aect individual perceptions and expectations of their ability and preferences. Moreover, they take fully into account the costs of education, including opportunity cost and eort involved in alternative course choices."}, {"section_title": "Econometric implications", "text": "The model we presented also brings to the fore econometric issues that will appear when reviewing the literature. First, wages across dierent levels of education and elds of study are best described by a Roy-type model, implying heterogeneous returns to education. In other words this is a switching regressions framework (see Quandt (1972), Heckman and Robb (1985)). Ex post the selection into any of the sectors will be endogenous to the extent that preferences about education are correlated with unobserved determinants of wages (lazy at school and lazy at work for example) and to the extent that information about future wages is known by the individual at the time education choices are made, but is unobserved by the econometrician. For example, if an individual knows they will be more productive working in an oce rather than outdoors, this will inuence the sequence of education choices and imply that education choice is endogenous for wages, even if education and labor market ability are themselves independent. This brings us to the dicult question of identiability and identication in practice. The model highlights the costs of education as the main source of exogenous variation: a low-cost college can trigger a chain of decisions that leads to college completion, where this may have not happened if fees were higher. Thus if there is variation in the costs of obtaining alternative combinations of education, and if such variation can be taken as exogenous (i.e. not correlated with quality of education or with the characteristics of the individuals having access to such fees), this can be an important source of exogenous variation. However, as shown in Heckman and Navarro (2007) and further discussed in Meghir and Rivkin (2010), this may be far from enough to identify such dynamic models non-parametrically. Thus, in practice, identication will be in part driven by such exogneous variables and by restrictions on the functional forms of the distribution of unobservables. The dynamic model presents a clear approach to estimating both an education choice model and the returns to education, as well as the specic properties of wages. Any source of endogeneity is taken into account and there is transparency regarding the assumptions made. However, it is a complicated model; to include all the detail we have suggested may be almost impossible in practice. Thus, a dynamic approach will have to impose a number of simplications and will rely on functional form restrictions. The complexity of such models and the detailed data requirements can be a serious impediment to their use. Meanwhile, most of the literature we review has taken the simpler approach of estimating relatively simple wage equations based on instrumental variables. The cost is the limited external validity and alternative assumptions that in a sense take the place of the ones required by the ful dynamic structural model: Imbens and Angrist (1994) have shown that IV will identify the Local Average Treatment Eect parameter (LATE), which is the eect of the binary treatment on those who were induced into treatment (college in our example) by the variation in the value of the instrument. If the instrument (say reform assignment) is independent of all the unobservables, such is the case when it is randomized, then LATE identies the eect of those who switched into treatment as a result of the reform under the key additional assumption that no one is induced out of treatment as a result of the policy (monotonicity). In this case the theoretical framework can be suggestive of whether monotonicity is valid. With many dierent treatments, as would arise in our context of multiple levels of education and curriculum choices, it is harder to interpret instrumental variables, even if we had enough instruments. This of course does not mean that the dynamic model is necessarily our only alternative. Consider, for example, the wage equation, and take expectations conditional on a set of instruments that have been randomized (Z ) and on educational history denoted by S. Assume that the dimension l indexes the education path. (We will ignore for this example the labor market history as well as time in the labor market.) average ex post return to education path S l i . In terms of our notation the issue is whether the control function assumption required, i.e. that E(u and whether it has independent variation from the education choices S l i . The form of this function is driven by the dynamic selection process described earlier in the theoretical model. Constructing this control function will require a model for S. In general this is not going to be a single index model, because of the sequential nature of the choices; hence the need for many instruments. For example, Cameron and Heckman (1998) have shown that education choice can be represented by an ordered choice model (which hugely simplies the identication and estimation problem) when there is just one unobserved factor driving educational decisions. When we depart from this very framework, we will need more than one index to represent the choice of S i as well as many instruments. This is an issue of both sucient amounts of exogenous variation and the correct structure. In interpreting the results of the existing empirical literature, we need to remember that important identication questions remain both when implementing the full dynamic structure and when estimating a simpler version of the model. But given the complexity and pitfalls of estimation based on dynamic structural models, we expect careful studies using IV strategies or OLS with rich controls to continue to play a critical role in the literature going forward."}, {"section_title": "The eects of high school curriculum on educational attainment and wages", "text": "As we noted in the introduction, there is surprisingly little hard evidence about the causal eects of specic high school courses on educational attainment and labor market outcomes. 12 This is partly due to data limitations, but mostly due to the fact that student course selection is not random given the available options, as is clear from the model in Section 2. Furthermore, student curriculum choices are shaped by school requirements, tracking policy, and guidance, and these reect to some extent the qualications and interests of the student body. In the supplemental appendix, we provide a brief discussion of trends in course taking, socieconomic correlates of course taking and role of graduation requirements, but we found little model-based curriculum choice. The complexity of the subject is undoubtedly part of the reason why. Even with excellent data, identifying the causal eects of high school courses on educational attainment, choice of college major and occupation, and wage rates is a dicult task. In this section we review the limited evidence on the eects of high school curriculum. We emphasize wage eects but also touch upon educational attainment and choice of major. We discuss the approaches to estimation that are used and briey summarize the results. None of the studies we reviewed model the endogeneity of curriculum choice by allowing for dynamics. The implication is a lack of clarity of the underlying determinants of both wages and educational choice, as we discussed in Section 2. The existing empirical studies estimate equations of the form for educational attainment S and ln W age for wages where here C i denotes high school curriculum, X i denotes background and other characteristics, e wi and e si are unobserved random intercepts, and g si and g wi are unobserved random coecients. C i is typically a count of the number of year-long courses taken in various subjects. It is likely to be correlated with the composite error terms in the equations, which will lead to bias in OLS estimates of G s and G w . Studies dier in a number of ways including in the assumed exogenous source of variation for the curriculum, in whether or not all courses are examined at the same time rather than one by one or in subsets, in whether courses in a given subject area are dierentiated by level, and in whether the analysis is conditional on high school graduation. An important issue is whether one should control for post-secondary education S in the wage equation. Doing so aects the interpretation of the coecient on C. The entire history and type of educational attainment will aect wages to the extent that each path leads to a dierent set of skills. As specied in (5), G w is the average eect of courses on lnW age holding years of post secondary education constant. For example, high school math and science courses may inuence the types of jobs obtained by students who enter the workforce after high school or facilitate completion of a BS in engineering as opposed to a lower-paying college major. Controlling for post-secondary education in some fashion makes sense because post-secondary schooling is costly. However, if the return \u03c1 exceeds the interest rate, then part of the return to C ih is through facilitating protable investments in S. It raises the option value of investment in S. Altonji (1995) reports a set of estimates based on including S in the wage equation with \u03c1 set to 0.04, which he assumes is the real discount rate. Most studies report estimates with and without S. None of the papers that estimate \u03c1 addresses the fact that S is endogenous in (5). We now to turn to the studies. Altonji (1995) is the rst comprehensive study of the eects of curriculum on postsecondary educational attainment and wages. 13 He uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS72), which follows samples of 12th grade students from a large number of high schools. His specication of (4) and (5) includes counts of courses in eight subject areas: math, science, English, social studies, foreign languages, commercial studies, industrial arts and ne arts. His main identication strategy uses the substantial amount of variation across high schools in the average value C h of C i as an instrumental variable for C i , where h is the high school i attends. 14 If the variation in C h reects high school or school district policies that are unrelated to the distribution of aptitude, ability, and prior preparation of the student body, then use of high school averages as excluded instruments would yield consistent estimates of the average treatment eect of an extra semester of math, science, etc. But casual observation, as well as the evidence from the NLS72 and other similar data sets, indicates that variation across schools in the quantity of academic courses is positively related to both the level and quality of the courses and to the quality 13 Rumberger and Daymont (1984) is a noteworthy early study of the eects of curriculum on wages shortly after high school. 14 For example, Levine and Zimmerman nd that both math and science courses boost educational attainment. There is evidence that additional math and science courses increase the probability of choosing a technical college major. This evidence relates directly to the question of how the type of education one chooses at the high school level conditions the optimal choice of education and occupation later. Additional math and science courses move women toward jobs that involve more mathematical reasoning, although the evidence is stronger in HS&B than in NLSY79. As the authors emphasize, the OLS estimates may be biased upward by selection in course-taking and the other issues discussed in more detail in Altonji (1995 17 We arrived at the 40% gure based on the fact that the reduced form coecients relating log earnings to MathReform fall from 0.028 to 0.019 (0.008) for black males, 0.026 to 0.016 (0.008) for black females, and 0.020 to 0.011 (0.010) for white males when education/graduating class interactions are added to the baseline specication. The estimates are negative but not signicant for white females regardless of whether education is in the model. education. These results, along with Goodman's TSIV estimates and Levine and Zimmerman's results, suggest that additional math courses have substantial value. There is also some evidence that vocational courses have value for students who did not intend to go to college. (See, for example, Altonji (1995) and Mane (1999) and additional references that she provides.) However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the value of particular courses of study, about how the courses aect post-secondary education, and about heterogeneity in these eects. We have two suggestions for research. The rst is to make use of the huge student record data sets that have become available in several US states and other countries. This information, combined with post-secondary education records and earnings (as is possible, for example, for the states of Florida and Texas) and in conjunction with information about specic reforms to curriculum at the high school and/or school district level, provides a way to address the problem of endogeneity of curriculum. A panel data set on course graduation requirements and course availability will have to be assembled for a large set of schools. Furthermore, the student record data sets can be used to study how curriculum aects post-secondary eld, which has been dicult to do because of sample size considerations in the panel data sets discussed above. The second is to integrate the study of curriculum choice into a dynamic model of educational attainment and labor market outcomes, along with sources of exogenous of variation in curriculum. This would help elucidate how courses are chosen and how education choices today inuence future opportunities. Furthermore, it will provide a systematic way of addressing selection in course-taking in a dynamic setting when estimating the return to curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Empirical evidence on the determinants of college major", "text": "The theoretical framework presented above implies that college major choice is inuenced by expectations of future earnings, preferences, ability, and preparation. We discuss some of the evidence on the role of each of these factors, drawing on both the small number of structural models and on the more extensive reduced-form approaches. First, however, we document some trends."}, {"section_title": "Trends in college major", "text": "Patterns of college major choice have been relatively steady over the past twenty years. Supplementary Figure 1 illustrates the trends across college graduation cohorts in the fractions of degrees accounted for by the ve most popular aggregated college majors. The results are shown separately for men and women. Later in this section we estimate the contribution of this change in composition to the growth of the college wage premium in the 1980s. Not surprisingly, women are far more prevalent in education, and men in engineering and in business and economics. However    A few recent papers directly measure expectations. They use specialized surveys (usually conned to one school) to assess students' subjective expectations about wages. A more representative sample of colleges would be preferable, but these studies provide unique insights into college students' decision-making. Betts (1996) nds that University of CaliforniaSan Diego seniors are much better informed about wages than freshmen, suggesting that students may wait to learn about their abilities and preferences before investing in informationgathering. This has implications for the timing and informativeness of information shocks about the labor market in our model, relative to the preference and learning shocks \u03b6 and . Given the diculty of majoring in science and engineering if one does not lay the foundation in freshman and sophomore year, students may be obtaining the labor market information after it is too late. Betts also shows that students from lower-income families systematically underestimate earnings for college-educated workers. Arcidiacono, Hotz & Kang (2010) nd that major choice is based on comparative advantage, in that Duke sophomores expect to have higher earnings in the major in which they are currently enrolled than in other majors (with the exception of economics, which all students believe would lead to higher earnings). Students also tend to be more accurate about future earnings in their own major than in other majors. Zafar (2009b) (Northwestern sophomores) and Betts (1996) nd similar results. Reassuringly, students' earnings expectations do correlate with actual earnings. The literature on choice of major also considers risk aversion. With concave preferences, students should consider the variance as well as the mean of earnings associated with particular programs of study. ( "}, {"section_title": "Ability and preparation", "text": "We have not yet said anything about how high school preparation and innate ability conditions choice of major. Turner Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2011) use a unique panel data set on Berea College students to track student major choices over time. Rather than asking students to state their expected major, they ask the students to assign probabilities to completing various majors (see also Manski (1993) and Manski (2004)). They nd that although many students begin their college careers assigning a high probability to nishing a science major, many learn that their abilities are not adequate. In our model, we incorporate this new information about one's abilities through performance shocks in college. Ost (2010) echoes Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner (2011) and Arcidiacono (2004) in documenting a positive relationship between grades and persistence in a particular major. However, Ost points that physical science majors get higher grades in non-science courses than in science courses and thus may be tempted away from science. This eect is exacerbated by increasing grade ination in non-science elds relative to science elds. He nds additionally that the presence of high-achieving peers in the physical sciences positively inuences one's own persistence. It is somewhat articial to separate ability and preparation from preferences in determining major choice.

If there were sucient regional variation in oerings across colleges, such as the availability of an engineering school, a variant of Card's (1995) distance to college instrument might be tried. Freeman (1976) and Siow (1984), among others, show that the supply to specic occupations depends upon market conditions at the time that students choose a eld of study. More work could be done using variation across time and place in the demand for particular types of majors. However, the A natural approach would be to use a regression discontinuity (RD) design in situations where certain majors have a test score cut-o or enrollment cap for entry. Some US universities use GPA cut-os as a way to ration access to some programs. The opportunity for RD approaches is greater in countries that admit students to particular programs and particular colleges based primarily on test scores. 26 However, because students are in fact making a sequence of decisions about whether to remain in school and about which eld to choose (particularly in the US context), there is an important distinction between ex ante and ex post returns to schooling decisions. Both of these returns to school choice depend on when the choice is made. The ex post return parameter to graduating in engineering identied by a regression discontinuity design based on grades or test scores at the time of college entry is dierent from the corresponding parameter identied using a grade cuto after the second year of college. Another selection issue is selection into the labor force. Employment rates dier substantially across majors both because of dierences in labor force attachment and dierences in the unemployment probability. Insofar as this problem is restricted to women, one solution is to estimate wage equations for men only, as is standard in the returns to schooling literature more generally. However, this sidesteps many interesting and important questions regarding gender dierences in choice of, and returns to, college major, and it does not address dierential unemployment risk. Hamermesh and Donald (2008) is the only paper we reviewed that explicitly corrects for selection into employment."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "They nd that accounting for selection into the labor force reduces earnings dierentials across major by 10-20%. Furthermore, this bias is most important for education majors, which is not surprising given the much larger proportion of female education majors and the fact that Hamermesh and Donald pool men and women. This points to the importance of an integrated approach where both employment and earnings prospects play a role in choosing major and employment selection is controlled for."}, {"section_title": "Estimates of the return to major", "text": "As we already noted, most studies use OLS with control variables rather than addressing endogenous selection into  There has been speculation that the dierence in returns is due to dierence in math ability. Paglin and Rufolo (1990), for example, explain 82% of the variance across college majors in entry-level wages on the basis of the average GRE-math scores by major. 31 Moreover, Grogger and Eide show that the return to math ability has increased over time: the eect of a one standard deviation increase in math ability grew from a 2% increase in wages in 1978 to 5% in 1986, and from 3% to 7.5% for women. There are also dierences across majors in hours worked. Hamermesh and Donald (2008) nd that controlling for hours worked and selection into the workforce reduces earnings dierentials. One might also be interested in the eects of college major on occupation, and in particular, the extent to which human capital is major-specic. Robst (2007) shows that students who are employed in a eld unrelated to their eld of study suer a wage penalty, suggesting that this is at least partially the case; however, the wage penalty varies by eld. The most specic elds, such as engineering, involve harsher penalties than elds which develop more general skills, such as liberal arts. Malamud (2011), however, shows that the British system that requires students to specialize early leads to greater eld-switching upon labor market entry than the Scottish system, which allows later specialization. This suggests that delaying specialization to learn about one's preferences and comparative advantage may outweigh any loss in eld-specic skills. Not much is known about the eect of college major on opportunities at the graduate level. Black et al (2003) 29 Black et al (2006) provide a similar analysis of the contribution of dierences in detailed major to race dierentials in the wages of highly educated men. Among individuals who speak English at home, dierences in education and language prociency account for essentially all of the small gap between white men and Hispanic men but only a quarter of the much larger gap between white men and black men. The reduction in the gap is about the same for the two groups. However, they account for the entire gap for black men born outside the South with parents who have some education. provide estimates of wage gaps by undergraduate major relative to economics for those who obtain an MBA or a graduate law degree. With the exception of chemical engineers who obtain an MBA, economists earn more than their counterparts from the other most common pre-MBA or pre-law majors. These results illustrate the importance of considering the options that an earlier education choice oers."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive evidence from the ACS on college major choice and returns", "text": "In this subsection we provide additional evidence on the relative returns to college major using the ACS. Unfortunately, the data set lacks test scores and family background measures, and so the estimates we report almost certainly overstate the relative return to majors that attract advantaged, high ability students. Nevertheless the large size of the ACS permits one to examine very detailed major categories with and without 5-digit occupation controls and to examine trends in major choice by graduation cohort and gender. Table 3 provides OLS estimates of major coecients separately for men and women, with and without occupation controls. These regressions include dummy variables for advanced degrees, a cubic in potential experience, and race/ethnicity as controls. The table reports only the 23 most popular of the 171 major categories included in the regression. These twenty-three account for just over half of the college-plus sample. The omitted category is General Education. Near the bottom of the table we also report the sample-weighted standard deviation of the major coecients adjusted for sampling error. 32 The dierences across majors are large. Consistent with results in the literature, the estimates show that engineers have the highest returns and education majors the lowest. This is true even after controlling for occupation. In most elds the size of the premium over a general education degree is higher for men than it is for women. The standard deviation is 0.177 for men and 0.146 for women. Thus, for men (women), a two standard deviation shift is associated with an increase of 0.354 (0.292) log points in earnings. To compare, the high schoolcollege dierential is 0.577. 33 Almost all of the gender dierence in the standard deviation is due to gender dierences in major choice rather than gender dierences in the dispersion of the major coecients. How have trends in major choice aected the gender gap holding the major coecients for men and women constant? Figure 2 takes the major coecients from Table 3 and calculates their weighted average by age and gender. (General education is the omitted category.) For individuals who graduated from college in the early 1970s, the weighted average of the female coecients using the male major weights is about 0.1 above the value using the female weights. The gap narrows for the later cohorts but does not move very much. The gap at the beginning of the period is even wider using the male weights, but it narrows during the 70s. These results indicate that over most of the period, the dierences in college major choice account for about a third of the gender gap in log wages. The gure also show how changes in the composition of majors have aected the average return to a college degree. 32 The sample is restricted to individuals between 23 and 59 years of age who worked more than 34 hours a week for more than 40 weeks in the previous year and who had a college or advanced degree. All majors are included, not just those corresponding to the coecients presented in the table. The full set of coecients are in Supplementary Table 3. See Carnevale et al (2011) for a descriptive analysis of the returns to college major using the ACS. For both men and women, the curves show an increase of about 0.05 in the weighted average of the returns between the early 1970s and about 1986. This is due to a shift toward more lucrative majors, particularly engineering and business, with a peak in the mid-80s. The gure shows a decline of about 0.02 after that. These shifts in the distribution of majors are illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1. We have also estimated, but do not present, a set of regressions using major characteristics from the B&B and We obtain 62.5% of the variation using average GRE math, verbal, and writing scores for graduate school applicants in a smaller number of major categories. However, this overstates the role pre-existing ability dierences for reasons touched upon earlier. What is the role of occupation? For men, the standard deviation of the college major coecients is 0.177 when occupation is excluded and 0.098 when it is controlled for. Thus a substantial part of the dierence in pay across majors is related to the occupations that they lead to. Part of this wage dierence represents compensating dierentials for nonpecuniary factors, of course. In summary, wages vary greatly across college major. The variation is large enough for the tendency for men to choose high paying majors to be an important factor in the gender gap in wages. A substantial part of the dierences in returns is almost certainly due to dierences in the market value of tasks that require the specic knowledge and skills particular majors develop. However, pre-college dierences in skill and ability, as captured by the SAT scores, and compensating dierentials for nonpecuniary attributes also play a role. Much remains to be learned about why majors pay so dierently."}, {"section_title": "College major and occupational choice", "text": "In this subsection we discuss the empirical link between college major and occupation.  evidence for this pattern. This gure reports the probability density (across majors) of the fraction of people in a major who are in one of the top ten occupations for that major. The peak of the densities occurs when the fraction is about 0.43. However, the heavy right tail and lower peak for those aged 25 to 34 indicates that occupational concentration is substantially larger for young workers. The ip side of this analysis is the proportion of workers in an occupation accounted for by the three most common majors for that occupation. In Supplementary Table 5 we report this statistic for a few occupations by stage of career. Not surprisingly, almost all registered nurses major in either nursing, biology, or psychology regardless of stage of career. The values for marketing and sales managers and for accountants and auditors are similar, though less extreme. Post-secondary school teachers and marketing and sales are examples of occupations that draw on a wider array of majors. With a large panel data set, one could go much further in examining the link between major and career path. We have already noted that much the variance in the returns to majors is associated with dierences in the pay of the occupations that they lead to. The clear message is that specicity of skill is important to a degree that varies across occupation and major."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The demand for and return to types of human capital investments is an exciting research area that is highly relevant for both education and labor market policy, as education and occupation choices dier greatly in the monetary and non-monetary rewards that they bring. Rather than summarizing the paper, we close by restating the questions for empirical research. The recent theoretical work on education and occupation choice that we have synthesized here emphasizes several key factors: the sequential nature of the decision-making process; the partial irreversibility of some decisions because of the heterogeneity of human capital and the cumulative nature of human capital investment in many elds; the importance of innate ability, preferences, and pre-high school learning in shaping the feasibility and non-pecuniary costs and benets of particular education and occupation paths; and the essential role of uncertainty about ability, preferences, knowledge accumulation, and wage rates at each stage. The theory has some very clear implications for empirical research. The rst concerns the determination of preferences for schooling in general and types of schooling in particular, which we touch on briey in Section 3. The second concerns the determination of the ability to do math, excel at science, write well, etc. The third concerns estimation of the knowledge production function. How should skills and knowledge be classied? How can they be measured using observables such as course content, grades, and tests? How much does learning in school or on the job depend on the program or the occupation? The fourth is how grades, knowledge and ability determine promotion and admission to colleges, a subject on which there is a substantial literature that we have not touched on here. The fth is how best to model the agent's information set and learning about ability and preferences. The sixth is estimation of the ex post payo to knowledge, ability, and degree by level and eld. We summarized a number of papers that attempt this for college education and a smaller number that look at high school curriculum. Much progress has been made, but there is a long way to go on the road to credible measures of the payo to elds of study. We suggest several approaches that might prove fruitful. The overriding question is the choice of education and occupation at each stage in the life course and the consequences of those choices. For example, how does the current utility and expected future utility of spending the rst period of college in a pre-engineering curriculum versus a ne arts curriculum depend on preferences, ability, and the stock of human capital at the start of college? The large earnings gaps across elds that attract students admitted to the same universities with similar grades and test scores strongly suggests that compensating dierentials are of critical importance.    Note: Relative fraction female is calculated by dividing the fraction female in a particular major in a particular year by the fraction of female college graduates that year, then smoothed using a three-year moving average. Data are from the ACS. We are not aware of any study that has estimated a structural model of high school curriculum choice along the lines sketched in the previous section. Zietz and Joshi (2005) use the NLSY (1997) to estimate a two-period model of leisure maximization, subject to minimum consumption constraints. They find that \"academic aptitude, pre-high school academic performance, and lifetime consumption goals as driven by peer pressure and family background are by far the most important determinants of program choice.\" Meer (2007), using the NELS88 data, finds that the principle of comparative advantage is at play when students choose between academic and vocational high school curricula. In the remainder of this section, we briefly summarize some of the descriptive evidence on the determinants of curriculum. There is a substantial literature on the role of gender, race/ethnicity, and socio-economic status in determining high school curriculum, which we touch on briefly here. Historically, girls tended to take less math and science than boys, despite equal (or greater) opportunities or prior achievement (Oakes (1990), Catsambis (1994), Ayalon (1995)). Girls tend to have less positive attitudes toward or fewer aspirations for careers in math or science; they are less interested in math and less confident about their mathematics abilities (Dick & Rallis (1991)). However, Goldin et al (2006) report that among graduating seniors the male/female ratio of mean number of high school courses in math, science courses, and chemistry declined from between 1.3 and 1.4 in 1957 to between 0.9 and 1.0 in 2000. In physics, the male/female ratio declined from 3.1 to 1.21. Students from high SES backgrounds tend to be streamed into more academic tracks; this can be explained by a variety of factors including higher intrinsic ability (cognitive or non-cognitive), choice of school and neighborhood, better preparation in primary school, peer effects, or parental lobbying (Vanfossen, Jones & Spade (1987)). Interestingly, African-American and Latino students have positive attitudes toward math, despite low achievement (Catsambis (1994)). That said, minorities enroll in math-intensive courses at lower rates than whites; however, this is mostly explained by SES and prior achievement (as measured, for example, by GPA) (Ferguson (2009)). Recent reports discussing student course taking and achievement with emphasis science, engineering, technology and math, include President's Council on Science and Technology (2011). To the extent that school behavior can be taken as independent of the unobserved characteristics of the students that attend the school, such variation can be (and has been) used to identify the effects of particular high school curricula. In practice, however, school choice and cross school competition and specialization (attracting particular parts of the student market) will undermine the credibility of such a strategy. In Section 3, we discuss three studies that use curriculum reforms as a source of exogenous variation."}, {"section_title": "School-level influences", "text": "Peers, teachers and facilities (e.g., availability of science labs or a theater) may also influence curriculum choice, but attempts to identify the causal effect of these factors are subject to the same endogeneity problem. 1 Supplementary From 2011 NAEP report.
