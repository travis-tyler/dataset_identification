"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Higher latitude regions are projected to experience the largest increase in temperatures as a result of rising greenhouse gases during this century (Meehl et al., 2006; Solomon et al., 2007) . These regions significantly impact global climate, primarily through the influence of sea ice albedo-climate feedback mechanism (IPCC, 2013; Lamb, 1965) and atmospheric teleconnections (Gregory et al., 2013 ). Yet, deficiencies in instrumental temperature data sets make detection of high latitude change difficult (Lamb, 1977) , as well as limiting our understanding of high latitude ocean-climate processes (Bourassa et al., 2013) . Gridded and interpolated sea surface temperature (SST) data products derived from ship of opportunity observations are globally available yet the number of observations for any single gridded area are reduced prior to 1950 (Deser et al., 2010) . Therefore, high-resolution reconstructions from proxy archives are needed to extend the available data sets back more than several decades to address questions on climate variability in the early 20 th century and preceding anthropogenic warming (Bourassa et al., 2013) . There are few such archives of ocean temperature for the high latitude oceans, thus limiting our understanding of past oceanic change on monthly-to-centennial time scales.\nThe high-resolution climate archives available at the higher latitude oceanic environments such as deepsea corals and bivalves are limited in their distribution, contain biological-induced variability in their geochemically-derived reconstructions (Torres et al., 2011) , or are located deeper in the water column and do not provide information about surface water variability. However, geochemical and sclerochronological records extracted from long-lived encrusting coralline alga Clathromorphum sp. are now providing significant records of higher latitude climate and ocean variability (Chan et al., 2011; Halfar et al., 2013; Halfar et al., 2007; Halfar et al., 2011b; Hetzinger et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2011) .\nClathromorphum sp. is very abundant in near-surface rocky seafloor environments throughout the mid-tohigh latitudes in the northern hemisphere and can grow for hundreds of years with specimens dating back nearly a millennium (Adey et al., Accepted; Halfar et al., 2007) . This alga forms clear annual growth increments in its high-Mg calcite skeleton in response to winter decreases in temperature and insolation, and onset of reproduction such that large, poorly calcified cells in the spring overlay short, heavily calcified cells formed during the previous winter ( Figure 1a ) (Adey, 1965; Adey et al., Accepted; Moberly, 1968 ) 7KH \u012f 18 O and Mg/Ca variations along the growth axis in the skeletons of Clathromorphum sp. vary in response to variations in SST (Halfar et al., 2008; Halfar et al., 2007; Hetzinger et al., 2009; Moberly, 1968) . Despite the high biological variability in growth rates among Clathromorphum sp. specimens (Halfar et al., 2011a; Halfar et al., 2011b) , the geochemical variability within a specimen or among specimens has not been fully assessed because previous studies generally rely on few specimens due to the analytical expense and time constraints of analyzing replicate transects in multiple specimens (Halfar et al., 2008; Halfar et al., 2007; Hetzinger et al., 2009; Hetzinger et al., 2012; Hetzinger et al., 2013 ). Yet, it is important to understand the intra-and inter-specimen geochemical variability so that environmentally-driven variability in the algal skeleton can be separated from biological variability and confidence intervals can be established for interpreting the records generated from geochemical measurements (de Villiers et al., 1995; DeLong et al., 2007; DeLong et al., 2013) .\nTherefore, robust assessments of skeletal Mg/Ca with SST records are needed prior to confidently extending Mg/Ca-derived SST reconstructions into the past.\nIn this study, we measure replicated transects of Mg/Ca in six specimens of Clathromorphum nereostratum from three islands in the Aleutian archipelago in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. We use these transects to assess geochemically-, biologically-, and environmentally-driven variability in skeletal Mg/Ca. We then determine a master transfer function for algal Mg/Ca to SST. The algal Mg/Ca calibration and uncertainty assessment developed here is a critical step to using C. nereostratum to reconstruct past absolute temperature variability for multi-centennial timescales in the ecologically and economically significant northern North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea regions."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area and climatology", "text": "This study examines six C. nereostratum specimens collected from Attu, Amchitka, and Akun Islands spanning 20\u00b0 of longitude in the Aleutian archipelago ( Figure 2 ). The Aleutian archipelago is a chain of volcanic islands extending westward from the Gulf of Alaska toward the Kamchatka Peninsula, separating the North Pacific Ocean to the south from the Bering Sea to the north. The Alaskan Stream, originating in the Gulf of Alaska, brings warmer water westward along the south side of the archipelago before turning into the Bering Sea through the Aleutian Islands passages where it is the dominant source of relatively warm, fresh, and nutrient-rich water (Reed and Stabeno, 1994) . Previous temperature reconstructions in this region using single coralline alga specimens indicate the central Aleutian archipelago is sensitive to climate patterns that influence the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and teleconnections into the region from the northern Atlantic\nOcean including the North Atlantic Oscillation (Halfar et al., 2007; Hetzinger et al., 2009; Hetzinger et al., 2012) .\nGlobally complete and interpolated gridded monthly SST data products (Kaplan et al., 1998; Rayner et al., 2003; Reynolds et al., 2002; Reynolds and Smith, 1994) are reconstructions using historical nautical records archived in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) database (Worley et al., 2005) for the interval before satellite-based observations (before 1981) . The authors of these monthly SST data products use numerical methods to complete grid cells with missing observations by interpolating from grids cells with observations, generally from coastal regions and shipping lanes.\nBecause local SST observations are not available at locations where the algal specimens were collected in this study, we extracted SST time series for 1\u00ba grid areas that include our study sites from two SST data products: the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST; 1981 -2003 (Reynolds et al., 2002) and the Hadley Centre Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature (HadlSST; 1960 -2003 (Rayner et al., 2003) . The OISST data product includes satellite-derived SST estimates thus providing complete spatial and temporal coverage (Reynolds et al., 2002) . The HadISST data product also includes satellite SST estimates from 1981 to present; however, before 1981 interpolated SST estimates are used when no observations are available (Rayner et al., 2003) . The number of ICOADS SST observations for the 2\u00b0 grid boxes that contain our study sites steeply decrease prior to the early 1960s (see Figure 3 for observations for the larger grid 50-56\u00b0N by 172\u00b0E-162\u00b0W) (Black et al., 2009; Deser et al., 2010; Hetzinger et al., 2012) . Thus, SST from these data products pre-1960s are less likely to capture the full range of seasonal variability and only SSTs post-1960 were used.

Two specimens were collected from each island (Table 1) .\nSpecimen sizes ranged from several centimeters to tens of centimeters ( Figure 1a ).\nSpecimens were air-dried and then sectioned perpendicular to the direction of maximum growth using a large rock saw at the University of Toronto. Thick sections were polished to three microns and highresolution images were generated using an Olympus reflected light microscope (VS-BX) attached to an automated sampling stage/imaging system equipped with the software geo.TS (Olympus Soft Imaging Systems). The resulting images were stitched together to form a single very high-resolution photomosaic of each section (Figure 1b) . The skeletal structure of each specimen was closely examined in the highresolution digital images to ensure that no growth discontinuities were present along transects selected for geochemical analysis. The geo.TS software was used to select two approximately parallel digital paths along the axis of maximum growth on the photomosaic for each specimen avoiding the conceptacles.\nConceptacles are the spheroidal cavities used for reproduction formed in part by the dissolution of previously calcified skeleton (Figure 1b) . Coordinates of the two digital pathways along with two reference points for each specimen were transferred to the automated stage of the laser ablationinductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) system used to measure Mg/Ca ratios."}, {"section_title": "Specimen analysis", "text": "Microprobe Mg/Ca values for specimen 11-4 from Attu Island were previously reported by Hetzinger et al.

Since the extended uncertainty of analysis ) is a function of the analytical uncertainty on the values in the reference material in addition to crater aspect ratios and matrix, the advantages of using NIST SRM glasses outweigh the disadvantages of an unmatched matrix. The extended uncertainty on Mg is in fact twice as high (16%, Jochum et al. (2012) their Table 1 ) for MACS3\nthan that for NIST 610 (6%).\nIt is generally recommendable to use the 193 nm wavelength for trace element measurements in carbonate materials to minimize fractionation effects (Czas et al., 2012; Hathorne et al., 2007; Jochum et al., 2012) .\nHowever, these element fractionation effects are largest for siderophile elements, while lithophile elements like Mg are less or not at all affected (Czas et al., 2012; Fryer et al., 1995; Hathorne et al., 2007; Jochum et al., 2012) . Elemental fractionation is higher for smaller craters than for larger craters at constant sampling time. The choice of 65 \u00b5m crater sizes in this study presents a good compromise between maximal spatial resolution and at the same time minimal elemental fractionation for the lithophile elements. In fact, fractionation factors approach 1(i.e. no significant elemental fractionation) for lithophile elements for silicate glasses and carbonate reference materials at 65 \u00b5m crater size ."}, {"section_title": "Chronological development and growth", "text": "Seasonal changes in ambient temperature and light drive variability in Clathromorphum sp. growth rates throughout the year (Adey et al., Accepted) . The physical differences between winter and summer cells were clearly visible in all specimens. Mg/Ca values measured along transects were visually matched with the changes in cell structure to develop annual chronologies for each specimen. Working from the youngest to the oldest part of the sampling path, years were assigned to each annual growth increment and the corresponding seasonal cycle of Mg/Ca in each specimen using the winter growth line to assign January for each year. Previous chronologies in several of the specimens were independently developed for growth-increment width analyses (Halfar et al., 2011b) and verified against those determined in the current study. Additionally, the previous chronology for specimen 11-4 was verified using U/Th dating (Halfar et al., 2007) . Annual growth rates were determined in specimen G1-1a by measuring the distance between winter growth lines. Annual growth rates for the remaining five specimens were previously measured by Halfar et al. (2011b) (Table 1) . Analyseries software (Paillard et al., 1996) was used to assign the annual chronology to a calendar year using the maximum and minimum values as tie points and then was used to down sample and linearly interpolate the LA-ICP-MS Mg/Ca transect records to a monthly-resolved time series ( Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "Prior to interpolation to monthly resolution, the quality of the data was verified to ensure no sampling or analytical inconsistencies. In rare cases, the destructive sampling during laser ablation broke through to a conceptacle below the surface of the thick section that was not visible in the photomosaic image. In these cases, the Mg/Ca ratios were elevated, thus the entire year was removed for that transect. Spikes in the raw Mg/Ca related to variability in the laser signal intensity were avoided (see raw data in Figure 5 ).\nOutliers defined as \u00b11.5 times the interquartile range of the raw LA-ICP-MS data were removed.\nAssignment of annual chronology to winter growth lines is relatively straight forward, yet assignment of individual Mg/Ca determinations to a calendar date or month is not always clear. To avoid introducing uncertainties from subannual dating assignments, we used only the maximum and minimum Mg/Ca values representing summer SST highs and winter SST lows, respectively, for calibration of the Mg/Ca values to SST. Such practice is commonly used in coral-based calibration studies (Corr\u00e8ge, 2006) . Mg/Ca determinations were not smoothed prior to selecting the maximum and minimum Mg/Ca values to prevent muting the seasonal range.\nTo assess intra-and inter-specimen variability, standard descriptive statistics for maxima and minima were calculated on an expanding scale for each transect, each specimen, and each island. General linear model (GLM) statistics investigated differences among transects, specimens, and islands using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc). The absolute difference was determined between two transects within the same specimen, between two specimens from the same island, and between records from different islands. Absolute difference quantifies the discrepancy between coeval algal Mg/Ca measurements (Eq. 1) (DeLong et al., 2013) .\nIn paleoclimate calibration studies, linear regression typically assumes error is equal (reduced major axis) or negligible for the independent regressor (ordinary least squares) when a single time series is used (York et al., 2004) . Weighted least squares (WLS) regression (York et al., 2004) allows for the assignment of weights based on uncertainty when such assessments are possible. WLS was used to determine the relationship for maximum and minimum values of skeletal Mg/Ca with coeval OISST for the interval from 1982 to 2003 using code developed in MATLAB \u00ae (DeLong et al., 2007) . Regression analysis was performed on an expanding scale for each transect, each specimen, each island, and of all the specimens by averaging respective maxima and minima for each time series. The weights for this expanding scale regression analysis were determined by assessing standard error for each Mg/Ca determination based on deviations between the determination and the average of those determinations.\nThe weights for OISST are the reported error of 0.3\u00b0C for SST (Reynolds et al., 2002) . The reconstruction error for Mg/Ca-SST (\u00b0C) was determined using standard error of regression \u0131 R ) where n is the number of observations.\nCovariance is reported as Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients. All significance testing assumes a 5% significance level.\nFollowing standard practices for calibration and verification in climate reconstructions (Crowley et al., 1999; Fritts et al., 1979) , we verified the Mg/Ca-SST developed with OISST for the period 1982 to 2003\nwith HadISST (Rayner et al., 2003) for the verification interval from 1960 to 1981 for island-specific calibrations and for a master record comprised of all six specimens."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Average skeletal Mg/Ca", "text": "Mg/Ca values were averaged for the 43-year analysis period for each transect to evaluate intra-specimen, inter-specimen, and inter-island variability.

Here, individual regression equations for skeletal Mg/Ca with OISST were generated for each specimen by combining the replicated transects, for each island, and for all three of the islands combined to a master time series (Table 2) .\nAveraging two specimens from a single island to create an island-specific record as well as averaging the island-specific records to create a master record increased the correlation between SST and skeletal Mg/Ca and reduced the standard error of regression by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (Table 2) . By combining records together, the error of regression was reduced from \u00b10.65 to 0.84\u00b0C for a single specimen to \u00b10.45\u00b0C for the master record.

The slope for Akun Island fell in the middle, although the specimen-specific Mg/Ca-SST relationship for specimen 8-24 was lower than that for Amchitka Island."}, {"section_title": "Verification of Mg/Ca-SST relationship", "text": "The algal Mg/Ca values were converted to SST using the determined transfer functions ( Table 2 ). The minimum and maximum algal-SST significantly correlated with HadISST record, such that the algal-SST explained between 95% and 98% of the variance in the HadISST record (Table 3) . (Figure 11 ).\nUsing the maximum and minimum values as tie points, the raw LA-ICP-MS data were interpolated to monthly values and converted to temperature in \u00b0C. This monthly-interpolated algal-SST significantly correlated with monthly HadISST; however, explained less of the variance than the comparisons with only the maximum and minimum values (Figure 12a ; Tables 3 and 4) . For both the maximum and minimum values, and monthly values, the master record explained the highest amount of variance in the gridded-SST and had the lowest error of regression (Tables 3 and 4 ).\nThe months of the intra-annual SST varies between that of the algal-SST and the HadISST. Generally, one to two months represented the warm and cold seasons in the algal-SST while seasonal changes in SST were evenly spaced out over the year in the HadISST dataset (three months for the warm season and five months for the winter season) (Figure 12a ). The anomalies smoothed with a 25-monthly running average varied significantly (r 2 =0.38, p<0.0001, n=493, Figure 12b ). The residuals of the algal-SST minus the HadISST indicate that the algal-SST systematically overestimated temperature during the winter months and underestimated temperature during the late spring and early summer months ( Figure   12c ). Monthly algal-SST and HadISST significantly correlated over the duration of the verification interval based on running correlation (r values between 0.52 and 0.88, Figure 12d ).\nThe annual averages for the analysis period were determined from the monthly-interpolated values.\nAnnual HadISST correlated significantly with algal-SST for the 43 year study period (Figure 12a , Table 5 ).

Below we address the factors that could induce variability in the algal skeletal Mg/Ca outside of that generated by ambient SST, first exploring within specimen variability, followed by among specimen variability, and then among island variability.\nMatrix effects in LA-ICP-MS between the carbonate skeleton and glass standard can vary by up to 10% from day to day potentially causing a significant difference in mean Mg/Ca values between transects analyzed on different days (difference of up to 0.02 mol/mol). Although the mean absolute difference between two transects within a single specimen never exceeded 0.011 mol/mol, this analytical uncertainty may explain some of the differences between replicate transects within a specimen, particularly in specimen G1-1a ( Figure 6 ). Analytical uncertainty, however, does not explain the interannual variability between transects or between specimens ( Figure S1 ).\nSampling resolution varied between transects within a specimen due to the indirect paths the laser ablation system sometimes took to avoid the conceptacles. This means that the replicated transects were not necessarily parallel at all times. If one transect crossed a single year of growth at an angle rather than directly across the year of growth, this first transect could have higher resolution and each LA-ICP-MS data point will span a shorter period in time. This is likely a negligible influence here as there are at least several thousand LA-ICP-MS data points going into each 43-year transect (e.g., Figure 5 ). Instead, the very high-resolution LA-ICP-MS measurements (generally less than ten microns per sequential increment) may capture ultra-structural scale heterogeneity in the skeletal architecture and geochemistry (Adey et al., Accepted) , similar to that reported in scleractinian corals (e.g., Allison and Finch, 2004) .\nThis may reflect biological processes altering geochemistry during calcification (i.e., vital effects), which will influence the Mg/Ca ratios on ultra-structural scales and may drive some variability among transects within a single specimen. C. nereostratum, along with all high-Mg calcite organisms, increases the ratio of Mg to Ca during calcification relative to that of seawater (Moberly, 1968) indicating that there is a vital offset from seawater composition (Hetzinger et al., 2009 ). However, while calibration studies under controlled conditions using C. nereostratum are currently not available, the vital offset in Mg/Ca from seawater composition in this alga, similar to other organisms with a vital effect, is likely constant within a given species on the larger scales explored here, and does not drive variability among islands. The absence of significant influence of growth rates on Mg/Ca values on interannual timescales supports this assumption, as vital effects are largely associated with changes in calcification and linear extension (i.e., growth) rates. The absence of such a relationship between growth rates and Mg content is not consistent with previous studies that did not include C. nereostratum reporting that growth rates positively influence magnesium content in some species of coralline algae (Kolesar, 1978; Moberly, 1968) .\nDestructive invertebrate grazing on C. nereostratum continuously removes the outer layer of photosynthetic epithallium in C. nereostratum (Steneck, 1982) that covers the meristem cell layer (site of calcification) and the deeper basal perithallium forming the bulk of the plant. The perithallium is largely preserved without alteration after formation, the exception being dissolution of select parts of the skeleton due to the formation of conceptacles for reproduction and possible grazing extending beyond the epithallium into the perithallium. Uneven grazing could remove part or all of the previous year's growth at specific sites in the algal skeleton. Grazing would not remove an entire year of growth uniformly across the entire specimen. Careful selection of the LA-ICP-MS laser path using the digital images avoided sections of the skeleton showing signs of grazing. In areas where grazing removed part of the previous year's growth, the growth band in the skeleton would still be present but part of the year's growth would be absent or filled with specialized cells formed by the algae to repair the wound post-grazing (hypothallium). Grazing may be more evident during warmer summer temperatures when invertebrates are more active, resulting in the removal of skeleton containing maximum Mg/Ca values. Consequently, reconstructed algal-SSTs would underestimate actual SST values. Although grazed areas visible in the digital images were avoided during analyses of the specimens here, it is feasible that small amounts of grazed material were missing from the analyzed material resulting in the wider variability present in the reconstructed summer SSTs. Collecting specimens from colder water deeper in the water column (>10 m) may reduce the influence of grazers, although these algae would be more likely to capture changes in the subsurface water temperature and not SST.\nTemperature and light levels influence Mg/Ca in other coralline algae (Moberly 1968) . Therefore, specimen-specific habitat characteristics including different light levels may drive the Mg/Ca variability between specimens of C. nereostratum at a single island. This variability in Mg/Ca values was most evident between the two samples from Akun Island ( Figure S1d ). The rocky bottom of Akun Island has a small scale (<50 cm) spur and groove morphology and light levels reaching the two specimens oriented differently toward the light within this habitat structure may have differed over the lifespans, resulting in offsets in Mg/Ca between the two specimens. Regardless of the cause of the variability, we can make the broad assumption that the average of the two samples starts to converge on a single value representative of each island. To support this assumption, we find that the average absolute difference between two specimens at the same island is either similar to or lower than the difference between two transects within a single specimen ( Figure S1 ).\nThe largest differences among the islands occur during the summer months (Figures 8 and 9 ). While maximum monthly SSTs varied among the islands (Figure 4) , this difference was not large enough to explain the variability in maximum monthly Mg/Ca. The long residence time of Mg and Ca in seawater (Lear et al., 2002) suggests that there is little variability in seawater Mg/Ca between islands. Therefore, this is not a contributor to the significant variability that exists between islands, although without local seawater measurements there is the possibility that site-specific mixing or upwelling could alter the local saturation state with respect to high-Mg calcite. These island-specific effects indicate that, if available, local SST-Mg/Ca calibrations are preferred to reconstruct summer SST."}, {"section_title": "Verification of Mg/Ca-SST transfer functions", "text": "This study does not evaluate the fidelity of gridded-SST data in reflecting in situ seawater temperature at the sites that the coralline algae were collected from. This is important to note as the thermocline can shoal to less than 10 m in the Aleutian archipelago during the summer season (Callaway, 1963) (Figure 12a ), which is evident in the cyclical residuals (Figure 12c ), suggests the assignment of monthly Mg/Ca introduced subannual dating uncertainties.\nAssuming that in situ temperatures follow a smooth seasonal cycle, these data indicate that algal growth is slow during the cold winter and warm summer months during the year, and faster during the spring and fall months (Figure 12a ). This is not consistent with faster summer growth in C. compactum (Adey, 1965; Halfar et al., 2008) . Thus, the intra-annual deviations in the algal record from HadISST may reflect changes in thermocline shoaling. Regardless, the 43-year average of the monthly-interpolated algal-SST values (6.2\u00b0C) overestimates HadISST determined from monthly values (5.8\u00b0C) by 0.4\u00b0C, which is less than the error of regression for the master record (\u00b10.45\u00b0C).\nThe annually averaged algal-SSTs captured the HadISST records well over the 43 years of the study period, although annually-averaged Mg/Ca explains a relatively small amount of SST variance on interannual timescales (Table 5 (Table 5) , likely reflecting the larger analytical error during measurement of higher Mg/Ca values, the increased grazing from chitons during the summer, and potentially a greater influence of light variability during the summer season. In addition, the algal-SST records of summer values and winter values both followed changes in minimum and maximum HadISST (Figure 11 ), allowing the algal Mg/Ca values to be a tool to reconstruct past seasonality. In some cases, the algal Mg/Ca-SST lagged air temperature by one year (Figure 10 , Table 5 ). This lag could reflect inaccuracies of the chronology but more likely, rounding error resulting from subannual dating uncertainties. Improved understanding of intra-annual growth rates in the algae would work to address this problem."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The long-lived coralline algae C. nereostratum may start to address the data gap in high-resolution proxy archives of mid-to-high latitude climate variability.
