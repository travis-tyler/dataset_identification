[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by droplets and likely aerosols. The median incubation period is about 5\u20136 days (range 1\u201314 days)1 and the median age at confirmed infection in Germany is 49 years. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, anosmia, ageusia, and pneumonia. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is higher among elderly and among ethnicities other than Caucasians. Furthermore, a markedly higher mortality rate has been observed for several comorbidities including obesity class II (BMI 35\u20220\u201339\u20229 kg/m2) and III (BMI 40\u20220+ kg/m2), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, malignancies in the previous year, severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (below 30 ml/min/1\u202273m2), chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, chronic liver disease, stroke, dementia, organ transplant, and immunosuppression2.\nThe case-fatality of COVID-19 in Germany below age 60 years is close to zero. However, among elderly, the case-fatality exponentially increases from age 60\u201364 up to age 80\u201384 and thereafter slightly levels off3. The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in Germany at week 10 (March 2, 2020) and ended in week 23 (June 7, 2020). As part of the fight against the pandemic, the federal government banned major events with more than 1000 participants from March 9, 2020. This was followed by a nationwide lockdown on March 23, 2020.\nTo estimate the mortality burden of SARS-CoV-2 it is possible to study the increase in deaths if SARS-CoV-2 had not occurred. Vestergaard et al. presented pooled estimates of all-cause mortality and estimated excess deaths for 24 European countries together.4 Due to the different course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in European countries, pooling of mortality data masks important national differences. The aim of this paper is to provide estimates of excess mortality in Germany during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods ::: Material & methods", "text": "To dampen the random fluctuation of age-specific mortality figures we aggregated daily numbers to weekly numbers with weeks starting on Mondays. In the main analysis, the reference period are weeks 10\u201323 of the years 2016\u20132019 and the index period are weeks 10\u201323 in 2020. The reference period provides the number of expected deaths in the absence of COVID-19. For each calendar week 10\u201323, we subtracted the expected number of weekly deaths from the observed number of deaths for the weeks 10\u201323, 2020.\nFurthermore, we estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals by age groups 0\u201329, 30\u201349, 50\u201359, 60\u201369, 70\u201379, 80\u201389, and 90 years and more. As provided data were not stratified by sex, we were not able to provide sex-specific SMRs. The reference period of 2016\u20132019, weeks 10\u201323, includes seasonal influenza waves. The estimated excess mortality due to seasonal influenza as reported by the Robert Koch-Institute in 2015\u20132016 (week 2\u201315 of 2016) was 0, in 2016\u20132017 (week 51 of 2016 to week 11 of 2017) was 22,900 deaths, and in 2017\u20132018 (week 52 of 2017 up week 14 of 2018) was 25,100 deaths. Excess deaths for the seasons 2018\u20132019 (week 2\u201314 of 2019) and 2019\u20132020 (week 2\u201312) are not available until now."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity analysis ::: Material & methods", "text": "Within the years 2016\u20132020 there were marked changes in population size, especially in the age group of 80+ years (increase by relative 17\u20225 percent) where the expected number of COVID-19 deaths is highest (Supplementary Table 1). Not accounting for this increase produces a bias of the SMR away from the reference value to values above 1.\nWe therefore ran a sensitivity analysis that can only partially address this potential bias because weekly population figures are not available. Instead, we had to use midyear population figures to estimate weekly age-specific mortality rates. We first estimated the age-specific weekly mortality rates for each year 2016 through 2019 using the age-specific midyear populations of these years and thereafter calculated the means of these annual age-specific weekly rates so that we came up with mean mortality rates for the age groups 0\u201329, 30\u201349, 50\u201359, 60\u201369, 70\u201379, and 80+ years for each calendar week 1\u201352.\nAs for 2016\u20132019, weekly population figures for 2020 were not available. We used instead the age-specific population figures of December 31, 2019 as a surrogate for the weekly population figures of the weeks 1\u201326 in 2020. We multiplied these population figures with the weekly age-specific mean rates of 2016\u20132019 to generate the expected number of deaths per week in 2020 in each age group. Thereafter, we estimated SMRs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Supplementary Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany lasted from week 10 to 23 in 2020. During this period, overall 183,978 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed and 8674 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been registered. The peak of the weekly number of newly confirmed cases and weekly deaths associated with COVID-19 was week 13 (March 23\u201329, 2020) and 17 (April 20\u201326) respectively. The peak of the weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU treatment was also week 17. At week 17, overall 73% of all COVID-19 patients treated at ICUs received artificial ventilation (Fig. 1\n).\nThe expected number of weekly deaths based on mean values across the years 2016 through 2019 and the observed number of weekly deaths in 2020 are presented in Fig. 2\n. For the age groups 30\u201349, 50\u201359, and 70\u201379 years, the observed number of deaths was lower than the expected number of deaths for the weeks 2\u201312 in 2020. In contrast, during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in Germany (week 10\u201323), the observed number of deaths was higher than the expected number for the age groups 60\u201369, 80\u201389, and 90+ years. The age group 70\u201379 years did not show any excess mortality during the first wave.\nThe age-specific SMRs by calendar week 1\u201326 are shown in Fig. 3\n. Between week 7 and 10 (Feb 10 to March 8, 2020) SMRs tended to be below 1 for all age groups except ages 0\u201329 and 60\u201369 years. Thereafter, SMRs increased up to 1\u202225 for the age groups 60\u201369 years, 80\u201389, and 90+ years. The excess number of deaths (negative numbers indicate a lower number than expected, positive numbers indicate higher numbers than expected) for the weeks 10\u201323 were negative for the ages 0\u201359 years and 70\u201379 years and positive for all other age groups. The net excess number of deaths for weeks 10\u201323 was +8071 deaths. This number deviates from the registered number of 8674 deaths associated with COVID-19 as reported by the Robert Koch-Institute for the same time period.\nFor the period of the first SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany (week 10\u201323, 2020), the overall SMR was 1\u202203 (95%CI 1\u202203\u20131\u202204). SMRs were increased for the age groups 60\u201369, 80\u201389, and 90+ years. The largest increase occurred among people of the age groups 80\u201389 and 90+ years (SMR=1\u202208 and SMR=1\u202209 respectively) (Table 1).\nOur sensitivity analysis reveals that the overall SMR for the week 10\u201323, 2020, is 0\u202298 (95%CI 0\u202298\u20130\u202299). With the exception of the age group 60\u201369 years, SMRs were below 1. According to this sensitivity analysis, there is a deficit of overall 4926 deaths during week 10\u201323, 2020. For age groups 60\u201369, 70\u201379, and 80+ years, weekly SMRs showed a peak at week 14\u201315 and were above 1 (60\u201369 years: SMR=1\u202209, 70\u201379 years: 1\u202207, 80+ years: 1\u202212) (Supplementary Figs. 1 & 2)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany produced excess mortality during its first wave from week 10\u201323 in 2020. The estimated excess number of deaths during this period (+8071 deaths) is to some extent lower than the reported figures of deaths (8674 deaths) associated with COVID-19 by the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). The gap between reported COVID-19 deaths and estimated excess deaths (overall 603 deaths) is influenced by several factors including the filling and coding quality of death certificates, the SARS-CoV-2 test capacity in Germany at that time and the location of death (hospital, nursing home, or unattended death at home)8. The RKI counts all deaths that are \"associated with COVID-19\u2033, which includes deaths that are potentially not attributable to COVID-19. According to the RKI report of July 26, 2020, about 12% of all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were placed in nursing homes and other mass accommodations and 46% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in these facilities. The median age at COVID-19 death was 82 years in Germany9.\nThe influenza season 2017/2018 (week 52 of 2017 up week 14 of 2018) was the worst influenza season in Germany of the last 30 years with an estimated excess number of deaths of overall 25,100.10 However, also the influenza season 2016/2017 resulted in an excess number of deaths of overall 22,900 deaths in Germany. Excess deaths for the influenza seasons 2018\u20132019 (week 2\u201314 of 2018) and 2019\u20132020 (week 2\u201312 of 2020) have not been provided by the Robert Koch-Institute until now. Our estimated SMRs below 1 during the weeks 2\u201312 in 2020 may be explainable by a shorter interval of the influenza season 2019\u20132020 (11 weeks) compared to the previous five influenza seasons (13\u201315 weeks) and by a milder course.11 Compared to seasonal influenza, Germany has apparently got off lightly so far with COVID-19.\nGermany has also come through the first wave well in international comparison. The estimated excess deaths due to COVID-19 are markedly higher in countries such as Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Brazil and the United States. Many factors may explain why Germany was so far successful in combating the pandemic in terms of excess mortality. First, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in Germany predominantly among younger people (median age of 40 years until March 4, 2020)12 typically coming back from skiing holidays in the alps and only thereafter the pandemic also spread among older people. Since March 2020, the median age of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases which were reported to the Robert Koch-Institute changed to 48 years in July 26, 20209. Low age at infection is one of the most important factors that prevents COVID-19 deaths2. In contrast to Japan where a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections were acquired in hospitals and nursing homes13, only about 15% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were acquired by typically more vulnerable and elderly patients in hospitals or nursing homes up to the end of the first SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave in Germany.14 Second, the daily mean number of social contacts defined as either skin-to-skin contact (kiss or handshake) or a two-way conversation with three or more words in the physical presence of another person was considerably lower in Germany (8\u20220) than in any other country that was included in this study. Italy had the highest mean value of 20. Furthermore, the difference of mean contacts in Germany and Italy is particularly prominent for contacts of children to persons aged 65 years or more15. The considerably lower amount of social mixing in Germany may have prevented especially infections among the elderly who have a considerably higher case-fatality than younger people. Third, factors related to the health care system including the number of general practitioners, hospital beds and especially ICU bed capacity may have played a beneficial role in Germany. Fourth, the early pandemic management may have differed compared to other countries. In response to the pandemic, local public health authorities were strengthened and extra staff was employed to support local contact tracing16. Subjects with a potential infection or contact to other infected subjects and people coming from risk territories were strongly encouraged to stay at home. Furthermore, these people were advised not to see a doctor if possible. If general practitioners (GPs) or the local health authority was asked for help and advice much of this counselling was done via telephone hotlines. The indication for a SARS-CoV-2 test was examined by the local health authorities (Public Health offices) because of the initial bottlenecks in testing capacity. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was performed in case of symptoms, contact to infected persons, or persons from risk areas. This approach was possible because Germany was in addition to some Asian countries one of the first in the world to establish meaningful test capacities. As a consequence, many contacts to infected people could be prevented and it was possible to prevent increasing numbers of infected persons and thus also in some cases persons requiring intensive care treatment.17 Further research is needed to find out why the pandemic has been so relatively mild in Germany.\nBased on our results we cannot answer whether the rigorous lockdown in Germany was the reason for the relatively low numbers of fatal cases during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections. With 2922 COVID-19 patients at intensive care units on April 18, 2020, the first SARS-CoV-2 wave had reached the maximum COVID-19-related utilization of the ICUs. At that time, the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, which did not completely register all hospitals with ICU beds at the time, registered about 16,700 available ICU beds17 so that debates on triage of patients did not seem to be indicated. In the meanwhile, the intensive care bed capacity has been increased to 30,000 beds. As long as the intensive care bed capacity is not too heavily burdened by COVID-19, risk-based lockdown relaxation measures seem possible, especially for younger people (under 60 years) in Germany.18 However, relaxation measures should be accompanied by close monitoring of the development of COVID-19 case numbers. According to Dehning et al., effects of lockdown relaxation on the number of confirmed new infections occur with a delay of about 11 days in Germany1.\nThere are several factors that limit our results. First, we were not able to provide sex-specific estimates of excess mortality because the Federal Bureau of Statistics did not provide these data until now. We expect that men will show a higher excess mortality than women. In their cohort study based on national primary care electronic health record data linked to COVID-19 death data, Williamson et al. found a 59% (95%CI 53\u201365%) higher COVID-19 mortality rate among men than women after multiple adjustment for several confounders2. Second, the years 2016\u20132019 were used to estimate the COVID-19 excess mortality. However, these years were affected to varying degrees by the seasonal influenza excess mortality. Depending on the inclusion or exclusion of single years of the period 2016\u20132019 estimates of excess mortality vary. We therefore used the average number of deaths of the weeks 1\u201323 for the years 2016\u20132019 to reduce the influence of a single year. Third, we could only partially address the change in age distribution of the German population from 2016 to 2020. This imperfect sensitivity analysis showed that there was no excess mortality during the first pandemic wave in Germany but a deficit of deaths (overall 4926 deaths). It is difficult to decide whether the main or sensitivity analysis is more valid. Both forms of analysis suffer from limitations. While the main analysis did not take into account the change in age structure in the reference period, the sensitivity analysis did not take into account the weekly change in the underlying population figures during the reference and index period. The advantage of our main analysis is the predictability of the direction of potential bias: estimated SMRs tend to be farer away from the reference value. It is hard to speculate about the direction of the bias in our sensitivity analysis. Fourth, number of deaths may be influenced by other factors than influenza and COVID-19. For example, the lockdown was accompanied by a marked decrease of car, train, and air traffic and a reduction of contact rates, which was also most likely accompanied by a reduced risk of other infectious diseases. Furthermore, the lockdown was accompanied by a marked decrease in hospital bed occupancy, as hospitals were required by decree to maintain most of the capacity to treat expected COVID-19 cases. This was accompanied by a marked decrease in the hospitalization rate of the population and thus a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitals."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Competing Interest", "text": "None of the authors declares a competing interest."}]
