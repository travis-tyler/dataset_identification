[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We developed a merged younger-older adult template of the fornix and demonstrated its utility for studies of aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). In Experiment 1, probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct the fornix in younger and older adults and successful streamlines were then averaged to create a merged template in standard space. The new template includes the majority of the fornix from the hippocampal formation to the subcallosal region and the thalamus/hypothalamus. In Experiment 2, the merged template was validated as an appropriate measure for studies of aging, with comparisons against manual tracing measures indicating identical spatial coverage in younger and older adult groups. In Experiment 3, the merged template was found to outperform age-specific templates in measures of sensitivity and specificity computed on diffusion tensor imaging data of an independent participant cohort. In Experiment 4, relevance to preclinical AD was demonstrated via associations between fractional anisotropy within the new fornix template and cerebrospinal fluid markers of AD pathology (A\u03b2 42 and the t-tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio) in a third independent cohort of cognitively normal older adults. Our new template provides an appropriate measure for use in future studies seeking to characterize microstructural alterations in the fornix associated with aging and preclinical AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The fornix is a key associative tract of the limbic system, interconnecting the hippocampal formation with subcortical structures in the basal forebrain and diencephalon. The fornix forms a core portion of the Papez circuit, described in 1937 (Papez, 1937 , and its course has been extensively studied in animal tracer experiments (Daitz and Powell, 1954; Aggleton and Brown, 1999) . Anatomically, the fornix is an arched, C-shaped structure divided into four bilateral sections. Left and right fornices connect with their ipsilateral hippocampal formation as the fimbria, sweep toward the midline as the crura, arch dorsally under the corpus callosum as the body, and curve ventrally as the columns. The postcommissural columns principally connect the hippocampal formation with the thalamus and hypothalamic nuclei (Aggleton, 2012) .\nThe precommissural columns principally connect the hippocampal formation with deep septal nuclei (Poletti and Creswell, 1977) .\nThe advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Basser et al., 1994; Le Bihan et al., 2001) has allowed for in vivo study of the fornix in aging and age-related neurodegenerative conditions. A body of DTI studies have shown that microstructural properties of the fornix are negatively affected by aging (Lebel et al., 2012; Michielse et al., 2010; Salat et al., 2005; Sullivan et al., 2010) . Additional, more pronounced, declines in fornix microstructure have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (Bozzali, 2002; Kantarci et al., 2001; Rose et al., 2006) .\nMore recent findings suggest that measures of fornix microstructure may be useful in detecting early/preclinical AD stages (Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015) . First, there is evidence of altered WM microstructure in the fornix in cognitively normal older adults at high AD-risk compared to their low risk peers (Gold et al., 2010 Nierenberg et al., 2005; Persson et al., 2006; Ringman et al., 2007) . Second, poorer WM microstructure in the fornix is associated with more AD pathology (as reflected by in vivo measures) in cognitively normal older adults (Gold et al., 2014; Molinuevo et al., 2014) .\nThe increasing interest in understanding age-and disease-related alterations in fornix microstructure calls for a standardized template to allow for direct comparison of results across studies. An important feature of a template intended for comparisons between groups with morphological differences is that it be representative of the 'average' anatomy of these groups. At present, most fornix templates were developed solely on younger adult samples (Lawes et al., 2008; Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2011; Wassermann et al., 2010) . Limitations associated with the use of younger-only templates in studies of aging are well known and have motivated calls for the use of merged younger-older or study-specific reference data which can improve registration, better control for volumetric differences and thus improve measurement accuracy (Ashburner and Friston, 2000; Good et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2001) .\nAt present, DTI studies of aging focusing on specific tracts such as the fornix can use custom regions of interest (ROIs, e.g. Ringman et al., 2007; Gold et al., 2014) , computationally intensive labeling algorithms (Jin et al., 2014 (Jin et al., , 2015 , or voxel-wise analyses (Gold et al., 2010; Lebel et al., 2012; Salat et al., 2005) . While valuable, these methods are not relevant to the goal of creating a standardized template that can be used across studies for the purpose of comparison of results. Currently, the most widely used fornix template is that developed as part of the ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas (Mori et al., 2008) . The ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas was created by hand segmentation of an average DTI map from 81 adults ranging from young to middleaged (range 18-59 years old, Mean = 39 years old). Though highly useful, the ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels templates include only small discontinuous sections of the fornix and include non-fornix fibers from the stria terminalis.\nHere we sought to develop a single, continuous DTI template of the fornix appropriate for future studies seeking to characterize WM microstructure alterations associated with aging and preclinical AD. Four experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, a merged younger-older adult template of the fornix was developed. Probabilistic tractography was used as the fornix follows a complex, spiral trajectory that lacks clear anatomical boundaries in most sections. In Experiment 2, the new template was validated against manual tracings of the fornix body. In Experiment 3, the merged younger-older fornix template was qualitatively and quantitatively compared to age-specific fornix templates in a new participant cohort. In Experiment 4, potential associations between fractional anisotropy (FA) in the new merged fornix template and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of AD pathology were explored."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General methods", "text": "Methods common to all studies are reported first, followed by a description of experiment-specific procedures."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A total of 221 adults between the ages of 18-92 years old participated.

Exclusion criteria were a major head injury, stroke, a neurological or psychiatric disorder, high blood pressure, diabetes, claustrophobia, pacemakers, the use of psychotropic drugs, or presence of metal fragments and/or metallic implants contraindicated for MRI. All participants were recruited as part of multiple fMRI studies that had inclusion criteria that individuals have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and not be color-blind.\nThree distinct participant samples were involved in the present study. Data from sample 1 (55 younger adults aged 25-40 years old, 65 older adults aged 57-83 years old) was used for template generation and anatomic validation (Experiments 1 and 2). Data from sample 2 (29 younger adults aged 18-34 years old, 30 older adults aged 61-77 years old) was used for comparison of the merged and age-specific templates in a new cohort (Experiment 3). Data from sample 3 (42 older adults aged 65-92 years old) was used for assessing relationships between the merged and age-specific templates with CSF markers of AD pathology (Experiment 4). Final characteristics of each sample are provided in the experiment-specific sections below.\nDTI data from 120 participants (sample 1) were initially screened for use in the creation of a fornix template. Inclusion criteria were the availability of: (1) DTI and T1-weighted images collected on the same scanner and head coil, using the same MRI sequence, and (2) cognitive test results (for the purpose of between-group matching). Some of the participants included in the present DTI experiment also took part in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments requiring decisions about colored stimuli, the results of which have been reported elsewhere (Hakun et al., 2015a (Hakun et al., , 2015b Zhu et al., 2015) .\nFrom the original pool of 120 participants, 10 were excluded for motion or other artifacts and 15 participants were excluded for insufficient coverage of the fornix (i.e. data did not include the entire hippocampal seed mask used in tractography).

The data for this experiment originated from a separate experiment conducted by one of this study's co-authors (NFJ).\nParticipants (sample 3) were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Center in the University of Kentucky's Sanders-Brown Center on Aging (SBCoA). Participants at the SBCoA undergo annual cognitive and clinical assessments, with cognitive normality determined via expert clinical diagnosis. The details concerning this participant cohort have been described extensively elsewhere . Sample 3 consisted of a total of 42 participants who underwent imaging and had available CSF data.

Briefly, non-linear voxel-wise registration was used to transform FA images into MNI space, where they were averaged to generate a mean FA image. The mean FA image was subsequently used to create a common white matter (WM) tract skeleton. The skeleton was thresholded at FA N 0.2 in order to minimize partial volume effects after warping across all participants.

The differences were driven by low sensitivity of the older-only template in younger adults (sensitivity = 79.2% \u00b1 3.8) and low specificity of the younger-only template in older adults (specificity = 84% \u00b1 4.6).\nA repeated-measures ANOVA with FA as the dependent variable ( Fig. 4e) found significant main effects of group (F 1,57 = 59.75, p b 0.001) and template (F 2,114 = 8.62, p b 0.001), as well as a significant group \u00d7 template interaction (F 2,114 = 63.19, p b 0.001). Planned comparisons indicated higher FA values in younger than older adults in the merged (t = 7.72, df = 57, p b 0.001), younger-only (t = 8.28, df = 57, p b 0.001), and older-only (t = 6.91, df = 57, p b 0.001) templates. Further, FA values in the younger-only template were higher than those in the merged template (t = 5.39, df = 28, p b 0.001) and older-only template (t = 8.03, df = 28, p b 0.001) in younger adults, but were lower than those in the merged template (t = \u2212 5.62, df = 29, p b 0.001) and older-only template (t = \u22123.77, df = 29, p b 0.001) in older adults. FA values in the merged template were significantly higher than those in the older-only template in younger adults (t = 9.59, df = 28, p b 0.001), and there was a trend toward higher FA values in the older-only template than the merged template in older adults (t = \u22121.87, df = 29, p = 0.07)."}, {"section_title": "Relationships between fornix templates and CSF markers", "text": "FA in the merged younger-older template was positively associated with A\u03b2 42 (r = 0.43, df = 30, p = 0.015) and negatively associated with the t-tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio (r = \u22120.46, df = 30, p = 0.008) after controlling for age and sex ( Fig. 5a-b) . No other CSF markers correlated with FA in the merged younger-older fornix template (p N 0.15).

None of the other relationships between FA in the older-only or younger-only templates and CSF markers approached significance (all p's N 0.18).

There were no significant voxels in which higher FA was associated with greater pathology (either lower A\u03b2 42 or higher t-tau/ A\u03b2 42 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "A merged younger-older adult DTI template of the fornix was developed and shown to accommodate anatomical variability associated with human aging. The new template provides continuous coverage of the fornix from the hippocampal formation to the subcallosal region and to hypothalamus. The merged template showed identical spatial coverage of the fornix body in younger and older age groups and outperformed age-specific templates in measures of sensitivity and specificity computed on DTI data of an independent participant cohort. Relevance to preclinical AD was shown via associations of lower FA in the merged fornix template with higher AD pathology (based on CSF measures of A\u03b2 42 and the t-tau/A\u03b2 42 ratio) in cognitively normal older adults. Our new template is an appropriate measure for future studies seeking to characterize microstructural properties of the fornix associated with aging, preclinical AD and cognitive/brain reserve.\nThe coverage of our new fornix template and the ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels templates are shown in Fig. 2 . The new template encompasses WM regions captured by the ICBM-DTI-81 template, other than the stria terminalis (which is a developmentally related tract but not part of the fornix). In addition, the new fornix template captures additional sections of the body, crus/fimbria and columns not covered by the ICBM-DTI-81 fornix templates. More subtle differences between templates can also be seen. For example, the crus/fimbria portion of the new template extends slightly more ventrally than the ICBM-DTI-81 crus/stria terminalis template. This may be due in part to our use of tractography. Inclusion of the ventral portion of the crus/fimbria at the subicular region would be challenging with visual tracing as this region lacks the clear anatomical boundary present at other regions of hippocampal formation (the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle). However, subtle differences in coverage should not be strongly interpreted as they may relate to non-linear registration of the templates to FMRIB58_FA standard space employed here. The ICBM-DTI-81 whitematter labels templates were created via linear registration to the ICBM-152 anatomical template and thus may not register optimally to the FMRIB58_FA template employed by TBSS.\nAnatomical validity of the merged template was demonstrated via comparison with manual tracing of the fornix body. Importantly, the merged template was found to provide identical coverage of the fornix body in younger and older adults (86% in each group), validating it as an appropriate measure of age-related WM microstructure comparisons. The deviation from 100% coverage in the new template relates mainly to exclusion of the hippocampal commissure. Fibers of the hippocampal commissure connecting the left and right hippocampal formations are oriented perpendicularly to adjacent fibers of the fornix body, and are necessarily excluded from probabilistic tractography approaches due to curvature threshold violation (Behrens et al., 2003 (Behrens et al., , 2007 . Investigators with a special interest in this portion of the fornix may consider manual tracing of the hippocampal commissure in conjunction with the use of the merged fornix template.\nDifferences between the age-specific templates and the merged template were explored in Experiment 3. As can be seen in Fig. 4 , the older-only template is smaller than the younger-only template. The smaller size of the older-only template is likely the result of multiple age-related changes including axonal loss/rarefaction, demyelination and atrophy (Roher et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2001) . The size difference between the group-specific templates is most apparent in the region of the columns, but also evident in the body. By incorporating the average Fig. 3 . Anatomic validation results. A-B: Qualitative results. The younger-older template (red) and the manually-traced (MT) fornix (yellow with black outline). Opaque yellow within the black outline indicates overlap with the merged younger-older template, while brighter yellow within the black outline are unique to the MT fornix body. A: Visual comparison reveals extensive overlap between the merged younger-older template and the MT fornix body, overlaid on the MNI152 T1 1 mm brain for anatomic reference. B: Caudo-dorsal view of the merged younger-older template and MT fornix body reveals that the main area unique to the MT fornix is in the dorsomedial section (bright yellow), which primarily consists of hippocampal commissural fibers running perpendicular to the fornix body/crus. The more lateral and rostral aspect of the fornix body (opaque yellow) overlap with the merged fornix template. C: Quantitative results. An independent samples t-test revealed that the merged younger-older template provides identical coverage in younger and older adults (p = 0.89). Error bars are \u00b11 S.E.M. n.s.: p N 0.05.\nfeatures of younger and older adults, the merged template is intended to reduce biases that can occur in studies making age group comparisons that use age-specific (typically younger-only) templates, which disproportionally alters data of only one group (typically older adults) during registration.\nThe reduction in measurement bias of the merged fornix template was quantified via between-template comparison of d\u2032 measures computed on DTI data from an independent participant cohort. Results indicated that the merged template had superior d\u2032 than both age-specific templates, with higher specificity than the younger template and higher sensitivity than the older-only template. Overall, the younger-only template was found to be the most biased measure, showing the largest age-group difference in d\u2032. The older-only template was slightly less biased than the younger-only template, although it did show a trend-level effect of higher d\u2032 in younger compared to older adults. In addition, the older-only template had lower sensitivity than either of the other templates, consistent with its reduced coverage of the body and columns sections of the fornix.\nIn contrast to the age-specific templates, the merged template showed no differences in d\u2032 between younger and older adult groups, validating it as an unbiased measure for age group comparisons. A reduction in bias associated with use of the merged fornix template compared to age-specific templates was also seen via FA estimates from DTI data of the independent participant cohort. Once again, the youngeronly template was the most biased measure, returning FA values that were higher than those of the other two templates for younger adults and lower than those of the other two templates for older adults. The older-only template was slightly less biased, but still returned FA values significantly lower than the merged template in younger adults. The merged template returned FA estimates intermediate to those of the age-specific templates, reducing the systematic bias of age-specific templates. These results are consistent with previous reports detailing the benefits of merged templates when making age-group comparisons (Ashburner and Friston, 2000; Good et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2006) .\nIn Experiment 4, clinical utility of the merged template was explored by testing potential associations with measures of AD pathology in a new cohort of cognitively normal older adults. Results indicated that measures of AD pathology (lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 42 and higher levels of t-tau/A\u03b2 42 ) were associated with lower FA in the merged fornix template. In contrast, CSF markers were not correlated with FA in either of the two age-specific templates. Our findings linking A\u03b2 amyloid pathology with poorer fornix WM microstructure are consistent with several recent results (Gold et al., 2014; Molinuevo et al., 2014) , and serve to further link lower FA in the fornix with higher CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 ratios. In addition, subsequent voxelwise results indicated that AD pathological markers were associated with lower WM FA in widespread portions of the fornix body, as well as in portions of the crus and columns-sections of the fornix that are uniquely captured by the merged younger-older template. Inclusion of crus/columns sections in templates of the fornix are thus likely to be of clinical relevance for biomarker studies. It should be noted that the columns of our fornix template appear as a unified bundle ( Fig. 2; panel A) , as they predominantly reflect postcommissural paths (panel D). However, inclusion of small portions of precommissural paths reaching caudal septal region are also evident when our template is overlaid on coronal slices (Fig. 2; panel E) . The majority of the precommissural fornix adopts a steep rostral curvature. Reconstruction of the more rostral precommissural fornix using a single hippocampal seed approach adopted here would require a very lenient tractography curvature threshold (which would risk likely inclusion of non-fornix fibers). Though different functions of the post-and pre-commissural fornices have not been firmly established, they remain possible given known anatomic connections and physiological differences. Whereas both precommissural and postcommissural portions of the columns carry glutamatergic efferent projections from pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and subiculum, the precommissural fornix also carries cholinergic and GABA-ergic afferents to the hippocampal formation from medial septal nuclei (Meibach and Siegel, 1977; Aggleton and Brown, 1999) .\nThe current study has limitations. Although probabilistic tractography was successful in reconstructing the majority of the fornix, the technique necessarily omits anatomically-related crossing fibers. Thus, the new younger-older adult template does not include the commissure of the fornix, which connects the left and right hippocampal formations. Additionally, the new template did not include middle-aged adults (i.e. in the 40-60 age range). The lack of difference between anatomic coverage between younger and older adults, however, would indicate that the absence of individuals in this age range may have had negligible effects on our results. Finally, longitudinal studies will be necessary to better assess potentially directional relationships between accumulating AD pathology and alterations in fornix WM microstructure.\nIn summary, we developed and validated a standardized DTI template of the fornix for use in studies of aging and preclinical AD. The new fornix template is simple to use within the TBSS pipeline and registers accurately to both younger and older participant cohorts, which allows for standardized, reproducible measurement of fornix microstructure across age groups. We plan to make our template freely available to other investigators. Future longitudinal work using the youngerolder template developed here should provide greater understanding about the timing, extent and specific location of white matter microstructural declines in the fornix associated with AD pathological processes.
