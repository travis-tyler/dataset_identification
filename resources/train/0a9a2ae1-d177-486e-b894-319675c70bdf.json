The five regions selected differences in the KLEFMA inputs either to reduce for analysis were defined above. The data acquired input quantity or to increase yield, independent of from the FEDS surveys were used to construct a total changes in relative prices (Griliches, fn 11, p. 334) .\nof 45 representative enterprise budgets (3 years x 5 These differences in turn are associated with technoregions x 3 size categories), which were used in the logical progress, regional resource endowment or analysis.

Therefore, in this case, the standard increase in input use, against which the actual change in input use was compared, was 101 percent. The standard of comparison was found by taking the 6th root of the yield ratio and multiplying by 100. The 6th root came from the six KLEFMA input categories that had been multiplied together to determine the input index.\nwere grouped into one of the six input categories of three years studied.

The key assumption was that all tractors and machinery were fully utilized. Care was taken to make sure that harvesting machinery was fully utilized for a given enterprise size.\n10 Weights used in calculation of weighted averages by size were developed from U.S. Census of Agriculture data. 11 Since the sampling objective of the two FEDS surveys was to provide an equal probability of inclusion for any specific acre of cotton in the sample area, larger farms were sampled at a higher rate than smaller ones. Thus, after 1974, the enterprise data presented in Table 2 came from a sampling frame that was skewed in favor of the larger cotton enterprises in the production region surveyed. duction regions in 1982.
