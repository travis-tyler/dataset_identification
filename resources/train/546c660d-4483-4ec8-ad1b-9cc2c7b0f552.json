[{"section_title": "1.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The World Ocean Atlas (WOA) compiled by Levitus (1982) provides a climatological description of the temperature and salinity fields over the global ocean. The later version of WOA (Levitus et al., 1994) included more data during recent years. Both WOA'82 and WOA'94 were computed on a l o x 1\" horizontal grid at 33 isobaric surfaces, and used a 2-dimensional objective analysis method for the horizontal interpolation and smoothing along isobaric surfaces with an influence radius of 557 km. The gridded 1' WOA has been widely used in the ocean modeling community as initial and boundary conditions as well as a verification data set for model simulations. In parallel to the development of WOA at isobaric surfaces, Lozier et al. (1995) recently compiled a hydrographic database (i.e., Hydrobase) over the North Atlantic Ocean at constant potential density (or isopycnal) surfaces. The advantage of averaging property fields on isopycnal surfaces is to preserve the temperature-salinity structures associated with a particular water mass. Hydrobase was computed on a l0x1\" horizontal grid and used an influence radius of 100 km, much smaller than the 557 km used by WOA'82 and WOA'94. A comparison between Hydrobase and the 1' WOA showed striking differences in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream (GS) and the North Atlantic Current: the fields in the 1' WOA appeared extremely smooth and many frontal features were broadened (Lozier et al., 1994). Furthermore, the isobaric averaging used in WOA created 'lanomalous anomalies\" in temperature and salinity fields on certain isopycnal surfaces because the averaging process mixed surrounding waters with apparently different temperature-salinity characteristics (Lozier et al., 1994). However, the Levitus Atlas, with its global coverage, has the obvious advantage for model initializations and verifications, while the Hydrobase climatology is only available over the North Atlantic Ocean."}, {"section_title": "P", "text": "Recently, the WOA'94 was gridded with a finer resolution of 1/4\" and a smaller influence radius of 134 km (Boyer and Levitus, 1998). Both the 1' and 1/4\" WOA used the same data source (Levitus et al., 1994). The increased horizontal resolution and reduced spatial smoothing in the 1/4\" WOA should result in improvements over the 1\" WOA and reduce discrepancies with Hydrobase climatology. The objective of this Ietter is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the 1\" and 114\" WOA against Hydrobase. In what aspect is the 1/4\" WOA significantly better than the 1\" WOA? To what extent can the 1/4\" WOA describe the sharp frontal features associated with the western boundary current and the mid-depth recirculation gyre? What are the remaining problems associated with the 1/4' WOA? In order to address these questions, we project the temperature and salinity fields onto two selected isopycnal surfaces. A three-way comparison is made among the 1' and 1/4\" WOA and Hydrobase. Finally, the geostrophic current at 100 m as diagnosed from the 1\" and 114\" WOA temperature and salinity fields are presented."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Property Fields on Isopycnal Surfaces (ao = 26.50 and a2 = 36.95) The methodology used in the isopycnal analysis follows closely to that of Lozier et al. (1995): the property fields of temperature and salinity are projected onto constant potential density (0) surfaces. Comparisons are made at two isopycnal surfaces among the 1' and 1/4\" WOA and Hydrobase. Isopycnal surfaces of 00 = 26.50 and 0 2 = 36.95 are selected because they represent the near-surface and mid-depth circulation, respectively. The subscript for CT is the reference level, in db/l000. The salinity fields tend to display similar spatial pattern as the temperature fields, henceforth are not shown here. The most prominent feature on this surface as seen in Hydrobase (Fig. le, f) is the sharp gradients that extend eastward from Cape Hatteras and curve northward around the Tail of the Grand Banks. These gradients define the GS as well as the western and the northern boundaries of the subtropical gyre. Part of the subtropical gyre water circulates clockwise from north to south and returns westward to supply the Florida Current. Due to the coarse resolution and the heavy spatial smoothing in the 1' WOA ( Fig.la, b), the curvature of the GS is absent and the isobars intersect the coast near Cape Hatteras rather than skirt around it. The 1/4\" WOA ( Fig. IC, d) shows a substantial improvement over the 1' WOA and is in reasonably good agreement with Hydrobase (Fig. le, f) in depicting frontal features associated with the Florida Current, the GS and the North Atlantic Current. However, the effect of isobaric averaging is still recognizable in the 1/4' WOA with a broader GS on the pressure map ( Fig. IC) when compared with Hydrobase (Fig. le). In contrast to these sharp gradients associated with fronts, a large pool of homogeneous water can be found on this surface. This Eighteen Degree Water (Worthington, 1959) with uniform temperature (17.4-17.6'C) and salinity (36.4-36.5) is located west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Another pool of homogeneous, called the Madeira Mode Water (Siedler et al., 1987), with 18\u00b0C and 36.5, is also found near 25' N and 25'W. These two water masses are identifiable in all three hydrographic data sets. The temperature map of the 1/4' WOA shows several discontinuous pools of the Madeira Mode Water. Given the fact that the 1/4' WOA used the 1' WOA as the initial guess in the objective analysis, we suspect that the limited data coverage and the reduced spatial smoothing are responsible for the noise in the 1/4' WOA. Although the large-scale mid-depth recirculation gyre is recognizable in the 1' WOA, its spatial extent is much too broad and the associated pressure gradient is significantly weaker than that in Hydrobase. Small-scale features such as those four local recirculation cells are smoothed out in the 1' WOA ( Fig. 2a). The 114' WOA ( Fig. 2b) resolves most features associated with the mid-depth recirculation as seen in Fig. 2c and described in Lozier (1997). In particular, the four local recirculation cells, which are missing in the 1' WOA, are now resolved in the 1/4' WOA. The northward retroflection of the Labrador Sea Water is also realistically described. However, at mid-depth around 2000 m, the analyzed fields in the 1/4' WOA appear more noisy aqd wrinkled than those in Hydrobase, presumably resulting from a combination of isobaric averaging, poor data coverage and the initial guess fields from the 1' WOA."}, {"section_title": "Absolute Geostrophic Current Maps", "text": "In order to contrast the difference in the flow fields associated with the 1' and 1/4\" WOA, we diagnosed the absolute geostrophic current from the temperature and salinity. The method is based on the P-spiral method (Stommel and Schott, 1977) with modifications as described in Chu et al. (1998). The physical base of this method is the conservation of potential density and potential vorticity and there is no need to specify the reference level of no-motion (see Chu et al., 1998 for a detailed description of this method), Figure 3 shows the diagnosed current vector maps at 100 m for the 1' (a) and 1/4' (b) WOA, respectively. Clearly, those undesirable features in the 1'WOA associated with the isobaric averaging and a large influence radius are evident in the diagnosed current map (Fig. 3a). For example, there is a southward current north of the GS separation point. In contrast, the 1/4\" WOA shows a very tight and continuous western boundary current (Fig. 3b). The Caribbean Current and the Loop Current in the Gulf of r Mexico which are absent in the 1' WOA are now evident in the 1/4' WOA. The GS core speed derived from the 1/4' WOA is 57 cm s\", which is much larger than that of 17 cm sderived from the 1' WOA. It should be pointed out that the GS core speed derived from the 1/4' WOA is still significantly weaker than the observed speed, which is on the order of 100 cm s-'. Based on the absolute current fields, we computed the downstream volume transport associated with the GS. The GS path is defined by the 12'C isotherm intersecting 400 m isobath. The zonal and meridional velocities are projected onto the downstream and cross-stream velocities, which are then used for the volume transport calculation. Our computation shows that the GS transport derived from the 1/4' WOA is significantly larger, by almost 50%, than that from the 1' WOA."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "Our results show that one can significantly improve the 1' WOA by increasing the grid resolution and reducing the influence radius for spatial smoothing. The 1/4' WOA is significantly better than the 1' WOA in describing sharp frontal features associated with the western boundary current. It also provides a more accurate description of the middepth recirculation gyre. The four local recirculation cells, which are missing in the 1' WOA, are identifiable in the 114' WOA. The diagnosed current field from the 1/4' WOA shows a much more stronger and continuous western boundary current. The GS transport computed from the 1/4' WOA is almost 50% larger than that from the 1' WOA. Despite the improvement of the 1/4' WOA over the 1' WOA, the \"anomalous c anomalies\" as described in Lozier et al. (1994) and introduced by the isobaric averaging that mixes different water masses still exist in the 1/4' WOA. Another problem associated with the 1/4' WOA is the noise, which becomes more apparent in the deeper layers. This noise problem in the 1/4' WOA can be attributed to a combination of isobaric averaging, finer analysis grid, and the poor data coverage. During the course of our study, another hydrographic climatology over the global ocean has been released (Gouretski and Jancke, 1998). The horizontal resolution of this database is loxlo and an influence radius of 500 km is used for the objective analysis. The property fields are first analyzed on neutral surfaces and then gridded onto 43 pressure levels similar as WOA. The accuracy of this new data set in comparison with 1/4' WOA and Hydrobase remains to be determined. However, the results from the present study suggest that a 500 km spatial smoothing might broaden the sharp frontal features associated with the western boundary current and the mid-depth recirculation gyre, and further eliminate the mid-depth local recirculation cells. Recently, the World Ocean Database (WOD, Levitus et al., 1998) has been released and contains significantly more data than WOA'94. Ideally, one should produce a gridded product along isopycnal surfaces as Hydrobase (Lozier et al., 1995). Progress has been made to produce a Hydrobase climatology over the North Pacific Ocean (A.   Contour intervals are 50 m and 1' C for pressure and potential temperature, respectively.  "}]
