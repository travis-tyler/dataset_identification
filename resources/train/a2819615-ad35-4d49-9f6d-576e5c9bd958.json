Several states in the U.S. have recently started tightening divorce requirements, reversing the liberalizing trend in divorce laws that began around 1970. 1 The proponents of tightening the divorce regime often argue that making divorce easier has negative consequences for children. However, as pointed out by Gruber (2004) , this argument relies on three implicit suppositions. First, that easier divorce regulations cause an increase of divorce rates. Empirical work on this supposition has reached mixed conclusions: while Friedberger (1998) \u2026nds that there is an impact of unilateral divorce on divorce rates in the U.S., the evidence presented by Wolfers (2003) indicates that the increase in divorce rates is only transitional, disappearing after a decade. Second, that changes in divorce regulation only have an impact on families and children through their e\u00a4ect on the propensity to divorce. The third supposition that drives criticism of easier divorce regulations, on which this paper focuses, is that divorce has an adverse impact on children.\nThere is an enormous literature that \u2026nds that experiencing parental divorce is negatively related to a wide variety of children's outcomes such as educational attainment, fertility choices (specially non-marital birth during teenage years), future earnings, employment status and welfare recipiency among others (many of these studies are reviewed in Amato and Keith 1991, and Haveman and Wolfe 1995) . However, this large literature can hardly be interpreted causally because divorce is associated with socioeconomic characteristics that also determine children's attainments. For instance, there is a negative relationship between divorce and men's earning ability (Sander 1986 ). Moreover, even if socioeconomic information is available, the question of causality is further complicated because it is unlikely that these observable variables can fully capture the unobservable di\u00a4erences that may exist between families that choose to divorce and intact families; for example, it may be the con \u2021ict associated with divorce, rather than divorce per se, what leads to children's inferior outcomes. Therefore, it is easy to overstate the detrimental impact of divorce.\n1 Unilateral divorce, which requires the willingness of only one spouse to divorce, rather than the consent of both spouses, was rare before the late 1960s but was in place in most states by the mid-1970s.\nSeveral studies have stressed the di\u00a2 culties associated with the endogeneity of parental divorce. Manski et al. (1992) present and interpret alternative estimates of the e\u00a4ect of family structure on high school graduation, obtained under di\u00a4ering assumptions about the process generating family structure and high school outcomes. Sandefur and Wells (1997) and Bjorklund et al. (2004) use sibling data to control for unmeasured characteristics of families that are common to siblings. Corak (2001) assumes that parental loss by death is exogenous and argues that children with a bereaved background o\u00a4er a benchmark to assess the endogeneity of parental loss through divorce, considering that any di\u00a4erence between the outcomes of individuals from bereaved and divorced backgrounds represents the consequences of an endogeneity bias. In a related paper, Lang and Zagorsky (2001) also consider parental death as an exogenous source of parental absence. Gruber (2004) states that \"what is required to appropriately identify the impact of divorce is an exogenous instrument that causes some families to divorce and others not, based on a factor independent of the determinants of their children's outcomes\" (p. 806). However, a valid instrument is hard to \u2026nd in this context and not even changes in divorce laws could be considered as such if, as suggested by Stevenson and Wolfers (2003) , changes in divorce regimes may directly a\u00a4ect the nature of intrafamily bargaining, with potential implications for children's outcomes.\nIn this paper we revisit the question of whether parental divorce leads to children's worse outcomes using a nationally representative sample of youths from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1998 (NELS: 1988) . We expand the existing empirical literature in two important ways. First, we examine the relationship between parental divorce and student's performance on standardized tests. Test scores are often used to evaluate the performance of students, teachers and schools (Kane and Staiger 2002) and many studies have shown that scores on cognitive tests taken during adolescent years are important determinants of future wages and employment probabilities (Murname et al. 1995; Neal and Johnson 1996; Cawley et al. 1997; Currie and Thomas 2001; Zax and Rees 2002) . There is also evidence that the greater dispersion of cognitive test scores in the United States plays a role in explaining the fact that wage inequality is higher in the U.S. than in Europe (Blau and Kahn 2004) . Moreover, psychologists (e.g. Harris, 1983) have shown that children's scores in cognitive and developmental tests are strong predictors of later outcomes. This voluminous literature suggests that test scores are important variables to examine.\nSecond, our empirical approach, which is di\u00a4erent from methods used in the lit-erature, allows for the possibility that parental divorce is correlated with unobserved family characteristics that may in \u2021uence children's outcomes. The longitudinal nature of the NELS allows us to account for the potential endogeneity of parental divorce by using double and triple di\u00a4erences models that rely on observing the outcomes of children from intact and divorced backgrounds before and after the divorce takes place.\nOur main \u2026nding is that parental divorce does not adversely a\u00a4ect teenagers'cognitive skills. Teenagers from divorced families appear to perform worse than their counterparts from intact families before the divorce actually takes place. Our results also suggest that cross-section estimates actually overstate the detrimental e\u00a4ect of parental divorce.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out our empirical strategy for identifying the impact of parental divorce on adolescents'cognitive ability. The data set used is described in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results and Section 5 o\u00a4ers some concluding comments."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Model", "text": "Let Y (i; t) be the outcome of interest for teenager i at time t. As a starting point, let us assume that we observe the population of youths in two periods, t = 1 and t = 2. Between these two periods, some fraction of the population experiences parental divorce. We denote D(i; t) = 1 if teenager i has experienced parental divorce between period 1 and period 2 and D(i; t) = 0 if teenager i's parents are still married in period 2. Since teenagers are only exposed to parental divorce after period 1, D(i; 1) = 0 for all i by de\u2026nition and youth with D(i; 2) = 1 are called treated while those with D(i; 2) = 0 are called controls. The following formulation of the di\u00a4erence-indi\u00a4erences (DID) framework is based on that in Ashenfelter and Card (1985) and Abadie (2005) . Suppose that Y (i; t) follows a components-of-variance scheme:\nwhere (t) is a time-speci\u2026c component, is the impact of parental divorce and (i; t)\nis a serially uncorrelated transitory component. Finally, (i) is an individual-speci\u2026c component that represents unobserved pre-disruption characteristics such as the con\u2021ict between the parents or the stress and friction associated with an unhappy family life. If D(i; t) is independent of (i) and (i; t), then the di\u00a4erence in test scores between treated and controls in t = 2 will estimate the e\u00a4ect of parental divorce .\nHowever, D(i; t) is very likely to be correlated with (i).\nGiven the longitudinal nature of the NELS:1988, which we describe in detail in the next section, both pre-divorce and post-divorce data are actually available. Hence, one could control for (i) by comparing the scores of teenagers from divorced families with the scores of these same teenagers before the divorce occurs. However, this comparison might be contaminated by temporal variation in test scores that is not due to parental divorce. Since not all the teenagers in the population experience parental divorce, teenagers from intact families can be used to identify temporal variation in the outcome that is not due to divorce. This is the main idea behind the DID estimator.\nDi\u00a4erencing (1) with respect to t we obtain:\nwhere = (2) (1). The parameters of interest are identi\u2026ed under the condition P (D(i; 2) = 1j (i; t)) = P (D(i; 2) = 1) for t = 1; 2. Under this restriction, the least square estimator of is the sample counterpart of the following equation:\nNote that P (D(i; 2) = 1j (i; t)) = P (D(i; 2) = 1) for t = 1; 2 implies that ( (i; 2) (i; 1)) is mean independent of D(i; 2) and therefore that, in absence of parental divorce, the average test scores for the treated would have experienced the same variation as the average test scores for the controls. This assumption may be implausible if treated and controls are unbalanced in covariates that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable. Hence, we introduce covariates linearly in equation (2):\nwhere = (2) (1) and X(i) is a vector of observed characteristics that are assumed uncorrelated with (i; t). Note that the model is now identi\u2026ed under the conditional restriction P (D(i; 2) = 1jX(i); (i; t)) = P (D(i; 2) = 1jX(i)) for t = 1; 2.\nIn other words, if non-parallel test score dynamics for the treated and the controls 2 Heckman et. al. (1997) and Abadie (2005) propose DID estimators based on conditional identi\u2026cation restrictions which treat covariates non parametrically.\ncan be explained by including covariates, then model 3 is identi\u2026ed. Accordingly, the plausibility of this condition relies on the inclusion of a rich set of covariates. However, if the dynamics of test scores depend on unobservables, or, in other words, if the unobserved variation associated with divorce is not \u2026xed over time, identi\u2026cation breaks down. 3 One way to assess the plausibility of the identifying condition is to use data on more than one pre-divorce period (that is, use data for t = 0 as well) to apply the DID estimator to at least two pre-divorce periods and test that is equal to zero:\nwhere = (1) (0) and = (1) (0): Alternatively to the DID model and in order to relax its identifying condition, we also apply a di\u00a4erence-in-di\u00a4erence-in-di\u00a4erences (DIDID) estimator to the three data periods. The DIDID model, which is obtained by substracting equation 4 from equation 3, is identi\u2026ed under the more general condition that unobserved factors jointly in \u2021uencing cognitive development and the probability of divorce grow at a constant rate."}, {"section_title": "3 Data", "text": "The individual data used in this paper are from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), a continuing study sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. A nationally representative sample of 24,599 8-th graders were \u2026rst surveyed in 1988. Many of these same students were re-surveyed through four follow-ups in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 2000. 5 The \u2026rst follow-up includes responses from approximately 17,500 of the students from the \u2026rst wave while the second follow-up includes approximately 16,500 students from the original cohort.\nOn the questionnaires, students reported on a range of topics including school, work and home experiences. Depending on the year, data were also collected from parents, schools and teachers. In addition, for the three in-school waves of data collection (1988, 1990 and 1992) , cognitive tests were administered. The administration of cognitive tests in multiple waves allows us to analyse the impact of changes in teenagers'lives on their performance on standardized tests.\nThe NELS:88 cognitive test battery consists of multiple choice tests in four subject areas: reading comprehension, mathematics, science and history/citizenship/geography.\nIn the base year, all students received the same set of tests. In order to avoid \"ceiling\"\nand \" \u2021oor\"e\u00a4ects, that is, many students getting either all items correct or incorrect, the reading and mathematics tests in the \u2026rst and second follow-ups were tailored to students' ability levels in the previous wave. Item Response Theory was used to develop scores that are on the same scale and thus can be compared to measure gains in achievement over time. The maximum possible scores that a teenager could achieve are 81 in mathematics, 38 in science, 47 in history and 54 in reading.\nOur identi\u2026cation strategy, described in the previous section, requires observing teenagers'outcomes before and after parental divorce. 6 Therefore, we depart from a sample of approximately 16,500 teenagers who participated in the \u2026rst three waves of the data. Furthermore, our estimation strategy requires having information on test scores in at least two points in time and being able to code family transitions during high school. A unique feature of the NELS:88 data is that youth who leave high school prior to graduation continue to be interviewed throughout the longitudinal study. It is therefore possible to include in our analyses dropouts who are not represented in other national school-based surveys. Moreover, students who had transferred out of the school from which they had initially been selected were subsampled and reinterviewed.\nIt is also worth noting that all statistics presented in this paper are weighted using NELS:88 weights, which attempt to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the e\u00a4ects of nonresponse. 6 Note that our double and triple di\u00a4erences models do not allow us to examine adult labour market and demographic outcomes, since they are only observed after parental divorce. 7 Weights are calculated in two main steps. In the \u2026rst step, unadjusted weights are calculated as the inverse of the probabilities of selection, taking into account all stages of the sample selection process. In the second step, these initial weights are adjusted to compensate for nonresponse; such nonresponse adjustments are typically carried out separately within multiple weighting cells. The nonresponse adjustment factor was intended to adjust for the fact that some of the sampled students\nIn order to code family transitions, we have used information from the parent questionnaires and we have contrasted it with the information provided by students.\nWe have classi\u2026ed families into two broad categories in 1988: intact families (with both biological parents) and non-intact families (stepfamilies and single parent families).\nFor the majority of our analyses, which require observing teenagers before and after parental divorce, we have departed from the sample of students from intact families in 1988 and then identi\u2026ed those who experience parental divorce during high school and those whose families remain intact. 8 In order to focus on the impact of parental divorce, we exclude teenagers who experience parental death during high school. Regarding multiple transitions, we have counted families that undergo divorce and subsequently remarry while their child is in high school as divorced families, but our results are unchanged when eliminating these families.\nFigure 1 displays mean test scores for teenagers from persistently intact families and for teenagers whose parents divorce before 1988, between 1988 and 1990 and between 1990 and 1992 . A number of features are worth noting. First, cognitive test scores rise with age and schooling. This is consistent with the \u2026ndings of Cawley et al. (1997) . Second, teenagers with a divorced background perform worse than their counterparts from intact families. Finally, at least part of this gap is visible before the divorce actually takes place. Accordingly, it is possible that the endogeneity of parental divorce is generating this di\u00a4erence. For example, con \u2021ict between parents may lead to both divorce and teenagers'worse outcomes. Another possibility is that parents who are less committed to their families may be more likely to divorce and may also invest less time in their children.\nAlternatively, it is possible that the di\u00a4erence in test scores is due to background di\u00a4erences between teenagers from divorced and intact families. The NELS:88 questionnaires also provide additional information on family and school characteristics. In line with the idea that children of divorce come from more disadvantaged backgrounds than children from intact families, Table 1 we also use the student's 12th-grade percentile rank based on her 12th-grade score in all the tests as dependent variables. The results of these analyses, shown in column 2, suggest that experiencing parental divorce reduces test score ranks in mathematics, science, history and reading by 12, 11, 11 and 7 percentile points, respectively.\nPart of the estimated di\u00a4erence in test scores between teenagers from divorced and intact families may be due to the observed background di\u00a4erences highlighted in Section 3. Hence, we now explore whether these \u2026ndings are robust to the inclusion of controls.\nFirst, consider the coe\u00a2 cients on some of the explanatory variables, reported in Table 3 . There are statistically signi\u2026cant and negative impacts on the mathematics score from being Black or Hispanic, working more than 21 hours per week and attending a public school. On the other hand, having highly educated parents, coming from from those of the full sample.\nfamilies with high socioeconomic status, having a working mother, being male and not living in the South appear to increase the mathematics score."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Regarding the impact of parental divorce, conditional estimates for all four examinations are also reported in Table 2 (columns 3 and 4, row 1 of each panel). It is found that parental divorce is associated with a decrease of approximately 4-5 points in the mathematics, science and history percentile ranks, while the reading rank is only reduced by approximately 2 percentile points and it is not statistically signi\u2026cantly. The results suggest that conditional coe\u00a2 cient estimates are substantially smaller in absolute value than the unconditional estimates displayed in columns 1 and 2. However, they are still negative and (with the exception of the reading examination) statistically signi\u2026cant at standard levels and the associated percentage e\u00a4ects range between 5%\n(mathematics score) and 2% (reading score)."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "The estimated negative e\u00a4ects so far obtained are generally in line with previous studies on the implications of parental divorce. However, they may overstate the detrimental impact of divorce if they measure both the e\u00a4ect of parental divorce and the e\u00a4ect of unobserved family characteristics, (i), associated with divorce. In fact, when equation (1) is estimated using 1990 (10th-grade grade) test scores information ( Table   2 , row 2 of each panel), it is found that, prior to parental divorce, teenagers whose parents will divorce between 1990 and 1992 perform worse than their counterparts from intact families. This is consistent with the results of Piketty (2003) , which reveal that pre-separation children do as bad at school as single-parent children in France.\nAs a next step in our analysis we use a DID estimator, which is obtained by comparing the change in test scores for teenagers who are exposed to parental divorce with the change in test scores for teenagers from intact families. DID estimates without 13 We obtain qualitatively very similar results for the other three examinations, with the notable exception of the statistically signi\u2026cant and negative impact on the reading score from being male. 14 There are alternative ways of assessing the magnitude of the e\u00a4ects. We have also computed the percentage variation of test scores due to parental divorce as\n100, where N is the total number of observations and\u0176 1i and\u0176 0i denote the predicted value of test scores for individual i when experiencing parental divorce and when coming from an intact family, respectively. Another way to compute percentage e\u00a4ects that we have considered is to use the ratio between the estimated OLS coe\u00a4cients and the corresponding maximum score values for each examination. These results, not reported, lead to essentially the same conclusions.\nand with covariates (equations (2) and (3), respectively) are displayed in row 3 of each panel of As discussed in Section 2, the DID model used so far assumes that in the absence of parental divorce, test scores of teenagers from intact and divorced backgrounds would have followed parallel paths over time. We have applied the DID estimator to periods 1988 and 1990 in order to assess whether this assumption is plausible. While the results are not reported the evidence is suggestive that this assumption may not always apply, since the estimates of are negative and in some cases statistically signi\u2026cant at standard levels of testing. Therefore, we now use a DIDID model that identi\u2026es our parameter of interest under the more general condition that unobserved factors jointly in \u2021uencing test scores and the divorce decision grow at a constant rate.\nDIDID estimates with and without covariates are reported in Table 4 . Parental divorce appears to have a less detrimental impact on math and history scores than implied by the corresponding DID estimates presented in Table 2 . For the science and reading examinations, DIDID coe\u00a2 cient estimates are positive and bigger than the corresponding DID estimates displayed in Table 2 . However, all estimates are negligible and most of them are statistically insigni\u2026cant at the 10% level, supporting the previous conclusion that parental divorce does not negatively a\u00a4ect teenagers' cognitive development. 15 . This \u2026nding is in line with Corak (2001) , who uses Canadian administrative data and concludes that, with respect to labor market outcomes such as 15 The NELS:88 dataset does not contain information on parental marital status after 12th grade.\nearnings and use of social programs, the causal impact of divorce is relatively \"mild or insigni\u2026cant\"(p. 712). Along the same lines, Lang and Zagorsky (2001) use data from the NLSY and \u2026nd little evidence that a parent's presence during childhood a\u00a4ects educational and labor market outcomes."}, {"section_title": "The Impact of Parental Divorce by Adolescent Characteristics", "text": "Although our analyses mainly focus on the average e\u00a4ect of parental divorce, it may be that it has little impact on most teenagers but a very important impact on certain groups. Hence, we also evaluate the impact of parental divorce for teenagers with speci\u2026ed characteristics in Table 5 .\nThe results in Table 5 reveal that the e\u00a4ect of parental divorce is very small for all the categorizations of the data examined. We \u2026nd that coe\u00a2 cient estimates are never statistically signi\u2026cant at standard levels and we cannot reject the hypothesis that the e\u00a4ects are equal for the mutually exclusive groups considered. For the sake of brevity, Table 5 only displays results for the mathematics score. However, an examination of the corresponding \u2026ndings for the science, history and reading scores indicated that they were remarkably similar. This suggests that the impact of parental divorce does not signi\u2026cantly di\u00a4er across groups of adolescents.\nTherefore, one may be concerned that we are underestimating the impact of parental divorce by including in our control group teenagers from families that will go through a divorce after the high school period. In order to address this issue, we have performed a simple simulation exercise: we have assumed that teenagers from intact families with low test scores are those more likely to experience parental divorce later in life and we have re-estimated our DIDID models by dropping from our sample those teenagers from intact families with test scores in the lower tail of the distribution. The results of this analyisis suggest that in order to \u2026nd a statistically signi\u2026cant e\u00a4ect of parental divorce one would need to eliminate at least 30% of the teenagers currently classi\u2026ed as belonging to intact families and even in this case the magnitude of the estimated e\u00a4ect would not be bigger than 2.3 percentile points."}, {"section_title": "Age at Time of Parental Divorce", "text": "We have so far analysed the e\u00a4ect of experiencing parental divorce for the population of teenagers whose parents divorced while they were between the 10-th and 12th-grade.\nHowever, the impact of parental divorce may be greater if the divorce occurs when children are younger. Moreover, to the extent that regulations that tighten the divorce regime do not avoid divorce but delay it by a few years, it is also interesting to explore the di\u00a4erences between children whose parents divorced while they were between the 10th-grade and 12th-grade grade with children whose parents divorced at earlier ages.\nGiven that cognitive tests were also administered in the 1988 wave of the NELS:88, some evidence on this issue can be provided by estimating the e\u00a4ect of experiencing parental divorce between 1988 and 1990 on the 1990 (10th-grade grade) test scores.\nThe results of this analysis are reported in Table 6 ."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "All DID coe\u00a2 cient estimates are now negative, including those corresponding to the reading and science examinations, which are positive in Table 2 .
