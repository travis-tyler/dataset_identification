ENSO is an important predictor for regional seasonal climate over East Asia. The relationships between ENSO and the East Asian climate are very complex and have recently been suggested to change on interdecadal time scales (Wu and Wang 2002; Zhou et al. 2007b; Xie et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2012) . It is well known that the interannual climate variation over East Asia is significantly related to the ENSO cycle (e.g., Huang and Wu 1989; Wang et al. 2000) . Huang and Wu (1989) suggested that summer rainfall anomalies in China are different during the developing and decaying phases of ENSO. Wu et al. (2003) further studied the El Ni\u00f1 o-related rainfall anomaly pattern over East Asia during the various phases of El Ni\u00f1 o. The ENSO-related positive rainfall anomalies migrate from southern China in the developing phase of ENSO, eastward in the mature phase of ENSO, and northeastward to eastern central China and southern Japan in boreal spring during the decaying phase of ENSO, in association with the changes of low-level atmospheric circulation in the western North Pacific. In addition, the negative rainfall relationships are seen in northern China in summer and fall of the ENSO onset year, which is associated with the anomalous barotropic cyclone displacing southwestward along the East Asian coast."}, {"section_title": "Recently, a different type of El Ni\u00f1 o called El Ni\u00f1 o", "text": "Modoki ) has been emphasized because its maximum sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are located in the tropical central Pacific instead of being in the tropical eastern Pacific as for canonical or conventional El Ni\u00f1 o. Modoki in Japanese means ''a similar but different thing.'' El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki is also referred to as Date Line El Ni\u00f1 o (Larkin and Harrison 2005) , central Pacific El Ni\u00f1 o (Yu and Kao 2007) , and warm pool El Ni\u00f1 o ). Its impacts on the tropical and midlatitude climate are distinct from these of the canonical El Ni\u00f1 o because the intensity and locations of their associated SST-induced heating are different (e.g., Larkin and Harrison 2005; Ashok et al. 2007; Weng et al. 2007 Weng et al. , 2009 Cai and Cowan 2009; Kim et al. 2011) .\nThe influences of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki during different El Ni\u00f1 o phases over East Asia have been documented and compared with these of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (Weng et al. , 2009 Ashok et al. 2007; Feng and Li 2011; Feng et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011) . Weng et al. (2007 Weng et al. ( , 2009 and Ashok et al. (2007) analyzed the impacts of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki in boreal summer and winter of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year. The composite and partial correlation analyses illustrated that El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki greatly influences the rainfall anomalies over the maritime regions, India, southern Japan, and eastern Australia in summer, while its influences on rainfall in China in summer are weak . During winter of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year, different atmospheric anomalous circulation patterns in the western North Pacific result in different rainfall impacts on southern East Asia for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki Weng et al. 2009 ). During fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that canonical El Ni\u00f1 o is associated with increased rainfall over southern China, but El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki corresponds to insignificant rainfall changes in southern China (see their Fig. 3 ). During spring of the El Ni\u00f1 o decaying year (the subsequent spring of the El Ni\u00f1 o mature year), Feng and Feng et al. (2011) The present paper mainly focuses on the relationships of El Ni\u00f1 o events with the southern China rainfall during fall. We find that because some El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events show positive rainfall anomalies in southern China and others display negative rainfall anomalies, the correlation in Fig. 1 shows an insignificant relation. Based on the opposite impacts on rainfall in southern China, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events can be divided into two groups: El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I and II, which also show different origins and patterns of SST anomalies, and different atmospheric circulations in the western North Pacific. The present paper also investigates physical mechanisms of rainfall relationships and examines the influences of various El Ni\u00f1 o events on the typhoon tracks in the western North Pacific.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the datasets and indices used in the study. Section 3 analyzes the relationships between the anomalous precipitation over southern China and El Ni\u00f1 o events and identifies two groups of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki based on the rainfall pattern in southern China. Section 4 shows different SST anomaly spatial patterns and evolution of various El Ni\u00f1 o events. Section 5 examines El Ni\u00f1 orelated atmospheric circulations in the western North Pacific and East Asia, and explains why various El Ni\u00f1 o events have different rainfall influences in southern China. Section 6 uses a simple atmospheric model to show atmospheric response to various El Ni\u00f1 o events. Section 7 investigates the influences of various El Ni\u00f1 o events on the typhoon tracks in the western North Pacific. Finally, section 8 provides a summary and discussion."}, {"section_title": "Datasets and numerical model a. Datasets", "text": "Several observational and reanalysis datasets are used in this study. The atmospheric reanalysis datasets include the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1996) and the newly developed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR) (Compo et al. 2011) . The NCEP-NCAR reanalysis has a spatial resolution of 2.58 3 2.58 and the 20CR reanalysis has a resolution of 2.08 3 2.08. We analyze both the The rainfall dataset is from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). The monthly rainfall data are gridded from the complete GPCC station database with more than 70 000 different rain gauge stations worldwide (Rudolf et al. 1994) . The gridded land precipitation is available in spatial resolutions of 0.58 3 0.58 and 1.08 3 1.08. Here we use the precipitation with the resolution of 1.08 3 1.08 from 1910 to 2010. The rainfall data are available from http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/ data/gridded/data.gpcc.html.

The tropical cyclone (TC) dataset from the website of the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) Project (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ oa/ibtracs/) is used in this study. Because of TC data availability and reliability in the western North Pacific (e.g., Song et al. 2010; , the TC dataset used in this study is from 1950 to 2010."}, {"section_title": "b. Numerical model", "text": "To examine the responses to tropical heating anomalies associated with various El Ni\u00f1 o events, we also use a simple atmospheric model developed by Lee et al. (2009) . This is a steady-state two-level (centered at 250 and 750 hPa) primitive equation model, linearized about a prescribed background mean state. The formulation is similar to that of the multilevel linear baroclinic model used by Hoskins and Simmons (1975) and others, but its governing equations are greatly simplified by employing Gill's (1980) simple thermodynamic equation. The simple model captures three fundamental dynamic processes: 1) a heating-induced baroclinic mode as described by the Matsuno-Gill model (Matsuno 1966; Gill 1980) ; 2) a barotropic Rossby wave source resulting from conversion of the heating-induced baroclinic mode into barotropic anomalies; and 3) teleconnections to high latitudes, as in the barotropic stationary wave model of Branstator (1983) . For more details about this model, see Lee et al. (2009 . 1911/12, 1918/19, 1925/26, 1930/31, 1951/52, 1957/58, 1965/66, 1972/73, 1976/77, 1982/83, 1986/87, and 1997/98 [see the recent ENSO review by Wang et al. (2013) ]. Kao and Yu (2009) and Yu and Kim (2010) obtain the CP El Ni\u00f1 o pattern by first removing the portion of the tropical Pacific SST anomalies that are regressed with the Nino1 1 2 SST index and then applying an empirical orthogonal function analysis to the residual SST anomalies. The regression with the Nino1 1 2 index is considered as an estimate of the influence of the eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1 o, which should be removed to better reveal the SST anomalies associated solely with the CP El Ni\u00f1 o. They identify the CP El Ni\u00f1 o events during the second half of the twentieth century, which agree with those identified by using other El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki indices Ren and Jin 2011 ). If we extend this classification back to the early twentieth century, we can identify 17 El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events : 1914/15, 1923/24, 1940/ 41, 1941/42, 1963/64, 1968/69, 1977/78, 1979/80, 1987/88, 1990/91, 1991/92, 1992/93, 1993/94, 1994/95, 2002/03, 2004/05, and 2009/10. We then plot the time series of the rainfall anomalies in southern China (248-308N, 1078-1208E) during fall [September to November (SON)] with the canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki years marked, as shown in Fig. 2 . Of these canonical El Ni\u00f1 o events, seven (1911/12, 1951/52, 1965/66, 1972/73/ 1976/77, 1982/83, and 1997/98) are associated with the rainfall anomalies larger than 10.5 standard deviation. The exception occurs during the 1920s and 1930s when the decadal forcing cancels the effect of El Ni\u00f1 o (Chan and Zhou 2005) , resulting in the smaller rainfall anomalies varying between 60.5 standard deviations during that period. For 1986/87 El Ni\u00f1 o, the Ni\u00f1 o-3 index began warming (exceeding 0.58C) in November 1986, and thus it weakly influenced southern China precipitation during fall of 1986. The rainfall anomaly for the 1957/58 El Ni\u00f1 o was marginally smaller than 10.5 standard deviation. These results are consistent with Fig -1914/15, 1940/41, 1941/42, 1963/64, 1987/88, 1990/91, and 2002/03 -are associated with the largely (larger than 10.5 standard deviation) positive rainfall anomalies in southern China, whereas six El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events-1968 Modoki events- /69, 1979 Modoki events- /80, 1991 Modoki events- /92, 1992 Modoki events- /93, 2004 Modoki events- /05, and 2009 correspond to the largely negative rainfall anomalies. In the other four El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki years of 1923/24, 1977/78, 1993/94, and 1994/95 , the rainfall anomalies in southern China are small and vary between 60.5 standard deviations. These positive and negative rainfall anomalies result in insignificant correlation between the rainfall anomalies in southern China and EMI index during fall, as shown in Fig. 1 .\nWe also examine the relationship of southern China rainfall with El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki in winter of the El Ni\u00f1 o mature year. We found that nine El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki years are associated with positive rainfall anomalies larger than 10.5 standard deviations, whereas three El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki years correspond to negative rainfall anomalies below 20.5 standard deviations (not shown). These indicate that the feature of the opposite rainfall anomalies in southern China during winter of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki is weaker. In this paper, we focus on fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year.\nThe relationships between El Ni\u00f1 o and rainfall in southern China are much clearer if we calculate rainfall anomaly composites (Fig. 3) . During fall of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (Fig. 3a) , the significantly positive and negative rainfall anomalies are observed in southern and northern China, respectively, which is consistent with previous results (Wang et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2011) . If all 17 El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events are used to calculate the rainfall composite, the significant positive rainfall anomalies in southern China disappear (Fig. 3b) . As demonstrated in Fig. 2 , the rainfall anomalies in southern China are significantly negative for some years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki and positive for other years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki. That is, the rainfall anomalies in southern China cancel each other. If we use the half standard deviation of the rainfall anomalies in southern China as a threshold, we can identify seven years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki (1914/15, 1940/41, 1941/42, 1963/64, 1987/88, 1990/91, and 2002/03) when rainfall in southern China is largely increased and six years (1968/69, 1979/80, 1991/92, 1992/93, 2004/05, and 2009/10) when rainfall is significantly decreased. For the case of seven years in Fig. 3c , the spatial rainfall anomaly patterns are similar to canonical El Ni\u00f1 o. However, for the case of six years in Fig. 3d , the rainfall anomalies in southern China are opposite to those of Fig. 3c and canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (Fig. 3a) . The positive and negative rainfall anomaly patterns are expected because Figs. 3c and 3d are constructed and composited based on the time series of the rainfall anomalies in southern China in Fig. 2 evolution of starting in spring, developing in summer-fall, and maturing in winter (e.g., Rasmusson and Carpenter 1982) . Because of this, oceanographers and meteorologists usually calculate and derive El Ni\u00f1 o composites to better understand the evolving nature of El Ni\u00f1 o. Here we composite the evolution of SST anomalies for various types of El Ni\u00f1 o events from the onset phase to the mature phase (Fig. 4) . For canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (the first column of Fig. 4) , the warm SST anomalies first appear along the South American coast in boreal spring and then propagate westward (Rasmusson and Carpenter 1982) . Because of the Bjerknes' positive feedback, the warm SST anomalies are further intensified and reach a maximum in winter with the largest values in the equatorial eastern Pacific. The cold SST anomalies develop in the off-equatorial western Pacific, especially during and after the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1 o (Weisberg and Wang 1997; Wang et al. 1999; Wang and Weisberg 2000) .\nHowever, for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki the warm SST anomalies do not originate from the South American coast.\nFor the group of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I (the second column of Fig. 4) , the warm SST anomalies are seen over the equatorial central Pacific in spring. Then, the warm SST anomalies gradually intensify and peak in the central Pacific during winter. For El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II (the third column of Fig. 4) , the warm SST anomalies first appear in the subtropical northeastern Pacific in spring and then further develop, reaching the equatorial central Pacific. The SST anomaly pattern in El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II resembles the Pacific meridional mode shown by Chiang and Vimont (2004) , which can potentially affect the onset of ENSO involved in the extratropical atmospheric variability (Chang et al. 2007) . It is noted that the maximum of SST anomalies over the subtropical northeastern Pacific in El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II appears in fall, which is distinct from the peak anomaly season of boreal spring in the Pacific meridional mode (Chiang and Vimont 2004) (1923/24, 1977/78, 1993/94, and 1994/95) , both the SST anomaly origin and pattern are a mixture of those for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I and II (not shown).\nIf we compare the SST anomaly spatial patterns between El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I and II during fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year (the season that the present paper focuses on), we note two differences. First, the warm SST anomalies are symmetric about the equator for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, whereas the warm SST anomalies are north of the equator for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II. Second, the positive SST anomalies in the equatorial central Pacific extend farther westward (about 108 in longitude) for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II than El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I. These SST anomaly differences as well as the different origins induce different atmospheric circulation patterns (as shown in the next two sections), which in turn contribute to different impacts on rainfall anomalies in southern China and typhoon landfall activity. (1911/12, 1951/52, 1965/66, 1972/73/ 1976/77, 1982/83, and 1997/98) , 7 El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I events (1914/15, 1940/41, 1941/42, 1963/1964, 1987/88, 1990/91, and 2002/03) , and 6 El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II events (1968/69, 1979/80, 1991/92, 1992/93, 2004/05, and 2009/10 (Fig. 5a) , consistent with previous studies that emphasized the importance of the ENSO western Pacific anomaly patterns (Weisberg and Wang 1997; Wang et al. 1999 Wang et al. , 2000 . This anomalous anticyclone produces southwesterly wind anomalies along the coast of southern and eastern China that carry moisture to southern China for rainfall there. For El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, the anomalous anticyclone is weaker but is still located near the Philippines (Fig. 5b) . However, for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II, an anomalous cyclone is just east of the Philippines (Fig. 5c) Fig. 5c reflects Gill's (1980) response to the warm SST anomalies in the equatorial central Pacific (more details are given in next section). Thus, the wind anomalies in southern China for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II are northerly and supply dry air and thus are unfavorable for rainfall.\nWe further calculate the moisture flux and its divergence anomalies for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II during fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year (Fig. 6 ). For both canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, southern (northern) China is associated with anomalous moisture convergence (divergence) (Figs. 6a,b) . However, the moisture divergence pattern in China for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II is opposite to that of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I (Fig. 6c) . Both of these moisture flux and moisture divergence distributions are consistent with and explain the rainfall anomaly composites in China (Fig. 3) .\nWe also calculate composites of 500-hPa pressure vertical velocity anomalies for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II during fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year (Fig. 7) Fig. 3 . Since the atmospheric reanalysis products and the GPCC rainfall data are independent, the consistency suggests that the results are robust."}, {"section_title": "Model results", "text": "The simple atmospheric model described in section 2 is used to examine the response to SST anomalies. The composited SST anomalies during fall for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II (Fig. 4) are used to force the model. The model results for the baroclinic streamfunction are shown in Fig. 8 . A common feature is that in response to a warm heating anomaly in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific, the baroclinic streamfunction from the model experiments shows a pair of cyclones straddled on the equator (the left panels of Fig. 8 ). This is indicative that Gill's (1980) dynamics are at work: the equatorial warm SST anomalies produce a pair of cyclones north and south of the equator, which in turn induces equatorial westerly wind anomalies to the west of the heating region. The pair of cyclones for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki events is farther westward than canonical El Ni\u00f1 o event, consistent with the observed wind distribution patterns associated with various El Ni\u00f1 o events (Fig. 5) .\nThe model response in the tropical western North Pacific is also basically consistent with the observational results shown in the previous sections. For the model experiment of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, a strong anticyclone is located in the north of the Philippines. For El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I and II, a weak anticyclone resides over Asia. In particular, the model experiment of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II shows that the cyclone extends westward to the east of the Philippine Sea and Indonesia, consistent with the observed result in Fig. 5c . We also perform additional model experiments by removing the forcings of the negative SST anomalies in the western Pacific (the right panels of Fig. 8 ). For the case of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, the anticyclone north of the Philippines disappears (Fig. 8d ). For the model experiments of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki, the cyclones extend westward, reaching the east coast of China. ) dp, where q is specific humidity, u is vector wind, p is pressure, and g is gravity.\nFIG. 7.

From 1950 to 2010, El Ni\u00f1 o events feature six years of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (1951/52, 1965/66, 1972/73/ 1976/77, 1982/83, and 1997/98) , four years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I (1963/64, 1987/88, 1990/91, and 2002/03) and six years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II (1968/69, 1979/80, 1991/92, 1992/93, 2004/05, and 2009/10) . [Note that previous studies have classified three prevailing typhoon tracks in the western North Pacific: 1) the westward track across the Philippines and the South China Sea to Vietnam, 2) the northwestward track toward the south and east coast of China, and 3) the recurving track toward the regions near Japan and the sea east of Japan (e.g., Liu and Chan 2008).] In the tropical western North Pacific, TCs usually move toward the west with a slight poleward component due to an axis of high pressure called the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) that extends eastwest poleward of TCs. On the equatorward side of the WNPSH, the easterly trade winds prevail. However, if the WNPSH is weak and/or shifts eastward, TCs may turn poleward and then recurve toward the east as in the case of hurricanes in the North Atlantic (e.g., Liu and Fearn 2000; Elsner et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2011) . On the poleward side of the WNPSH, the westerly winds prevail, thus steering TCs back to the east. Hence, the position and strength of the WNPSH can determine and change the movement of TCs. We calculate the composites of the WNPSH for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II during fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year (Fig. 10) . For both canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, the WNPSH extends westward to the South China Sea and even to southern East Asia. However, for the case of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II, the WNPSH shifts slightly eastward in comparison with the WNPSH climatological position (Fig. 10c) . Thus, the eastward shift of the WNPSH will allow a more frequent northeastward recurvature of typhoons, whereas the westward shift of the WNPSH creates a more favorable condition for typhoons to make landfall. In other words, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II does not allow the WNPSH to extend far west, meaning that typhoons likely would be steered around WNPSH's edge to the northeast instead of making landfall in China.\nIn fact, the movement of TCs is mainly steered by the surrounding environmental flow in the troposphere and 1951/52, 1965/66, 1972/ 73, 1976/77, 1982/83, and 1997/98) , (b) 4 years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I (1963/64, 1987/88, 1990/91, and 2002/03) , and (c) 6 years of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II (1968/69, 1979/80, 1991/92, 1992/93, 2004/05, and 2009/10) . modified by the beta effect. An integrated flow through a layer of the atmosphere is usually defined as the TC steering flow (e.g., Dong and Neumann 1986; Velden and Leslie 1991) . The steering flow patterns associated with canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II during fall of the El Ni\u00f1 o developing year are shown in Fig. 11 . As with the rainfall influence, canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I share a similar pattern of the TC steering flow with the southwesterly anomalies in the south coast of China and the west of the Philippines. However, for the case of El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II, the northwesterly anomalies of the TC steering flow blow in the south coast of China, the South China Sea, and the Philippine Sea (Fig. 11c) , which are unfavorable for typhoons to make landfall in China. The differences of the TC steering flow explain why El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II has a smaller ratio or number of typhoons making landfall in China compared to canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I. In this paper, the WNPSH is represented by the contour of 5864 gpm of the 500-hPa geopotential height. Although the position of the WNPSH is sensitive to the selection of contour lines, the basic feature of the zonal shifts for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II does not depend upon the contour selections. We can also choose other contour lines such as those of Sui et al. (2007) and obtain similar results. That is, canonical El Ni\u00f1 o and El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I are associated with a westward extension of the WNPSH, whereas El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II corresponds to an eastward shift. However, the physics of the zonal shifts of the WNPSH for various El Ni\u00f1 o events need to be investigated given that the formation mechanisms of the subtropical highs are in debate and many hypotheses have been proposed (e.g., Rodwell and Hoskins 2001; Seager et al. 2003; Liu and Wu 2004; Liu et al. 2004; Miyasaka and Nakamura 2005; Nigam and Chan 2009 ). In addition, it is not clear why the westward extension of the WNPSH for El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I is larger than that of canonical El Ni\u00f1 o (Fig. 10) ."}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "El", "text": "Why various El Ni\u00f1 o events show the different origins of SST anomalies is unknown. For canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, the warm SST anomalies first appear along the South American coast in boreal spring and then propagate westward (e.g., Rasmusson and Carpenter 1982) , reaching the maximum warming in the equatorial eastern Pacific. For El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki I, the warm SST anomalies are seen over the equatorial central Pacific in spring and then gradually intensify and reach the maximum in the equatorial central Pacific. For El Ni\u00f1 o Modoki II, the warm SST anomalies originate in the subtropical northeastern Pacific in spring and then further develop reaching the equatorial central Pacific. These different origins of SST anomalies may be associated with different ENSO mechanisms such as the recharge-discharge oscillator (Jin 1997) or other oscillators [see the review by Wang and Picaut (2004) ] for canonical El Ni\u00f1 o, and possible mechanisms of zonal advection feedback (e.g., Kug et al. 2009 ), subtropical connections (Yu et al. 2010; Yu and Kim 2011) , and seasonal footprinting (Vimont et al. 2003; Chang et al. 2007) "}]
