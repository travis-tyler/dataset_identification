Purpose", "text": "This document describes the universe, methods, and editing procedures used in the nonfiscal, universe portion of the school year (SY) 2015-16 Common Core of Data (CCD) collection. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) will publish updated versions of this document with each school year collection. The CCD universe collection is a comprehensive listing of the public elementary and secondary schools and the local education agencies (LEAs) that administer and support them. The CCD includes directory, enrollment, and staffing data at state, LEA, and school levels. State education agencies (SEAs) report these data in a series of file submissions throughout the school year. Specific information about the actual data is provided in the First Look publications and companion files that accompany the release of the component files. The CCD also includes fiscal data and data on high school dropouts and completers. Those collections are described in separate documentation. The CCD universe collection is a subset of the data submitted by SEAs to the Department of Education through EDFacts, the department's centralized data collection system. SEAs submit data through the EDFacts Submission System (ESS). The Partner Support Center (PSC) assists data providers in resolving any file submission problems. Files with CCD data are replicated to the Data Management System (DMS) which is used by PSC analysts to review the data and communicate with SEAs about any data issues. Other documentation that may be useful to researchers includes the following: \u2022 EDFacts workbook, a reference guide to using the ESS; particularly useful to new users; contains multiple appendices, including one that explains how to use the file specifications (posted at https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden-workbook.html. \u2022 EDFacts file specifications, posted at https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/filespecifications.html. These specifications include the detailed definitions and guidance given to SEAs for reporting CCD data. \u2022 The EDFacts business rules guide describes each business rule; it includes the error number, type, message, definition, edit logic, and the file specifications against which the business rules are applied (posted at https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/businessrules-guide.html). \u2022 The CCD DMS state users' guide instructs data providers in the SEAs in the use of the CCD Data Management System: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/dms-stateuser-guide.docx. \u2022 The CCD DMS Business Rules Guide lists the edits run against the data submitted by SEAs: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/ccd-dms-business-rules-guide.xlsx. \u2022 CCD data files and documentation, posted at https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp.

Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. CCD Background", "text": "The CCD is a national statistical program that collects and compiles administrative data from SEAs covering the universe of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the United States. The first CCD collection was for SY 1986-87. The predecessor to CCD was the Elementary and Secondary General Information System. The CCD includes five basic collections and several supplemental ones. The basic collections are divided into two main data content areas: nonfiscal (or universe) data and fiscal data. They are further divided into hierarchical levels (school, LEA, 1 and state). These five basic collections are listed in the exhibit below. This documentation addresses the three nonfiscal, universe data files. "}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 1.

Particulars regarding the 2015-16 Data Files", "text": "\u2022 Version 1a of the 2015-16 CCD file includes data submitted up through January 17, 2017. \u2022 The NCES School ID (SCHID) has been changed for 96 schools so that starting with 2015-16 it is unique for all schools within each state. This change was made in the preliminary CCD school directory file. It was always intended that this value should be unique within each state; however, a processing error resulted in these 96 cases of duplicate SCHID values within a state. This was corrected in the 2015-16 collection by changing the '0' in the first position of the SCHID (or the eighth position of the NCESSCH field) to a '1'. The Directory companion file includes an ID crosswalk for the affected schools. With this correction, SCHID is unique within an SEA, meaning all schools can be uniquely identified with the combination of FIPST and SCHID. The unique values of SCHID make it possible to track a school longitudinally, even though it may change the LEA with which it is affiliated. \u2022 The virtual school flag (VIRTUAL) has been moved from the school directory file to the CCD School characteristics file (EDFacts file specification 129). \u2022 From SY 1998-99 through SY 2014-15, CCD LEA files included the count of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in LEP programs (EDFacts file C046-LEP Students in LEP Programs). That EDFacts collection will be discontinued. Starting with 2015-16 CCD is reporting total enrollment of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students (EDFacts file C141-LEP Enrolled). \u2022 Utah was unable to report staff data for both SY 2015-16 and SY 2014-15. State-level staff values were imputed. Please see the companion file for particulars. \u2022 Wyoming did not report staff data at the LEA level; all of the LEA-level staff values were set to '-1' (missing). \u2022 Wyoming reported a total of 4 charter schools in 2014-15; all four were reported as noncharter schools in 2015-16. These schools are: o Snowy Range Academy (NCESSCH=560073000216) o Laramie Montessori Charter School (NCESSCH=560073000542) o Arapahoe Charter High School (NCESSCH=560096000367) o PODER Academy (NCESSCH=560198000547) \u2022 Ungraded enrollment (UG) and ungraded teacher FTE (UGTCH) were set to '-2' (not applicable) for those states that indicated that they did not use the designation 'ungraded'. The state-level imputation flags for these values in these cases were set to 'A' ('Adjusted'). \u2022 Massachusetts did not submit Free-or Reduced-Price Lunch data for SY 2015-16. \u2022 New York reported all counts of Hawaiian Native / Pacific Islander students as '-1' (missing). \u2022 The table below shows which data files have been submitted by American Samoa, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), Guam, and the Northern Marianas for SY 2015-16.

The Scope of CCD", "text": "The CCD is a census or \"universe\" data collection, unlike a sample data collection that includes only a subset of the target population. The goal of the CCD surveys is to provide a complete and comprehensive listing of all schools, LEAs, and SEAs providing free public elementary and secondary education within the United States. The primary use of the CCD is to provide national estimates of key education statistics, such as the total number of students enrolled in public elementary/secondary schools in the United States and the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers working in these schools. The NCES annual Digest of Education Statistics publishes tabulations of CCD data. The CCD is also used as a sampling frame for studies of public elementary/secondary education. NCES studies that use the CCD this way include the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS). 2 The geographic scope of the CCD includes: \u2022 the 50 states and the District of Columbia; \u2022 Puerto Rico; \u2022 the U.S. Virgin Islands; \u2022 American Samoa; \u2022 Guam; \u2022 the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; \u2022 Bureau of Indian Education (BIE); and \u2022 Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). References in CCD documentation to state education agencies include the reporting agencies for the island territories, BIE, and DoDEA.

Elementary/Secondary Education Entities in CCD", "text": "The CCD imposes a three-level hierarchy on public elementary/secondary education entities: state, LEA, and school.

This hierarchical relationship between schools, LEAs, and SEAs is reflected in the identification numbers assigned to schools, LEAs, and SEAs by NCES. (See the section, \"Unit Identifiers\" below). This section describes how these entities are characterized in CCD.

This standard derives from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which defines the SEA as the agency of the state charged with primary responsibility for coordinating and supervising public elementary and secondary instruction (education), including the setting of standards for instructional programs, and it is the state agency that administers federal grant programs under the ESEA. This SEA is the entity responsible for reporting CCD data. Other state agencies, such as justice departments or health departments, may operate schools or provide elementary/secondary education services. Some states also operate schools for the blind or the deaf. Within the CCD typology, these would all be designated as LEAs of type 5 (\"stateoperated\"-see the next section)."}, {"section_title": "Local Education Agencies (LEAs)", "text": "In the CCD typology, LEAs include all governmental agencies within a state that support public elementary/secondary education other than the SEA and schools. These include local school districts that operate schools, as well as regional agencies that provide services to school districts, other education agencies, or schools. LEAs may or may not be coterminous with county, city, or town boundaries. The CCD LEA typology is based on the governance of the agency. The LEA type (LEA_TYPE) takes one of the following values: 1 = regular local school district that is not a component of a supervisory union; 2 = regular local school district component of a supervisory union sharing a superintendent and administrative services with other local school districts; 3 = supervisory union administrative center or a county superintendent serving the same purpose; 4 = regional education services agency or a county superintendent serving the same purpose; 5 = state-operated institution charged, at least in part, with providing elementary and secondary instruction or services to a special-needs population; 6 = federally operated institution charged, at least in part, with providing elementary and secondary instruction or services. With few exceptions, these are LEAs operating under the DoDEA; 7 = agencies for which all associated schools are charter schools. In the CCD model, every school is associated with an LEA. Charter schools authorized by entities other than a LEA often serve as their own LEA for CCD reporting purposes; and 8 = other education agencies that do not fit into the first seven categories. Prior to the SY 2007-08 collection, TYPE 7 represented \"other education agencies,\" which included charter school agencies.

To ensure the uniqueness of each reported entity and continuity with prior year reporting, the ESS runs a series of checks using the states' own ID numbers for LEAs and schools, NCES ID numbers, and the reported status of the entities. These are referred to as \"match\" edits because they rely primarily on matching entities reported in the current year collection with those reported in the prior year. To pass these edits the reported status of the LEA or school must be logically consistent from prior year to current year (e.g., a school closed in the prior year should not be reported as open in the current year). A directory file that fails match edits is rejected by ESS, and the SEA must make the appropriate corrections and resubmit the file before the data is processed further. As a quality assurance measure, CCD DMS also runs a similar series of match edits against the LEA and school files extracted from ESS. SEAs are asked to review any LEAs and schools that fail match edits in CCD DMS. Unless the reporting SEA requests it, these entities are not deleted from the directory file. This allows for the possibility that the entity changed status within the school year. The directory companion file includes a cross tabulation of the counts of LEAs and schools by prior year and current year status with inconsistent status changes flagged. Closed schools are reported on the CCD directory file the year after they have closed. The directory file specifications (029 -https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden/nonxml/n029-12-1.doc) provide the directions given to SEAs on reporting schools, LEAs, their IDs and their statuses.

However, to avoid publishing clearly erroneous data, NCES tests for unlikely values and suppresses those that cannot be explained or resolved. Beginning with SY 2009-10, NCES implemented an editing methodology that more accurately identifies data that are likely to be erroneous. For the SY 2015-16 all membership reporting (total membership, membership distribution by race/ethnicity, membership distribution by sex, membership distribution by grade level, lunch program counts, children with disabilities and English language learners) was subjected to multi-year edits. Of the staff categories, only teacher FTE was tested this way. Prior to SY 2009-10, data elements were compared only to the reported data from the prior year for each school or LEA. The revised methodology uses available data from multiple prior years and is applied to both the reported data items and related ratios. Specifically, an average variation over the prior 4 years is computed based on the differences between each year and the other 3 years. Then, the average variation between the current year and the 4 preceding years was computed based on the differences between target year and each of the 4 prior years. Data elements with large differences are then flagged as potential errors. Additionally, a related ratio is calculated and tested. Examples of these computed ratios include pupil/teacher ratio and percent of students eligible for FRPL. For example, in testing total student membership, the pupil/teacher ratio is also tested. A consistent value for the ratio indicates that the changed value is consistent with other changes in the data. If both the absolute value and the ratio value are at wide variance compared with prior years, the value is flagged for possible suppression and included in the DMS error reports. CCD analysts and SEAs then have the opportunity to review the suspect values and make a determination of their validity. A processing flag is used to track the status of these values during the review process in the trunk schema. Its values are: \u2022 passed edits; \u2022 ED Analyst accepted anomalous data as correct; data to be retained; \u2022 state provided satisfactory response as to why anomalous data are correct; data to be retained; \u2022 state did not give satisfactory response as to why anomalous data are correct; data to be suppressed \u2022 state did not provide a response as to why anomalous data are correct; data to be suppressed."}, {"section_title": "b) Review completion", "text": "Once the data review is completed, PSC analysts compile recommendations for any adjustments needed to resolve any remaining data issues.

GSLO excludes prekindergarten and kindergarten unless one of those is also the highest grade offered, or where a first grade is also offered by the school. This is done to avoid mischaracterizing a school's grade range in those cases where, except for prekindergarten and kindergarten, a school's grades are all in the middle or high school ranges.

Growth rate imputation applies a rate of change to an item from the previous to the current year. The method for growth rate imputation is as follows: (1) calculate the ratio of the current year value for the item to the previous year's value among states reporting the item strictly by the definition (states reporting these items \"strictly by the definition\" are those states that (a) report values greater than 0 for each of the items involved in the imputation; and (b) have no values affected by another imputation or edit); (2) calculate the average of these ratios; and (3) multiply the value reported in the previous year (but missing this year) by this average ratio. The accompanying imputation flag is set to 'P'. NCES' review of data found a number of cases where the same values for the same states had been imputed by this method for three or more years in a row. NCES decided against imputing values from imputed values and that these values would be left as missing for 2015-16. These included the following: \uf0a7 Alaska (CORSUP), \uf0a7 California (PK, LIBSUP, PKTCH), \uf0a7 Montana (LIBSUP) \uf0a7 Nevada (PARA, CORSUP, SCHSUP, LEASUP, LIBSUP) \uf0a7 New Jersey (LIBSUP) \uf0a7 Oregon (PK) \uf0a7 West Virginia (LIBSUP) b) Imputations from prior years' data If a staff count was missing for the current year, but was reported in the prior year, a current year value was imputed using the prior year ratio for the particular staff count to the total staff count. Utah did not submit staff data for 2014-15 or in 2015-16. Staff data were imputed for the 2014-15 public release file using a national growth rate. Rather than use a national growth rate imputation for a second year of missing data, NCES imputed staff values from prior years when Utah reported staff data. The 2015-16 figures were imputed from 2013-14 data using a 2 percent annual increase for school-related positions and a 1 percent annual increase for LEA-related positions.

Calculate the average of each of these ratios; 3. Calculate the ratio of each average ratio to the sum of the average ratios for the unreported items as well as for the item that will be distributed; and 4. Multiply the reported item by the ratio calculated in step 3 to determine the share for each item.

This level of disaggregation is available at the LEA level starting with SY 2010-11 and at the SEA level starting with SY 2009-10. Information about the level of detail of membership data for a given school year can be found in the corresponding data file documentation or companion file. All membership counts in CCD are head counts, not FTEs. A student may attend more than one school, but each student is counted only once, in the school where he/she spends most of the school day, sometimes called the \"home school\" or \"school of record.\" A student is counted in the membership of the SEA and the LEA responsible for the student, and in the school that he/she actually attends. Some LEAs 'tuition-out' students to schools in other LEAs or even private schools. These students are still counted in the membership of the LEA responsible for them, but they are not reported in membership of any of that LEA's schools. For this reason, school membership aggregated to the LEA level does not always equal the membership reported by the LEA. \"Ungraded\" is included as a grade-level designation in CCD; however, not all states use this designation. For these states, counts of ungraded students and ungraded teachers are reported as \"not applicable.\" Some public elementary/secondary schools also provide adult education, which may engage the elementary/secondary teachers in those schools. Generally, adult education (AE) is outside the scope of the CCD. In order to provide data users with all the data relevant to public schools' functions, information about AE is included in the CCD. This information includes a gradesoffered flag for AE and counts of AE enrollment. AE is not considered in assigning high and low grade values or a school's LEVEL value.

Guidelines for Aggregating CCD Data For many analyses, it is useful to aggregate data from lower levels to higher levels. However, higher level aggregations can be misleading when data at lower levels are missing. NCES strongly encourages researchers to consider the possible effect of missing or suppressed data on their analyses. The percentage of cases (schools or LEAs) reporting valid values can be used to evaluate the reliability of the aggregated number. The denominator in this percentage is the number of cases in the aggregation excluding those cases not expected to report the item (i.e., cases with a value of -2); the numerator is the number of those schools providing valid data (values greater than or equal to zero). The difference between them are cases of missing (-1) or suppressed (-9) values. NCES suggests the following guidelines for interpreting this percentage. \u2022 If the percentage is greater than 95 percent, the aggregation can be considered reliable. \u2022 If the percentage is less than 95 percent, but more than 85 percent, the aggregation should be interpreted with caution. \u2022 If the percentage is less than 85 percent, the aggregation should be considered unreliable."}, {"section_title": "F.

The bureau also funds residential programs for students at boarding schools and at dormitories housing those attending nearby tribal or public schools. Each BIE school is also its own LEA. These LEAs are of TYPE '2' (Supervisory Union Member). BIE does not report any supervisory unions (LEA TYPE '3'). Instead, the SU members are linked by the supervisory union ID (UNION) to one of 22 \"Education Line Offices\" with an LEA type of '4' (Regional LEA). The supervisory union member entities were created to report student performance data required for other EDFacts collections. The Education Line Offices do not have this data. Some state governments provide some support to BIE schools within their borders. To account for this funding, the state governments may include a BIE school in their EDFacts/CCD reporting. In a limited number of cases, the state also reports the membership for these schools, creating the possibility of double-counting these students in CCD. There are 10 such schools and six such LEAs in three different states; these are the same schools and LEAs in each year of data.

It indicates the provision under which a school is participating in the NSLP. \u2022 The Department of Agriculture has been encouraging school systems to certify for NSLP by using a count of \"directly certified\" students in place of the individual household applications used in past years. Students are directly certified when the appropriate agency certifies the participation of the student, or the student's family, in various public assistance programs. The number of students directly certified is a subset of the total number of students eligible for NSLP. It is multiplied by 1.6 to provide an estimate of the percentage of NSLP-eligible students. Some schools, especially those participating under the CEP (see next paragraph) only have directly-certified counts to report. \u2022 In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was amended to provide an alternative to household applications for free and reduced-price meals in high-poverty LEAs and schools. This alternative is called the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). CEP was implemented to increase student participation in meal programs by expanding access to free meals to all students and decrease household and administrative burden by not requiring regular applications to establish eligibility for free lunch. However, while CEP improves the efficiency of the NSLP, it also results in the loss of individual student-level FRPL eligibility data in participating education agencies, given that CEP schools are prohibited from collecting NSLP household applications. Schools qualifying under CEP no longer count students qualifying for reduced-price lunches since all students are provided a free lunch. CEP schools may report all students as eligible for free lunches, regardless of individual student's economic status, since all students are provided a free lunch.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) provides the structure of numeric codes for representing congressional districts and similar areas defined for the various congresses of the United States. The congressional district codes are two-digit numeric codes used to represent the congressional districts of each multidistrict state of the United States. For example, the First Congressional District is identified as \"01,\" the Second Congressional District as \"02,\" etc. The Congressional District in a state with only a single representative elected at large is designated as \"00.\" In the 110th Congress, this applies to Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. For an entity with a nonvoting delegate-the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico (whose delegate is referred to as a \"resident commissioner\"), and the U.S. Virgin Islands-the representational area is designated as \"98.\" Those entities with no representation in the Congress-the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and the several U.S. minor outlying islands are designated as \"99.\" Although congressional district codes are unique within each state and equivalent entity, and for each Congress, the congressional districts in different states may have the same code. For example, the First Congressional District of Alabama and of Arizona are both coded \"01.\" Since the CCD requires the identification of congressional districts in more than one state, the congressional district code is preceded by the ANSI state numeric code.
