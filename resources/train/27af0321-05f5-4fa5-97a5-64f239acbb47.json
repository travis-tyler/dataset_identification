It is the fourth leading cause of death among adults in high-income countries. Although numerous drug-modifying clinical trials for AD have been conducted, none have been effective (1) . Two hypotheses could explain this lack of efficiency: a) therapy has been implemented too late, after irreversible brain damage has occurred, stressing the need to identify the disease earlier (2, 3) before neurodegeneration is too severe; b) the therapeutic strategy is not appropriate, requiring a better understanding of disease pathological mechanism(s). Either way or both at the same time, finding very early biomarkers of prodromal AD, characteristic of the presymptomatic phase (before memory loss and cognitive decline) of the disease, is therefore a major issue for current international research on AD.\nWith this aim, highly sensitive biomarkers are needed. While structural imaging markers are considered sensitive enough to detect very early stage of disease (4-6), the current model assumes that their modification occurs after the apparition of the first symptoms (7, 8) and MRI-based studies were based on datasets with a relatively short follow-up period before diagnosis (around 3-5 years). However, it is now well admitted that pathological changes to the brain occur decades before the first symptoms appear in AD. Thus efforts to identify subjects in the prodromal phase of AD have recently shifted to the presymptomatic phase of the disease.\nIn this context, it is highly desirable to study population-based cohorts that include healthy elderly with longer term follow-up. In addition, population-based cohorts give us the opportunity to avoid the potentially biased selection associated with recruitment in memory clinics and enable the study of imaging and neuropsychological parameters at the presymptomatic stage (silent phase) of the disease. Herein, in the present study, we propose to evaluate MRI-based imaging biomarkers on a dataset from a population-based cohorts of healthy elderly subjects with long follow-up (12 years) enable the study of imaging and neuropsychological parameters over the course of the presymptomatic phase of AD. During the 12 years follow-up period some subjects will convert to AD do so 7 years (on average) after enrollment into the study. This long follow-up enables to track evidence of neurodegeneration at least 7 years before clinical diagnosis using MRI.\nAnother limitation of previous studies evaluating neurodegeneration biomarkers is the method of estimating the MRI neurodegeneration signature. Among the biomarkers proposed in the literature, hippocampal atrophy is considered a sensitive and powerful marker of AD progression (4) . Recent comparisons of MRI-based measurements of neurodegeneration (hippocampus volume loss, cortical thickness reduction or global brain atrophy) revealed that hippocampus volume is currently among the best candidates for predicting AD (6, 9) . However, the prediction accuracy obtained using hippocampus volume is relatively low, around 65% in subjects 18 months before conversion to AD (9) . Therefore, performing automatic individual prognosis using hippocampus volume as a neurodegeneration surrogate appears limited.\nRecently, we developed advanced image analysis methods that have been proposed to better detect the AD signature in MRI (10, 11) . Based on a pathological pattern recognition strategy, such approaches are able to provide a grading measure that reflects the similarity of the anatomical patterns of the subject under study with datasets composed of healthy and pathological subjects. In this manner, it is possible to accurately reveal the presence of neurodegeneration, even when it is subtle.\nThese methods take advantage of using a large training library composed of cognitively normal (CN) controls and AD patients to learn from example. Using the ADNI dataset (12), we have showed that hippocampal grading significantly enables better automatic prediction of AD compared to hippocampal volume (11) . This advanced image analysis method is based on an MRI-based pattern recognition strategy that is able to provide a grading measure that reflects the similarity of the anatomical patterns of the subject under study with datasets composed of healthy subjects and patients with AD.\nThe present study aims to assess the predictive value of hippocampal grade on incident dementia in cognitively intact patients. Our two hypotheses are: 1) subtle neurodegeneration can be detected very early in the course of AD by using hippocampal grade in a population-based study with long follow-up (12 years); and 2) accurate scoring of subjects from Bordeaux site of the Three-City project could be achieved by using the AD and cognitively normal (CN) populations from another cohort, ADNI dataset, as a training library. "}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Test dataset: Bdx-3C", "text": "In this study, we used subjects from the Bordeaux site of the Three-City (Bdx-3C) dataset, a prospective population-based cohort designed to assess the risk of dementia and cognitive decline due to vascular risk factors (14) . In this longitudinal dataset, neuropsychological tests were performed by trained psychologists at baseline and at 2, 4, 7, 10 and 12 years. MRI scans were acquired at baseline and at 4 and 9 years. The neuropsychological evaluation consisted of several tests performed at each follow-up, always including the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (15) to evaluate global cognitive function. During follow-up, subjects suspected of dementia were seen at home by a neurologist or a geriatrician who confirmed the diagnosis and specified the etiology of dementia. After this assessment, definitive diagnosis was made by a panel of independent neurologists to obtain a consensus on the diagnosis and the etiology according to the DSM-IV criteria for dementia and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD (13) .\nIn the Bdx-3C study, 663 subjects have a baseline MRI scan. By using baseline scans of all the CN subjects who remain free of dementia during 12 years, we built a stable CN (sCN) group while subjects who converted to AD during the last 3 follow-ups were used to build the converter CN (cCN) group. The group construction is similar to the procedure described in a previous study (16) . First, subjects with missing MMSE (n= 3) and MMSE \u2264 24 (n=46) at baseline were excluded and subjects with unusable MRI scans were removed (74 for brain pathologies and 2 for major acquisition artifacts). In addition, subjects with prevalent dementia (n=2) and early incident dementia (n=13) at 2-year and 4-year follow-up were excluded. Then, subjects with missing data for 7-year, 10-year and 12-year follow-up (n=148) were excluded. Among these 375 remaining subjects, 47 presented late incident dementia at 7-year, 10-year or 12-year neuropsychological follow-up and 328 remained free of dementia until the 12-year follow-up. Finally, only subjects fulfilling the criteria for AD dementia type (n= 37) were used in cCN group and only subjects free of dementia with a MMSE >24 (n= 309) at 7-year, 10-year and 12-year follow-up were kept to construct the sCN (see Figure 1 ). We do not use CN subjects who converted at 2-year and 4-year follow-up in order to build a homogeneous group composed of subjects far from conversion. Therefore, Bdx-3C dataset was divided into two groups of 309 sCN and 37 cCN. Demographic details of both Bdx-3C groups are provided in Table 1 . We found statistical difference between sCN and cCN groups for age (p=0.0001) but not for gender (p=0.17). At baseline, no statistical difference was observed between groups for a global cognitive scale (i.e., MMSE) using generalized linear model. This indicates that cCN subjects are in a silent phase.\nWe estimated the mean time before AD diagnosis for the cCN group at 103.05 months (SD: 24.26) using the baseline MRI and the follow-up exams where AD diagnosis was established. However, low frequency of follow-up exams might introduce a bias by overestimating this duration. Therefore, we also computed an "}, {"section_title": "Image Preprocessing", "text": "All the images (ADNI and Bdx-3C) were preprocessed through the same fully automatic pipeline (17) . The preprocessing included the following steps: estimation of the standard deviation of noise (18); denoising based on an optimized nonlocal means filter (19) ; correction of inhomogeneities using N3 (20) ; registration to stereotaxic space (stx) based on a linear transform to the ICBM152 template (1x1x1 mm\u00b3 voxel size) (21) using a population-specific template derived from the ADNI database (22); linear intensity normalization of each subject on template intensity; brain extraction using BEaST (23); image cropping around the structures of interest and cross-normalization of the MRI intensity between the subjects within the estimated brain mask (24) (see Figure 2 ). Finally, the hippocampal volume was estimated with (25) ."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal grading", "text": "Inspired by our work based on a nonlocal patch-based framework for MRI denoising (19) and for MRI segmentation (25), we recently proposed a new method to estimate structure grading called SNIPE (10, 11) . The grading or scoring of the structure under consideration is achieved by estimating the nonlocal similarity of the subject under study to different training populations. With the nonlocal framework, SNIPE is able to handle inter-subject variability by enabling a one-to-many mapping between the subject's anatomy and those of the training templates. Moreover, by employing the patch-based comparison principle, SNIPE can detect subtle anatomical changes caused by the disease. In short, the technique uses a library of manually labeled MRI datasets from healthy aging subjects and patients with AD. For each voxel in a new subject to be analyzed, the method defines a 7x7x7 voxel patch centered on the voxel in question (see Figure 2 ). The procedure then searches the template library for similar patches. Template structure labels are weighted by the patch similarity, and the structure label with the maximum weight is then associated with the voxel. At the same time, the template group (+1.0 for normal controls and -1.0 for AD subjects)\nis also weighted by the patch similarity. The resulting average weight is used as a grading value to indicate how similar this voxel is to the CN group or the AD group (see (10) for details). In this paper, we also propose to adapt this grading framework to image-based estimation of clinical scores as explained in the following.\nAfter the preprocessing pipeline, we estimated hippocampal grading on the Bdx-3C dataset using the following steps: selection of the training subjects, structure grading and feature extraction. a) Training subjects selection: AD and CN populations of ADNI were used as training library to achieve hippocampal grading of the cCN and sCN groups of the Bdx-3C\ndataset. During our experiment, the selection of the 50 closest subjects from each training population (i.e., AD and CN) was achieved using the sum of the squared difference (SSD) over an initialization mask. In a previous study (10), we showed that 50 subjects provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and computational burden. b) Structure grading for the subject under study: For each voxel of the subject under study in the hippocampal area, we compared the surrounding patch (a cube of 7x7x7 voxels) with all the patches from the N=100 training templates selected from the ADNI AD and CN populations in the hippocampal area. For each patch comparison, the SSD between the patch under study and the considered training patch was used to assign a weight to the training patch. More precisely, the patch P(x i ) surrounding the voxel x i under study is compared with all the patches P(x s,j ) of the training template s within a search area \u03a9 of size 9x9x9 voxels. The patch similarity between P(x i ) and P(x s,j ) was estimated by the sum of squared differences (SSD) measure.\nFinally, each patch received a weight w(x i , x s,j ):\nwhere ||.|| 2 is the L2-norm computed between each intensity of the elements of the patches P(x i ) and P(x s,j ), and h(x i ) 2 is the smoothing parameter of the weighting function. This weighting function is designed to give a weight close to 1 when the SSD is close to zero and a weight close to zero with the SSD is high. The smoothing parameter was automatically and locally adjusted as follows:\nwhere \u03b5 is a small constant used to avoid numerical instability. These estimated weights were then used to perform structure grading using the group membership status of training subjects (i.e., CN or AD). As described in (10), we used a non-local estimator to estimate grading values at each voxel:\nwhere p s is the clinical status of the considered ADNI training template s. In our case, p s =-1 was used for AD status while p s =1 was used for normal control.\nTherefore, a negative grading value g(x i ) indicates that the neighborhood surrounding x i is more characteristic of AD than CN (respectively, of CN than AD) (see Fig. 2 ).\nRespectively, a positive grading value indicates that the neighborhood surrounding x i is more characteristic of CN than AD. In this paper, an adaptation to clinical score estimation of this grading framework is also proposed. To do that, clinical status p s in Eq. (3) is replaced by clinical scores of ADNI training subjects. In our experiments, we used ADNI MMSE scores to perform patch-based MMSE estimation of Bdx-3C subjects.

In such approach, only the control group is used to estimate the age-related effect through linear regression. Here, linear regression models have been estimated first using the sCN group only. Then, these models were used for correcting age-related effect impacting the considered biomarkers (i.e., volumes, grades, MMSE scores and patch-based MMSE estimation) for cCN and sCN groups."}, {"section_title": "Validation framework", "text": "In order to study the AD prognostic accuracy of the imaging biomarkers and the considered global cognitive test evaluated at baseline (i.e. MMSE), we performed classification experiments on sCN vs. cCN subject of the Bdx-3C dataset.

In this type of cross-validation, the classifier is trained on n\u22121 samples and then the trained classifier is used to classify the remaining sample.\nThe biomarker values were corrected for age difference. All the classification results were analyzed in terms of Correct Classification Rate (CCR), specificity (SPE) and sensitivity (SEN). Moreover, a McNemar's test was performed to verify that the classifier tested was significantly different from a random classifier to show results are better than chance. Finally, the classifier performance was studied also by estimating the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) using posterior probabilities of the LDA obtained within the LOOCV procedure. A bootstrap approach was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval of AUC."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Signature", "text": "As previously mentioned, hippocampal atrophy can be better characterized using pathological pattern recognition than using pure volume. The main idea of hippocampal grading is to use a training MRI library to efficiently track the presence of AD signature. For a given anatomical pattern (e.g., a cube of 7x7x7 mm) located in the hippocampal area of the subject under study, a search for similar patterns is done within a large number (around 50,000 in our experiment) of anatomical patterns available in the training MR images composed of two groups -a healthy and a pathological group (i.e., CN and AD) (see Figure 2 and Table 1 ). Here, the studied subject is extracted from Bdx-3C and the training library is composed of ADNI MRI (12) . The degree of similarity and the number of similar patterns found in each group is used to decide if the current anatomical pattern is more CN-like or AD-like. A strong similarity with AD pathological patterns indicates the presence of an AD MRI signature and thus reveals that the neurodegeneration process related to AD has started. This procedure is repeated for each voxel included in the hippocampus that implies approximately 350,000,000 pattern comparisons are used to establish the final grading map in the proposed framework. Finally, the average grading value over the hippocampus is used as hippocampal grading measure and can be viewed as a consensus decision. Each grading value obtained for each voxel can be viewed as a \"weak\" classifier of the status of the current subject. The advantage of using an ensemble of classifiers composed of many \"weak\" classifiers has been demonstrated in machine learning (29) . Figure 3 shows typical examples of hippocampal grading maps at the same position in stereotaxic space for age-matched sCN and cCN subjects (this baseline MR image for a converter subject is 7.5 years before conversion to AD). The hippocampal grading map of the sCN subject (mainly bluepurple color) indicates that the majority of the anatomical patterns of the subject are highly similar to anatomical patterns found in the ADNI CN training subjects. For the cCN subject, a number of red focal regions appear, indicating that these hippocampal regions exhibit high structural similarity with the pathological pattern of ADNI AD training subjects. This demonstrates that in these areas, AD-like anatomical patterns were found in this cCN subject and thus that neurodegeneration was detected 7.5 years before conversion to AD. Finally, green regions indicate anatomical patterns equally similar to the anatomy of AD and CN ADNI training subjects. While the human visual system cannot detect the subtle anatomical difference between both subjects, the involved pathological pattern recognition method based on a simultaneous comparison of a huge number of anatomical patterns succeeds in detecting very early signs of AD."}, {"section_title": "Biomarkers comparison", "text": "After image processing, hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus grading maps were obtained for all the Bdx-3C subjects. The segmentations were used to estimate the left and right HC structure volumes, and the average grading value was estimated over the hippocampus segmentations. Finally, the used features were the hippocampal volume (i.e., sum of left and right hippocampus volumes) and the hippocampal grading (i.e., mean grading value estimated over left and right hippocampus). For a given voxel, the grading scale goes from 1 when only CN-like patterns are found to -1 when only AD-like patterns are found. Figure 4 shows the distributions of the compared imaging biomarkers and the cognitive test. All the values were adjusted for age differences between groups. The hippocampal volume of the non-converter group was significantly larger than the hippocampal volume of the converter group (p=0.004) and the hippocampal grade values of the nonconverter group were significantly higher than the converter group (p<0.0001). As previously mentioned MMSE scores were not significantly different between groups (p=0.16). Finally, as for hippocampal grading, patch-based MMSE estimation was significantly different between groups (p<0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Automatic Early Prognostic", "text": "In order to study the AD prognostic detection accuracy at presymptomatic stage (i.e. 7 years before conversion to AD) of the compared biomarkers and cognitive test, we performed automatic classification experiments on sCN versus cCN.

Finally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) shows the advantage of both proposed patchbased biomarkers (see Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Patch-based clinical score estimation", "text": "Recently, several studies investigated age prediction (30) and clinical score prediction (31, 32) using MRI content. The interest of such image-based approaches is growing for early pathology detection and longitudinal follow-up. As previously explained, the proposed framework can be adapted to other problems than clinical status estimation. In fact, MMSE score can be predicted using image content through our patch-based grading framework. Instead of using clinical status of ADNI training subjects as input to estimate clinical status of 3C subjects, MMSE scores of ADNI training subjects can be used to perform a patch-based MMSE estimation. As explained in (30) , such prediction methods require a calibration step to compensate for dataset differences. Here, we used a classical standardization procedure based on z-scores. The patch-based MMSE estimation obtained with ADNI MMSE scores are rescaled to MMSE scores of Bdx-3C subjects using mean and standard deviation of sCN population. As shown on Figure 4 , image-based estimation of MMSE scores using our hippocampal grading framework enables to distinguish populations (p<0.0001) while MMSE score obtained by cognitive tests cannot (p=0.08). Table 2 shows prognostic accuracy obtained for MMSE and patch-based MMSE estimation.\nThe image-based MMSE scores clearly improve prognosis accuracy compared to clinical MMSE scores with a gain of 11.9 pp in terms of CCR and 21.2 pp in terms of AUC (see Figure 5) . The AUC is similar to values obtained with hippocampal grading while CCR is slightly lower."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we showed that using hippocampal grading for early prognosis exhibited higher classification accuracy than hippocampal volume with a gain of 14.4pp. This result on the Bdx-3C population is in line with our previous results obtained on the ADNI dataset with subjects who converted to AD in 18.24 months on average (11), where we obtained 71% correct classification using hippocampal grade (p<0.0001) and 62% correct classification using hippocampal volume (p=0.0007).\nRecently, we showed that combination of hippocampal grading with cortical thickness could improve classification accuracy (33) . We also showed that performing gray matter grading over the entire brain could even improve this rate to 75.6% at the expense of a more complex framework requiring automatic ROI selection (34) . A very recent independent study on the ADNI dataset confirmed these previous results and\nshowed that hippocampal grading provides higher AD prognosis accuracy than current state-of-the-art MRI-based methods (35) . Here, our results support the hypothesis that, although hippocampal volume has been found to be an efficient imaging biomarker on subjects close to AD diagnosis (9, 36), hippocampal volume loss is not sufficiently sensitive to enable automatic classification at a very early preclinical stage of the disease. The use of more sophisticated measures of the neurodegenerative process impacting hippocampal structure, such as the pathological pattern recognition method used here, appears to be crucial for the identification of an early presymptomatic phase of AD 7 years before conversion to AD. Even with the relatively crude feature of averaging over the entire hippocampus we obtain decent predictions. As Figure 3 indicates, some regions of the hippocampus seem more sensitive to the pathology. Therefore, more advanced grading-based features estimation (e.g., using hippocampal sub-fields segmentation)\nhold promises of even higher prediction accuracies. Finally, advanced approaches based on machine learning (35, (37) (38) (39) have recently demonstrated high performances. The combination of patch-based and learning-based strategies (e.g.,\ndeep learning) appears to be a good candidate to further improve early AD detection. In our study, imaging biomarkers exhibited higher classification accuracy than global cognitive status, reflected by MMSE scores. In accordance, hippocampal volume has been shown to be a more efficient predictor of AD conversion than a large number of cognitive tests in the ADNI dataset for subjects close to AD diagnosis (36). However, when using subjects with longer follow-up (43) or amnesic subjects (44), cognitive tests seem to provide better predictive accuracy. Here, on the Bdx-3C dataset, hippocampal biomarkers were better than MMSE 7 years before conversion to AD. In this paper, we also adapted our hippocampal grading framework to clinical score estimation. We showed that image-based MMSE prediction could provide better prognostic accuracy than clinical MMSE scores. It is interesting to note that using a binary variable (i.e., clinical status) or discrete score (i.e., MMSE) as training inputs yielded similar AUCs but slightly lower accuracy when using MMSE. These similar results were expected since clinical status is partially based on MMSE scores and thus are highly correlated. However, MMSE score provides a finer definition of pathology degree and thus should in theory have produced higher accuracy. The expected advantage of using this richer value than a simple binary status might be reduced by noise in MMSE measurements obtained by cognitive testing and by the fact that the diagnosis is based on more than just MMSE. Further works should investigate longitudinal aspect of clinical score prediction as done in (31) .\nIn the present work, we used an external dataset as training library (i.e. the ADNI dataset) to estimate hippocampal grade on the Bdx-3C dataset. The superior results\nobtained using hippocampal grade demonstrate the robustness of the proposed preprocessing pipeline to multi-site and multi-sequence datasets. Moreover, the possibility of using a large freely available dataset to train our pathological pattern recognition method highlights the clinical potential of such an approach. Finally, our study gives support to the hypothesis that North American and European populations share similar atrophic patterns caused by AD as discussed in (45) .\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting an automatic MRIbased prognosis method that enables AD prediction 7 years before conversion to AD. First, we proposed a new computer-aided prognosis method based on latest advances in image processing. Then, we demonstrated the highest prognosis accuracy provided by hippocampal grading compared to hippocampal volume. At present, hippocampal volume is considered as state-of-the-art MRI-based biomarker for diagnostic criteria and clinical trial (46) . To ensure that subjects were in presymptomatic phase, we used a dataset with a follow-up period of 12 years.\nCompared to previous studies investigating new biomarkers for AD prediction on shorter periods (47, 48) , the very long follow-up used here enables to really evaluate the clinical potential of the proposed imaging biomarkers. The high accuracy obtained with the proposed hippocampal imaging-biomarker paves the way to the automatic identification of elderly subjects with high risk to develop AD. is repeated for all the voxels of the subject under study over the hippocampus to obtain the final grading map. In this example the Bdx-3C subject under study is a cCN subject. Purple arrows symbolize the similarity between anatomical patterns. Dark purple indicates high anatomical patterns similarity and light purple indicates low similarity. For the anatomical pattern under study in this example derived from a cCN subject, more similar anatomical patterns are found in AD population and their weights (similarities) are higher. In the grading map, when the voxel color is blue, this indicates that the anatomical pattern surrounding this voxel is more similar to anatomical patterns found in the CN training subjects and thus that the local anatomy is closer to anatomies of healthy subjects (i.e. CN-like anatomical pattern).\nWhen the voxel color is green, this indicates that the anatomical pattern is equally similar to anatomical pattern found in the CN and the AD training subjects. Finally, when the voxel color is red, this indicates that the local anatomy contains alterations typical of the AD population "}]
