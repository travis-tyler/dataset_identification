[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Work readiness has been discussed in the literature since the 1980s as economic difficulties and increasing competitiveness of global markets led American manufacturers to reconsider roles, responsibilities, and skills needed of workers (O'Neil, Allred, & Baker, 1992 ; U. S. Department of Education, 1983) . Assessing the work readiness of high school students is important because they tend to be employed in entry-level jobs after graduation and increasingly these jobs require higher skills and knowledge than students may possess (Alvarez, Gillies, & Bradsher, 2003; Lippman & Keith, 2009; National Governors Association, 2010) . This skills differential is important to career technical education (CTE) because CTE has been at the forefront of providing workplace skills training in secondary and postsecondary schools throughout the past century (Scott & Sarkees-Wircenski, 2008) .\nHigh school students were deficient in areas identified as basic skills (writing in English, mathematics, and reading comprehension), as well as applied skills (critical thinking/problem solving, and professionalism/work ethic) in Casner-Lotto and Barrington's (2006) study examining the work readiness of secondary and postsecondary students. Basic skills are those typically associated with academic courses while applied skills identified in this study have long been included in career and technical education curriculum (Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, 2010). The Up to the Challenge report emphasized the importance of career and technical education in providing applied context for high school students' academic skills, as well as preparing them for lifelong learning and increasing their income potential (Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, 2010). The disconnect between applicants' skills and those required by employers has been described in the literature as a skills gap; the difference between skills required of workers for an organization to grow and remain competitive in its' industry and the skills possessed by the organization's workforce (Cornelius, 2011; McNamara, 2009; Symonds, Schwartz, & Ferguson, 2011) . If this situation continues unchecked, graduates' ability to find employment paying self-and family-supporting wages could be compromised.\nHigh schools are now charged with the responsibility of ensuring that graduates are prepared for postsecondary education or the workforce and public policy currently refers to this as college and career readiness. Potential study variables were identified after a review of relevant literature. Gender, race, socioeconomic status, and career and technical education participation appear frequently in work readiness literature associated with high school students (Barnes, 2002; Hall, 2010; Parker, 2011; Reed, Jepsen, & Hill, 2007; Schultz, 2011; Stone, 2007; Stone & Aliaga, 2007; Sugiarti, 2008; and Wall, 2011) . Other factors frequently found in literature related to high school students include the relation between factors such as taking higher levels of mathematics courses, student mobility, absenteeism, socioeconomic status, parttime work status, and students' academic achievement (Bottoms & Carpenter, 2003; Crowley, 2003; Donnelly, 2010; Fleischman, Hopstock, Pelczar, & Shelley, 2010; HOPE Program, 2011; Paik, 2002; Parke, 2006; Parke & Kanyongo, 2012; Rampey, Dion, & Donohue, 2009; Rumberger, 2002; Thompson, Myers, and Oshima, 2011; and Wilcher, 2005) .\nHigh school graduates' readiness for college and work impacts not only their individual outcomes but also directly impacts the communities and states in which they live and work. Communities and states may experience a loss of existing jobs or may lose new business development to areas with higher educational attainment. Employment within the study county has steadily declined since 2004 (Census Bureau, 2011 , consequently, it was extremely important to assess the situation of a sample of Georgia students living in this county. Although prior work readiness research with high school students has focused on gender, race, socioeconomic status, and pathway participation, this study sought to extend and explore relations among variables frequently related to student achievement."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Although it has been discussed in the literature for 30 years, work readiness as a construct lacks a consistent definition. Workplace skills, employability skills, workforce readiness, 21st century skills, and most recently college-and career-readiness are most frequently connected to work-readiness (Harris, 2008; McLarty & Vansickle, 1997; Overtoom, 2000; Saterfiel & McLarty, 1995;  Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), 1991).\nThe conceptual framework for this study is based on O'Neil, Allred, and Baker's (1992) review of five work readiness related reports (Carnevale, Gainer, & Meltzer, 1990; Committee on Science, 1984; Employability Skills Task Force, 1989; New York State Education Department, 1990 ; Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), 1991) and st century skills identified through the collaborative effort of public and private business and education leaders (Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, 2006).\nFour categories of skills including basic academic skills, higher-order thinking skills, interpersonal and teamwork skills, and personal characteristics and attitudes were identified as essential for entry-level workers to be successful in their jobs (work ready) (O'Neil, et al., 1992) . Since that time, the SCANS Commission report continues to be recognized as the leading framework when discussing skills associated with work readiness. The SCANS Commission's work identified competencies and a foundation of skills and personal qualities integral to workers' performance in high-performance workplaces (Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), 1991). The competencies included resources, interpersonal skills, information, systems, and technology, and encompass characteristics used by effective workers to be productive in their jobs. Foundational skills represent basic skills, thinking skills, and personal qualities workers should possess to attain competency at work. Although the competencies and skills identified in the SCANS Report were first reported more than 30 years ago, they continue to provide momentum for current workforce development research, curriculum, and policy development. "}, {"section_title": "Review of Related Literature", "text": "Most work readiness related literature has been descriptive in nature examining the relationship of gender, race, and career technical education pathway participation to students' level scores on ACT, Inc.'s WorkKeys \u00ae assessments (Barnes, 2002; Hall, 2010; Parker, 2011; Reed, Jepsen, & Hill, 2007; Schultz, 2011; Stone, 2007; Stone & Aliaga, 2007; Sugiarti, 2008; and Wall, 2011) . Student achievement related literature included demographic variables but also examined the effects of taking higher-level mathematics courses, student mobility, and absenteeism on student achievement (Bottoms & Carpenter, 2003; Crowley, 2003; Donnelly, 2010 , Fleischman et al, 2010 HOPE Program, 2011; Paik, 2002; Parke, 2006; Parke & Kanyongo, 2012; Rampey, Dion, & Donohue, 2009; Rumberger, 2002; Thompson, Myers, and Oshima, 2011; and Wilcher, 2005) .\nRampey, Dion, and Donohue (2009) reviewed 2008 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results and reported that taking higher level mathematics courses was associated with higher mathematics achievement scores for students between 13-and 17-years old. Specific descriptive information about the students taking higher-level mathematics courses was not discussed in the report. Any academic, social, or other differences that exist between students taking higher-level mathematics courses and those not taking the same level courses would enrich our understanding of this variable and its potential influence on students' work readiness. Highest-level mathematics course is a variable used in the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) test administered by the federal Department of Education. This assessment, also known as \"The Nation's Report Card,\" is conducted at least every two years in schools throughout the U.S. Participation in the NAEP is voluntary; however, states receiving Title 1 funds are required to participate in the assessment. Bottoms and Carpenter (2003) examined mathematics achievement of 2,400-plus eighth graders and 1,900-plus high school seniors from rural schools to determine students' level of mathematics achievement and the relationship of mathematics achievement to course-taking patterns. The authors found that students' mean score was at the Basic level while high school seniors were at risk of falling below the Basic level of proficiency. Students who had taken a semester or more of algebra during middle school scored significantly higher than those who did not. Additionally, students taking one or more mathematics courses below college-preparatory Algebra I tended to have lower mathematics achievement than students taking higher-level mathematics courses. Parke and Kanyongo (2012) analyzed data for the 2004-2005 school year from 80 elementary, middle, and high schools in an urban Ohio school district. Students' mobility and attendance were examined for their influence on mathematics and reading achievement. Study results indicated negligible differences between attendees and ethnicity, but the Black subgroup was slightly more mobile than the White subgroup. When controlling for SES, the White subgroup had a higher percentage of its' population in the stable attendance category than did the Black subgroup. Statistically significant effects were found between attendance-mobility and mathematics achievement scores. Donnelly (2010) sought to determine if reading and mathematics scores were different based on levels of student mobility. Differences were also examined among socioeconomic status and attendance groups. Study participants were all 9th grade students enrolled in a Tennessee high school that had taken the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) with complete record information for all study factors. Study results indicated that students with higher levels of student mobility, absenteeism, and lower socioeconomic status had lower reading and mathematics achievement scores on the TCAP. Engec (2006) studied the effects of student mobility on participants' Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores using data available for Louisiana kindergarten through twelfth-grade students in the 1998-1999 school year. Study results demonstrated statistically significant differences between students who were non-mobile and their mobile peers. As mobility increased, students' performance on the ITBS decreased.\nIn an article investigating the residential mobility of poor families and children, Crowley (2003) noted that children who moved most frequently tended to be from families with lower socioeconomic status and were members of racial minorities. Moves for these families were most often due to external factors, not parental choice. External factors might include family disruption, divorce, death, eviction, or others that can be associated with negative stress. Academic achievement is typically adversely affected for children experiencing frequent moves due to these factors.\nIn their review of the 2009 Program for International Assessment (PISA) results, Fleischman, Hopstock, Pelczar, and Shelly (2010) examined the relationship of the socioeconomic status of schools in the U.S. and students' reading literacy. The sample included students from 165 randomly selected public and private schools. Study results found that the average PISA scores for U. S. schools with free-or reduced price lunch participation rate of 50 to 75% were lower than U.S. schools with higher socioeconomic status. Schools in the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) countries also outscored the lower SES study schools in the U.S.\nFoote (1997) studied 214 Tennessee high school seniors who were enrolled in vocational education courses and who took the WorkKeys \u00ae test in the spring of 1996. The study sought to determine if significant differences existed between applied mathematics, reading for information, and locating information scores and participant's gender, race, part-time job experience, and socioeconomic status. Study results found significantly higher applied mathematics scores for males than females, and White participants scored significantly higher than Black participants on applied mathematics and reading for information tests. Statistically significant differences were not found for participants based on socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among certain personal characteristics (socioeconomic status, higher-level mathematics courses, absenteeism, and student mobility) of high school seniors in a Middle Georgia county and their work readiness. The research objectives for this study were to examine the relationships among SES, higher-level mathematics courses, absenteeism, and student mobility and participants' scale scores on each of the applied mathematics, reading for information, and locating information sections of ACT's WorkKeys \u00ae assessment.\nPrevious studies using WorkKeys \u00ae had focused on descriptive demographic variables. This study sought to broaden the scope of potential factors contributing to work readiness and examined factors related to student achievement. The predictor variables used in this study were selected based on their relationship to student achievement (Burkham, Lee, & Dwyer, 2009; Fleischman, Hopstick, Pelczar, & Shelley, 2010) . The criterion variable of work readiness was defined as the combination of technical, employability, and academic skills necessary for occupations offering opportunities for advancement that pay family-sustaining wages (Association for Career and Technical Education, 2010). Work readiness was quantified using participants' scale scores on the applied mathematics, reading for information, and locating information sections of ACT's WorkKeys \u00ae assessment."}, {"section_title": "Method Participants", "text": "A total of 476 seniors representing a population of 498 seniors in the county participated in this study. Three students were absent on the test administration day and did not makeup the test. Nineteen students attended the county's alternative high school during the 2010-2011 school year and were not included in this study. Students at the alternative high school are there to work toward graduation but are behind their cohorts academically. Table 1 contains a comparison of participants' race and socioeconomic status to that of high school seniors within the study county's Regional Education Service Agency (RESA) district and the state of Georgia. The RESA district is comprised of schools from eight contiguous counties in the state of Georgia. Data for all high school seniors throughout the state were gathered using adequate yearly progress (AYP) reports from the Georgia Department of Education's website (Georgia Department of Education, 2011). Participants were compared with students representing the counties in the RESA district (not including the study county) and the state of Georgia to determine if any similarities existed between the groups (Georgia Department of Education, 2011). Socioeconomic status for this study was categorized based on students' participation in the free and reduced price lunch program. A review of these data indicates that racial makeup of study participants was not unlike 2010-2011 high school seniors from the remaining counties in the RESA district or Georgia high school seniors. A comparison of participants reported as economically disadvantaged revealed that the study county had a higher economically disadvantaged population of high school seniors for the 2010-2011 school year than the remaining counties in the RESA district or the state. Correlation coefficients were calculated to determine whether the components of the sample were significantly correlated with the population. Using data from Table 1 above, the calculations in Table 2 show that correlations range from .949 to .989, with \u03b1 \u2264 .01. All sample components were significantly correlated with those of the population.

Scale score information (criterion variables) for individual participants was obtained from the school system's copy of the WorkKeys \u00ae score report and predictor variables were obtained from school system instructional technology personnel by queries to the student data base system. The data was compiled in an Excel spreadsheet to be used for this study. All data vectors were available for each study participant; there was no missing data so the usable sample was 476 participants.\nData were exported from an Excel spreadsheet and into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 for analysis. This analysis used descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis (MRA). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the relationships among the predictor and criterion variables using SPSS version 20. MRA was appropriate for this analysis because the study sought to examine the strength and direction of variable relations and it indicates the relative importance of the different predictor variables. The descriptive statistics included frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Assumptions necessary for appropriate analysis with multiple regression were checked and no violations were found.\nSocioeconomic status was coded based on whether a student participated in the free or reduced price lunch program. Data for highest-level mathematics course included courses taught inside the study county as well as those courses students had taken out of county (while enrolled in other schools). School system personnel were consulted to provide a rank ordering of the mathematics courses so that it was possible to determine the highest-level mathematics course taken by each participant. Absenteeism was measured by the number of class periods a student was absent because this is how it is measured by the school system. During the 2010-2011 school year students were on a six-period day schedule.

It came about during the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to a growing realization that economic conditions in the U.S. and around the world were changing due to rapid technology advances. The competencies, skills, and personal qualities presented in the SCANS Report and measured in this study with WorkKeys \u00ae provide the foundation for the findings shown below.\nFrequencies and percentages for study participants across economically disadvantaged status, and highest-level mathematics course passed are presented in Table 7 . An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests. The work readiness of high school seniors was studied using three separate multiple regression models. Applied mathematics scale score was the criterion variable in the first model, reading for information in the second model, and locating information in the third model. Each model included socioeconomic status, highest-level mathematics course, absenteeism, and student mobility as the predictor variables. Assumptions necessary for multiple regression were tested and no violations were found. Table 8 summarizes the descriptive statistics for the criterion and predictor variables. Locating information had the highest mean scale score of the three criterion variables (78.62), followed by reading for information (78.28), and applied mathematics (77.17). Additionally, participants were slightly more likely to be members of the lower socioeconomic status group, have taken at least Math 3, been absent just under 64 class periods, and to have moved less than one time since their initial enrollment in high school. Correlations among the predictor variables and applied mathematics are shown in Table  9 . Results indicated positive and significant correlations between socioeconomic status and highest-level mathematics course and applied mathematics. Students from families with higher socioeconomic status and students that had taken higher-level mathematics courses scored higher on the applied mathematics assessment. Absenteeism and student mobility were significantly negatively correlated with applied mathematics, which indicated lower scores for students with higher rates of absenteeism and household moves after initial high school enrollment. Correlations between the predictor variables and reading for information, shown in Table  10 , indicated positive and significant correlations between socioeconomic status and highestlevel mathematics course and reading for information. Indications were that students from families with higher socioeconomic status and those who had taken higher-level mathematics courses had higher reading for information assessment scores. Absenteeism and student mobility were significantly negatively correlated with applied mathematics, which indicated that students with higher absenteeism levels and number of household moves after initial high school enrollment scored lower on the reading for information assessment.

A note of caution here is that the data set in this study only measured socioeconomic status as either low or high (coded as 1 and 2 respectively).

Students taking higher levels of high school mathematics courses generally have higher mathematics achievement scores (Bottoms & Carpenter, 2003; Rampey, Dion, & Donohoe, 2009 ). This study supports the previous findings that students taking higher-level high school mathematics courses have higher mathematics achievement scores. However, potential factors influencing students' participation in higherlevel mathematics courses were not addressed in the NAEP report. It may be that students enrolled in higher-level mathematics courses have academic, social, or other differences that support their ability to successfully complete those courses. It is possible that those differences may contribute to students' higher work readiness scores. Of interest, was the significant and unexpected relationship found between highest-level mathematics course and students' scores on the reading for information and locating information assessments. It would seem that knowledge and practices learned in high school mathematics courses contribute to the processing and problem-solving skills needed to score well on this type of test. Reading and graphical interpretation skills are necessary in high-school level mathematics courses and these skills are also measured in WorkKeys \u00ae . It appears from the results of this study that taking higher-level mathematics courses may continue to be important but more detailed investigation into the differences between students enrolled in higher-level mathematics courses and those not enrolled is needed."}, {"section_title": "Absenteeism and Student Mobility", "text": "Absenteeism and student mobility have been found to be problematic with high school students in several studies (Donnelly, 2010; Hinz, Kapp, & Snapp, 2003; Parke & Kanyongo, 2012; Wilcher (2005) . Higher absentee and mobility levels are negatively related to students' reading and mathematics achievement scores. Results from this study supported the significant negative relationship between absenteeism and student mobility and a participants' achievement (measured in this study by applied mathematics, reading for information, and locating information scale scores). No statistically significant relationship was found among absenteeism and any of the criterion variables. Student mobility was significantly related to the criterion variable locating information but not to applied mathematics and reading for information. A review of the beta weights indicates a very small amount of variance in the dependent variables is explained by either absenteeism or student mobility.\nMean absences for students ranged from 63.25 (reading for information) to 64.63 (locating information). The highest number of absences during high school in the study sample was 369 class periods absent (equates to 61.5 days of school missed over a 4-year period), and the lowest number of absences reported was zero (perfect attendance).

One hundred eight of the 460 participants (23.4%) moved one or more times during high school while the remainder did not change schools during their high school career.

Although study results indicate that completion of higher-level mathematics explained the largest portion of variance for the three test areas, caution should be used before prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution. Increasing the number and rigor of mathematics classes alone does not necessarily improve students' enrollment, engagement, or success in higher-level mathematics courses. Research points to several factors with the potential to positively influence students' mathematics scores, notably increasing opportunities for students to use mathematics in authentic ways through career and technical education classes (Bottoms & Carpenter, 2003; Stone, Alfeld, & Pearson, 2008) . Stone and Alliaga (2007) contend that improving the availability and quality of high school career and technical education should be a focus of public education because these courses provide content and context enabling students to meld their interests with rigorous academic skills needed for a successful transition to work and postsecondary education.\nThe impact of higher levels of high school mathematics courses on participant's work readiness scores was a significant finding in this study. Participant's composite scale scores increased with each successive mathematics course they took. Based on study results, students' continued involvement in higher levels of mathematics courses seems to be an important factor in their academic achievement and integration of rigorous academics within career and technical education courses provides an authentic work context for student learning (Bottoms & Carpenter, 2003; Stone & Alliaga, 2007) . It is hoped that the results of this study can be used to develop intervention strategies aimed at improving high school students' work readiness. Intervention strategies based on improving academic achievement in reading and mathematics are important for students of all ages. Even though mathematics courses are required during all four years of high school in Georgia, it seems prudent to suggest that educators continue to provide relevance and real world application to aid student engagement and that supports be in place to help students whose mathematics skills may not be at grade level. Educators should continue to build a solid foundation in students' mathematics skills, but more importantly the relevance and importance of these skills through integration with career and technical education classes needs to be communicated to parents and students. Buy-in from parents and students is crucial to the success of any initiative aimed at student improvement. Administrators, faculty, and staff should be involved in implementing strategies aimed at increasing familial communication, and providing parents strategies and training to support student learning at home.\nPotential confounding variables were examined during the literature review; however, post-study analysis revealed two variables, prior academic achievement and reading achievement, were inadvertently overlooked. It is possible that inclusion of these variables would have substantively enriched the results of this study. The inclusion of other predictor variables discovered but not used during this study might prove useful in future research. This study used archival data that limited the selection of variables to those available at the time participants took the assessments. However, future researchers could use additional variables associated with work readiness or academic achievement including prior achievement, reading achievement, student motivation, student's satisfaction with their educational environment, GPA, parent's highest level of education, 8 th -grade achievement scores, and work status of high school students. It would also be interesting to examine the relationship between teacher education levels, preparation methods, and attitudinal issues and the work readiness/academic achievement of students.\n2. 59 3. 73 (Correct) 4. 230 5. 294 Table 4 .
