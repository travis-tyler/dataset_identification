The collection of blood is inexpensive, noninvasive, and a more feasible measure for use in the general population, especially if serial collection is needed. Neurofilament light (NfL) is a recognized biomarker of subcortical large-caliber axonal degeneration.\n1,2 CSF and plasma NfL levels are elevated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, 3, 4 frontotemporal dementia, 5 multiple sclerosis, 6 and traumatic brain injury. 7, 8 Although the NfL elevation is lower in AD dementia compared to other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia), 9, 10 NfL is hypothesized to be a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration. Indeed, among participants who are either cognitively unimpaired (CU) or have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the longitudinal relationship between plasma or CSF NfL and cognitive or imaging measures of neurodegeneration are independent of elevated brain amyloid. 3, 4 To date, longitudinal studies of NfL across the AD clinical spectrum have focused on either CSF or plasma and have not compared the effect sizes for change in neuroimaging or cognitive measures. Thus, it is not known how similarly plasma NfL reflects the prognostic value of CSF NfL for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

Participants were a median age of 76 years, 52 (66%) were men, and 15 (19%) had a clinical diagnosis of MCI. At baseline, plasma NfL levels increased with increasing age (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.588, p < 0.001) and were higher in those with hypertension compared to without (median 49.2 vs 36.0 pg/mL, p = 0.022). However, NfL levels did not differ by sex, education, APOE \u025b4 genotype, or diabetes. The 15 MCI participants had higher plasma NfL levels compared to the 64 CU participants (median 50.8 vs 42.2 pg/mL, p = 0.181), but the results were not significant. Similarly, baseline CSF NfL levels increased with increasing age (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.363, p = 0.001) but levels did not differ by sex, education, MCI diagnosis, APOE \u025b4 genotype, hypertension, or diabetes. There was a moderate correlation between plasma and CSF NfL (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.568, p < 0.001). The strength of this correlation did not differ by age (<75 vs \u2265 75 years).\nThe cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between baseline z log-transformed plasma or CSF NfL and neuroimaging and cognitive measures are shown in table 2 and the figure, A. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, and education, there were no significant cross-sectional associations between baseline plasma (table 2) or baseline CSF (table 3) NfL and baseline neuroimaging or cognitive measures. Longitudinally, higher levels of baseline plasma NfL were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with declines in hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, FDG-PET, corpus callosum FA, and global cognitive z score. Baseline plasma NfL was not associated with change in amyloid PET. By comparison, although the coefficients for all longitudinal associations between baseline CSF NfL and either neuroimaging or cognitive outcomes were similar and not statistically different, baseline CSF NfL was only significantly associated with declines in cortical thickness and corpus callosum FA. In additional analyses, we restricted the sample to the 64 CU participants at baseline (figure, B) or to the 62 participants with a 30-month follow-up (figure, C) and the results remained the same.\nAll 79 participants had a repeat blood draw and plasma NfL measure 15 or 30 months later, concurrent with their followup neuroimaging measure. The median (interquartile range) of plasma NfL increased from 46.8 pg/mL (32.7, 70.7) to 58.8 pg/mL (39.6, 77.4) over the follow-up; the median increase did not differ by baseline diagnosis. Table 4 shows the association between change in log plasma NfL and change in the neuroimaging or cognitive measures after adjustment for baseline log plasma NfL, age, sex, education, and time between visits. Increasing levels of log plasma NfL over the short follow-up were associated with increasing levels of log amyloid PET ( "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present study, we examined and compared the effect sizes of baseline plasma and baseline CSF NfL levels for shortterm (15 to 30 months) change in neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes. We found that baseline plasma and baseline CSF NfL were similarly associated with short-term declines in imaging measures of neurodegeneration and with global cognition, but not with change in amyloid ligand retention on PET. We also found that an increase in plasma NfL levels over the short follow-up was associated with significant declines in both attention and global z scores and an increase in amyloid ligand retention on PET. These results suggest that plasma NfL is a useful marker for the short-term prognosis of nonspecific neurodegenerative and cognitive changes.\nWe did not find a cross-sectional association between either plasma or CSF NfL and any neuroimaging or cognitive measure. Although plasma and CSF NfL levels were higher in the MCI participants compared to CU, they were also not significantly different. In Alzheimer's Dementia Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cross-sectional data with a larger sample size, patients with MCI had significantly higher plasma NfL levels compared to CU. However, notably, there was not a cross-sectional association between plasma NfL and cognition when analyses were restricted to the CU group. 3 This finding is in line with the current results because the majority of our participants were CU at baseline.\nPrevious longitudinal studies have shown that either plasma or CSF NfL is a prognostic marker for change in cognition and imaging measures of neurodegeneration or white matter integrity, independent of elevated brain amyloid. 3, 4, 26 Our longitudinal results, showing that both plasma NfL and CSF NfL are associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, are consistent with these findings. In addition, our observed correlation between plasma and CSF NfL (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.568) was similar to the correlation found in the ADNI (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.590), but lower than what has been reported in, for example, multiple sclerosis, where there is a greater range of concentrations in relation to disease activity. 8 Despite the consistently observed prognostic value of baseline plasma or CSF NfL for change in cognitive and imaging measures, few studies have compared their effect sizes. Only one cross-sectional study of ADNI patients reported that plasma and CSF NfL similarly correlated with the same regions of cortical and subcortical thickness, but the effect sizes were not compared. 27 Because CSF NfL is a more direct measure of subcortical axon degeneration than plasma NfL, we would have hypothesized that CSF NfL is more strongly associated with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes than plasma NfL. Instead, we found more statistically significant associations for plasma NfL compared to CSF NfL for neuroimaging or cognitive outcomes. However, although there were more statistically significant associations for plasma NfL, the effect sizes were similar to CSF NfL and not statistically different. There are a few explanations as to why we may have obtained these results. First, we used different assays for plasma and CSF because of the difference in concentrations between the 2 mediums. Thus, it is possible that there was more variability or other differences in the CSF assay compared to the plasma assay. Second, our sample size was small, which could have led to false-positive findings with respect to plasma NfL and false-negative findings with respect to CSF NfL. Additional longitudinal studies with concurrent measures of baseline CSF and plasma NfL and larger sample sizes are needed to validate our finding. Finally, it is possible that CSF and plasma NfL may be differentially altered over the course of clinical progression, similar to the observation that CSF amyloid-\u03b242 is thought to change earlier than amyloid PET. Serial assessments of both plasma and CSF NfL are needed to determine whether the markers differentially change in relation to clinical progression.\nCross-sectional studies show that both plasma and CSF NfL increase with age, 3,4,26 which we also replicated in the current study. Longitudinally, plasma NfL levels intraindividually increased over the 15-to 30-month follow-up. The quantitative increase did not differ by baseline cognitive status (CU vs MCI), but the sample size was small, the time period was short, and there were very few clinical transitions (CU to MCI or MCI to dementia). Notably, increasing levels of plasma NfL were significantly associated with declines in both attention and global cognitive z scores, even over the short follow-up. These results suggest that plasma NfL may track with cognitive decline. If this finding is replicated, plasma NfL could be utilized as a clinical trial endpoint or marker of disease progression for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, we also found that increasing plasma NfL was significantly associated with increasing amyloid PET over the short follow-up. This was a bit surprising given that NfL is thought to be a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration. Although not statistically significant (p = 0.07), increases in plasma NfL were also associated with declines in hippocampal volume and cortical thickness over the short follow-up. Thus, it is possible that the observed relationship with amyloid PET is reflecting ongoing AD-associated neurodegeneration. A larger sample size is needed to better Strengths of the study include the community-based population with concurrent plasma and CSF NfL and neuroimaging. There are, however, some limitations. First, although the current study is the largest study to date examining serial plasma and neuroimaging data, the overall sample size was small and larger studies are needed. Second, the time between consecutive visits with imaging and plasma NfL was 15 or 30 months, a period in which little cognitive or brain neuroimaging changes may occur in participants without dementia. Regardless, even though the follow-up was short, we still found that change in plasma NfL was associated with worsening in cognition and amyloid PET.\nOur results suggest that elevated plasma NfL is a prognostic marker of cognitive decline and imaging measures of neurodegeneration and has similar effect sizes to CSF NfL. Change in plasma NfL also tracked with short-term cognitive change, and may be a potential marker of disease progression. Plasma NfL is more clinically suitable than CSF NfL, more feasible at the population level for serial measures to assess disease progression, and similarly represents neurodegenerative and cognitive changes. Future studies will need to determine whether plasma NfL tracks with cognitive or imaging changes across the clinical spectrum or is a better measure in either the early or later clinical phases of the disease."}, {"section_title": "Study funding", "text": "This study was supported by funding from the NIH/ National Institute on Aging grants U01 AG006786, R01 AG011378, R01 AG041851, R01 AG049704, and R01 AG034676.
