Traditional augmentation strategies are severely limited, especially in tasks where the images follow strict standards, as is the case in medical datasets. Experiments conducted on the ADNI dataset prove that augmentation through GANs outperforms traditional methods by a large margin, based both on the validation accuracy and the models' generalization capability on a holdout test set. Although traditional data augmentation did not seem to aid the classification process in any way, by adding GAN-based augmentation an increase of 11.68% in accuracy was achieved. Furthermore, by combining traditional with GAN-based augmentation schemes, even higher accuracies can be reached.\nKonidaris, F., Tagaris, T., Sdraka, M. and Stafylopatis, A. Generative Adversarial Networks as an Advanced Data Augmentation Technique for MRI Data."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Over the past years, there has been a rapid development in the field of Computer Vision, especially through techniques involving Deep Learning. A trend has emerged, where models achieving state-of-the-art performances are becoming deeper and more complex. An explanation might be that the most important benchmark each new Deep Neural Network must pass is the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILVRC) (Russakovsky et al., 2015) , which requires the models to be trained on an immensely large dataset (i.e. millions of images). However, performance on this challenge does not always translate well to real world applications, as they rarely include such a large dataset.\nTraining a deep model on insufficient data usually results in overfitting, because a model of high capacity is capable of \"memorizing\" the training set. Multiple methods have been shown to alleviate this problem, but none so effectively to be used exclusively. These techniques can be split into two broad categories: regularization techniques, aiming to limit the model's capacity (e.g. dropout, parameter norm penalties) and data augmentation techniques, attempting to increase the size of the dataset (Kuka\u010dka et al., 2018) . In practice, most models benefit from a mul-Github repo: https://github.com/filippos1994/Gan mri aug titude of these techniques. This study mostly focuses on the latter category.\nData augmentation has proven to be very effective and is adopted universally in the field of deep learning, e.g. (Ciresan et al., 2010) , (Vasconcelos and Vasconcelos, 2017) . It is in fact so effective that it is being used even in tasks that involve large amounts of data (Wu et al., 2015) . The most common forms of augmentation include horizontal and vertical flips, affine transformations (e.g. scaling, translating, rotating), brightness/contrast adjustments and filter applications (e.g. blurring, sharpening). The goal of such transformations is to obtain a new image that contains the same semantic information as the original.\nWhile augmentation most certainly helps neural networks learn and generalize more effectively, it also has its drawbacks. In most cases, augmentation techniques are limited to minor changes on an image, as more \"heavy\" augmentations might damage the image's semantic content. Furthermore, the forms of augmentation one can use differ from problem to problem, making their application ad-hoc and empirical. For instance, medical images have to be mildly augmented as they follow strict standards (i.e. they are centered, their orientation and intensity vary little from image to image and many times they are laterally/horizontally asymmetric) (Hussain et al., 2017) . Finally, augmentation techniques are applied on one image at a time and thus are unable to gather any information from the rest of the dataset. This paper proposes a novel technique that overcomes said limitations and is capable of augmenting any given dataset with realistic, high-quality images generated from scratch.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are a family of unsupervised neural networks most commonly used for image generation. Each GAN is composed of two networks: a generator and a discriminator, competing against each other in a two-player minimax game. These models have proven to be capable of creating realistic images and will serve as the basis of this study."}, {"section_title": "RELATED WORK", "text": "Generative Adversarial Networks have been successfully used in the past for data augmentation. For example, (Antoniou et al., 2017) and (Wang et al., 2018) use custom GAN architectures in a low-data setting achieving consistently better results than traditionally augmented classifiers, while (Perez and Wang, 2017 ) devise a novel pipeline called Neural Augmentation which, through style transfer techniques, aims at generating images of different styles, performing equally as good as traditional augmentation schemes in a subsequent classification task. Additionally, (Neff, 2018 ) proposes a generative model which learns to produce pairs of images and their respective segmentation masks in order to assist a U-Net segmentation model, proving that in simpler datasets networks trained with a mix of synthetic and real images stay competitive with networks trained on strictly real data using standard data augmentation.\nOne field in which data augmentation is especially important is that of medical imaging, where the lack of available public data is a ubiquitous problem since access to individual medical records is heavily protected by legislation and appropriate consent must be given. In most cases this process is hindered by bureaucracy and/or high costs, while the resulting collection is greatly imbalanced towards normal subjects. Several authors employ Machine Learning techniques to learn directly from the available data and surpass the state-of-the art in problems as diverse as generating benchmark data, image normalization, super resolution, or cross-modality synthesis (Frangi et al., 2018) .\nThe medical field has only recently started adopting GAN-based methodologies for synthesizing images (Yi et al., 2018) . In particular (Bentaieb and Hamarneh, 2018) and (Shaban et al., 2018) propose GAN-based style transfer approaches to stain nor-malization in histopathology images, with quite interesting results in various datasets. For tackling segmentation tasks, various authors have proposed custom GAN architectures and pipelines which are adversarially trained to produce proper segmentation masks from a given medical image dataset (Shin et al., 2018) , (Dai et al., 2017) , (Xue et al., 2017) . Regarding image translation between modes, (Dar et al., 2018) synthesize T2-weighted brain MRI images from T1-weighted ones, and vice versa, using a Conditional GAN model. Finally, many authors, such as (Frid-Adar et al., 2018) and (Costa et al., 2018) , have attempted to generate counterfeit medical images in order to increase the size of the training set of different deep learning models, a task more closely related to the one examined in this paper.\nSupplementary to all of the above efforts, our approach aims to exploit the superior performance of GANs for the benefit of medical image classification. We explore the impact of GAN-assisted data augmentation on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease through non-invasive MRI scans and our critic is a robust CNN model designed to classify among Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls."}, {"section_title": "GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS", "text": "A Generative Adversarial Network is composed of two networks, the generator and the discriminator. The generator accepts a noise vector as input and produces fake data, which are then fed, along with real ones, to the discriminator, whose goal is to distinguish which distribution the samples originate from. Conversely, the generator's goal is to learn the real distribution without witnessing it, in order to make its output indistinguishable from real samples. Both networks are trained simultaneously and adversarially, until an equilibrium is reached. In order to combat instability issues during training, the Earth Mover's or Wasserstein distance was used, partially because it leads to convergence for a much broader set of distributions, but mostly because its value is directly correlated to the quality of the generated data. . The resulting formulation of the game is presented in eq. (1), where D is the set of 1-Lipschitz functions.\nThe discriminator's 1-Lipschitz constraint was initially achieved by clipping its weights by an arbitrary value (WGAN). It was later shown that this technique led to sub-optimal behaviour, which could be ameliorated with the inclusion of a gradient penalty term to the discriminator's loss function, as shown in eq. (2), calculated on a random interpolation point between the real and the fake samples (Px) (Gulrajani et al., 2017) .

To achieve this, a framework was designed where a single GAN was trained on each of the classes.

Following the input is a Fully Connected (FC) layer with 6 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 512 = 15360 neurons. The output of the FC layer is then transformed into a 3D volume, which can be thought of as a 6 \u00d7 5 image with 512 channels. The subsequent layers are regular 2D convolutions (Conv) and 2D transposed convolutions (Conv trans up), sometimes referred to as \"deconvolution\" layers. A 5 \u00d7 5 sized kernel and 'same' padding were selected for both types of layers, while a stride of 2 was selected for the transposed convolutions. This results in the doubling of the spatial dimensions of its input.\nAll layers apart from the last are activated by a \"Leaky ReLU\" function. The final layer has a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function, because its output needs to be bounded in order to be able to output an image. A tanh function was preferred over a sigmoid function because it is centered around 0, which helps during training (LeCun et al., 1998) .\nFinally, after five alternations of convolution and transposed convolution layers (each of which doubles Input (128) Dense (6 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 512) Conv trans up (512) Conv (256) Conv trans up (256) Conv (128) Conv trans up (128) Conv (64) Conv trans up (64) Conv (32) Conv trans up (32) Conv (1) Input (128) FC (6 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 512) Conv trans up (512) Conv (256) Conv trans up (256) Conv (128) Conv trans up (128) Conv (64) Conv trans up (64) Conv (32) Conv trans up (32) Conv (1 the size of its input), an image with a resolution of (6 \u00b7 2 5 \u00d7 5 \u00b7 2 5 ) = (192 \u00d7 160) and 1 channel is produced."}, {"section_title": "Discriminator", "text": "The discriminator is a regular CNN architecture aimed towards binary classification.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that results in loss of memory and mental function (thinking, planning, judgment) caused by the permanent deactivation of neuronal synapses. It is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the most common cause of dementia among people over the age of 65, yet no prevention methods or cures have been discovered (Alzheimer's Association, 2018).\nThe ADNI was launched in 2003 as a publicprivate partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has grown to include data from over 300 patients with AD, over 850 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and over 350 normal control subjects (NC)."}, {"section_title": "Patient Selection", "text": "In our study we selected a subset of the ADNI image data which only included scans of normal (NC) and AD patients, ignoring MCI subjects to aim for the highest variance between classes.

Table 1 shows the distribution of images (and patients) among classes.\nWe should note here that in our initial experiments we randomly shuffled and split all images without preserving each patient's sequences; this allowed the models to identify key features in each subject's head's morphology and achieve a perfect score on the test set (i.e. for each test set image, the model had been trained on another from the same patient).

While the model without dropout clearly outperformed the others, its use was re-evaluated during this experiment, as the regularization effect might be beneficial on not so ideal data.\nWhile augmentation usually improves a model's performance, in the present experiment it did not, apparent by the fact that not a single model reached the baseline set by the previous experiment. One explanation could be that MR images have a very strict format. Even the mildest augmentation strategies proved counter-productive for the classification task.

Most importantly, they increase the accuracy of the models without impacting their convergence.\nThe main question that arises is why does traditional data augmentation seem to work on the composite and not on the original data. A possible explanation would be that, even though the original dataset is an acceptable 50, 000 images, these were obtained from a mere 220 subjects. This results in the dataset having a low variance regarding the shapes and forms of the heads depicted in the images (i.e. the same patient will produce similar images from visit to visit). Traditional augmentation strategies would either heavily alter each image, confusing the model or, in our case, be so subtle that it simply won't improve its performance. The images introduced by GANs however don't correspond to a real patient, so each image's characteristics are unique to the dataset, increasing its variance, and thus possibly giving meaning to traditional augmentation techniques."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper presents a novel methodology for data augmentation with the use of Generative Adversarial Net-works. It involves training a GAN for each of the classes of the original dataset and then using it to produce a number of synthetic images.\nThe use of a powerful generative model for producing images has many advantages over traditional augmentation schemes. The most important are the quality of the produced images and the capability of generalizing beyond the limits of the original dataset to produce new patterns. The proposed technique is especially useful in low-variance datasets where the images follow a very strict format.\nTo study the impact of this augmentation strategy, four experiments were conducted. First, a CNN architecture was trained on a large dataset to form a baseline (I). Afterwards the same model was trained with traditional (II) and the proposed GAN augmentation technique (III). Finally, the use of both forms of augmentation on the same dataset was examined (IV). The models were trained on MR images from the ADNI dataset to classify patients with AD from NC subjects.\nThe models trained with the proposed GAN augmentation methodology (III) outperform the ones with a traditional one (II) by a large margin. In fact, because of the nature of the images, the traditional techniques offered no improvement over the baseline experiment (I). The final experiment, which combined both forms of augmentation (IV) outperformed the rest, showing that while traditional augmentation could not function on its own, it synergizes well with GAN augmentation.\nBecause of the success of the present experiment, multiple future research directions could be spawned. An obvious choice is to experiment with different architectures for further improvements on the data quality, either within the WGAN-GP framework by utilizing a more powerful discriminator, or by using a newer, more sophisticated framework that leads to improved experimental performance, such as the Auxiliary Classifier GANs by (Odena et al., 2016) or the Progressive Growing GANs by (Karras et al., 2017) .\nA different research direction is to use GANs as a way to improve performance on imbalanced datasets. Instead of discarding surplus data or repeating the same images, a GAN could be trained on the least populous classes and then generate synthetic data. If trained correctly, there could be a non-trivial increase in performance."}]
