[{"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Estonian Genome Center, the University of Tartu, Cohort\nThe Estonian Genome Center, the University of Tartu (EGCUT), cohort is a population biobank containing 5% of the Estonian adult population. 10 Samples have been collected in all 15 Estonian counties and diverse social groups by 454 general practitioners (corresponding to 56% of practioners registered to the Estonian Health Board). The age, sex, and geographical distribution of the 52 000 participants closely reflect those of the Estonian adult population. The detailed description of the Estonian cohort was previously published. 10 At baseline, general practitioners performed a standardized objective examination of the participants and filled out a questionnaire that included more than 1000 health-and lifestylerelated questions, as well as provided the diagnoses of diseases present in the medical history of the participating individual using the format of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 10 (see details in eMethods of the Supplement). The data are continuously updated through periodic linking to national electronic health registries. The wide range of phenotypes, ages, and social groups makes the cohort ideally suited to population-based studies. For details on EGCUT cohort phenotype data (see eFigure 1 and the eMethods section in the Supplement). The Estonian Genome Center is conducted according to the Estonian Human Genes Research Act and is managed in conformity with the International Organization for Standardization ISO 9001:2008. The ethics review committee on Human Research of the University of Tartu approved the project. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants for the baseline and follow-up investigations.\nThe relevant phenotype traits of individual carriers of DECIPHER-listed syndromic CNVs in the EGCUT cohort (eTable 1 in the Supplement) were obtained from the baseline questionnaire and compared with the reviewed characteristics of corresponding syndromes (eTable 2 in the Supplement). To further investigate the clinical features of adult carriers not clinically preselected, all 16p11.2 600kb BP4-BP5 (breakpoint) deletion and reciprocal duplication carriers identified in the Estonian cohort were invited back for follow-up investigations. See the Results section for a detailed description and relevant references of this genomic disorder. These CNVs were selected because of their relatively high prevalence and variable phenotype. These carriers were phenotyped using the standardized clinical and neuropsychological protocol that had been developed previously to specifically study patients with the 16p11.2 syndromes who had been ascertained through clinical cohorts. 11, 12 In agreement with the known population prevalence of 16p11.2 600kb BP4-BP5 CNVs, 11 4 deletion carriers (0.05%) and 7 duplication carriers (0.09%) were identified in the Estonian set. The EGCUT cohort (and Estonian population in general) is an outbred population with no substantial regional or ethnic differences. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns are similar to those found in populations with European ancestry. 13 We did not find small series of nonrecurrent CNVs or inflation of recurrent rearrangements typical of founder effects 14, 15 (eMethods in the Supplement). Accordingly, EGCUT samples have been successfully used to discover or replicate hundreds of SNP associations, which are vulnerable to population frequencies and stratification differences [16] [17] [18] (see eMethods and eFigure 2 in the Supplement for details on the Estonian population makeup and stratification)."}, {"section_title": "CNV Calling", "text": "The genomic DNA of 8110 individuals (7020 for the discovery and 1090 for the replication cohorts; eTable 3 in the Supplement), randomly selected among the 52 000 EGCUT participants, was subjected to CNV analysis.

Due to the recruitment criteria that required participants to provide sufficient and consistent information in an advanced sleeping pattern-related questionnaire and a regular work schedule over a survey period of 6 months, the high-functioning replication cohort was biased toward higher than average sociocognitive functioning (eMethods in the Supplement).

In the current analyses, only a single random individual was selected for inclusion in analyses in order to create a data set of unrelated participants (n = 2390, eTable 3 in the Supplement). The collection, genotyping, and analysis of DNA samples for both studies were approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board's Human Subjects Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants; parents provided written informed consent for their minor children. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina 660W-Quad array. Whole blood extracted DNA samples were only analyzed if the participant was white non-Hispanic and the standard deviation of the GC-corrected 33 autosomal log R ratios was less than 0.20. The CNVs were called using PennCNV and then processed and filtered. Adjacent CNVs were merged if they had the same copy number and if the number of markers in the intervening gap was less than 20% of the number of total markers spanning the called CNVs.

Within a combined discovery and replication sample of 7877 unrelated individuals, 56 carriers (0.7%) of known recurrent autosomal genomic disorders were identified (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Although the prevalence of each genomic disorder is lower than previously reported in clinical cohorts, 36,37 it is only slightly lower than the 67 individuals expected according to the reported population prevalence of the 57 autosomal syndromes listed in the DECIPHER database of genomic disorders 9 (eTable 2, eTable 5, and eMethods in the Supplement). The EGCUT cohort is depleted (6 observed carriers of 17 expected, OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.11-0.94; P = .03) of the most deleterious CNVs (graded 1-2 by DECIPHER), whereas the frequency of CNVs graded 3 and ungraded is as expected (50 of 50; OR, 1; CI 95%, 0.66-1.51; P > .99).\nThe clinical features of the EGCUT carriers of DECIPHERlisted CNVs are comparable with those reported in disease cohorts. Thirty-one of 56 (55%; including only formal diagnosis) and 39 of 56 (70%; including self-reported problems) carriers recruited from the general population with no prior awareness of their genetic disorder present phenotypes previously associated with their genomic lesion in the literature (see eTable 1 for the phenotypes identified in the 56 EGCUT carriers and eTable 2 for phenotypes associated with DECIPHER-listed CNVs in the Supplement). For example, carriers of the 16p11.2 600kb BP4-BP5 deletions and reciprocal duplications identified in clinical cohorts show opposite phenotypes on body weight, head size, and volume of specific corticostriatal structures. They exhibit reduced FSIQ, as well as neuropsychiatric problems and congenital abnormalities. 11, 12, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Correspondingly, the baseline questionnaires of the 4 deletion (case Nos. 41-44 in eTable 1 in the Supplement) and 7 duplication (Nos. 45-51) carriers identified in the EGCUT cohort indicated high and low body mass indexes, respectively, neuropsychiatric traits, and learning and developmental problems.

The underrepresentation of those with deletions compared with those with duplications (P = 2.2e-16) is consistent with previous reports and concordant with the hypothesis that the former are more deleterious. 1, 14 We found evidence for an association between carrier status and prevalence of intellectual disability. Twenty-three individuals, equal to a 3.2% prevalence, were diagnosed with intellectual disability in the rare CNV carriers group vs 114 intellectual disability diagnoses ( The diagnosis of intellectual disability is binary. Thus, to assess the effects of rare CNVs with greater granularity, we investigated whether their occurrence and size are related to achieved educational levels, a proxy for global cognition. 45, 46 For this purpose, we used the scale of 7 sublevels of the Estonian education curriculum (eMethods in the Supplement). Although 1729 individuals (25.3%) sampled in the Estonian cohort did not complete secondary school (level 4; MEA, 4.09; 95% CI, 4.07-4.12), which was similar to the at-large Estonian population, 10 Figure) . The EGCUT ancestry principal components are not associated with CNV burden (eFigure 2 in the Supplement), suggesting that genetic stratification is likely not confounding the association with educational attainment. Likewise, differences in educational achievement possibilities due to religion or ethnicity was not likely to account for the observed associations, as the surveys of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment and Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies showed that the \"free education for all\" Estonian system is among the best in the world in terms of results and equal opportunity (eMethods in the Supplement)."}, {"section_title": "Estonian Replication", "text": "A replication of the education analysis was conducted on a nonoverlapping random set of 1058 unrelated EGCUT individuals recruited similarly (eTable 3 in the Supplement) but sampled at a different time point and genotyped using a different array platform.

Mean education attainment in English language and mathematics was lower in those who carried large duplications (\u22651 Mb; P = .020 and P = .049, respectively, Welch 2-sided t test). These results support the association between educational attainment and rare CNVs using a different education metrics in a geographically distinct and differently ascertained cohort of adolescents. Larger CNV size was associated with the odds of individuals belonging to the lowest tertile of SATs score for both English language and mathematics (eTable 4 in the Supplement The educational attainment decreases with copy number variation (CNV) size. See Table 2 for statistically significant differences between groups. Educational levels are coded according to the Estonian education curriculum (eMethods in the Supplement). Table 3 ). These results were followed up in 2 separate cohorts of healthy individuals with normal cognitive functioning (eMethods in the Supplement). Consistent with this ascertainment, both the Italian and Minnesota cohorts suggested a paucity of DECIPHER-listed CNVs (1 observed vs 4 expected; P = .37; OR, 0.25; CI 95%, 0.005-2.53) among the Italian cohort and (14 vs 20; P = .39; OR, 0.7; 95%, CI; 0.32-1.46) among the Minnesota cohort (eTable 2).

The reduction of MEA is greater in female carriers than in the male carriers (\u0394 MEA, \u22120.42 for females and \u22120.02 for males; Figure) . Specifically, the female carriers of the 250 kb \u2264 CNV <500 kb deletion had an MEA of 3.71 (95% CI, 3.50-3.92) compared with an MEA of 4.13 (95% CI, 4.09-4.16; P = 3e-04) in EGCUT females.

These results are likely to be underestimated through exclusion of the most severely affected patients, inclusion of patients with CNVs known to have no effect on cognition and incorrect inclusion of carriers of large somatic or tumorigenic genomic lesions.\nThe link between impaired cognitive functioning and lower academic achievement in CNV carriers parallels the recognized correlation between health and education. 48 This health-education gradient was postulated to result from the combination of heritable factors impacting both traits, poor early life health that affects learning, and healthrelated behaviors being modulated by education. Although recurrent CNVs conferring risk of autism spectrum disorders or schizophrenia were associated with a decrease in IQ of individuals from the general population 49 17 and only a polygenic model including approximately 300 000 common SNPs genome-wide explained 28% to 29% of variation in general cognition. 54 Even though earlier studies failed to identify common CNVs as major contributors to the above heritabilities, 55-58 the results presented herein suggest that rare structural variants of 250 kb or larger for deletions and 1 Mb or larger for duplications are associated with complex traits such as educational attainment and variance in intelligence in population cohorts. About 2% of the analyzed biobank participants carry a rare CNV of 1 Mb or larger. Even without considering other health problems, a fifth of them appear to be linked with decreased quality of life, for the fraction reaching a secondary educational level is 15% lower when comparing CNV carriers to the general population. This reduction results in an MEA that is half a level lower. If we take into account also the carriers of the smaller intermediate-size CNVs associated with lower educational attainment identified in this report (at least 0.2% of the population) and the highly pathogenic anomalies absent from the EGCUT cohort (0.15%), the quality of life for 1 of 40 people might be negatively affected by rare CNVs. These variants may account for a sizable portion of the heritability of the complex \"educational attainment\" measure. 52 The observed excess of females carrying rare genomic deletions supports the recently described female-biased mutational burden.\n21, 59 Females appear \"protected\" from neurodevelopmental disorders. This potentially allows females to be enrolled in general population cohorts despite the fact that they carry rare CNVs, whereas their male counterparts who likely present more severe phenotypes are excluded from such studies. Consequently and corroboratively, female deletion carriers are responsible for the majority of the signal on educational attainment. Although intellectual disability prevalence was increased with presence of a neurodevelopmental or ohnolog gene in the deleted interval or a high haploinsufficiency score of imbalanced genes, none of the assessed evaluators correctly capture the variation in educational attainment, possibly because they are limited to protein-coding genes. Investigation of the function of the encompassed proteincoding genes revealed that they were enriched for genes involved in neurogenesis, cognition, learning, memory, and behavior. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these rearrangements are rare because they affect genes important for neurodevelopment and thus are rapidly purged from the population.\nAlthough none of the carriers of known syndromic CNVs identified in the EGCUT cohort were previously diagnosed with a genetic disease, many had major clinical problems (eg, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies, neuropathies, neuropsychiatric disturbances, extreme obesity, and reproductive problems). Because the latter are most likely caused by the newly found genetic alterations, it suggests that these individuals have escaped the attention of the medical genetics system and thus far have not received proper examination and counseling.\nWe acknowledge several study limitations. Because this is an observational study, no causal inferences can be drawn and confounding bias due to another causal factor could not be excluded. Although caution is required in using educational attainment as a proxy for intellectual function, the confirmatory results obtained with SATs scores and FSIQ in geographically distinct cohorts mitigate this concern. Some of the results show borderline statistical significance, which can be explained by the fact that rare CNVs by definition translate to a small number of carriers. The investigation of the population variance of a complex trait such as educational attainment requires extremely large phenotyped data sets to reach sufficient power."}]
