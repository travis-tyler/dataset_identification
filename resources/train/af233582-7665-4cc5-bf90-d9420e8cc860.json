Methods: We included healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia patients from Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed subject classification consistency with different biomarker combinations and the agreement and correlation between biomarkers. Results: Subject classification discordance ranged from 12.2% to 44.5% in the whole sample; 17.3%-46.4% in healthy controls; 11.9%-46.5% in mild cognitive impairment, and 1%-35.7% in dementia patients. Amyloid, but not neurodegeneration biomarkers, showed good agreement both in the whole sample and in the clinical subgroups. Amyloid biomarkers were correlated in the whole sample, but not along the Alzheimer's disease continuum (as defined by a positive amyloid positron emission tomography). Neurodegeneration biomarkers were poorly correlated both in the whole sample and along the Alzheimer's disease continuum. The relationship between biomarkers was stagedependent. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the current A/T/N classification system does not achieve the required consistency to be used in the clinical setting. \nAlzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; Magnetic resonance; Positron emission tomography; Classification systems; Diagnosis\nThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.

Accordingly, modern clinical and research criteria have integrated biomarkers for the in-vivo identification of the AD pathophysiological state [4] [5] [6] [7] . Biomarkers can be divided into two main modalities: neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and can also be subdivided according to their specificity for different pathophysiological categories including: cerebral amyloid deposition, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration [8] .\nCurrent diagnostic recommendations consider the information provided by a growing number of biomarkers. Consequently, biomarker-based classification systems have been proposed to integrate the information provided by the different sets of biomarkers. Specifically, the A/T/N system has been recently proposed to dichotomize the biomarker results from three different pathophysiological categories (cerebral amyloid deposition [A] , tau pathology [T] , and neurodegeneration [N] ). While some classification systems consider the individual clinical status [4, 5, 7, 9] , others such as the A/T/N system are proposed to be applicable across all clinical diagnostic stages independent of cognitive status [10] . This approach provides an integrative framework for AD research and cognitive aging.\nHowever, the operationalization of biomarker-based classification systems poses challenges before it can be applied in clinical practice. Foremost, subject classification at the individual level must be consistent across biomarker modalities and be faithful to the pathophysiology. Hence, the consistency of biomarker-based classification systems will essentially rely on a good agreement between biomarkers belonging to the same pathophysiological category. Nonetheless, we have previously shown in a study in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that the selection of biomarkers may be determinant for the individual subject classification [11] .\nDespite significant previous efforts [12] [13] [14] , a systematic appraisal of the agreement between the biomarkers related to each of the pathophysiological categories of the A/T/N system had not been conducted. In this study, we used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) multimodal biomarker data to evaluate for the first time: (i) the consistency of available biomarkers for subject classification within the A/T/N system; and (ii) the agreement and correlation across these biomarkers along the AD continuum."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

We calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient (for raw values) and the Cohen's Kappa index (for dichotomous classification) to test agreement between biomarkers. The kappa index provides a reliable measure of chance-corrected classification between different measures. We also explored if threshold adjustment could have the potential to improve the agreement.

In the whole sample, the percent of misclassification varied from 12.5% to 34.3% when only one biomarker was replaced, to 39.6%-44.5% when two of the three biomarkers where modified. As shown in Fig. 1B -D, similar results were observed when restricting the analyses to the cognitively healthy, MCI, and dementia groups, respectively. We then restricted the analysis to the subgroup of patients with a positive FBP PET. In this subgroup, the correlation between CSF Ab1-42 and FBP PET was low (Rho 5 20.30, P ,.001). However, we found a decreasing magnitude of correlation between both measures along the AD continuum from asymptomatic at risk for AD (Rho 5 20.48, P , .001) to prodromal AD (Rho 5 20.31, P , .001) and no significant correlation in the AD dementia group (Fig. 3A) .

We then assessed the correlations between neurodegeneration biomarkers in each clinical group. In HC, no significant correlations were found within the neurodegeneration biomarkers. In MCI patients, aHV was correlated with both cortical thinning within the AD MRI cortical signature and the FDG PET hypometabolism (Rho 5 0.52, P , .001 and Rho 5 0.37, P , .05, respectively) and the FDG PET also correlated with the cortical AD signature (and Rho 5 0.42, P , .05).

First, to the best of our knowledge, our article is the first to assess the consistency and reproducibility of the A/T/N classification system and gives a clear vision of the limitations of its empirical application (i.e., lack of reproducibility). The observed inconsistencies in the individual subject classification were derived from insufficient agreement between biomarkers within the different pathophysiological categories. Second, this is the first article to prove that the agreement between biomarkers related to the same pathophysiological category cannot be improved with the modification of biomarker cutoffs. Third, we highlight the existence of dynamic correlations between biomarkers along the AD continuum (i.e., different correlations in the different stages of the AD continuum). Finally, we show that the agreement between p-tau and t-tau could be significantly improved by means of cutoff modification.\nWe found inconsistent individual subject classification when using different biomarker combinations in up to 44.5% of the participants. This result shows a limitation associated with the A/T/N classification system, in which biomarkers of different modalities are considered interchangeable. These systems, which are based on the successive dichotomization of biomarkers related to different pathophysiological categories are very sensitive to the lack of agreement between biomarkers ascribed to the same pathophysiological process. Therefore, while the addition of new categories to the classification systems theoretically refines the classifications, this additional complexity, in the absence of high agreement between biomarkers within each category, decreases the consistency of classifications. Thus, a balance between precision (i.e., number of pathophysiological categories) and reproducibility must be found to ensure the generalization of the results.\nAmyloid biomarkers showed the highest agreement in the whole sample and in all clinical groups, but it never exceeded a kappa of 0.8. The correlation between CSF Ab1-42 and FBP PET values was very variable. It was good in the whole sample, in HC and MCI patients, but negligible in dementia patients. Importantly, the correlation between both measures decreased from asymptomatic at risk for AD to prodromal AD and was not significant in the AD dementia group. Both CSF Ab1-42 and amyloid PET have been reported to correlate with fibrillar amyloid deposition [27, 28] , and early studies already emphasized the high agreement and strong correlations between the two [28] [29] [30] . However, despite efforts that attempted to convert CSF Ab1-42 and amyloid PET values [31] , recent studies have suggested a nonlinear correlation between these two biomarkers [32] . We did replicate the good agreement between both amyloid measures, but we expand previous findings by showing that the strong correlations found when merging amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative populations together may be, at least in part, spurious. In the AD continuum, CSF Ab1-42 and amyloid PET values only modestly correlate in the preclinical and early prodromal AD stages. Taken together, these results confirm the utility of both CSF Ab 1-42 and FBP PET as state biomarkers but also reinforce the notion that amyloid biomarkers are not fully interchangeable to quantify the amyloid cerebral burden at the different stages of the disease [33] .\nNeurodegeneration biomarkers showed inadequate agreement and were poorly correlated. Modest correlations between neurodegeneration biomarkers have been reported in previous studies [34] , as recognized in the recently proposed A/T/N classification system [10] . A number of previous studies have assessed the relationship between NOTE. Spearman correlation coefficients are shown above the diagonal. Cohen's Kappa index for each pair of scores are shown below de diagonal; the first line in each box refers to the whole sample (n 5 711), whereas the second line refers to the subset of subjects in the AD continuum (n 5 397; positive FBP PET); *, P , .05; ns, non-significant.\nNOTE. In bold: correlation coefficients and Cohen's Kappa indexes with at least a moderate correlation (Rho . 0.5) or a substantial agreement (k . 0.6), respectively. neuroimaging biomarkers. However, these studies were restricted to a particular clinical stage, and they did not assess the effect of substituting biomarkers within a given category on individual subject classification consistency [35, 36] . Conversely, we found dynamic relationships between neurodegeneration biomarkers along the AD continuum. There were no correlations in the preclinical stage, a stage in which little neurodegeneration is expected to occur, were maximal in the prodromal AD stage, when significant neurodegeneration accumulates, and were lost in the AD dementia stage, when the neurodegenerative load is maximal. The heterogeneity of neurodegenerative changes in the preclinical stage of AD has been underscored in the recently proposed criteria, where \"downstream topographical biomarkers\" are not considered suitable for the definition of the preclinical stage of AD [7] . These results suggest that neurodegeneration biomarkers are not interchangeable to track neurodegeneration.\nIn addition, some important observations regarding neurodegeneration biomarkers should be highlighted. First, CSF t-tau did not correlate with the rest of neurodegeneration biomarkers. Some recent findings may help in the interpretation of this observation. While neuroimaging biomarkers may be informative regarding the cumulative neurodegenerative load (i.e., cortical thickness and metabolism decreases with disease progression), recent longitudinal studies suggest that CSF tau biomarkers may not increase over time, thus limiting their ability to track neurodegeneration over disease course [37, 38] . Second, our two MRI-derived biomarkers where only moderately correlated and showed a moderate agreement in the AD continuum. Of note, the AD cortical signature and the FDG PET showed the highest correlation in the AD continuum and were the two only biomarkers correlated in the AD dementia stage. This finding underlines the importance of considering the topography of the neurodegeneration. Both MRI and FDG PET AD cortical signatures track cortical changes as opposed to the aHV, which is a reflection of medial temporal lobe atrophy [39] . Network-based diagnosis is currently being developed [40] , based on the evidence that large-scale networks are key to understand regional vulnerability in neurodegenerative disorders and to understand clinical heterogeneity [41] . Future classification systems should consider the information contained at the network level.\nThe definition of cutoffs for continuous biomarker measures is crucial both for the development of consistent classification systems and for the reproducibility of findings across cohorts [11] , and significant efforts have been made in this regard, analyzing different methods for defining biomarker positivity [42] . Although we only used one previously validated threshold for positivity, we run several simulations calculating different thresholds that would maximize the agreement between each biomarker combination. By doing that, only the agreement between CSF t-tau and CSF p-tau was relevantly improved. This finding suggests that the studied biomarkers related to the same pathophysiological process will not reach adequate agreement regardless on the method used to define positivity and therefore should not be equated [10] .\nThe relationship between CSF t-tau and CSF p-tau deserves further comment. These two biomarkers are ascribed to different pathophysiological categories in the A/T/N classification system based on the assumption that high p-tau levels are specific of the AD process whereas high t-tau levels are nonspecific [10] . However, we showed that a good agreement could be achieved between these two measures with a modification of the cutoffs and that these biomarkers showed the highest correlation among all biomarkers in the AD continuum. A high correlation between CSF t-tau and p-tau levels has been previously reported in large meta-analysis across different platforms [43] [44] [45] . Furthermore, previous large pathology-proven cohorts have reported similar correlations between the two CSF tau biomarkers and the neurofibrillary tangle load or tau PET [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Further multimodal studies are needed to disentangle the relationship between tau PET and CSF tau biomarkers.\nOur work also showed mild to moderate correlations between biomarkers of different pathophysiological categories. We found that FBP PET (but not CSF Ab1-42) correlated with CSF t-tau and p-tau in the preclinical and prodromal AD stages. Previous studies showed a similar performance of FBP PET and the combination of CSF amyloid and tau and neurodegeneration biomarkers for the prediction of cognitive impairment [51] . These results, together with the aforementioned relationship between t-tau and p-tau, stress that pathophysiological categories should be carefully delimited in the design of classification systems to ensure their ability to track nonoverlapping pathophysiological processes.\nOur results have clinical implications as they are intended to impact the empirical application of biomarker-based classification systems [52] . Researchers and clinicians should be cautious when interpreting multimodal biomarker profiles based on different biomarker combinations. If the robustness of multimodal biomarker profiling is not ensured, we might ascribe incorrect risks to a given individual, which has important implications both in clinical practice and clinical trials [11] . Neurodegeneration biomarkers were the most problematic, especially when comparing neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers. As we have shown in Fig. 4 , it is unlikely that a more precise cutoff definition will allow for the interchange of these biomarkers. However, neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers might provide complementary information. Neuroimaging studies might help in the differentiation of AD endophenotypes with appropriate neurodegenerative signatures accounting for disease heterogeneity [39] .\nThis study has several limitations. First, we could not assess the relationships within the tau pathology category because we only had one biomarker available in that category (p-tau) and tau PET was only available in a much smaller number of participants. However, a recent study showed low correlation and agreement between the two tau measures [50] . Second, while we applied previously validated thresholds, these were derived from different approaches (i.e., pathological cohort as a gold standard or the best cutoff to differentiate HC from AD dementia patients). Third, we specifically calculated a cutoff for the AD signature as following previously published recommendations [42] . Anyway, as previously discussed, the discordances between the studied biomarkers were independent of the cutoff with the exception of p-tau and t-tau.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that there are practical and theoretical problems in the A/T/N classification system that should be addressed to ensure its consistency, reproducibility, and accuracy.
