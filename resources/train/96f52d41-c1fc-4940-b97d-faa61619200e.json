(JNCCN 2007; 5:737-742) The goal of any prostate cancer screening program is to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancers at an early stage when treatment is most likely to be effective. The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening remains controversial and the proportion of clinically significant tumors detected with PSA testing is unknown. Clinical use of PSA testing has led to the increased detection of prostate cancer that is more likely to be organ-confined. Prostate cancers detected with PSA testing are typically more favorable than those detected without the use of PSA. 1 PSA has been shown to improve the positive predictive value of digital rectal examination (DRE) for cancer 25% was shown to detect 95% of cancers while avoiding approximately 20% of unnecessary biopsies. 8 Using percent free PSA to diagnose prostate cancer has been shown to have limited value in preventing unnecessary biopsies among men with total PSA values less than 4.0 ng/mL. 9, 10 Percent free PSA is not typically used to decide whether to perform an initial biopsy. However, certain screening guidelines have used free PSA when considering an initial biopsy with the following cutoffs: when more than 25%, consider deferring biopsy; when more than 10% but 25% or less, consider biopsy; when 10% or less, perform biopsy."}, {"section_title": "Total and Percent Free PSA", "text": "A total PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL has been the historically accepted threshold for recommending prostate biopsy.

Subsequent PSA testing and follow-up depends on the initial PSA result. Men who are at higher risk on screening evaluation (i.e., PSA \u2265 0.6 ng/mL, AfricanAmerican race, or family history of prostate cancer) should undergo annual DRE and PSA testing.

Computer simulations have been used to evaluate competing strategies for PSA screening and cost-effectiveness of alternative screening approaches. 22, 23 Biennial screening with a PSA threshold of more than 4.0 ng/mL was projected to decrease the number of screening events and false-positive tests by nearly 50% compared with annual screening, while retaining approximately 93% of years of life saved. 22 A screening strategy consisting of a PSA test at 40 and 45 years of age, and biennial testing after 50 years of age with a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL also has been shown to use fewer resources and resulted in more lives saved compared with annual PSA testing beginning at age 50."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Screening Intervals", "text": "The ACS, AUA, and NCCN recommend annual PSA screening for all men older than 50 years. 11, 20, 24 Results from longitudinal studies suggest that a screening interval of 2 years for men with PSA levels 2.0 ng/mL or less was unlikely to miss curable prostate cancer. 25 Furthermore, a PSA range from 4.0 to 5.0 ng/mL was acceptable for maintaining the detection of curable prostate cancer in men with a normal DRE. A costeffective screening strategy based on these data would be for biennial PSA testing of men with PSA levels less than 2.0 ng/mL and annual screening of men with PSA levels 2.0 ng/mL or more. 23, 25 Results from biennial PSA screening from the Swedish section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) have shown that PSA testing 2 years after a baseline evaluation was sufficient to detect prostate cancers at a curable stage for men with PSA levels less than 2.0 ng/mL at the initial screen. 26 More frequent screening was recommended for men with a baseline PSA level 2.0 ng/mL or more. Pathologic evaluation of prostate tissue from the ERSPC suggests that most cancers detected between 2 to 4 years after an initial PSA screening remain curable. 27, 28 Age Limits for PSA Screening PSA screening has been generally recommended for men with a life expectancy of at least 10 or more years. The health benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening decline rapidly with advanced age. In fact, many men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years may not even benefit from screening. Most prostate cancers have an indolent course during the first 10 to 15 years, and men diagnosed with non-screen-detected cancers have been shown to rarely die of disease before 15 years without treatment. 29 Results from a prospective cohort of men who had serial PSA measurements from age 60 or 65 years until they were diagnosed with prostate cancer or reached age 75 indicated that if PSA testing were discontinued at age 65 with PSA levels less than 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL, prostate cancer would probably have not been missed. 30 Discontinuing PSA screening by 70 years of age may be appropriate for most men who have undergone regular screening up to that point and who have maintained PSA levels considered to be low-risk. However, an accurate clinical history and examination including concerning signs or symptoms (i.e., abnormal DRE, hematuria) should be taken into consideration. The age at which to discontinue PSA testing remains controversial.\nMost guidelines do not recommend PSA screening in elderly men who have limited life expectancies because the risks of screening are believed to outweigh potential benefits. However, a recent study that examined PSA screening in a large cohort from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities showed that 56% of men older than 70 years underwent PSA testing. 31 PSA screening rates in this population were not found to decrease as much as estimated 10-year survival decreased with advancing age. Furthermore, a large percentage of men classified as having poor health continued to undergo routine PSA testing. 31 This study underscores the need for a critical evaluation of individual health status when making PSA testing and prostate biopsy recommendations."}, {"section_title": "PSA Thresholds", "text": "An age-dependent log-linear relationship has been recognized between prostate volume and serum PSA with an estimated average annual increase of serum PSA ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL in men with benign prostate hyperplasia. 32, 33 African-American men may have higher overall PSA levels than Caucasian men, and race-specific threshold levels have been previously established. The use of age-and racespecific PSA ranges was an early attempt to increase the accuracy of PSA testing for cancer detection (Table 2) . 34, 35 Using a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL regardless of age or race may lead to earlier disease diagnosis and increase the chance for curative intervention, particularly for African-American men because they often have more aggressive disease at presentation. However, a more contemporary understanding of changes in PSA levels over time (PSAV) relative to a baseline value has led to the modification of PSA threshold recommendations in some screening strategies, particularly for men with PSA levels less than 4.0 ng/mL. PSA threshold values as low as 0.6 ng/mL have been established for men between 40 and 45 years of age to determine recommendations for subsequent screening intervals. 11 Prostate biopsy also may be considered for men with PSA levels between 2.6 and 4.0 ng/mL based on changes in PSA levels over a given period. Factors such as age, comorbid conditions, percent free PSA, prostate examination/size, family history of prostate cancer, and African-American race should also be taken into account before deciding whether to proceed with biopsy. Regardless of the PSA threshold chosen, an isolated PSA elevation should be confirmed before proceeding with further testing because of fluctuations in PSA that could represent a falsepositive elevation."}, {"section_title": "36", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PSAV", "text": "PSAV was introduced to improve the diagnostic accuracy of serial PSA measurements for prostate cancer screening and is equivalent to the rate of change in PSA values with repeated measurements over time. 37 PSAV has been reported to be most useful for detecting cancer when calculated over a minimum of 18 months.

Prostate cancer-specific survival was 92% among men with a PSAV equal to or less than 0.35 ng/mL/y and 54% among men with a PSAV more than 0.35 ng/mL/y.

For men with total PSA less than 4.0 ng/mL, data suggest that a PSAV more than 0.35 ng/mL/y indicates the presence of lethal cancer. 41 PSA levels of men who died of prostate cancer were found to increase at an exponential rate 10 to 15 years before diagnosis and were greater than those of both men with prostate cancer who were alive or died of another cause 48% of prostate cancers. 42 A lower PSAV threshold of more than 0.4 ng/mL/y was found to be more predictive of prostate cancer than age, total PSA, family history, or race.

After adjusting for age, PSA level, PSAV, and date of diagnosis, higher risk counts using PSAV thresholds of 0.2 or 0.4 ng/mL/y were significantly associated with the development of high-risk prostate cancer. 43 Risk count assessment may prove to be another useful method for interpreting a PSA history to help identify men who would benefit from prostate cancer diagnosed at PSA levels associated with curable disease."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The widespread use of PSA testing for prostate cancer screening has resulted in significantly increased numbers of cancer diagnoses.
