[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Statins reduce amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in animals and may thereby favorably alter the pathobiology of AD. It is unclear if statins modify A\u03b2 metabolism or improve cognition in asymptomatic middle-aged adults at increased risk for AD. Methods: In a 4-month randomized, double-blind, controlled study, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin 40 mg daily vs. placebo on CSF A\u03b242 levels and cognition in 57 asymptomatic middle-aged adult children of persons with AD. Results: Compared to placebo, individuals randomized to simvastatin for 4 months had similar changes in CSF A\u03b242 (p = 0.344) and total tau levels (p = 0.226), yet greater improvements in some measures of verbal fluency (p = 0.024) and working memory (p = 0.015). APOE4 genotype, gender, and vascular risk factors were associated with CSF biomarker levels, but did not modify treatment effects. Conclusion: In asymptomatic middle-aged adults at increased risk for AD, simvastatin use improved selected measures of cognitive function without significantly changing CSF A\u03b242 or total tau levels. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of higher dose and/or longer duration statin therapy on not only A\u03b2 metabolism, but also other preclinical processes related to the development of AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating illness that will affect an increasing number of older adults in the coming decades unless effective preventive strategies are developed. Hypercholesterolemia in midlife leads to an increased risk of developing AD later in life and, therefore, has been targeted as a potentially modifiable risk factor for AD [14] . While some observational studies show that use of lipid-lowering agents, specifically statins, is associated with a reduced incidence and prevalence of AD [10, 29, 41] , not all studies support these findings [25, 42] . In animal models, hypercholesterolemia stimulates amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition in the brain [26] , a pathologic hallmark of AD. Statins reduce CSF and brain A\u03b242 levels in animals by 50%, suggesting that statins may modify AD risk by affecting amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) processing [7] . It remains unclear, however, whether statins will effectively lower CSF and brain A\u03b2 levels in humans [12, 28, 31, 32] . Furthermore, the effects of such changes in A\u03b2 levels on cognition are unknown.\nPrevious investigations support the notion that statins may have the greatest benefit when they are targeted earlier in the disease course in high risk populations. Clinical studies to date show that short-term statin therapy (3 to 12 months) may beneficially modify CSF A\u03b2 levels [12, 31, 32] and cognition [33] in persons with mild AD, but are less effective in persons with more advanced disease [31, 33] . Persons carrying the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE4) allele, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, may also have greater cognitive benefit from statin therapy [33] . These findings, together with the fact that it is midlife hypercholesterolemia that contributes to AD risk decades later, suggest that an optimal prevention strategy may be to target statin therapy in a middle-aged, preclinical, at-risk population with high APOE4 allele prevalence. Asymptomatic middle-aged adult children of persons with late-onset AD are ideal to study as their risk for AD is increased not only by their family history (a potential marker of unidentified genetic and/or environmental AD risk factors) [13] , but also by their high prevalence of APOE4 allele [30] .\nOur study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design clinical trial evaluating the effects of four months of simvastatin therapy on CSF A\u03b242 levels and cognition in asymptomatic middle-aged adults with a parental history of AD and high prevalence of APOE4 genotype."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Fifty-seven men and women without cognitive impairment were recruited from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a statewide registry of adult children (ages 40-65 years) of persons with late-onset AD [30] .

At baseline, APOE4 allele carriers had similar demographic and vascular risk factor characteristics to non-carriers (data not shown, all p-values > 0.2).

Baseline CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau values were lower in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers, but APOE4 genotype did not affect changes in CSF biomarkers or response to therapy. While individual vascular risk factors did not significantly influence CSF A\u03b242 or T-tau levels in this study, gender interacted with BMI and TC to predict baseline CSF biomarker levels and changes in biomarkers, independent of therapeutic effects. These novel, preliminary data in a unique group of at-risk adults may help guide future research investigating the effects of vascular risk factor modification on preclinical processes related to the risk of developing AD.\nStatin effects on A\u03b2 metabolism and cognition may be significantly influenced by the targeted study population. Persons with preexisting AD may be too far along in the disease process to reverse the cascade of neuronal degeneration and healthy controls at average risk for AD may not benefit from such therapies in the presence of normal A\u03b2PP processing. To date, four other prospective clinical trials have evaluated the effects of statins on CSF A\u03b2 levels [12, 28, 31, 32] ; three of these studies focused on persons with AD [12, 31, 32] and one studied cognitively healthy, hypercholesterolemic adults at average risk for AD [28] . Of the four studies, only one included a control group [31] . Our study differs from previous investigations in that it is larger [12, 28, 31, 32] ,used a randomized placebo-controlled design [12, 28, 32] , measured domain-specific cognitive outcomes [12, 28, 31, 32] , and focused on a preclinical, middle-aged population with increased risk for AD (family history of AD and high APOE4 allele prevalence) [12, 28, 31, 32] . In an uncontrolled study of 19 persons with AD, use of simvastatin 20 mg daily for 3 months was associated with reduced concentrations of CSF \u03b1-and \u03b2-cleaved soluble A\u03b2PP (\u03b1sA\u03b2PP, \u03b2sA\u03b2PP), but not with changes in CSF A\u03b242, T-tau, or phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) [32] . In contrast, a 12-month follow-up trial in 19 AD patients showed an increase in both CSF \u03b1sA\u03b2PP and p-tau following simvastatin therapy, but no effect on \u03b2sA\u03b2PP [12] As this open trial did not have a placebo group, it is unclear how these statin-associated changes compared to CSF changes noted with natural disease progression. In a 26-week randomized controlled clinical trial of 44 persons with AD, simvastatin 80 mg daily reduced CSF A\u03b240 (but not A\u03b242) levels in persons with mild AD, but not in those with more advanced disease, suggesting greater statin effects earlier in the disease process [31] . In an uncontrolled study of 23 hypercholesterolemic subjects without dementia (ages 34-87 years), 14 weeks of simvastatin 40 mg daily was associated with reduced CSF p-tau levels compared to pravastatin 80 mg daily, but not with significant changes in CSF T-tau, A\u03b242, or A\u03b240 [28] . Our study population differs from the study of asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic subjects in that our participants had fairly normal cholesterol levels and were more homogeneous in age and AD risk, potential confounding factors for changes in CSF biomarkers. Together with our find-ings, these studies suggest that future trials should use a randomized controlled design, target high risk asymptomatic adults, and investigate the effects of higher dose and/or longer duration statin therapy on not only A\u03b2 metabolism, but also on other preclinical processes closely related to the development of AD.\nCognitive outcomes from ours and previous trials also suggest that the optimal timing for statin therapy may be in the preclinical or early disease stages, before neurodegeneration becomes irreversible. In addition, findings from ours and other studies support that domain-specific neuropsychological tests may be more sensitive in distinguishing preclinical cognitive benefits in asymptomatic persons at risk for AD compared to global measures of cognitive function. In the three previously discussed CSF studies in AD patients, statin therapy was associated with conflicting results on global cognitive measures (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive Portion [ADAS-cog]) [12, 31, 32] . In a 12-month randomized controlled trial of 63 older adults with AD, Sparks et al. demonstrated that atorvastatin may improve cognition in older adults with AD, with the greatest cognitive benefits noted in APOE4 carriers who are early in their disease course [33] . In a study by Muldoon et al., hypercholesterolemic middleaged adults at average risk for AD were noted to have less improvement in cognition following simvastatin therapy compared to placebo [23] . In contrast, our asymptomatic at-risk participants randomized to simvastatin had improvements in domain-specific tests of verbal fluency, working memory, verbal delayed free recall, and construction tasks. The cognitive domains which improved with statin therapy in our study are similar to those measures noted to decline in asymptomatic middle-aged APOE4 carriers [3] , suggesting that statins may stabilize these vulnerable cognitive domains in this at-risk cohort with high APOE4 prevalence. Our at-risk population may be more sensitive to the beneficial cognitive effects of potential preventive therapies; however, given the modest magnitude of the cognitive changes observed in our study, longer studies are necessary to establish if these differences in cognitive test scores lead to clinically beneficial cognitive changes. Given that cognitive outcomes were an exploratory secondary aim of this trial, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Thus, larger prospective controlled trials of longer duration are needed to confirm our preliminary findings.\nConsistent with our study results, animal and clinical studies support that statins may benefit cognition independently of their effects on A\u03b2 metabolism [16] , possibly through modifying signaling pathways, reducing inflammation, improving cerebral blood flow, and/or via more acute cholinomimetic effects [4] . Thus, some of the positive cognitive changes noted in our study may be due to some of these other unmeasured processes. While some AD-related mechanisms may be more rapidly reversed with statins, others may require longer duration of therapy. Although statins reduce CSF and brain A\u03b2 levels in animals in as short as three weeks [7] , our study may not have been long enough to fully assess simvastatin's impact on CSF A\u03b2 levels. Longer trials are underway investigating pleiotropic effects of statins on cognition and AD-related mechanisms of disease in at-risk adults.\nDespite normal cognitive function in our participants, our findings also suggest that asymptomatic middle-aged APOE4 carriers may already exhibit pathobiological changes in A\u03b2 metabolism compared to APOE4 non-carriers. Persons with AD have lower CSF A\u03b242 and higher CSF T-tau levels than healthy controls [35] , possibly from increased A\u03b2 deposition into amyloid plaques, reduced synthesis of A\u03b2 by dying neurons, and intracellular release of tau into the CSF. In older adults and persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), lower levels of CSF A\u03b242 [1, 6] and higher levels of CSF T-tau predict future risk of dementia [1] . Our findings of lower baseline CSF A\u03b242 levels in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers are consistent with those noted in the BIOCARD study [36] and may suggest increased risk for future cognitive decline. However, we also surprisingly found lower CSF T-tau levels in persons at increased genetic risk for AD (APOE4 carriers) as well as in those participants with lower CSF A\u03b242 levels (suggesting a possible increased risk for disease progression). Our CSF T-tau findings differ from those noted in the BIOCARD study, in which APOE4 carriers and non-carriers had similar mean CSF T-tau values [36] . While the T-tau results were unexpected, the strong association of the CSF T-tau levels with APOE4 status and A\u03b2 levels support that further investigation is needed to clarify the longitudinal changes in CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau levels spanning the preclinical phase of the disease through the development of AD. Based on previously published studies of persons with AD [8, 21] , many participants in our study had combined CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau biomarker levels meeting criteria for AD despite their having normal cognitive function. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate if this combination of biomarkers predict future risk for cognitive decline in an asymptomatic middle-aged at-risk population or if such CSF measures are less accurate in this age group. Findings from large, multicenter trials such as the ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) will help clarify the natural progression of CSF biomarkers throughout the disease course and will establish the best techniques for CSF biomarker collection and analysis to optimize the accuracy of such measures [22] .\nWe also found that increased TC levels and BMI were associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 levels in men, suggesting possible gender differences in the effects of vascular risk factors on AD progression. In general, men have more atherogenic lipid profiles than women, which could explain the gender differences noted in association with CSF A\u03b242 levels; however, we did not find an association between CSF A\u03b242 levels and lipoprotein markers of atherogenicity, including LDL particle number, LDL size, or HDL size. Our findings that gender and BMI interact to affect CSF biomarkers are supported by data showing a link between obesity, gender, inflammation, A\u03b2PP processing, and AD risk [11] . Further investigation is needed into the impact of dyslipidemia, obesity, and gender on the neurobiology of AD."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In asymptomatic middle-aged adults at increased risk for AD, treatment with simvastatin led to similar changes in CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau levels compared to placebo, yet greater improvement in some cognitive measures of verbal fluency, working memory, verbal delayed free recall, and construction tasks. APOE4 genotype and the interaction of gender with BMI and TC levels influenced CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau levels in this group of at-risk adults, but did not affect response to simvastatin. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of higher dose and/or longer duration statin therapy on mechanisms related to the development of AD, including A\u03b2 metabolism, inflammation, and cerebral perfusion. In addition, findings from the present study emphasize the need for future investigations to assess the interactive effects of gender, genetic risk, and vascular biology on preclinical AD biomarkers. Ultimately, large randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to best assess the effects of statins on long-term cognitive outcomes and the development of AD in asymptomatic adults at high risk for the disease."}]
