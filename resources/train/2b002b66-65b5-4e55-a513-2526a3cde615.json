[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Up to 10% of subjects with neurodegenerative dementias have an early onset disease, defined as a clinical onset below 65 years (Garre-Olmo J et al., 2010) . The most frequent cause of early-onset dementia is Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD), usually presenting with progressive anterograde episodic memory impairment. However, non-amnestic clinical presentations, are also commonly seen in early onset AD (EOAD) and frequently overlap with other neurodegenerative dementias such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) leading to greater rates of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay (Balasa M et al., 2011; Mendez MF et al., 2008) . In this context the use of specific biomarkers is crucial in achieving an accurate diagnosis.\nHippocampal atrophy (HA) is a well-recognized feature of AD considered a neurodegeneration biomarker in current NIA-AA diagnostic criteria (Apostolova LG et al., 2006; Sarazin M et al., 2010; Albert MS et al., 2011; McKhann GM et al., 2011) .\nMedial Temporal Atrophy (MTA) visual rating scale is a popular HA evaluation instrument, although its utility in EOAD is still unclear (Scheltens Ph et al., 1992) .\nSince quantitative volumetric analysis is time consuming, semiautomatic methods have been developed. Data regarding its reliability in early symptomatic stages is lacking (Cuingnet R et al., 2011) .\nIn this study we sought to elucidate the differences in HA between LOAD, EOAD and FTD, and compare visual and semiautomatic quantitative assessment diagnostic accuracy.

One hundred forty subjects evaluated at the (Pfeffer RI et al., 1982) . All subjects had a typical AD CSF biomarker profile. So, all EOAD fulfilling the NIA-AA diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD or AD dementia (Albert MS et al., 2011; McKhann GM et al., 2011) . Based on their clinical presentation, EOAD participants were further classified into two subgroups: amnesic (A-EOAD, 38 subjects) and non-amnesic variant (NA-EOAD, 20 subjects).\n2) LOAD group (n=30): All subjects had a typical AD CSF biomarker profile.\nNineteen of them fulfilled the NIA-AA diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD and eleven for AD dementia (Albert MS et al., 2011; McKhann GM et al., 2011) .\n3) FTD group (n=20): Six behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), seven non-fluent variant for primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) and seven semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) (Rascovsky K et al., 2011; Gorno-Tempini A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T three nfvPPA subjects had GRN mutation. All FTD subjects had normal AD CSF biomarkers levels.\nfive-point scale developed and validated by Scheltens et al. and then averaged to obtain a single MTA value for each subject (Scheltens Ph et al., 1992 , Harper et al. 2016 ). An expert radiologist specialized in dementia neuroimaging (N.B.) and a trained neurologist (N.F.) blinded to diagnosis and clinical data, visually assessed MRI images.\n\n\n3.3 Quantitative assessment\n\nThere was a significant moderate inverse correlation (r=-0.537, p<0.001) between MTA score and the quantitative HV evaluation. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare both visual and volumetric assessment in a well-characterized biomarker-confirmed cohort of LOAD, EOAD and FTD patients.\nSince its development, Scheltens' HA visual rating scale has been validated in numerous studies as a good predictor of progression from MCI to AD dementia and to discriminate AD from HC and has also been proved to correlate with volumetric methods (Heo JH et al., 2013; Wahlund LO et al., 2000) . The MTA score has been\nproposed as the best marker of HA and the MTA\u22651.5 cut-off has been recommended to be used for AD diagnosis under the age of 75 ( Van de Pol LA et al., 2014) . In the case of volumetric assessment, it is not clear yet which HV cut off should be used.\nIn our study, MTA was not able to accurately discriminate HC from AD or FTD patients, since specificity and sensitivity did not reach the 80% threshold for any of the groups (Consensus report of the Working Group on: molecular and biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, 1999). The quantitative assessment only achieved a good diagnostic performance in discriminating LOAD and A-EOAD from HC with little discriminative capacity between the other comparisons.\nMost previous studies point to the fact that both visual scales and quantitative analysis are able to discriminate between AD and HC, despite relevant variability in terms of diagnostic performance and they mostly focus on LOAD patients (Heo JH et al., 2014; Cavedo E et al., 2014) . In reference to LOAD, our results are in line with previous publications in terms of sensitivity albeit greater specificity in our cohort. (Harper et al., 2016) This could be explained by the characteristics of our older HC group in whom preclinical AD had been carefully ruled out through the use of CSF biomarkers and an extensive neuropsychological evaluation. In both visual scales and quantitative analysis, the diagnostic accuracy is better in LOAD than EOAD, as well as it is better in A-EOAD than in NA-EOAD. It makes sense, since LOAD patients mostly present amnesic clinical phenotype and have more HA whereas EOAD patients frequently have a non-amnestic clinical profile related to less HA (Balasa M et al., 2011; Koedam EL et al., 2010; Phillips J, 2018) . Poor MTA diagnostic accuracy results on EOAD may be due to the fact we have only included patients in early symptomatic stages (i.e, MCI and\nmild dementia, MMSE\u226520). Is well known that patients in advanced stages of the disease have more HA, thus, in consequence, assessing MTA at these stages could increase its discriminative power; but on the daily clinical practice it is in the early stages of the disease when the differential diagnosis is more complex and it is precisely where biomarkers should be more useful and make the difference. On the other hand, most studies using Scheltens' MTA scale do not have CSF results and the AD diagnosis is based only on clinical criteria (Cuingnet R et al., 2011; Heo JH et al., 2013; Wahlund LO et al., 2000; Van de Pol LA et al., 2014; Duara R et al., 2013; Ferreira D et al., 2015; Varon D et al., 2015; Pereira JB et al., 2014; Shen Q et al., 2011; Ridha BH et al., 2007) . We consider this fact to be a significant caveat since trying to establish AD diagnosis without biological confirmation of the disease can lead to higher rates of misdiagnosis (Beach TG et al., 2010) . Claus et al reported good diagnostic accuracy (83.3% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity) for MTA\u22651 at discriminating 18 EOAD patients from subjective cognitive impairment subjects (Claus JJ et al.,) . Their data does not fit with our results, which could be explained by several methodological differences such as: the use of computerized tomography (CT) scan, the lack of biomarker supported diagnosis, the wide range of clinical severity stages included in the sample and its small size.\nVolumetric assessment is expected to provide an added value in AD diagnosis (Bosco P et al., 2017) . Several techniques have been developed to achieve the most accurate measurement and many comparisons of both tools have been published (Cuingnet R et al., 2011; Heo JH et al., 2013; Wahlund LO et al., 2000; Van de Pol LA et al., 2014; Duara R et al., 2013; Ferreira D et al., 2015; Varon D et al., 2015; Pereira JB et al., 2014; Shen Q et al., 2011) . However, comparing them is difficult because of the heterogeneity of study samples and imaging techniques used. Cuingnet et al. compared \nthe diagnostic performance of different quantitative methods, including volumetric measurement of HV of clinically diagnosed MCI and mild AD patients aged 55-90 (Cuingnet R et al., 2011) . HV evaluation was as sensitive as other methods but however The clinical overlap between NA-EOAD and FTD sometimes leads to differential diagnosis difficulties in clinical practice and highlights the crucial importance of using disease-specific biomarkers (Beach TG et al., 2012) . Unfortunately, in our cohort, neither visual nor quantitative assessment performed optimally at differentiating them.\nIn line with previous studies mostly performed in late-onset cognitive impairment, we observed a moderate correlation between MTA visual rating and volumetric techniques (Dhikav V et al., 2017) . The moderate correlation could be explained because MTA score is based mostly on a single slice while HV is a three-dimensional measure. These data suggest that both techniques may perform in a different way with regard to HV measurements, therefore caution must be taken before considering them equivalent.\nFurthermore, variability through different HV quantification methods has been previously described (Buckner et al. 2004 ). Both approaches implemented in neuGRID, i.e.: HV in template space and total intracranial volume normalization methods, provided similar results. It suggests that HV diagnostic performance is consistent across the two analysis methods. Moreover, in the normalization method, the HV is not biased by extensive cortical atrophy.\nOur results would support the idea that visual MTA rating may play a limited role in the clinical diagnosis of EOAD, in particular in early clinical stages. With regards to volumetric assessment, it would only show an advantage compared to visual rating in discrimination between LOAD and A-EOAD from HC. Current criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD includes HA as a neurodegeneration biomarker (Albert MS et al., 2011; McKhann GM et al., 2011) . In light of our results showing low discriminative capacity of HA between groups, this feature should be interpreted with caution in earlyonset cognitive impairment especially in patients with non-amnestic presentations.\nThe main limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size, although, as far as we are aware this is the larger cohort study focused on EOAD patients reported until now. On the other hand, we have only used one semiautomatic volumetric analysis and it is possible that other volumetric techniques for evaluating HA may show different diagnostic performances.\nto determine the diagnostic utility of HA as a biomarker in the early stages for EOAD patients."}, {"section_title": "4)", "text": "Healthy controls (n=32): with no cognitive complaints, cognitive performance within normative range and normal AD CSF biomarkers.
