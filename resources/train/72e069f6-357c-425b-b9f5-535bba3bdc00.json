[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report analyzes patterns of undergraduate transfer behavior of students who entered postsecondary education during the academic year 1989-90. Data were derived from the spring 1994 follow-up of the 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study. The report notes that attendance at multiple institutions is widespread: at 4-year institutions almost half of beginning students enrolled elsewhere within 5 years, although only 25 percent transferred; and at community colleges, 25 percent were identified as working toward a bachelor's degree. The report data, which are summarized in 9 figures and 28 tables, and the discussion cover the following areas: (1) definition of transfer; (2) the general phenomenon of attendance at multiple institutions; (3) transfer activity in general; (4) transfer from 4-year institutions; (5) transfer from public 2-year to 4-year institutions; and (5) transfer activities, controlling for background. Three appendixes provide reference tables, a glossary, and technical notes and methodology. Transfer from 4-year institutions Among students at 4-year institutions, those with grade point averages (GPAs) below 2.50 at the first institution were more likely than other students to transfer (36 percent transferred, compared with 20-27 percent of students with higher grades). Dissatisfaction with any of the following factors (as reported in 1992) was positively related to transfer from 4-year institutions: intellectual growth, teacher ability, institutional prestige, and social life. Of these factors, students' dissatisfaction with their intellectual growth had a very strong correspondence to transfer: 63 percent of those who were dissatisfied with their intellectual growth at the first institution transferred, compared with 25 percent of students who found their intellectual growth to be satisfactory. At private institutions, students who were dissatisfied with the prestige of the institution were twice as likely to transfer as those who were content with the institution's prestige (54 versus 25 percent). The availability of various student services and students' satisfaction with those services were also related to transfer from 4-year institutions. Those reporting a lack of access to job placement, job counseling, and personal counseling services were much more likely to transfer than were students on campuses where such services were available. Among students who used services such as job placement and academic, personal, and job counseling, satisfaction with the experience was related to their likelihood of transfer. On average, students who transferred from a 4-year institution left 14 months after they began, and took about 7 months off before enrolling at the destination institution. Students who entered another 4-year institution (horizontal transfers) stayed at the first institution longer than did those who entered a less-than-4-year institution (reverse transfers), and they also took less time off before entering the destination institution. Among students who began at a 4-year institution, those who did not transfer were more likely than horizontal transfers to have completed a bachelor's degree by 1994 (63 percent of nontransfers had completed the degree, compared with 45 percent of horizontal transfers). However, if one combines bachelor's degree attainment and current enrollment at a 4-year institution as a broad measure of persistence, the two groups have similar persistence rates. Reverse transfer from a 4-year institution does not always signal a permanent abandonment of bachelor's degree plans: 22 percent of reverse transfers had either completed a bachelor's degree by 1994 or were enrolled at a 4-year institution.

"Percentage distribution of 1989-90 beginning students at public 2-year institutions who transferred according to transfer status, by stated degree goal in 1989-90: 1989-94 Introduction A recent report from the National Center for Education Statistics showed that patterns of student persistence and attainment in postsecondary education look quite different when examined relative to an individual institution versus the postsecondary education system as a whole: many students change institutions before attaining a degree.2 This report extends and elaborates upon those findings, analyzing undergraduate transfer behavior among first-time students in postsecondary education by tracing their attendance patterns from academic year 1989-90, when they first enrolled in postsecondary education, through academic year 1993-94. It uses the most current nationally representative longitudinal data on student progress through postsecondary education, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94). (Refer to appendix C for a detailed description of the BPS data.) This report first provides a general description of attendance at multiple institutions. Next, it provides an overview of transfer activity across the population of beginning students. Two types of transfer are then analyzed in detail: transfer out of 4-year institutions, and transfer from public 2-year institutions to 4-year institutions. Finally, three appendices are included for readers who desire additional information. Appendix A presents percentage distributions of key populations according to level and control of the base year sample institution, and also the distribution of selected student characteristics within each type of institution. Appendix B contains a glossary that provides detailed information about the characteristics presented in the tables. Appendix C describes the data and statistical methods used in the report."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Transfer", "text": "Transfer can be defined as a transition between postsecondary institutions in which the second institution (the destination, or receiving institution) typically grants the student credit for coursework taken at the first institution (the origin, or sending institution). It is normally a oneway transition: students who transfer do not return to the first institution. Thus, temporary enrollment at a second institution, followed by a return to the first, is not normally considered to be a transfer.3 Transfer can be characterized with respect to the level of the origin and destination institutions. Horizontal transfer occurs between institutions at the same level (for example, between 4-year institutions), while vertical transfer involves a change of level (for example, from a 2-year to a 4-year institution). Vertical transfer is sometimes described with respect to the direction of transfer: forward transfer involves movement to a higher level institution, while reverse transfer is movement in the opposite direction. (These may also be referred to as upward and downward transfer.) Since the BPS data do not include information on whether particular 2L. Berkner, S. Cuccaro-Alamin, andA. McCormick, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: 5 Years Later (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). 3See B. Gose, \"Double Dippers,\" Chronicle of Higher Education (August 4, 1995): A27. institutions awarded transfer credit, this aspect of transfer is not reflected in the operational definition of transfer used in this report.4 For this report, the definition of transfer was based solely on the pattern of students' enrollment: any transition from one institution to another that was not followed by a return to the first institution was defined as a transfer.5 In addition, any transition from a less-than-4-year institution to a 4-year institution was considered to be a transfer, even if a student subsequently reenrolled at the first institution. This permits a broad definition of this important kind of vertical transfer in order to capture all possible transfers to 4-year institutions and to avoid inappropriately excluding bona fide transfers who may temporarily reenroll at the first institution.6 Students do not necessarily have to complete an associate's degree to transfer from a 2-year to a 4-year institution. Depending upon a particular institution's or system's transfer admission practices, students may transfer with an associate's degree, a certificate, or without any credential. Consequently, completion of subbaccalaureate credentials was not considered in the operational definition of transfer. However, students who completed a bachelor's degree at their first institution were not eligible for transfer, even if they subsequently enrolled elsewhere. Three types of transitions were thus defined as transfers: 1) A student began at a less-than-4-year institution, left that institution with or without a degree, enrolled at another less-than-4-year institution, and did not return to the first institution; 2) A student began at a less-than-4-year institution, left that institution with or without a degree, and enrolled at a 4-year institution (regardless of subsequent enrollment at the first institution); or 3) A student began at a 4-year institution, left that institution without completing a bachelor's degree, enrolled at another postsecondary institution, and did not return to the first institution. Using this broad definition, certain students who might not normally be considered transfers are included. For example, a student who enrolled at one institution for a semester, left school for an extended period, and then enrolled as a first-year student at a different institution (without transferring any credit for previous work), is classified as a transfer under this definition. Another example is a student who completed a vocational certificate at a less-than -2year institution and subsequently enrolled at a 2-year or 4-year institution. Although such a 4The BPS data do include a more general indication of whether a student transferred credits between any institutions, and this is examined in the descriptive analysis of transfer patterns. 5 Thus it is possible that some students who looked like transfers as of 1994 will later return to the first institution. 6For example, this would include a student who transfers from a 2-year to a 4-year institution but subsequently reenrolls at the first institution to complete additional credits. transition may not involve any transfer of credit, this definition considers students at 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions as equally eligible for transfer. Since the definition of transfer requires that a student cease enrollment at the first institution, concurrent enrollment at two institutions does not constitute a transfer. Should a student who had been concurrently enrolled cease enrollment at the first institution while remaining enrolled at the second, then the transition may qualify as a transfer."}, {"section_title": "Attendance at Multiple Institutions", "text": "Transfer is, in effect, a special case of attendance at more than one institution. To set the context for examining transfer, it is worthwhile to begin by examining the general phenomenon of attendance at multiple institutions and its relationship to transfer."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Of students who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90, almost half (45 percent) had enrolled as undergraduates at more than one institution by 1994. One-third attended two institutions, and 12 percent attended three or more institutions (table 1). Concurrent enrollment at more than one institution was relatively rare: over the 5 years under study, 7 percent of beginning students exhibited such a pattern.? The proportion of students attending more than one institution varied with the type of institution first attended (figure 1). Students who began at public 2-year and public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were equally likely to attend more than one institution, with about half (46-49 percent) doing so (table 1). Two out of three students who began postsecondary education at private, not-for-profit 2-year institutions attended at least one other institution, as did about one out of four students who began at public less-than-2-year institutions and private, for-profit institutions.  Attending multiple institutions was also related to students' educational expectations. Students who said in 1989-90 that they expected to attain a bachelor's degree or higher were twice as likely as those with lower expectations to have attended more than one institution by 1994 (50-54 percent versus 26 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Attainment at First Institution and Transfer by Students Who Attended Multiple Institutions", "text": "Attending more than one institution does not necessarily mean a student left without a degree. An appreciable number of students who attended more than one institution completed a degree at the first institution, before or after enrolling elsewhere (table 2). Of students who began at a 4-year institution and attended more than one institution, about one-quarter (29 percent) received a bachelor's degree from the first institution. For most of these students, the additional enrollment extended, augmented, or was incidental to their bachelor's program at the first institution.8 As noted earlier, transfer is a special case of multiple-institution attendance. That is, a subset of students who attended more than one institution qualify as transfers. This relationship is depicted in table 3, which shows that 60 percent of 4-year beginners who attended more than one institution transferred, as did about 90 percent of students who began at a less-than-4-year institution and attended more than one institution. 8Out of the 29 percent who received a degree from the first institution, 25 percent had attended more than one institution before receiving the degreethat is, they enrolled elsewhere and then returned to the first institution to complete the degree. A small number had further undergraduate enrollment after receiving the bachelor's degree (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1989-90   Whereas the previous section examined students' overall pattern of attendance at more than one institution, this section looks at the subset of multiple-institution attenders whose transition between institutions qualifies as a transfer, as defined at the beginning of this report. Although students may transfer more than once, the following analyses of transfer are restricted to the first transfer. Thirty-five percent of all 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students transferred within 5 years of entering postsecondary education: 18 percent transferred to a 4-year institution, 13 percent to a 2-year institution, and 4 percent to a less-than-2-year institution (table 4)."}, {"section_title": "Origin and Destination of Transfer", "text": "Students' propensity to transfer and the destination of transfer varied somewhat with the type of institution first attended (figure 2). About one out of four students (28 percent) who began at a 4-year institution transferred: 16 percent entered another 4-year institution, and 13 percent entered a less-than-4-year institution, with most of them entering a 2-year institution (table 4). Among students who began at a 2-year institution, 43 percent transferred: 22 percent to a 4-year institution, 15 percent to another 2-year institution, and 5 percent to a less-than-2-year institution. One-quarter of students who began at a less-than-2-year institution transferred: 6 percent to a 4-year institution, 12 percent to a 2-year institution, and 6 percent to another lessthan-2-year institution."}, {"section_title": "9,10", "text": "Transfer was particularly common among students who began postsecondary education at a private, not-for-profit 2-year institution (62 percent).\" Among students who began at a public 2year institution, about two students in five transferred (43 percent) (table 5). Within each type of institution, transfer was related to certain student characteristics. Among students who began postsecondary education at 2-year institutions, the likelihood of transferring was directly related to their stated educational expectations in the first year: students who expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher were two to three times more likely to transfer than those who did not expect to complete at least a bachelor's degree (half of those expecting to complete a bachelor's degree transferred, as did 59 percent of those expecting to complete an advanced degree, compared with 23 percent of those who did not expect to complete at least a bachelor's degree) (table 5). The relationship between students' educational expectations and their socioeconomic background has been well established. Thus, it is not surprising to find a relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and transfer behavior among 2-year college students that corresponds to the findings for educational expectations: 60 percent of high-SES students at 2year colleges transferred, as did 40 percent of middle-SES and 25 percent of low-SES students. 9 Details may not sum to totals due to rounding and the exclusion of students who transferred to an institution of unknown level (see table 4). 10 Students completing a subbaccalaureate credential at the first institution are included among transfers. This group is a very small segmentabout 2 percentof the beginning population, however (appendix A, table Al).  "}, {"section_title": "Timing of Transfer", "text": "In addition to the mere fact of transfer, the timing of transfer is also of interest. First, did students have substantial exposure to the first institution, or leave after just a few months? Examining the duration of enrollment at the first institution provides an indication of the extent of course taking at the first institution and the likely number of credits available for transfer. Second, did the transfer follow an interruption in postsecondary attendance, or did students change institutions without interrupting their educational progress? Examining how much time elapsed between institutions reveals what proportion of students made an uninterrupted transition, and what proportion took time off before resuming their education at a different institution.  ), and less-than-4-year institutions do not award bachelor's degrees. 3Several factors may account for students at 4-year institutions who expect less than a bachelor's degree: some may be working on a subbaccalaureate credential (which some 4-year institutions offer) and not plan to continue their education; some may have decided to leave school before completing a bachelor's degree; and some may lack confidence that they will complete one. "}, {"section_title": "Duration of enrollment at the first institution", "text": "About half of all students who transferred were enrolled at the first institution for up to 10 months; one-quarter were enrolled for 11-20 months; and the remainder (22 percent) spent more than 20 months at the first institution before transferring (table 6). Students who transferred from 2-and 4-year institutions were equally likely to transfer after 10 months or less, with about half doing so. However, transfers from 2-year institutions were more likely than those from other institutions to spend more than 20 months at the first institution before transferring. This may reflect high rates of part-time attendance at 2-year institutions, which slows the rate of credit accumulation.\" Also, there is a high rate of transfer within 10 months from private, for-profit institutions (70 'percent), many of which offer programs lasting 1 academic year or less.\" The amount of time students spent at the first institution was also related to the destination of transfer. Students whO transferred to a 4-year institution were more likely than other transfers to have spent more than 10 months at the first institution. Of students who transferred to a 2-year institution, two out of three left the first institution after 10 months or less, as did 80 percent of transfers to a less-than-2-year institution. Among transfers to a 4-year institution, about one-third (35 percent) left the first institution within 10 months."}, {"section_title": "Time elapsed between institutions", "text": "Of students who transferred, about one-third (32 percent) entered the destination institution within 6 months after leaving the first institution. About half of all transfers (54 percent) were out of school for more than a year before continuing their education (table 7). Some of these students attained a certificate or degree at the first institution, while others interrupted their studies before receiving any credential (attainment prior to transfer is examined below). Students who transferred from a 4-year institution were much more likely than other transfers to enroll at the destination institution within 6 months of leaving the first institution (68 percent did so, compared with 10-18 percent of students who transferred from a less-than-4-year institution). At the other extreme, fully half of students who transferred from a less-than-2-year institution and one-quarter of transfers from a 2-year institution were out of school formore than 3 years, compared with 2 percent of students who transferred from a 4-year institution.\" The amount of time elapsed between institutions was also related to students' educational expectations. Students who said in 1990 that they expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher were more likely than others to make the transition between institutions within 1 year or less. For example, the transition took place within 6 months for 30-42 percent of students who expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with 12 percent of students who had lower degree expectations. I2Beginning students at public 2-year institutions were twice as likely as students at other institutions to be enrolled part time in their first year (appendix A, table A2), and public 2-year institutions enrolled 89 percent of all beginning students at 2-year institutions (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, Second Follow-up [BPS:90/94], Data Analysis System). Statistics, 1995Directory of Postsecondary Institutions (Washington, DC: 1996. The rate of transfer within 10 months from public and private, not-for-profit less-than-2-year institutions was equally high, but the less-than-2-year sector consists mainly of private, for-profit institutions. 14Some of these students completed a subbaccalaureate credential at the first institution (table 8). "}, {"section_title": "I3U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Attainment Prior to Transfer", "text": "Since the definition of transfer used in this report allows for completion of subbaccalaureate credentials at the first institution, it is worthwhile to examine students' attainment before transferring. Overall, four out of five transfers (83 percent) changed institutions before completing any credential (table 8). However, among students who transferred, attainment prior to transfer varied considerably with institutional origin and destination. Almost all transfers from 4-year institutions (97 percent) left without earning any credential. Among transfers from 2-year institutions, 78 percent left without a credential, and almost all of the others (20 percent) completed an associate's degree. About two-thirds of transfers from less-than-2-year institutions left without completing any credential, and the remainder completed a certificate. Differences in attainment before transfer were also related to the level of the destination institution. While transfer before completing any credential was common among all transfers, it was most common among those who transferred to less-than-4-year institutions (89-94 percent of transfers to less-than-4-year institutions did not complete a credential at the first institution, compared with 76 percent of transfers to 4-year institutions). About one out of five transfers to a 4-year institution completed an associate's degree before transferring (21 percent, compared with 1-4 percent of transfers to other institutions). One-third of students who transferred from a less-than-4-year institution to a 4-year institution did so. Certificate completion at the first institution was rare among transfers (4 percent). It occurred more often among those who transferred to a 2-year institution than among transfers to a 4-year institution (7 versus 3 percent). Half of all students who transferred without receiving a credential from the first institution made the transition within 1 year of their departure from the first institution (table 7). Students who received a credential from the first institution were less likely to do so: about one-third of transfers who completed an associate's degree and one-quarter who completed a certificate enrolled at the destination institution within 1 year (table 7)."}, {"section_title": "Transfer From 4-Year Institutions", "text": "Most studies of student transfer behavior focus on transfer from community colleges to 4year institutions, a subject that this report addresses in the following section. There has been relatively little systematic analysis of transfer from 4-year institutions on a national scale, at least in part due to a lack of adequate data that track a nationally representative sample of entering Level of transfer origin and destination 4-year to 4-year 96.9 0.6 2.4 4-year to less than 4-year 97.8 0.7 1.5 Less-than-4-year to 4-year 63.8 3.6 32.6 Less-than-4-year to less-than-4-year students across institutionsa deficiency that the BPS data collection effort was designed to address. This section provides a detailed descriptive analysis of transfer from 4-year institutions, asking the following questions: Who transfers from 4-year institutions? How is transfer related to undergraduate experiences? What kinds of institutions do students transfer to? How is the direction of transfer (horizontal or downward) related to undergraduate experiences? What proportion of transfers received credit at the destination institution for their coursework at the first institution? What enrollment and attainment outcomes were observed for students who transferred from 4-year institutions, and how do they compare with those observed for students who did not transfer? The analysis presented in this section is restricted to students who first attended a public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institution.\" Thus, throughout this section, private, not-for-profit 4year institutions are identified simply as private institutions.\nAt 4-year institutions, transfer was related to academic performance, satisfaction with selected aspects of the institution (particularly its contribution to their intellectual growth), and the availability of and students' satisfaction with certain services (particularly job and personal counseling). Cost also appeared to be a factor in transfer from private institutions, and two out of three students who transferred from private institutions entered public ones. While the bachelor's degree attainment rate was lower among horizontal transfers from 4year institutions than among students who did not transfer, the overall persistence rate was similar for the two groups. The implication of this finding is that horizontal transfer may increase time to degree without undermining persistence. Half of all horizontal transfers left the first institution after 10 months or less. Three-quarters of horizontal transfers entered the destination institution within 6 months of leaving the first institution; one out of eight entered'later, but within a year; and one-eighth took more than a year off between institutions. About half of students who transferred from 4-year institutions were reverse transfers. Of these, about one out of five had returned to another 4-year institution by 1994. Reverse transfer was more common among older beginning students, part-time students, and students who did not receive financial aid from the first institution. Reverse transfer was also more common among students who had low grades in the first year. Transfer From Public 2-Year Colleges to 4-Year Institutions About one-quarter of beginning students at community colleges were identified as prospective transfers: in their first year of college, they explicitly stated that they were working toward a bachelor's degree. Of this group, 39 percent had made a direct transition to a 4-year institution by 1994, and another 6 percent entered a 4-year institution after an intermediate transfer to another subbaccalaureate institution. Community college students who transferred to 4-year institutions had lower rates of bachelor's degree completion relative to those who began in a 4-year institution, but comparable rates of overall persistence toward the bachelor's degree. About one-third of community college transfers to 4-year institutions completed an associate's degree before they transferred. This group was much more likely than those who transferred without any credential to have completed a bachelor's degree by 1994. In contrast with horizontal transfers from 4-year institutions, students who transferred from a community college to a 4-year institution often stopped out for an extended period between institutions. On average, they took almost 2 years off (21'months). Prospective transfers who enrolled full-time in the first year were twice as likely as parttimers to transfer to a 4-year institution within 5 years. Even after controlling for a number of other characteristics in a multivariate model, enrollment status in the first year remains strongly related to the likelihood of transfer within 5 years. Positive values on this variable were also used to indicate the percentage of students who ever transferred during postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Who Transfers From 4-Year Institutions?", "text": "As noted in the overview of transfer, about one-quarter of beginning students at 4-year institutions transferred, and students attending public and private institutions were equally likely to do so. Students' propensity to transfer did not appear to have much to do with their background characteristics. Among the exceptions to this generalization, Asian/Pacific Islanders were half as likely as students from other racialethnic groups to transfer out of the 4-year institution where they began (14 percent, compared with 29-31 percent of others for whom a transfer rate could be estimated) (table 9). Low-SES students were also less likely than others to transfer (20 percent, compared with 29 percent among other students). Although students who received financial aid at the first institution were less likely to transfer than their counterparts who did not receive any aid, the difference in the two groups' transfer rates is small and only exists at public institutions; aided and unaided students at private institutions were equally likely to transfer. This difference probably reflects the lower transfer rate among low-SES students noted above. Middle-and high-SES studentsmany of whom may have received some form of financial aidtransferred at similar rates. 15Very few private 4-year institutions are operated as for-profit enterprises (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1995 Directory of Postsecondary Institutions (Washington, DC: 1996)). Transfer was less common among full-time students than among those who attended part time in their first year (27 percent of full-time students transferred, compared with 39 percent of part-time students)."}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Transfer From 4-Year Institutions", "text": "Why do students transfer from 4-year institutions? For some, transfer may indicate that they are having academic difficulty at the first institution, while for others it may indicate that they are dissatisfied with the institution. These factors may be related, of course: students who are dissatisfied may not be motivated to do well, and students who do poorly may find cause to be dissatisfied. Indeed, students with grade point averages (GPAs) below 2.50 at the first institution were more likely than other students to transfer (36 percent transferred, compared with 20-27 percent of students with higher grades) (table 9). For students with low grades, this may reflect involuntary departure from the first institution. There is also evidence that transfer is related to students' satisfaction with various aspects of the institution where they began postsecondary education, as reported in 1992 (table 10) Students' reported dissatisfaction with intellectual growth had a very strong correspondence to transfer: 63 percent of those who were dissatisfied with their intellectual growth at the first institution transferred, compared with 25 percent of students who found their intellectual growth to be satisfactory. While dissatisfaction with institutional prestige was related to transfer at both public and private institutions, the relationship was stronger at private ones, where students who were dissatisfied with the prestige of the institution were twice as likely to transfer as those who were content with the institution's prestige (54 versus 25 percent). In addition, cost was a factor at private institutions, where the transfer rate was somewhat higher among students who were dissatisfied with the cost of attendance (30 versus 23 percent). When satisfaction with the five attributes represented in figure 3 is combined into an overall index of satisfaction, transfer is found to be more common among students who identified three or fewer attributes as satisfactory (of whom 40 percent transferred) than among students who were satisfied with more than three attributes (24 percent transferred).  The availability of various student services and students' satisfaction with those services were also related to the likelihood of transfer (figure 4). Those reporting a lack of access to job placement, job counseling, and personal counseling services were much more likely to transfer than were students on campuses where such services were available. Students who reported that job and personal counseling were unavailable transferred at about twice the rate of students who had access to those services. Among students who used job placement services and academic, personal, and job counseling services, satisfaction with the experience was associated with their likelihood of transferring (table 10)."}, {"section_title": "Where Did the Transfers Go?", "text": "Among students who transferred from 4-year institutions, about half (55 percent) entered another 4-year institution. The remainder were reverse transfers, entering a less-than-4-year institution. Almost all reverse transfers went to a 2-year institution (table 11). Transfers from private institutions were somewhat more likely than those from public institutions to enter another 4-year institution (61 versus 53 percent). Among transfers, those who started college before age 20 were more likely than older students to enter another 4-year institution (57 versus 39 percent). Horizontal transfer was also more common among full-time students and students who received financial aid at the first institution.  Students who transferred to another 4-year institution tended to gravitate toward public institutions. Two out of three horizontal transfers from private 4-year institutions entered a public institution, as did 82 percent of horizontal transfers from public 4-year institutions (table 12). The pattern of movement from private to public institutions is consistent with the earlier finding of a relationship between transfer and satisfaction with the cost of attendance at private institutions. Horizontal transfer was much more common among students with at least a 2.50 GPA than among students with lower grades (62-77 percent of transfers who had GPAs of at least 2.5 entered another 4-year institution, compared with 45 percent of students who had lower GPAs) (figure 5). Students who entered another 4-year institution had GPAs averaging about 2.6, while reverse transfers had GPAs averaging about 2.0 (table 13). While transfers from public institutions had lower aggregate GPAs than those from private institutions, horizontal transfers from each type of institution had comparable grades. Students who took more than a year off between institutions had lower GPAs than students who entered the destination institution within a year, and this was true for both horizontal and reverse transfers. On average, students who transferred from a 4-year institution left 14 months after they began, and took about 7 months off before enrolling at the destination institution (table 14).17 Horizontal transfers stayed at the first institution longer than did reverse transfers, and they also took less time off before entering the destination institution.   NOTE: There were not enough students who transferred from 4-year to less-than-2-year institutions to produce reliable estimates for any of the statistics reported in this   Although the BPS data do not include information about the transfer of credit between specific institutions, students who had attended more than one institution were asked a general question about transfer of credit in each follow-up survey. For transfers who attended only two institutions,18 this item can be used to assess transfer of credit between institutions. Among horizontal transfers who attended two institutions, 89 percent transferred credits, as did about half of reverse transfers (table 15)  Among students who began at a 4-year institution, those who did not transfer were more likely than those who transferred to another 4-year institution to have completed a bachelor's degree by 1994 (63 percent of nontransfers had completed the degree, compared with 45 percent of horizontal transfers) (table 16). However, if one combines bachelor's degree completers with those currently enrolled at a 4-year institution as a broad indicator of persistence toward the degree (first column in table 16), the two groups have similar persistence rates (figure 6). Reyerse transfer does not always signal permanent abandonment of bachelor's degree plans: 22 percent of reverse transfers had either completed a bachelor's degree by 1994 or were enrolled at a 4-year institution (12 percent had attained the degree, and 11 percent were enrolled).0 Although reverse transfers did not return to the first institution they attended, at least one out of five made a subsequent transition to another 4-year institution. 19Details do not sum to total due to rounding (see table 16). NOTE: There were not enough students who transferred from 4-year to less-than-2-year institutions to produce reliable estimates for any of the statistics reported in this  Public community colleges serve a wide range of educational purposes. One important purpose is to provide a low-cost, flexible means for students working toward a bachelor's degree to complete their lower division requirements before transferring to a 4-year institution to complete the degree. How effectively community colleges fulfill this purpose has been the subject of considerable debate among scholars and policymakers.20 This section uses BPS data to examine the extent of transfer to 4-year institutions by beginning students at public 2-year "}, {"section_title": "Students' Degree Goals", "text": "One difficulty in examining transfer from community colleges is how to identify students who have transfer intentions at the outset. Community college advocates argue that it is inappropriate to include all community college students when calculating transfer rates because many never intend to transfer. In the analysis presented in this section, the population of prospective transfers is defined narrowly, based on students' responses to a base-year question that asked them to specify the degree toward which they were working. This question allowed students to specify any undergraduate degree, including one that they intended to receive at a different institution. One out of four community college students indicated that they were working toward a bachelor's degree (table 17). In examining transfer rates, this report will focus on this group as the population with clear transfer intentions (i.e., prospective transfers).22 When presenting characteristics of students who did, in fact, transfer to a 4-year institution, however, all such students will be included unless noted otherwise. The virtue of this approach to identifying prospective transfers is that it permits a sharp focus on students whose degree goal necessitates transferring to a 4-year institution. However, it also excludes other students who may have had equally strong transfer intentions. For example, there can be little doubt that the group of students who said that they were working on an associate's degree (54 percent of community college beginners) includes two subgroups: those who did not have immediate plans to continue their education beyond an associate's degree, and those who intended to transfer to a 4-year institution after completing an associate's degree. Since these two groups of associate's degree seekers cannot be separated, the only students who can be identified as having clear transfer intentions are those who stated that their courses were leading toward a bachelor's degreea subset of all who intend to transfer.23 This group nevertheless includes students who were formally enrolled in an associate's degree program at the first institution: one-quarter of those classified by the institution as enrolled in an associate's degree program indicated that they were working toward a bachelor's degree (table 17). The relationship between students' immediate degree goals and long-term educational expectations is shown in table 17. Among students who expected that they would ultimately attain a bachelor's degree or higher, about one-third (34 percent) said they were working on a bachelor's degree, and 56 percent said they were working on an associate's degree.24 By contrast, 5 percent of those who expected to attain less than a bachelor's degree said they were 22Another method for identifying the pool of potential transfers that has been promoted, but is not feasible with the BPS data, is based on credit accumulation (see E. Jones, ed., A Model for Deriving the Transfer Rate (Washington, DC: American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, 1992)). While this approach excludes students who enroll only briefly, it still includes students who may never intend to transfer. 23The distinction is further complicated by the fact that some articulation arrangements emphasize completion of an associate's degree for transfer admission, while others do not. In systems that emphasize the associate's degree, students who intend to transfer may be more likely to report that they are working toward an associate's degree. 24It cannot be assumed that all students who expected to attain a bachelor's degree had immediate transfer intentions. working toward one, but they were just as likely as those with higher expectations to be working toward an associate's degree (54 percent).25 Certain community college beginners were more likely than others to be identified as prospective transfers (i.e., to say they were working toward a bachelor's degree). Students who were under 20 when they started college were twice as likely as older students to say they were working toward a bachelor's degree (32 percent, compared with 15 percent of older students). Moreover, high-SES students were twice as likely as others to have a bachelor's degree goal (40 percent, compared with 16-20 percent of low-and middle-SES students) (figure 7). Men were also more likely than women to state a bachelor's degree goal (31 percent of men compared with 21 percent of women) (table 17).  25The apparent contradiction between working toward a bachelor's degree and expecting less may be interpreted as reflecting some students' lack of confidence that they will achieve their goal. Finally, although there were no significant racialethnic differences in the percentage of community college beginners working toward a bachelor's degree, the large share of Hispanic beginners who were working toward a bachelor's degree (one-third) illustrates Hispanic students' heavy reliance on community colleges as a point of entry into postsecondary education and toward a bachelor's degree. For example, 61 percent of Hispanic beginning students were enrolled at community colleges, compared with 41-42 percent of non-Hispanic black and white students, and among beginning students who expected to complete at least a bachelor's degree, 59 percent of Hispanics were at a community college, compared with 37-40 percent of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders.26 A recent analysis of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) found that among 1988 eighth graders who had enrolled in postsecondary education by 1994, half of Hispanic students first enrolled at a community college, compared with about one-third of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders.27"}, {"section_title": "Overview of Transfer Activity Among Community College Beginners", "text": "Overall, about one out of five community college beginners (22 percent) transferred to a 4year institution (table 18).28 However, among prospective transfers (students who were working toward a bachelor's degree), 39 percent transferred to a 4-year institution. This finding is consistent with the logic of sample selection described abovethat examining this group permits a sharp focus on those with transfer intentions. It also shows that even when one defines prospective transfers narrowly, less than half of such students had made a direct transition to a 4year institution within 5 years of college entry.29 While students who were working toward an associate's degree were less likely to transfer to a 4-year institution than those who were working toward a bachelor's degree, they were much more likely to do so than students who were working toward a certificate or who were not working toward any credential (23 percent of those working toward an associate's degree transferred to a 4-year institution, compared with 2-9 percent of the other groups). This is consistent with the interpretation that the group working toward an associate's degree includes both students who planned to transfer as well as students who did not intend to continue their education past the associate's degree (figure 8).  Table 19 presents transfer outcomes for the subset of community college beginners who said they were working toward a bachelor's degree. Many of the differences among these small groups are not statistically significant. That is, while some of the estimates of the proportion who transferred in table 19 appear notably different, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that this reflects a difference in transfer behavior in the population of beginning students rather than simply among those in the BPS sample. (See appendix C for a detailed discussion of statistical significance testing.) Among prospective transfers, those who enrolled full time in their first year were twice as likely as those who enrolled part time to transfer to a 4-year institution by 1994. It is unlikely that this simply reflects the time needed to complete transfer requirementssince the study covers a period of 5 years, it allows sufficient time for continuously enrolled half-time students to complete the equivalent of 2 years of full-time attendance. However, to the extent that students who transfer take a year or more off between institutions (see table 7), 5 years may not be enough time to capture all transfer behavior among part-time students. It is nevertheless very likely that some of the difference in transfer rates reflects higher stopout and dropout rates among part-time students.\" It may also reflect a greater propensity of part-time students seeking a bachelor's degree to change their degree objective. Prospective transfers who expected to complete an advanced degree also transferred at a higher rate than did those who expected their highest attainment to be a bachelor's degree.  "}, {"section_title": "Attainment Before Transferring to a 4-Year Institution", "text": "Among community college beginners who transferred to a 4-year institution, most (65 percent) did not complete a degree before transferring. About one out of three completed an associate's degree (table 20). About half of transfers (46 percent) who had said that they were working toward an associate's degree completed this degree before transferring, twice as many as those who had said they were working toward a bachelor's degree. Transfers who were enrolled full time in their first year were much more likely than part-timers to complete an associate's degree before transferring to a 4-year institution (41 versus 17 percent), and female transfers were more likely than their male counterparts to have done so (44 versus 24 percent).31 31Among all community college beginners, full-time students were also more likely than part-timers to be working toward an associate's degree (60 versus 49 percent, table 17).  "}, {"section_title": "Timing of Transfer to 4-Year Institutions", "text": "On average, community college beginners who transferred to a 4-year institution spent about 20 months at the first institution, roughly equal to the amount of time normally required for a full-time student to complete lower division coursework (table 21).32 Students who completed an associate's degree before transferring tended to spend more time at the first institution than students who transferred without any credential. The average number of months transfers spent at the first institution did not differ according to enrollment status in the first year. One possible explanation for this finding is that part-timers simply transferred fewer credits than did full-timers (for example, transferring in as sophomores rather than as juniors). Another possibility is that part-timers who transferred increased their course load soon after the first term. Community college beginners who transferred to a 4-year institution often took a considerable amount of time off between institutions, averaging 21 months (table 21).33 The amount of time they took off between institutions did not appear to vary with other student or enrollment characteristics, however. Table 21Among 1989-90 beginning students at public 2-year institutions who transferred to 4-year institutions, average number of months enrolled at the first institution and average number of months between institutions, by selected student and enrollment characteristics: 1989-94 "}, {"section_title": "Transfer of Credit by Students Who Transferred to 4-Year Institutions", "text": "As in the analysis of transfer from 4-year institutions, a partial examination of transfer of credit between institutions is possible by restricting the sample to transfers who attended only 33About one-third of community college transfers to any institution made the transition within 1 year, and about one-quarter took more than 3 years off (table 7). two institutions.34 Among community college students transferring to a 4-year institution who attended two institutions, nine out of ten (89 percent) reported transferring credits between institutions (table 22). Among high-SES students and students who completed an associate's degree before transferring, almost all (98 percent) transferred credits. This may reflect better academic preparation, stronger academic performance, or greater compliance with transfer requirements among such students, as well as other factors that might improve the chances that their credits will transfer (for example, attendance at institutions that are more oriented toward baccalaureate transfer, where appropriate academic advising may be more accessible and more effective).35 Table 22Among 1989-90 beginning students at public 2-year institutions who transferred to 4-year institutions and attended two institutions, percentage who transferred credits, by selected student characteristics: 1989-94 Percentage who transferred credits What had happened to transfers by the 1994 follow-up survey? Table 23 showS the percentage who had attained a bachelor's degree by 1994, and for those who had not attained the degree, the percentage who were enrolled, by level of institution. While one out of four transfers had received a bachelor's degree by the time of the follow-up survey, another 44 percent were still enrolled at a 4-year institution, representing an overall persistence rate of 70 percent (table 23, first column). This is comparable to the persistence rate among students who began at 4-year institutions, and among 4-year horizontal transfers (table 16). Thus, while less than half of prospective transfers made the transition to a 4-year institution (39 percent, table 19), those who transferred did as well with respect to overall persistence as their counterparts who began at a 4year institution.36 The bachelor's degree attainment rate was much higher among the minority of transfers who had completed an associate's degree before transferring: 43 percent of associate's degree completers had received a bachelor's degree by 1994, compared with 17 percent among those who transferred without any credential (figure 9). This difference cannot be attributed to different rates of part-time enrollment or different amounts of time off between institutions: those factors would merely alter the balance between the proportion who had attained and the proportion still enrolled. However, the two groups had equivalent rates of current enrollment at a 4-year institution (44-45 percent), and the percentage who had left postsecondary education was nearly three times higher among students who did not complete any credential before. The higher bachelor's degree attainment rate among transfers who first completed an associate's degree is also consistent with the finding that associate's degree completers were more likely to transfer credits, which would accelerate degree completion (table 22). Students who transferred with an associate's degree may have been better prepared for the transition, or they may have encountered fewer obstacles to continued progress. 36Beginners and horizontal transfers at 4-year institutions had higher rates of bachelor's degree attainment, however. This is consistent with higher rates of full-time attendance by 4-year beginners (appendix A, table A2), and less time off between institutions by 4-year horizontal transfers (tables 14 and 21). Since the analysis thus far has been restricted to the first transfer, the possibility remains that some students found their way into a 4-year institution after an intermediate transition to a less-than-4-year institution. This possibility can be addressed by examining the full record of institutions attended over the 5 years covered by BPS:90/94. In addition, one can examine the full record of stated degree objectives and bachelor's degree attainment among community college beginners. As noted earlier, 26 percent of community college beginners stated in their first year that they were working toward a bachelor's degree (table 17). Over the full 5-year period, however, 38 percent said at some time that they were working toward a bachelor's degree (table 24). Many students who were not initially working toward a bachelor's degree later took steps toward one. For example, among students who initially said they were working toward an associate's degree, 26 percent had attended a 4-year institution by 1994, and 24 percent had reported working toward a bachelor's degree by 1994 (table 24). Table 24 shows that some students who were not identified as transfers or whose first transfer was to a less-than-4-year institution (2 and 9 percent, respectively) had attended a 4-year institution at some time by 1994, and a fraction of a percent had attained a bachelor's degree by 1994.37 Among all community college beginners, the bachelor's degree attainment rate after 5 years was equal for those initially working toward an associate's degree and those initially working toward a bachelor's degree (8 percent). The rate of 4-year institution attendance was higher among those initially working toward a bachelor's degree, however (45 versus 26 percent). Some \"indirect transfer\"that is, transfer to a 4-year institution after an intermediate transfer to a less-than-4-year institutionoccurred among students identified as prospective transfers based on their stated degree goal in 1989-90. While 39 percent of prospective transfers made a direct transition to a 4-year institution (table 19), 45 percent had attended a 4-year institution at some time by 1994 (table 25). Among students who transferred to a less-than-4-year institution, 17 percent subsequently enrolled at a 4-year institution. While 20 percent of direct transfers had attained a bachelor's degree by 1994, none of the other transfers had done so (table   25). Table 24Among 1989-90 beginning students at public 2-year institutions, percentage who ever stated working toward a bachelor's degree, who ever attended a 4-year institution, and who had attained a bachelor's degree, by stated degree goal and transfer status: 1989-94 37Nontransfers who attended a 4-year institution or who attained a bachelor's degree were simultaneously enrolled at the first institution.

In this section, linear regression analysis is used to provide information about how certain characteristics are related to transfer after controlling for a set of other characteristics. Three different types of transfer are analyzed in this fashion: horizontal transfer from 4-year institutions, reverse transfer from 4-year institutions, and transfer from public community colleges to 4-year institutions.

The analysis does show two additional characteristics are associated with transfer when variation of the other variables has been taken into account: men were somewhat more likely than women to transfer to another 4-year institution, and high-SES students were more likely than middle-SES students to do so.

In this case, controlling for the other variables does not change the interpretation one would draw from the unadjusted percentages. Reverse transfer was less common among both low-and high-SES students than among middle-SES students; less common among students who expected to attain an advanced degree than among those who thought their highest degree would be a bachelor's; and less common among students who received financial aid than among unaided students. Reverse transfer was about twice as likely among students who were enrolled part-time in their first year than among full-time students, and also among students who earned low grades in their first year.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:90/94 Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the BPS data. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors4I and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table C1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 5 in the text, and was generated by the DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the NPSAS stratified sampling method. (See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.) 41The NPSAS and BPS samples are not simple random samples and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.

Each procedure is described below."}, {"section_title": "Differences Between Means", "text": "The descriptive comparisons were tested in this report using Student's t statistic. Differences between estimates are tested. against the probability of.a'Type'I error, or SignificanCe level. The significance levels Were determined by calculating the Student's' t values for the differenCes between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesiS testing. Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula:"}, {"section_title": "E2", "text": "(1) 11 2+ set se 2 where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and set and see are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates were not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup that is included in the total), a covariance term was added tothe denominator of the ttest formula. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p \u00a3 .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p \u00a3 .05.42 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p .05/10, or p .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race ethnicity, there are five racialethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 2, k = 5(5 -1) =10 2 Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended, within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables. Adjusted means for subgroups were 42The standard that p<.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p<.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56 (1961): 52-64. -Too few cases for a reliable estimate.
