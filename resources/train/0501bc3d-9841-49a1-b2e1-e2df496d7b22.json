Elderly subjects appear to be predisposed to the development ofhyperkalemia on the basis of both innate disturbances in potassium homeostasis and comorbid disease processes that impair potassium handling. Hyperkaiemia in the elderly is most often precipitated by medications that impair cellular uptake or renal disposal of potassium. This electrolyte disorder is best prevented by recognition of at-risk physiology in the aged, avoidance of therapy with certain high-risk medications, and monitoring of plasma potassium concentration and renal function at intervals appropriate for the medication prescribed. Management of hyperkaiemla entails identification of the clinical manifestations of severe hyperkaiemia, stabilization of cardiac tissue, promotion of cellular potassium uptake, and ultimataly removal of potassium from the body.\nCONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients should be considered at risk of developing hyperkalemia, especiaUy when they are prescribed certain medications. Potassium levels should be monitored at appropriate intervals when these patients are treated with potassium-aitering medications. Appropriate management of hyperkaiemia in the elderly can avoid lifethreatening neuromuscular and cardiac complications. elderly patient is particularly predisposed to develop this cation disturbance. 1S This predisposition has its genesis in part from aging-associated reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but more importantly from aging related disturbances in renal tubular functions and renin angiotensin-aldosterone system activity, 1,~ By impairing these homeostatic functions further, the presence of dis betes mellitus, long standing hypertension, or urinary ob struction often magnifies the risk, 1,~\nThe serum potassium concentration is typically not ele rated in elderly patients at baseline. Yet, slight perturbm tions in the potassium homeostatic mechmfisms can induce an abrupt and threatening rise in the serum potassium con centration. 1.~ In particular, a reduction in effective renal blood flow (RBF), as may occur with volume depletion, a change in forward cardiac output, or therapy with certain medications, can importantly disturb potassium homeo stasis in the older patient. Oral potassium supplements. adrenergic blockers, nonsteroidal antHnflanm~atory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in hibitors, mid potassium-sparing diuretics are well-known agents that can induce hyperkalemia in the predisposed pm tient.

The second step of reabsorption is the active extru sion of sodium out of the cell by the Na + K + ATPase trans port system. The movement from tubular lumen into the cell generates a lumen negative electric potential that fa cilitates the diflusive movement of potassium into the urine.: ~. 31 What is distinctive about the principal cells is their transport asymmetry: the sodium and potassium channels reside only in the luminal membranes, and the Na+-K + ATPase transporters reside only in the basolateral (pericapillary side) membranes. Hence, sodium transport occurs from lumen to capillaries, and potassium trans port occurs from capillaries to urine, Aldosterone importantly participates in potassium secretion (and sodium reabsorption) by modulating the activity of the Na+-K + ATPase transporters and gating the luminal membrane sodium specific and potassium specific transport channels. Aldosterone action leads to the open ing of these channels and stimulation of the NA+-K + ATPase transporters. If aldosterone is lacking, activity of the NA + K + ATPase transporters slows and the luminal bound ion-specific channels remain closed. Accordingly. aldosterone action is essential for renal tubular potas slum secretion (and sodium reabsorption).\nImpairment in distal nephron potassium secretion can be either morphologic or purely functional. Tubular atrophy or tubulointerstitial scarring may significantly impair potassium secretion, even if GFR is relatively preserved. The mechanism can be traced simply to a loss of nephron mass and a disrupted relation between the tubules and the peritubular capillary network, 1,:,:1,:: The aging process itself can result in tubular atrophy and in terstitial fibrosis sufficient to impair potassium secre tion. 1,:,:1,:: Such tubulointerstitial change is usually ascribed to the presence of global giomerulosclerosts and an associated reduction in tubular oxygen delivery, as the tubular blood supply is derived from postglomerular arterioles. However, other processes such as diabetes mellitus and damage from advance glycosylation end products, is chemia from renal artery stenoses, injury and tubular blood flow alterations from chronic urinary obstruction, and injury from nephrotoxin exposures contribute impor tantly to tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and chronic derangements in tubular function. :s In addition, obstructive uropathy, a disease common among elderly males, is often associated with a potassium secretory defect arising from voltage dependent hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis, a: Impairment in distal tubular potassium secretion can also be ascribed to defects in aldosterone synthesis or tu bular insensitivity to its action. ~--s~ Hypoaldosterontsm is associated most often with a low level of renal renin secretion. :~-.:'-~ The syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldoste ronism occurs most commonly in the elderly in associa tion with diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency. :~ A primary impairment in the renal production of renin seems to underlie the hypoaldosteronemie state in these pa tients, Although no single abnormality explains the defect in renin secretion, evidence suggests that damage to the Jmctaglomerular apparatus, disturbances in its sympa thetic innervation, and alterations in renal prostaglandin synthesis contribute to the hyporeninemic state. ~-.~'-~ The hyperkalemia associated with hyporeninemic hypoaldo steronism ranges from mild to severe. Its degree can fluctuate in a given individual, depending on other contribu tory factors such as intravascular volume status, cardiac output, potassium intake, degree of hyperglycemia, and presence of medications that may influence renin or al dosterone output.\nOther elderly patients may exhibit impairment in renal tubular potassium secretion manifesting as \"isolated\" aldosterone deficiency, so designated because hypoaldosteronism is discovered in the face of \"normal\" or even high plasma renin activity, s~ Individuals with this defect appear to be healthy in all other regards, s~ Its recognition depends simply on the occurrence of hyperkalemia. Its diagnosis is made when low levels of aldosterone are doc umented with normal cortisol and renin levels and eu volemia. Its etiology is unknown, sn Finally, distal tubular potassium secretion may be impaired when the delivery of sodium and water to the distal nephron falls below a critical threshold, 1,:,sl Because the movement of potassium from tubular cell into urine is linked electronically to sodium movement from urine into the cells, a reduction in the amount of sodium delivered to this segment of the nephron can retard the rate of potassium entry into tubular lumens. 1,~,s1 This dy namic limitation will pertain when the urinary sodium concentration falls below 10 mEq/L. Reduced water flow through the distal nephron may also limit quantitative potassium secretion, as washout of potassium ions from the brush border neighborhoods of the luminal potassium channel openings is necessary to support the diflusive po tassium movement into the nephron lumens. Elderly patients are subject to dehydration and intra vascular volume depletion as a result of central hypodipsia and impaired renal sodium conservation, :l,ss Whenever systemic arterial blood volume declines, proximal nephron segments augment sodium and water reabsorp tion in an attempt to repair the perceived intravascular fluid deficit. This action results in a proportional reduction in distal nephron sodium and water delivery. Potassium secretion accordingly declines, although an appropriate increment in aldosterone secretion can act to mitigate this. s~\nThe patient who is most vulnerable to this mechanistic im pairment in distal potassium secretion is the one who cannot augment aldosterone secretion appropriately, i.e., the elderly patient who may have hyporeninemic hypoaldoste ronism or isolated hypoaldosteronism, An identical impairment in potassium secretion may evolve in the patient with congestive heart failure or in the patient with \"third-spacing\" of fluid, Both conditions create a reduction in effective circulatory volume and e5\nfective RBF, This results in augmentation of proximal nephron reabsorption of sodium and water and decline of distal sodium and water delivery, Once again, an appropriate augmentation in aldosterone output would overcome or at least mitigate the reduction in distal potassium secretion, but patients who cannot sufficiently augment aldosterone output will become hyperkalemic, Taken together, these findings indicate that the aging process and certain comorbid conditions common among the elderly can and do cause changes in kidney structure and physiologic regulatory systems that disrupt homeo static potassium balance. Most often, the disturbmlce in potassium excretion is not apparent until an intercurrent illness supervenes or some other perturbation in potas sium homeostasis is imposed, Most commonly, the problem is a medication."}, {"section_title": "DRUG-INDUCED HYPERKALEMIA", "text": "Numerous medications are capable of elevating se rum potassium concentration (Table 1) .

Our personal experience and reading of the litera ture lead us to conclude that therapy with certain medi cations is the leading cause of hyperkalemia in patients with some degree of renal insufficiency, s4-s~-.sl The cardi nal principles of prevention include recognizing the possi bility of hyperkalemia in patients treated with a culprit medication, whether prescribed or over the counter, and counseling such patients about the adverse reactions as sociated with these medications, Toward this end, drug prescriptions should be selectively tailored according to the presence of disease processes that carry an increased risk of hyperkalemia, In addition, combinations of medications known to have a potentially hyperkalemic action should be avoided.\nPotassium-sparing diuretics should be prescribed cautiously in an elderly patient, especially when renal in sufficiency or diabetes mellitus exist or when there has been a history of urinary tract obstruction, 4n,444~' If a decision is made to initiate a potassium sparing diuretic, the plasma potassium concentration should be measured at the outset to establish a baseline and again within 5 to 10 days. We recommend repeated plasma potassium assays at 2 month to 4 month intervals of the duration of ther apy. Also. patients should be instructed to avoid dehydration and volume depletion, as these factors may precipi tously raise potassium concentration and cause frank hype rkale mia. 1,~,s~ Therapy with NSAIDs should be avoided in the geriat ric patient who exhibits prostaglandin dependent disease states, such as renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis. cirrhosis, partial urinary tract obstruction, or congestive heart failure. To avoid iatrogenic hyperkalemia in elderly patients who require an NSAID. the dose of the NSAID should be reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency, liver disease or hypoalbuminemia because these condi tions not only represent at-risk physiology but also alter the clearance of this family of drugs. 54 We think it is pru dent to avoid intramuscular or intravenous NSAID use in these contexts, as this mode of administration produces high plasma concentrations and increases the likelihood of side effects. 54 Whenever therapy with an NSAID is corn menced in an elderly patient, we recommend that renal function parameters and the plasma potassium concen tration be checked in 5 to 10 days and again at 3 to 4 weeks, if therapy is to continue, Finally. patients should be advised about the appropriate level of potassium rich food, and counseled to maintain adequate fluid intake, avoid potassium supplements, and to discontinue the NSAID and contact their physician if they develop diar rhea or vomiting, as these problems increase the risk of hyperkalemia and acute renal insufficiency when they occur in association with NSAID therapy. 54\nCurrently, ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypertension and congestive cardiomyopathy as well as for slowing the progression of renal in sufficiency in patients with diabetic nephropathy and chronic renal disease, common maladies suffered by the elderly. Although these diseases benefit from ACE inhibi tor therapy, they also increase risk of hyperkalemia, and close monitoring, especially during the initial period of drug therapy, is recommended. 40,41,67,6e When therapy with an ACE inhibitor is initiated in a patient with renal insufficiency, it is prudent to commence with low doses of a short acting ACE inhibitor and titrate to higher doses cautiously, as most of these medications are excreted by the kidneys, 4n,41,~';,~'~' We recommend measurement of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and serum ereatinine at 5 to 10 days of drug treatment and repeated measure ments in 4 to 6 weeks. Volume depletion from concurrent diuretic therapy should be monitored, and patients should be instructed to notify their physician if severe di arrhea or vomiting supervene.\nl~ Adrenergie blockers can usually be prescribed safely to most elderly patients. In general, these mediem tions cause hyperkalemia in patients with multiple underlying risk factors coupled to concurrent therapy with potassium-altering medications, 4o,41,74,7e' In situations in which the hyperkalemic risk is prominent, a eardioselectire ~ blocker is preferred because these agents more se leetivefy antagonize the ~1 adrenergie receptor rather thin1 the ~-adrenergie receptor/''~,rs,r4 In our opinion, potassium measurement within 5 to 10 days of initiation will provide sufficient indication of the risk of potassium imbalmme, Hospitalization and initiation of either intravenous or subcutaneous heparin therapy can also lead to hyper kalemia in geriatric patients. 7c' The risk begins to rise after treatment for more than S days, especially when other medications that alter potassium homeostasis are em ployed, re' Regular monitoring of plasma potassium concentrations is advised. 75 Widespread utilization of digoxin in the elderly popula tion increases the risk of intoxication and the development of hyperkalemia. Overdosage is most often inadvertent and typically occurs when subtle renal insufficiency exists and the dose is unadjusted, ;~ Therefore. it is prudent to prescribe digomn according to a measured or calculated creati nine clearance and to intermittently measure levels to docu ment therapeutic levels, r~ Electrolytes should be measured when digoxin is combined with other potassium altering medications.\nAntimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim-suli~amethox -azole is commonplace in the elderly in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Often, this medication is pre scribed as a double-strength tablet taken twice a day. regardless of underlying renal function, r-'-<l~,13 This can and does result in overdosage in patients with GFR < 40 mL/ rain mid may partially explain the relatively frequent occurrence of hyperkalemia in elderly patients treated with this medication, e~e,l~,13 Therefore, adjustment of the dose for renal dysfunction (single-strength tablet, twice a day) is necessary and will decrease the risk of hyperkalemta.\nIn the high risk patient, plasma potassium levels should be checked after 5 to 7 days of initiation of drug therapy. the time when plasma potassium concentration has been noted to peak."}, {"section_title": "MANAGEMENT OF THE HYPERKALEMIC PATIENT", "text": "Immediate evaluation and therapy should be commenced for patients who develop hyperkalemia. Treat ment is dependent on and directed by three basic factors:\n(1] the seventy and acuteness of hyperkalemia. (2] the presence of cardiovascular symptoms, and (3) the under lying cause. Generally, chronic hyperkalemta is better tol crated than an acute evolution, mid often stopping the offending agent is all that is necessary. However, regardless of the potassium level, any sign of electrocardiographic (ECG) dysfunction requires immediate and aggressive therapy. Hyperkalemta alters excitable tissues. Most vulnera ble to the toxic effects of hyperkalemia are the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems. The neuromuscular system typically exhibits the earliest symptoms of hyper kalemia, ranging from muscle weakness to severe paralysis. ~~,~s However. disturbances in heart rhythm are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalernia, e4 Electrocardiographic changes typically ap pear before there is overt cardiac dysfunction, Ultimately. asystole or ventrieular fibrillation will occur if treatment is not initiated or is delayed. 74 It is prudent to recognize that any conduction disturbmlee may occur in patients with more than mild hyperkalemia. Importantly, elderly patients with underlying cardiac disease or abnormal baseline ECGs may deteriorate into a life-threatening conduction delay with hyperkalemia despite the absence of classic ECG changes, e4\nMedical therapy of hyperkalemia should be initiated when the plasma potassium concentration rises acutely or when ECG abnormalities arise. Interventions in order of urgency and priority are as follows: (1] stabilize cell membranes, (2) reduce plasma potassium concentrations by fa cilitating the movement of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. (3) remove potassium from the body, and (4) eliminate the causes of hyperkalemta.\nStabilization of excitable cell membranes, in particular the cardiac tissue, is a priority in the treatment of hyperkalemta. Calcium therapy, given either as calcium giuco nate (10~ solution, calcium ion at 3 mEq/nzL] or calcium chloride (10% solution, calcium ion at 13 n~Ecl/mL], is the treatment of first choice. Calcium will effectively antagonize the toxic effect of hyperkalemia even in the presence of a normal serum calcium concentration/~,~ Onset of action is within 1 to S minutes, and the effect lasts approximately 30 minutes. Repeated calcium administration may be ben eficial if no effect is noted within 5 minutes of the first dose. A slower infusion of calcium (mixed in 100 mL of 5% dextrose) over 10 to 20 minutes is recommended for pm tients who have been treated with digoxin/4 Movement of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space is an excellent maneuver to lower the plasma potassium concentration until potassium can be removed from the body. Treatments with insulin, ~ agonists, and sodium bicarbonate have been shown to move potas sium into ceils and lower serum potassium/.>.< A dose of 10 to 20 U of insulin with 50 g of glucose infused intrave nously over 15 to 30 minutes is optimal and can be accom plished by adding insulin to a 10~ dextrose solution. ~4 In patients with glucose levels above 200 mg/dL, insulin may going dialysis who were not acidemic. '<','\"r Therefore. we think it prudent to reserve intravenous sodium bicarbonate (50 ii~x t) for patients with a severe metabolic acidosis who are able to tolerate a sodium load and are normocalcemic.\nRemoval of potassium from the body is ultimately re quired to normalize the plasma potassium concentration of the hyperkalemic patient, as the previously described maneuvers are only temporary measures. If the patient is fluid replete and does not have severe renal impairment, loop diuretics alone or in combination with a thiazide diuretic may facilitate renal potassium secretion via enhanced delivery of sodium and water to principal cells, ~4 Care must be exercised to maintain euvolemia with this maneuver, Note that this type of intervention will require 8 to 16 hours to aug ment potassium excretion, Intestinal removal of potassium with a cation exchange resin is useful and often necessary. but will also take several hours to accomplish.\nThe resin, sodium polystyrene sulfonate promotes intestinal potassium secretion via exchange of sodium for potassium by colonic cells, e4.'-~7 The usual oral dose of so dium polystyrene sulfonate is 15 to 30 g every 6 to 8 hours, administered as needed, It also may be administered as a retention enema (50 g), but it must be adminis tered with saline since sorbitol is very irritating to the colon in an enema preparation and may cause bowel necrosis. Caution is required to avoid precipitation of con gestive heart failure in older patients with marginal cardiac status. Acute hemodialysis, using a 1 or 2 mEq/L dialysate bath, may be required for patients who have severe renal failure or need a rapid reduction of the plasma potassium concentration. '\"~lnl Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium, but much less efficiently compared with hemodialysis, '~lnn While patients are receiving therapy as described above, the potential causes of hyperkalemia must also be addressed. Elimination of medications known to alter potassium homeostasis is appropriate. Review of recent changes in dietary habits, including over the counter preparations and nutritional supplements, may identify an excessive source of potassium. A search for worsening renal disease, urinary obstruction, metabolic acidosis, or hyperglycemia may also identify the cause of hyperkalemia, Appropriate correction of these processes is obviously indicated. Finally, recognizing subtle renal impair ment or heretofore asymptomatic hypoaldosteronism in the aged patient may point to the etiology of hyperkalemia and lead to more tailored management."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Elderly patients constitute a large proportion of the population requiring medical care. Elderly patients characteristically have altered renal function simply on the basis of aging that puts them at greater risk of medication induced alterations in potassium homeostasis. In addition.\nthey are likely to be afflicted with disorders that further impair renal potassium handling, such as diabetes mellitus with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, obstructive uropathy. and secondary renal insufficiency from hypertension or longstanding diabetes. Several commonly employed medications cml disrupt potassium balmlce in these patients and precipitate frmlk hyperkalemia, Polypharmacy is common among the elderly. Avoidance of concurrent therapy with culprit medications may prevent iatrogenic induction of hyperkalemia. When hyperkalemia does supervene, it is important to recognize clinical manifesta tions and aggressively treat those patients at high risk of complications related to hyperkalemia."}]
