The body of the report discusses highlights of these data. Supplementary tables on 1989 doctorates are displayed in Appendix A, and trend data are displayed in Appendix B. Technical notes are in Appendix C, and the survey questionnaire is included in Appendix D. Recent Summary Reports have included special sections that analyze important trends in the survey results. This year's special section focuses on the non-U.S. citizen doctorate recipients and their growth since 1960, discussing their countries of origin; the fields in which they earned their Ph.D.; their primary sources of support in graduate school; and their postgraduation plans, with a focus on those individuals planning to work at least temporarily in the United States after graduation. Seven broad fields are profiled in the text of Summary Reports. Readers should note that these fields may differ from those reported by federal sponsors of the survey. For a list of subfields that make up each broad field, see the inside back cover of this report and the specialties list in Appendix D. Data on fine fields of Ph.D.s are included in the Appendix Tables.2   Ikesponses were received from 31,373, or 91.4 percent, of the 34,319 persons who earned doctorates in academic year 1989. When individuals did not complete the questionnaire, abbreviated records were compiled using information from the universities' commencement bulletins. As a result, basic informationsuch as gender, field, institution, and year of Ph.D.is available for all of the 34,319 doctorate recipients.

Please contact the project officer, Susan Hill, for further information (202) 634-47S7.\nThis increase in doctorate production among non-U.S. citizens was shared by both men and women, although men experienced the greater growth. In 1960, foreign men were awarded 1,060 Ph.D.s, or 12 percent of all degrees awarded to men; foreign women were awarded 116 Ph.D.s, or 11 percent of all degrees awarded to women. In 1989, foreign male Ph.D.s numbered 6,525 (or 33 percent of all men), and foreign female Ph.D.s numbered 1,670 (or 15 percent of all women). It is apparent from both Figure 8 and Table 14 that temporary visa-holders have been largely responsible for the meteoric rise among non-U.S. Ph.D.s in this country, especially during the last decade. While in 1960 temporary residents earra..d only 897 Ph.D.s, or 9 percent of all U.S. doctorates, in 1989 they earned 6,590 Ph.D.s, or 21 percent of all doctorates. The curve for temporary residents in Figure 8 closely resembles the curve for all foreign Ph.D.s, showing growth into the mid-1970s with a peak in 1975, followed by a small three-year decline and then, in 1979, the beginning of renewed growth. Since 1979, temporary residents have earned an additional 3,000 Ph.D.s in this country and increased their share of all Ph.D.s from 12 percent to 21 percent. The growth pattern of permanent visa-holders is substantially different from that of temporary visa-holders. Although they have increased both the number and proportion of U.S. doctorates in recent years, permanent residents remain well below their peak level of 2,093 Ph.D.s in 1972. In 1960, they were granted 279, or 3 percent, of all U.S. Ph.D.s. After reaching an all-time peak in 1972 with 2,093, or 7 percent, of all Ph.D.s, doctorate production among permanent residents declined until the mid-1980s. Since then, however, 31 4 F their number of degrees has grown, dipping only slightly in to 1,W5, or 5 percent, of all Ph.D.$) 3  "}, {"section_title": "TREND ANALYSIS OF TWed NUMBER OF DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS", "text": "In academic year 1989, U.S. colleges and universities awarded the largest number of doctorates ever, 34,319. About 87 percent of these degrees wex Ph.D.s or D.Sc.s; 10 percent were Ed.D.s: and the remainder were other specialized d'actorates. (See the inside back cover of this report for a complete list of degrees included in the survey.) For the fourth consecutive year, the number of students earning doctoral degrees increased. This rise has occurred after a plateau that characterized the first half of the 1980s: the number of Ph.D.s rose dramatically in the 1960s, peaking at 33,755 in 1973 (see Figure 1 and Table 1). A decline then occurred through 1978, after which the number of Ph.D.s stabilized around 31,200 annually through 1985. Since 1986, the number of doctorates awarded annually has continued to grow, surpassing the 1973 peak in 1989. Although the number of doctorates more than tripled between 1960 and 1989, not all groups of recipients increased proportionately. For example, the number of women increased more than twelvefold, from 1,042 recipients in 1960 to 12,510 in 1989. The number of non-U.S. citizens increased nearly sevenfold, from 1,176 in 1960 to 8,195 in 1989, the largest number and highest proportion of any year. NOTE: See Table 1.   1   1969 1973 1977 1981 1985 1989 Year FIGURE 1 Doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities, 1960-1989. example, within physical sciences, the number of mathematics Ph.D.s fell from 1,232 recipients in 1973 to 861 Ph.D.s this year, a decrease of 30 percent. The 1989 number, however, is the greatest since 1977. U.S. citizens accounted for the majority (51 percent) of the mathematics doctorates in 1989 after a two-year period when the majority were awarded to non-U.S. citizens (51 percent in each year). Another change in the overall characteristics of the recipients was their sex. Women significantly increased their proportion among life sciences doctorates, from 18 percent in 1973 to 38 percent in 1989. Women also increased their presence in professional/other fields: in 1973 women represented 13 percent of the recipients; in 1989 they received 35 percent of the doctorates. Most of this growth in the number of professional degrees awarded to women has been in business and management, although the numbers in communications and social work have also risen significantly. In 1989, 21,809 men earned the Ph.D. in the United States, the largest number of men to receive it in a decade. The number of men earning the doctorate began a 13-year decrease in 1973; since 1986, however, men increased their doctorate production each year (see Table 2). In comparison, women increased both their number and proportion of doctorates in every year from inception of the SED (1958) through 1986, after which their number continued to grow (reaching 12,510 in 1989) but their proportion stayed at about 35 percent until 1989, when women earned 36 percent of all degrees.

In humanities and education, the number of doctorates earned by women has remained relatively stable since 1984. Among men, the numoer of Ph.D.s in the fields of physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences began falling in 1973 after peaking one year earlier. The decrease in these fields paralleled the decline in the total number of men who received doctorates. Initially, there were dramatic declines in the number of male Ph.D.s in physical sciences and engineering that continued into the early 1980s, but in 1983 the number of men in these fields began to increase. While the number of male Ph.D.s in physical sciences remains well below the peak in 1972, the number of male Ph.D.s in engineering has surpassed the 1972 peak. The number of men who received Ph.D.s in life sciences showed a more moderate decline and, with some fluctuation, has been relatively stable over the last 16 years. Decreases also occurred in the number of men receiving doctorates in humanities and education; however, while the number in humanities stabilized over the last six years, the number in education decreased further. The decline in the number of men who received degrees in social sciences and professional/other fields began later, in 1977. Social sciences has continued its downward trend, but professional/other fields has recovered and grown in the last four years. It is evident from both Table 2 and Figure 3 that the gender gap has narrowed in all fields, in some cases because women increased their numbers dramatically, and in others because the number of men decreased while the number of women grew. Nevertheless, disparities between the sexes remain marked in certain disciplines (see Appendix Table  A-3). The data indicate that, despite numerical gains, women are still underrepresented in physical sciences and engineering (81 percent male versus 19 percent female in phycal sciences, and 92 percent male versus 8 percent female in engineering). In life sciences, women earned 38 percent of all doctorates in 1989, although they outnumbered men in the subfield of health sciences, where they constituted 65 percent of Ph.D.s. This proportion was largely the result of the number of women earning Ph.D.s in nursing, a traditionally female-dominated area; 48 percent of health science Ph.D.s awarded to women were in nursing. (See Appendix Table A-1, for numbers in each specialty.) In both social sciences and humanities, on the other hand, the gap between the numbers of men and women receiving doctorates narrowed considerably. While in 1960 women received only 13 ptrcent of all social science doctorates, 45 percent of 5,955 such doctorates in 1989 were awarded to women. This trend toward equality, however, masks differences among some social science fields: in 1989, women dominated in psychology (56 percent); but in economics and political science/ international relations, men led with 81 percent and 74 percent, respectively, and in other social sciences, men held a 63 percent share. In 1989, 46 percent of humanities Ph.D.s were awarded to women, compared to 16 percent in 1960. Women were more numerous in English (58 percent) and foreign languages and literature (61 percent), while men predominated in history (66 percent) and other humanities (60 percent). Education was the only broad field in 1989 where womenarning 58 percent of the doctorateswere more numerous than men. This continued ia trend begun in the early 1970s: the number of male education doctorates dropped from 5,455 in 1973 to less than 2,660 in 1989, and the number of women rose from 1,783 to just over 3,605. In 1989 as in the two previous years, however, the number of degrees earned in this field decreased for both men and women."}, {"section_title": "Citizenship Status", "text": "The proportion of doctorates earned by U.S. citizens has steadily decreased through the years especially during the last decade (see Figure 4). In 1960, 88 percent (8,469) of doctorates (whose citizenship was known) were granted to U.S. citizens and 12 percent (1,176) to non-U.S. citizens.

Although the number of doctorates granted to U.S. citizens increased in each of the fields between 1960 and 1989, the U.S. sham of degrees decreased in every field. This was most evident in engineering, where the U.S. percentage dropped more than 30 points from 77 percent in 1960 (607 Ph.D.$) to 44 percent in 1989 (1,809 Ph.D.$). However, U.S. citizens experienced significant decreases in physical sciences as well (a decline of 23 points), but Iife and social sciences decreases were less significant: 6 points and 8 points respectively. Since 1960, the proportion of U.S. citizens in humanities declined 11 points including a sharp 4-point drop during the most recent 5-year interval, 1985-89. Professional/other fields, dropping 15 points over the  period, showed more of a decline than humanities.

As shown in Figure 5, American Indians and Hispanics have been slowly growing in doctorate production since 1979, although both groups declined somewhat in the last two years.6 American Indians earned 81 Ph.D.s (0.3 percent of the cohort) in 1979; and 115 (0.5 percent) in 1987; this year, however, only 93 American Indians received doctorates (just over 0.4 percent of the cohort). Hispanics received 462 Ph.D.s (1.9 percent) in 1979 and 618 doctorates (2.7 percent) in 1987, their peak year, but also declined slightly in 1989, falling to 569 doctorates (2.4 percent). The upward trend through 1987 for Hispanic Ph.D.s was primarily a function of the increase in female doctorates while their decline in the past two years was due to a decrease in the numbers of both men and women. In contrast to these groups, Asians have grown in doctorate production at a faster rate; they received 428 Ph.D.s (1.8 percent) in 1979 and 624 (2.7 percent) in 1989. This was due to an increase in the numbers of both men and women although the number of Asian women increased in greater proportion than the number of men.  Meanwhile, the number of U.S. blacks receiving Ph.D.s fell somewhat since last year but has still not fallen to their low point in 1987; their number increased from 767 doctorates in 1987 to 811 in 1989 (3.5 percent of the cohort). Nevertheless, because of the steadily falling numbers of black men earning the Ph.D., blacks have experienced a decline of 23 percent since 1979, when they earned 1,056 doctorates (4.4 percent of the cohort). However, the number of black men who received doctorates increased slightly since last year, its lowest level of the decade, with the 323 doctorates awarded to black men in 1989 being the highest number awarded since 1985, while the number of black women receiving Ph.D.s declined somewhat in 1989. As Table 4 shows, the largest share of U.S. minorities (except Asians) earned their doctoral degrees in the field of education in 1989: 26 percent of American Indians, 27 percent of Hispanics, and 48 percent of blacks. The second most frequently chosen field for two of these three groups was social sciences: 22 percent of Hispanics and 20 percent of blacks. For American Indians social sciences tied with physical sciences at 19 percent. The majority of these social science doctorates were concentrated in psychology.

While all broad fields experienced the basic pattern of lengthening registered dnd total time-to-degree between 1960 and 1989, the source and size of the change varied enormously by field (see Table 6). In general, recipients in social sciences and in the nonsciences experienced longer time lapses than natural scientists. Over the last 30 years, the median RTD has risen for recipients in all fields. In 1960, the 7 broad fields varied in RTD by up to 1.5 years, ranging from 5.0 years for physical sciences and engineering to 6.5 years for education. By 1989 the spread had widened, with engineering doctorates showing the shortest RTD at 6.0 years and humanities showing the longest at 8.4 years. The social sciences and nonsciences experienced the greatest lengthening of both RTD and TrD over the 30-year period.

The increased proportions in physical science and engineering fields of those who planned to study occurred since 1979 (their proportions actually decreased between 1973 and 1979); this dramatic shift to continued education during the last decade (10 percent and 8 percent, respectively) was due to the surge in the number of Ph.D.s earned by temporary residents (for further discussion of this item, see the special section on postdoctoral plans of non-U.S. doctorates on page 46).

Academe employed the largest proportions of new Ph.D.s in all broad fields except physical sciences and engineering; in these two fields, industry employed 50 percent or more of Ph.D.s in 1989. Humanities doctorates were the most likely to work in academe (81 percent), while engineering doctorates were the least likely (27 percent).

Over the same period, administration and professional services have gained 3 and 6 percentage points, respectively, in their proportionate shares. Yet, the number of r working in administration decreased during the period from 2,084 to 1,958, while the number in professional services increased from 1,589 to 1,951. Disaggregation of the data for 1973 and 1989 by sector reveals that, in academe, teaching has declined as a primary work activity (from 81 percent to 66 percent), but R&D has increased (from 8 percent to 19 percent). In fact, academe was the only sector to demonstrate proportionate growth in R&D since 1973, and the number of Ph.D.s in the academic sector working in R&D in 1989 (1,278) was also higher than in 1973 (920). In industry, meanwhile, R&D's proportionate share of activity fell from 72 percent of doctorates in 1973 to 60 percent in 1989, although the number grew from 1,415 to 1,575. At the same time, the percentage of Ph.D.s performing professional services in the industrial sector rose 10 points (freni 16 percent in 1973 to 26 percent in 1989), corresponding to more than a two-fold increase in number (from 317 to 691). This increase was in large part attributable to the growing pool of self-employed individuals, especially in social work and in clinical, counseling, and educational psychology. In both 1973 and 1989, doctorates who obtained jobs in government were most inclined to work in R&D, followed in almost equal proportions by activities in administration and professional services. Doctorates employed in \"other\"10 sectors also showed their largest shares in administration and professional services. By field of doctorate, R&D was the most frequently reported activity in physical sciences and engineering in 1989, as it was in 1973. The largest propo lion of life science doctorates also planned R&D as their primary work activity (38 percent in 1973; 44 percent in 1989), but teaching employed a significant share as well in these fields (45 percent in 1973; 29 percent in 1989). In 1989, doctorates in education leaned slightly more toward administration than teaching (41 percent versus 38 percent), and those in social sciences 10\"Other\" refers mainly to elementary/secondary schools and nonprofit organizations."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "TABLE 10 Primary Work Activity of Doctorate Recipients with Postgraduation Commitments in the United States, by Sector and Broad Field, 1973, 1979, and 1989 1979 1989 1973* 1979 1989 1973* 1979 1989 1973* 1979 1989 1973* 1979 1989 Total Ph.

The most significant change was that several new categories were added, allowing respondents to identify more accurately the type of support that they had received.\" Because of the apparent shifts in distribution, time-series data through 1986 are no longer comparable with the data collected in the last three years, so this report discusses only 1989 data. Table II presents a frequency distribution of doctorates among \"primary\" sources (i.e., the sources with the largest reported percentages). In 1989, new Ph.D.s reported that personal and university sources provided the largest amounts of their graduate support: 41 percent each. Another estimated 11 percent of support came from the federal governmentl 2 and 7 percent from \"other\" sources. Table II further compares the primary sources of support of new Ph.D.s in 1989, by broad field and demographic group. Doctorates in some fields relied on certain sources more than students in other fields. In general, doctorates in physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering were mostly supported from university sources, while personal sources, for the most part, supported students in social sciences and the nonsciences: education ',77 percent), professional/other (54 percent), social sciences (53 percent), and humanities (48 percent). In contrast, those earning Ph.D.s in physical sciences furnished only 14 percent from personal sources. University sources, on the other hand, provided 60 percent of the support for physical science doctorates but only 15 percent for education doctorates. Differences among the demographic groups were largely related to field rather than to demographic group per se. For example, Table 4 (page 12) shows the breakout by field for each of the groups. Those fields in which many of the groups are concentratedi.e., education and social sciences are also the fields in which doctorates reported primary support from personal sources. I 1 In 1987 the new categories included NSF, NI H, and other federal research assistantship (RA), and foreign (non-U.S.) government support. In 1988, categories for USDA fellowship and RA were added (see item 18 of the survey questionnaire in Appendix D). The addition of the federal RA categories has had the effect of reducing the reported number of unive7sity RAs. A solution for time-series analysis would be to look at RAs as a single type of support mechanism rather than as split between university-related and federal support. 12Federal support may be understated because additional support provided indirectly through federal loan programs is included under \"personal\"; federal support provided through universities may be included under \"university.\" 4.8 4.9 NOTE: A recipient's \"primary\" source of support is the source with the largest reported percentage. \"Personal\" includes loans as well as own earnings and contributions from the spouse/family. \"Other\" includes U.S. nationally competitive fellowships, business/employer funds, foreign government, and other nonspecified sources.

Of the 30,883 respondents to the debt question in 1989, over half (53 percent) reported finishing their doctoral programs with no debt related to their...education. Of the 14,426 (47 percent) who replied affirmatively and reported an amount of debt, 34 percent owed less than $5,000; 27 percent owed between $5,001 and $10,000; 25 percent owed between $10,001 and $20,000; 10 percent owed between $20,001 and $30,(X)0; md 5 percent owed $30,001 or more. The median level owed for those with accumulaxd educational debt was approximately $8,000. Figure 7 displays the percentages of indebted recipients and the median levels of their debts by field. Engineering recipients had the lowest frequency of cumulative del,t, with debt reported by 35 percent of the cohort. They were followed by doctorates in education and in physical sciences (39 percent and 44 percent, respectively). Of those students in these three fields who did end their graduate work with debt, 39 percent  reported owing $5,000 or less, with the median levels of debt being about $6,900 (engineet'ng), $7,200 (education), and $6,800 (physical sciences). The field reporting not only the highest percentage of recipients with debt but also the highest median level of debt$11,100was social sciences, where 62 percent of graduates had accumulated debt at the end of their doctoral programs. This corroborates the reported primary source of support for social science PhD.s discussed in the previous section as having the highest percent supported through personal sources. In each of the three remaining broad fields, about half of the recipients reported at varying levels: $7,200 in humanities, $7,700 in life sciences, and $9,200 in professional/other fields. In   we see that the group least frequently reporting debt at the end of their doctoral program was that which reported predoctoral status as full-time employed, 42 percent of whom were indebted, compared with 47 percent overall. The median level of debt of the full-time employed, $7,700, was also lower than the overall median. Two groups with similar and higher-than-average frequencies of reported debt were those with stated predoctoral status as part-time employment (54 percent) and those with fellowship support (57 percent); their median debt levels were $8,900 and $8,400, respectively. Although, the frequency of debt among those not employed (42 percent) was nearly the same as the full-time employed, their median level of debt was the highest of any group, $9,000. The special section of this report discusses the increasing participation of foreign citizens in U.S. doctoral education. It examines the growth pattern of non-U.S. Ph.D.s, especially of temporary visa-holders; their countries of origin; the fields in which they earned the doctorate; their primary sources of support in graduate school; and their postgraduation plans, with a focus on those individuals planning to work, at least temporarily, in the United States after graduation.

As both Figure 9 and Table 17 show, the largest increases occurred in the broad fields of engineering and physical sciences. Growth was the most marked in engineering, where the number of foreign Ph.D.s increased from 183 to 2,285 between 1960 and 1989, and their proportion of all engineering degrees increased from 23 percent to 55 percent. During the same period, the number of foreign Ph.D.s in physical sciences rose from 284 to 1,799, and their share of all degrees in the field rose from 13 percent to 36 percent. Life sciences and social sciences displayecl more moderate growth, yet in 1989 the number of non-U.S. recipients reached 1,399 (or 24 percent) in life sciences and 1,033 (or 20 percent) in social sciences. Numbers and percentages were smaller in humanities (551 Ph.D.s, or 17 percent) and education (605 Ph.D.s, or 10 percent). In professional/other fields, non-U.S. citizens earned only 523 Ph.D.s, but they comprised a significant 26 percent of the field. Further disaggregation of the data reveals a greater concentration of foreign recipients in certain subfields. Within physical sciences in 1989, the proportion of non-U.S. doctorates was 49 percent in mathematics, 42 percent in physics/astronomy, and 41 percent in computer sciences, compared to 36 percent overall. Differences also appear within life sciences, where 40 percent of all Ph.D.s in agricultural sciences were awarded to non-U.S. citizens versus 20 percent in biological sciences and 18 percent in health sciences. The social science field of economics granted 48 percent of its doctorates to foreign nationals in 1989, and political science/international relations granted 35\"percent, compared to 20 percent for the discipline as a whole. Among the professional fields, a significant 33 percent of degrees in business and management were earned by non-U.S. citizens. Table 17 also shows that, by far, the largest percentages of Ph.D.s awarded to foreign students were to temporary residents. In 1989 for all fields cfmrbined, the proportion of doctorates earned by temporary residents was four times greater than that for permanent residents (21 percent versus 5 percent). The shares were even more disparate in certain subfields, especially mathematics (45 percent for temporary residents versus 5 percent for permanent residents), physics/astronomy (37 percent versus 5 percent), agricultural sciences (36 percent versus 5 percent), and economics (41 percent versus 7 percent). The major countries of origin of non-U.S. Ph.D.s in each broad field are presented in Table 18. Although Taiwan ranked first in total numbers of non-U.S. Ph.D.s in 1989 (see Table 15), it was the top supplier in only two of the seven broad fields: engineering (421 Ph.D.$) and life sciences (148 Ph.D.$). Taiwan ranked second in physical sciences (217 Ph.D.$) and third to fifth in all other fields except humanities. Of the 962 degrees granted to Taiwanese citizens in 1989. 44 percent were in engineering, 23 percent in physical sciences, and 15 percent in life sciences. Korea, the second largest source of non-U.S. Ph.D.s overall, is the only country listed in the top five for every broad field, ranking first in social sciences (170 Ph.D.$) and professional/other fields (92 Ph.D.$) and second in engineering (307 Ph.D.s, or one-third of all degrees awarded to Korean citizens). The People's Republic of China (PRC) was the leading supplier in physical sciences, with 318 Ph.D.s (or half of all degrees earned by PRC students). Another 24 percent of doctorates granted to PRC citizens were in engineering, and 19 percent were in life sciences. Canada was the leading supplier of non-U.S. recipients in humanities and education, with 50 doctorates in each field. Although Iran only appears on the list for engineering, it is noteworthy that half of all Ph.D.s received by its citizens were in this field (108 degrees FIGURE 9 Non-U.S. citizens as a proportion of all doctorate recipients in each broad field, 1960, 1973, and 1989.    , by Broad Field, 1964, 1973, and 1989 China, unspecified\" in 1964 and1973.

Virtually all German recipients of U.S. Ph.D.s have been West German. p II Primary Source of support A comparison of data on Ph.D.s' primary sources of support during graduate school, as presented in Table 11 on page 26 and in Table 19, reveals a significantly different distribution for non-U.S. citizens than for the overall doctoral cohort. While almost identical percentages of the entire cohort received primary support from personal or university funds (about 41 percent each), 57 percent of non-U.S. Ph.D.s received their major support from the university and only 18 percent from personal funds. This lower percentage of personal support, however, masks differences between permanent and temporary residents. Only 15 percent of temporary residents indicated that they were mainly self-supporting, compared to 32 percent of permanent residents. Conversely, a larger proportion of temporary residents than permanent residents was primarily supported by the university (58 percent versus 53 percent).15 \"Other\" sources were reported by 16 percent of foreign recipients in 1989, threefourths of whom indicated foreign governments as the major provider. Temporary residents, in particular, showed significant proportions with primary support from the home government: 14 percent of the group overall, and 3f) percent of agriculture Ph.D.s. In comparison, only 5 percent of permanent residents reported this type of support. The U.S. government was responsible for the primary support of the remaining 9 percent of non-U.S. Ph.D.s., with a ;omewhat higher percentage for temporary residents (10 percent) than for permanent residents (8 percent).16 In six of the seven broad fields in 1989, the largest proportion of primary support for non-U.S. citizens (ranging from 48 percent in social sciences to 70 percent in physical sciences) was obtained from university sources, primarily teaching assistantships (TAs) and research assistantships (RAs). In contrast, only 29 percent of all primary support in education was supplied by the university, while 44 percent was obtained from personal sources and another 18 percent from foreign governments. Federal support of foreign Ph.D.s was highest in physical sciences (16 percent) and engineering (12 percent), with RAs the major mechanism of support (15 percent and 11 percent, respectively).17 Ar:ong non-U.S. citizens, RAs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) were reported as the primary source of support by 9 percent of physical science Ph.D.s and 6 percent of engineering Ph.D.s. Nearly 10 percent of non-U.S. Ph.D.s in life sciences also indicated primary support from the federal government 17 percent through RAs, over half funded by the National Institutes of Health (NI11)]. Federal support was greater for Ph.D.s in biological sciences (13 percent) than in other life science subfields and was again granted mostly through RAs (10 percent total and 7 percent funded by NIH). Among \"other\" sources, foreign government support was highest in life sciences (19 percent), especially in agriculture (28 percent) and health sciences (20 percent). In addition, a significant 18 percent of education doctorates received their major support from foreign governments. 151n general, Ph.D.s in physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering are largely supported by universities, while Ph.D.s in the other fields arc more likely to be self-supporting. Because non-U.S. citizens are most concentrated in science and engineering fields, universities are their greatest provider. The reader is also referred to the discussion of support for the total cohort on page 25. 16Federal support may be understated because additional support provided through universities (such as research assistantships) may be included under \"university.\" 17Eligibility requirements for U.S. government support declare that federally-funded fellowships can only be awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, not to temporary resident.s.

Because recipients sometimes complete the questionnaire well ahead of graduation, it is not possible to determine the final status of the \"negotiators\" and \"seekers.\" Therefore, the discussion of postdoctoral plans in the remaining sections of this report focuses only on those Ph.D.s who indicated \"definite\" commitments at the time of survey completion; in 1989, 58 percent of permanent residents and 64 percent of temporary residents reported \"definite\" plans. Also, because the questions on postgraduation plans were not consistent until the late 1960s, the years discussed in the remainder of the report are 1973, 1979, and 1989; 1979 is shown as the interim year because the greatest growth in doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens has occurred since that time. Results of the survey indicate that not only are non-U.S. citizens earning larger numbers of doctorates in the United States, but they are also staying here more often after graduation (see Figure 10). In 1973, 51 percent (or 1,595) of foreign Ph.D.s with definite postgraduation plans planned to stay in the United States after graduation; by 1989, the proportion had grown to 63 percent (or 2,904 Ph.D.$). Among permanent residents, however, the proportion of Ph.D.s planning to stay in this country actually declined from   1973, 1979, and 1989. 89 percent to 86 percent between 1973 and 1989, and their numbers fell from 966 to 724 Ph.D.s. In striking contrast, the proportion of temporary visa-holders planning to stay in the United States rose from 31 percent to 58 percent, and their numbers more than tripled (from 629 to 2,180 Ph.D.$). Most of this increase occurred in the 1980s, with the surge in the number of doctorates awarded to temporary residents. In 1979, only 38 percent of temporary residents with definite commitments (or 877 Ph.D.$) indicated plans to stay in the United States after graduation.18 Table 20 presents an overview of the immediate postgraduation plans of permanent and temporary visa-holders with definite commitments, including location, type of commitment, and major field of doctorate. While, overall, foreign Ph.D.s planning to stay in the United States have been more inclined toward employment than study, temporary residents have been almost equally divided between the two. In fact, in 1989 there were more temporary resident Ph.D.s staying here to study (30 percent, or 1,137 Ph.D.$) than to work (27 percent, or 1,029 Ph.D.$). Because temporary visa-holders are generally not eligible to accept permanent jobs in this country, study opportunities may be more readily available to them. Among permanent visa-holders in 1989, 61 percent (or 508 Ph.D.$) reported employment commitments in the United States, and 25 percent (or 212 Ph.D.$) reported study commitments. Table 20 also points out differences among the seven broad fields, as well as the subfields in which non-U.S. citizens are most concentrated. 19 Permanent residents holding degrees in earth/atmospheric/ marine sciences, health sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education were also most likely to work in the United States. Temporary residents, too, reported more employment than study commitments in these fields, but most of the employed planned to return home. Only in agricultural sciences did both groups show the largest proportions with employment plans abroad (41 percent of permanent residents, or 11 Ph.D.s: 61 percent of temporary residents, or 146 Ph.D.$).

Table 21 also disaggregates the data by broad field of doctorate. Thmugh the years, academe and industry have been the major employers of foreign citizens working in this country after graduation. In 1989, academe was still the largest employer. hiring 60 percent of permanent residents (or 302 Ph.D.$) and 63 percent of temporary residents (or 646 Ph.D.$). Industry employed the second largest proportions:   1973, 1979, and 1989. 20The reader is also referred to the description of postgraduation plans data located at the beginning of th.., \"Postdoctoral Location and Plans\" section on page 46. 32 percent of permanent visa-holders (or 164 Ph.D.$) and percent of temporary visaholders (or 321 Ph.D.$). The percentages of non-U.S. citizens in government and \"other\" sectors were much smaller. In all broad fields except engineering, the majority of both permanent and temporary residents in 1989 planned to work in academe. The highest percentages ranged from 86 to 94 percent in humanities and profcssional/other fields (with the numbers of Ph.D.s between 57 and 113). However, despite tieir smaller proportions, temporary residents in physical sciences, engineering, and social sciences outnumbered Ph.D.s in all other fields within the academic sector (153,147,and 121 Ph.D.s,respectively). Engineering Ph.D.s reported most of their commitments in industry (74 percent of permanent residents, or 96 Ph.D.s; 58 percent of temporary residents, or 223 Ph.D.$). The industrial sector also employed significant percentages of foreign Ph.D.s with degrees in physical and life sciences, although the numbers weir quite small. Table 21 also shows that the percentages of non-U.S. Ph.D.s with employment commitments in academe decreased substantially between 1973 and 1979 (especially among permanent residents) while there was a commensurate increase in industry. 13y 1989, though, the percentages of non-U.S. Ph.D.s planning to work in the academic sector were approximately the same as in 1973. The number of permanent visa-holders, nevertheless, remained smaller in 1989 than in 1973 (302 versus 369), with the most severe declines in social sciences and humanities. Their numbers also decreased in the other sectors, and in all hut academe, there were still fewer permanent residents in 1989 than 10 years ago. These declines, of course, are reflective of the overall growth pattern of permanent visa-holders: after peaking in 1972, the doctorate production of permanent residents continued to fall into the mid-1980s: only in the past five years have they started to earn more degrees. In contrast, temporary residents with employment commitments have exhibited substantial numerical growth in all sectors, regardless of the shifts in proportions from one year to the next. In U.S. academe, for example, the proportion of employed temporary resident Ph.D.s dropped from 67 percent in 1973 to 55 percent in 1979, then climbed to 63 percent by 1989. Despite these proportional fluctuations, the actual number of temporary visa-holders with commitments in the academic sector continued to rise: although the increase was small between 1973 and 1979, by 1989 the number had more than tripled (646 in 1989 versus 210 in 1973). During the same period, the number of temporary residents employed by industry increased 4.5 times, from 71 to 321 Ph.D.s. This tremendous growth, espeeially since 1979, was a direct result of the surge in doctorate production among temporary residents in the 1980s. It must be pointed out, however, that while new temporary resident Ph.D.s may outnumber new permanent resident Ph.D.s in the U.S. labor force, they are not permitted to remain indefinitely without a change in visa status.

Between 1973 and 1979, the proportion of permanent residents performing Table 22 Primary Work Activity of Non-U.S. Citizen Doctorate Recipients with Employment Commitments in the United States, by Visa Status, Sector, and Broad Field, 1973, 1979, and 1989  R&D grew from 39 percent to 56 percent, and the proportion of temporary residents grew from percent to 49 percent. By 1989, there was renewed teaching activity, and permanent residents were equally distributed between teaching and R&D. However, because of the overall decline in doctorate production among permanent residents beginning in 1973 and continuing into the mid-1980s, their numbers of Ph.D.s in both teaching and R&D were still fewer in 1989 than in 1973 (203 versus 297 in teaching and 204 versus 231 in R&D). The pattern for temporary residents was quite different:  commitments were somewhat more inclined to continue their education, while permanent residents were more likely to be employed. Academe was the largest employer of foreign Ph.D.s who planned to work here in 1989, hiring at least 60 percent of both permanent and temporary visa-holders. The industrial sector employed over 30 percent of each group. The majority of non-U.S. PhD.s in all fields but engineering planned to work in academe; engineers were more likely to find positions in industry. In 1989, more than half of U.S.employed temporary visa-holders planned to conduct R&D, while permanent visa-holders were almost evenly divided between R&D and teaching. Teaching was the most frequently reported activity in the academic sector, indicated by 68 percent of permanent residents and 60 percent of temporary residents. RR,D was the primary activity in industry, reported by 77 percent of permanent residents and 83 percent of temporary residents. R&D was also reported by significant percentages of foreign Ph.D.s planning to work in the academic sector.

Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SID). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, genetal\"---contain individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categories-----e.g., \"chemistry, other\"--include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not included among the specialty fields. Table A-1 presents data by doctoral specialty and gender. Table A-2 displays doctoral specialty by citizenship and race/ethnicity. See the explanatory note on Table A-4 for further description of the racial/ethnic variable and changes that have been made to the question over the years. Table A-3: These are three 2-page tables: one contains data about all doctorate recipients in the most recent year, and the other two present data by gender. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables: see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Terms requiring definition are as follows: Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is derived by subtracting the year of birth from the calendar year of doctorate. Months are not included in the computation. Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to total calendar time elapsed between the year of baccalaureate and the year of doctorate; \"Registered Time\" refers to the total time registered in a university between baccalaureate and doctorate. Months are often not indicated by the recipient, and are. therefore, not included in the computation of time-to-doctorate. Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items and 22 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out at about the time the doctorate is received, these planned activities can be subject to change. However, comparisons with data from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients have shown these data to be a reasonable predictor of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate (see the discussion on \"definite\" postgraduation plans in the Technical Notes in Appendix C). Postgraduation plans of the doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), or \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown.\" The sum of these lines totals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 50.1 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 41.1 percent planned to be employed, and 8.8 percent did not report their postgraduation plans; these total 100.0 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdividedshowing that 23.7 percent of all the chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 25.3 percent, research associateships: 0.4 percent, traineeships; and 0.7 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided; the percentages, listed by type of employer, show that a total of 41.1 percent planned employment. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who have definite postgraduation plans (item 21: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who are still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 21: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines, \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study,\" add to give the percentage having \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines, \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment,\" add to give the percentage having \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by work activity and by region of employment are based on those who have definite employment commitments. They exclude those still seeking employment and those planning postdoctoral study as described above. Jr 1977, the item on race/ethnicity in the survey questionnaire was revised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to Asian in 1978. In 1980, two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category (prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race). However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority-group category; and those whose responses were black as well as any other category were designated as black. Beginning with the 1982 survey, this item was revised to separate questions on racial and ethnic groups. Respondents are first asked to check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then to indicate Hispanic heritage. For purposes of analysis, all respondents who indicated Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial identification, are included in one of three Hispanic groups. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. Table A-5: Table A-5 displays data reported in item 18 on all sources of financial support received during graduate school, by gender and broad field. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in this table; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Doctorate recipients indicate multiple sources of support. In this table, a recipient counts once in each source category from which he or she received support. Federal support may be understated because additional support provided indirectly through universities is included under \"university\". The data should be interpreted as follows: 751 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences reported financial support from National Science Foundation research assistantships during graduate school. This number is 18.8 percent of the male physical sciences doctorates who answered the question, and it is 53.3 percent of the males in all fields who reported NSF research assistantship support. Since students indicate multiple sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent.

Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categories--e.g., \"chemistry, general\"contain individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\" include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not included among the specialty fields. The seven tables in Appendix A present additional information about the most recent cohort of Ph.D.s by field of doctorate. Table B-2: Table B-2 presents data on the race/ethnicity of doctorate recipients in the last ten years, by gender and citizenship. There are three panels in this table, each displayed on a separate page. The first panel includes all doctorates; the remaining panels disaggregate the data by gender. In 1977, the item on race/ethnicity in the survey questionnaire was revised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to Asian in 1978. In 1980, two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category (prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race). However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority-group category; and those whose responses were black as well as any other category were designated as black. Beginning with the 1982 survey, this item was revised to separate questions on racial and ethnic groups. Respondents are first asked to check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then to indicate Hispanic heritage. For purposes of analysis, all respondents who indicated Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial identification, are included in one of three Hispanic groups. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. It is possible to make rough comparisons between the racial/ethnic groups of Ph.D.s and the U.S. population even though the Census Bureau's method of data collection differs from the SED. According to the 1980 census, American Indians were 0.6 percent of the population, blacks were 11.7 percent, Hispanics were 6.4 percent, Asians were 1.5 percent, and whites were 83.1 percent; the percentages add to greater 87 than 100 percent because Hispanics were sometimes double-counted as blacks or whites.' The SED data in Table B-2 suggest that American Indians, blacks, and Hispanics are underrepresented relative to their proportions in the general population, and Asians and whites are overrepresented. The groups comprising the population closest to that counted by the Census Bureau are U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Tables A-2 and A-4 in Anrzndix A present additional information about the most recent cohort of Ph.D.s by racial/ethnic group. The reader should pay heed to three considerations when interpreting the changing trends presented in Table 13-3. First, in 1965 U.S. immigration and naturalization laws were amended to abolish the country quota system which had long discriminated against certain regions of the world. In its place, uniform restrictions were established for all countries, with a focus on the reunification of families and, to a lesser extent, employment skills in short supply in the United States. No limit was imposed on the number of \"immediate\" relatives (spouses, minor children, parents) of U.S. citizens who could be admitted. An annual limit of 270,000 was set for \"preference system\" visas issued to other relatives of U.S. citizens, all relatives of permanent residents in this country, individuals of distinguished merit in the arts and sciences, and workers with skills needed in the United States. No more than 20,000 \"preference system\" visas could be issued to any one country in a given year. Because all but a fraction of permanent visas since 1965 have been family-based, the law ultimately favored countries with newly arrived immigrants. While Asia and Latin America have benefited, many European c9untries whose immigration waves occurred in earlier years have been all but excluded: The impact of these legislative changes on the composition of the non-U.S. doctoral pool was evident by the mid-1970s. A second consideration in analyzing trends is that certain countries were not identifiable in every year because specific codes for these countries did not always exist; this was particularly true in the 1960s and 1970s. Therefore, a dash in Table B-3 does not necessarily mean that there were no doctorate recipients from a country during that time period. If counts appear for a country in later years but there are dashes in all of the earlier years, the reader can assume that no code existed for that country in the early 'Bureau of the Census, 1980 Census (PC8O-1-B1), Washington. D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1983, Chart 43: \"Persons by Age, Race. Spanish Origin andSex: 1980,\" pp. 27-36. 'Lawrence, C. C., ed. 1989. The 45th Annual CQ Almanac: 1989. 101st Congress, 1st session. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, Inc. years. In such cases, any doctorates awarded are included in the \"unknown\" category for the region (e.g., Cuba & Islands, Unknown; South Africa, Unknown). The third consideration is one requiring special emphasis. Because response rates to the country of citizenship question have varied significantly through the years, some of the numbers shown in this table may be lower than if response rates had been more stable. More than one-third of non-U.S. citizen Ph.D.s in 1960 and 1961 did not report their country of citizenship. For the years 1962 through 1968, nonresponse rates ranged from 12 percent to 19 percent. Although the rate fell to about 4.5 percent in 1969 when the survey form was redesigned, it has continued to fluctuate from year to year over the past two decades. In 1989 the rate of nonresponse to the country of citizenship question was about 10.5 percent.

Presented first is a table showing the overall nonresponse rates to the various data items in 1989. Following this table is a series of notes related to specific tables and figures that appear in the body of the report. These notes are grouped by the major focus of the data: citizenship, cumulative debt, postgraduation plans, primary source of support, race/ethnicity, and time-to-degree. They provide nonresponse rates for selected populations and years, as well as additional descriptive explanafion of the data as needed. In 1989, 91.4 percent of new recipients completed the survey forms themselves. Skeletal information on the remaining 8.6 percent of recipients was obtained from doctorate-granting institutions or commencement programs. The following data items are available for all recipients, whether or not they completed the questionnaires themselves: gender, Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, and Ph.D. year. Because nonresponse rates computed by gender or Ph.D. field reflect the entire doctoral cohort, they may be significantly higher than nonresponse rates for other populations (e.g., U.S. citizens, Asians). Populations defined by data items such as citizenship or race/ethnicity are most likely to be comprised of self-reporting recipients, in which case the data are more complete and nonresponse rates are lower than for the overall cohort. For example, in 1989, information on educational debt was not available for 10.2 percent of male Ph.D.s and 9.2 percent of female Ph.D.s., or 9.9 percent overall. Because gender is available for all Ph.D.s, these rates include the 8.6 percent of recipients who were not self-reporting in 1989. In comparison, the nonresponse rate to the debt question was 1.3 percent among U.S. citizens, 1.6 percent among permanent residents, and 2.3 percent among temporary residents. Rates are lower when computed by citizenship than by gender because the base number represents a reduced population that was more likely to have been self-reporting. In most cases, nonresponse rates for 1989 are higher than those for earlier years. Although it is not possible to determine the exact number of self-reported questionnaires prior to 1980, approximate nonresponse rates can be derived from data items that are unlikely to be obtained from institutions or commencement programs. Looking at high school location, one finds that 11.2 percent of new Ph.D.s in 1989 did not respond to this item, compared to only 2.0 percent in 1960, 3.8 percent in 1973, and 4.7 percent in 1979. The 1989 rate includes the 8.6 percent of Ph.D.s who did not complete the survey fonns themselves, as well as the 2.6 percent who were self-reporting but neglected to answer the question. 1Appendix Tables A-3 and A-4 repon categories for \"unknown\" responses, as well, so percentages are based on the total doctoral cohort. 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 9.9 23.2 3.9 (of employed Ph.D.$) 32.5 11.4 10.2 7.6 (of employed Ph.D.$) 10.2 9.9 10.6 13.6 17.0 NOTE: In 1989, 91.4 percent of new doctorate recipients completed the survey form.

In 1960, the nonresponse rates ranged from 0.5 percent in engineering and education to 1.7 percent in humanities and professional/other fields. In 1973, professional/other fields exhibited the highest rate of nonresponse at 6.1 percent, while the other six fields showed rates between 1.3 percent (engineering) and 2.1 percent (humanities). 3.

Therefore, some of the numbers presented in these tables may be lower than if response rates had been more stable. Because more than one-third of non-U.S. citizen Ph D.s in 1960 did not respond to the country of citizenship question, 1964 is the earliest year shown in these tables. In 1964, the rate of nonresponse to country of citizenship was 13.1 percent; in 1973, it was 11.1 percent; and in 1989, it was 10.4 percent.

Because doctorate recipients sometimes complete the survey questionnaire months ahead of their actual graduation, it is not possible to determine the final postgraduation plans of many recipients. It is quite likely, however, that some of those Ph.D.s who indicated \"negotiating\" or \"seeking\" found positions by the time of graduation. Because the final outcomes are unknown, data on postgraduation plans in this report are restricted to the group of Ph.D.s with known \"definite\" plans: 71.4 percent of all Ph. D.s in 1973, 68.5 percent in 1979, and 65.8 percent in 1989. Comparisons with recent data from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown the data on \"definite\" postgraduation plans to be a reasonable predictor of the actual employment status of new Ph.D.s in the year following the doctorate. (The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, enginecring, and humanities fields.) According to the 1989 SDR, 97.2 percent of the 1987-1988 Ph.D.s who had indicated \"definite\" employment plans in the United States at the time of graduation were in the U.S. labor force as of February 1989. Even among non-U.S. citizens, the percentages of new Ph.D.s in the U.S. labor force a year after graduation were quite high (98.5 percent of permanent residents and 94.8 percent of temporary residents). In addition, 94.4 percent of all graduates with immediate postgraduation plans in academe and 90.7 percent of those with plans in industry were working in the same sectors one year later. 61.0 percent in humanities; 68.3 percent in education; and 71.0 percent in professional/other fields. Virtually all of the Ph.D.s who reported \"definite\" commitments also indicated their plans for employment versus study; the only groups with a nonresponse rate of more than one percent to this question were American Indians and blacks (among U.S. citizens and permanent residents) and humanities Ph.D.s.
