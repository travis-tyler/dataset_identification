Only 22% of life science PhD recipients held tenure or tenure-track jobs in 2010, according to that year's NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and the percentage is likely to decrease as science funding continues to be limited while more and more trainees earn life science PhDs.\nCompounding the problem, the hiring process itself can be inefficient and ineffective. ''You see the same 15 candidates at all the schools, and one or two of those candidates get offered all the positions, so the other searches go empty-handed,'' Henne says. ''There has to be a change. The classical method isn't going to work with so many qualified candidates.'' Roger Brownsey, head of the biochemistry and molecular biology department at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, experienced similar frustration from the other side of the process when his department was conducting its most recent search and encountered great difficulty choosing between the top candidates. ''We had about 160 applications, and it was an extremely high quality,'' Brownsey says. ''We had several rounds of iterative discussions trying to whittle the numbers down. The top five had remarkably strong records. The top two candidates, we thought they were both spectacular, and we would have dearly loved to have hired them both.'' They ended up making the final hiring decision based primarily on which candidate's research fit better into the department's strategic direction, and Brownsey plans to follow the careers of the other four front-runners as well. ''I have tremendous optimism for what they might achieve,'' he says."}, {"section_title": "Talk It Out", "text": "Some hiring committees are adopting new approaches to help them find the best candidates for their departments. Traditionally, hiring committees have relied primarily on candidates' paper track records, including their publication lists, research proposals, and recommendations, to choose just a handful of candidates to be invited to campus for in-person interviews. Given the huge number of applicants that many committees are considering these days, this approach can unfairly discriminate against people who may have great potential but are not considered because they have taken nontraditional career paths. On the other end of the spectrum, inviting candidates based only on their paper records can also end up wasting everyone's time if the hiring committee knows right at the beginning of the visit that the candidate isn't right-which is frequently the case, according to Northwestern University professor Milan Mrksich. ''Within ten minutes, you either have a really strong feeling that they're special or you're reasonably certain that they're not the right candidate for your department,'' he says.\nAn improvement, which Mrksich first suggested to his biomedical engineering department and later to cell and molecular biology department chair Robert Goldman, would be adding a videoconferencing step, for example with the free tool Skype, that would allow members of the hiring committee to ''meet'' with a broader spectrum of candidates before deciding who to invite for an in-person interview. ''Skype gives people who may be a little bit different a chance to demonstrate how they're thinking about their science and really get the committee excited about having them come out for an interview,'' Mrksich says. According to Goldman, during the most recent recruiting round for the cell and molecular biology department, the Skype interview convinced the search committee to pursue one or two candidates who otherwise would not have been considered. ''I would say the Skype interview for some people really made a difference,'' Goldman says. ''We were very impressed with some people that we otherwise might not have picked. '' In addition, the Skype interview can help rule out candidates who look promising on paper but may lack particular required characteristics. ''One thing you can't determine from the written package is whether the person has the full skill set to build and lead a cutting-edge laboratory,'' including the softer people skills required to be an effective mentor and a productive member of the department, Mrksich says. ''In a Skype interview you can identify those people, or at least the people who have the potential to be those people, pretty quickly.'' Without the video interview,'' he says, ''half of the candidates that come to campus probably realistically aren't strong contenders for the position for reasons that would have been evident after a Skype interview.'' Dileep Varma, who was recently offered a job in Goldman's department and went through the Skype interview process, thought it was very useful and encourages other departments to consider instituting similar approaches. ''I think it's great,'' he said. ''Instead of just reading the application material, they can actually talk and get a feel for the prospective candidate.''"}, {"section_title": "Apples to Apples", "text": "Even departments that use Skype can't interview all the applicants, so hiring committees have also developed additional ''Sometimes we really have to sell somebody who doesn't have a lot of Nature and Cell papers because we know their science is very good and they're going to be very important in the future.''-Robert Goldman, Northwestern University tools to help standardize candidate evaluation. For example, UT Southwestern cell biology chair Sandra Schmid, who like Goldman has introduced a Skype step to her interview process, also implemented a set of questions that applicants must answer in their cover letters to help determine who gets a Skype interview. The questions address research accomplishments, including articulating the significance of their contributions to the field and describing any unpublished work, future plans, and applicants' personal stories, including attributes that will make them successful and any extenuating circumstances or hardships they think the committee should be aware of as they evaluate the candidate's application. ''We wanted to hear in their own words what problems they've been tackling and what's important to them,'' Schmid explains. ''From the answers you understand what they think are highpriority research questions and that they know how to articulate them.'' And in her first round of recruitment, she did feel that this approach helped her identify the strongest candidates who would be the best fit for her department.\nSchmid's approach helps her collect more sophisticated and nuanced information from her applicants so that she can make better-informed hiring decisions, but it doesn't address another key issue: the effect that prejudices, conscious and unconscious, can have on the evaluation process. It is well known that women and underrepresented minorities are less likely to obtain faculty positions than their white male counterparts, and research suggests that this imbalance is caused at least in part by ingrained biases, referred to as ''schema.'' University of Michigan professor Pamela Raymond was co-PI on a 2001 NSF grant that aimed to use a data-driven approach to identify and address the way that these schema affect academic hiring in the sciences, particularly with respect to women. The program, taken over by the university after the grant funding ended, has since expanded its mission to address hiring biases to increase faculty diversity in all fields.\n''We make hidden, unconscious judgments that are related to the schemas we hold,'' Raymond explains. For example, Raymond was surprised when she found, based on an online implicit association test, that she, a female scientist, is biased against women in science. ''I tend to associate men and masculine traits with science,'' she says. ''It's in me too. It's in all of us. It's culturally shared.'' To minimize the effect of these unconscious biases on hiring decisions, the University of Michigan team developed and implemented faculty recruitment workshops that are open to all faculty at the university and are required for those serving on hiring committees in the College of Literature, Science & the Arts and the College of Engineering; during these workshops, the team presents data about schemas, how they can affect hiring, and strategies to minimize their influence.\nOne of their primary strategies involves implementing a new evaluation process. ''It is clear from the literature that the more comprehensive the evaluation, the more nuanced. The more we are provided opportunities not to rely on schemas and to be more thoughtful, the better the evaluation,'' Raymond says. To facilitate more sophisticated candidate evaluation, the team developed detailed ''evaluation tools'' that ask evaluators to rate candidates on specific items, such as their scholarly impact, their fit with department priorities, and their potential ability to supervise students. In addition, each evaluator must indicate his or her level of interaction with the candidate, from simply reading the CV to spending significant time with the candidate, so the committee knows how much weight to give to each evaluation. ''The richness of the evaluation tool is what provides a more fair evaluation,'' Raymond says. ''It tends to cause people to think more carefully about the various qualifications that candidates would bring and the differences among the candidates.'' Raymond was chair of the molecular, cellular, and developmental biology department from 2008 to 2014, during which she changed the hiring process from a system in which committee members simply ranked candidates in their order of preference to a system that relied on the use of the candidate evaluation tool to make hiring decisions. ''The discussions that we have in the faculty meetings to decide on our top choice are very different, with more things to consider,'' Raymond says. ''The evaluation tool has allowed candidates to rise to the top who otherwise may not have been the first choice-and a large number of those have been women.'' The faculty members were somewhat resistant at first, she says, because it seemed to them like it took too long to evaluate candidates in this way, but now they are on board. ''It's not that we're trying to make extra work,'' she emphasizes. ''We're really trying to make better decisions.'' Raymond also emphasizes that in the long term, eliminating the role of schemas Search-Committee Toolkit in hiring will require deeper cultural changes within the academy. ''Tools are great helpers and ways to put best practices forward, but change comes from making people more aware,'' she says. ''It's a matter of increasing the awareness of everyone who's involved in the process to guard against using schemas and try to be open-minded and look for candidates who maybe don't look like everyone else but could bring something unique. It's the attitude that's the key and is the sustaining force for change.''"}, {"section_title": "Keep an Open Mind", "text": "One factor that can make a candidate appear unusual is a publication record that is missing the names of the highest impact journals. Although many applicants expect that they have to have publications in the highest profile journals to even be considered, which may be true for some institutions, many search committees make a conscious effort to carefully consider each applicant's work on its own merits rather than the journal in which it is published. ''We look more at the content of whatever comes out and what they're working on rather than the journal impact factor,'' says Goldman.\nWhereas the committee members can evaluate candidates based on the merit of their work, higher-level administrators who sometimes have to approve hiring decisions probably will not have the subject-area expertise to appreciate the importance of an individual's work without relying on crude metrics like impact factors. Therefore, hiring committees may have to work harder with the administration in cases where they have decided on a candidate who may initially appear less qualified than other applicants based on the publication records. ''Sometimes we really have to sell somebody who doesn't have a lot of Nature and Cell papers,'' Goldman says, ''because we know their science is very good and they're going to be very important in the future.'' Schmid takes this stance a step further, arguing that postdocs should not worry so much about the number of publications they have before they apply for faculty jobs-and that search committees should be more open to considering candidates who have spent less time in their postdocs but nonetheless show the potential to be successful independent researchers. ''The bottom line is, you're hiring people for potential, so why are we making them wait another year?'' she asks. ''They'll have more papers, but they'll be the same person.'' Schmid's advice to postdocs: ''Call me when you're ready, not when you think I'll think you're ready.'' Putting her money where her mouth is, she made her first job offer as chair to a candidate before he had even submitted for publication a crucial part of his postdoctoral work, which ended up being published in Cell. ''We knew that his research fit perfectly into the department, so we brought him out, we liked him, and we offered him the job,'' Schmid says. A year and a half into his professorship, she is very happy with his progress and reports that he recently received a fundable priority score for his R01 grant application. In addition, she encouraged one of her postdocs, Costin Antonescu, to apply for a faculty position relatively early, about two and a half years after he started in her lab. His publication record showed that he had been productive, but he didn't have any papers in the ''big'' journals. Nonetheless, he got the job. ''Many people I talked to about the job search process gave me the traditional spiel, that unless you have a first author Nature, Cell, or Science paper on your CV, don't even bother applyingwhich I'm very glad I ignored, because I think it probably holds a lot of people back,'' he says. ''Postdocs all have this sense that they have to have a CV that's a certain length,'' Schmid adds. ''I don't know how the idea became so ingrained that you have to have a Cell paper in order to get a job.'' Schmid also emphasizes that just because a postdoc has a job lined up doesn't mean that he or she should leave current work unfinished. In fact, she argues, getting the job search out of the way can help the postdoc be more productive, which in the end benefits the lab, the PI, and the science. ''There's nothing happier than a postdoc with a job, because they can just focus laserbeam sharp on the science they need to get finished to complete that phase of their career and move on to the next.'' She acknowledges, though, that there is still hesitation around this idea, and recent Northwestern hire Varma may provide an illustrative example. Varma obtained his position at Northwestern in his second year of searching for a job, after a first year in which he didn't have much luck. He believes that his greater success the second time around was at least in part because he was able to strengthen his CV by publishing another paper. He also obtained an NIH grant that provided independent funding, which he thinks may have been an even more important factor. Goldman confirmed the general importance of funding in the hiring decision. ''The institutions are basically saying, 'We're putting all this money into a person, what's the prognosis? Are they going to help us pay the investment back?''' he explains. Given the current financial environment, ''we're looking for people who we think can get NIH grants, and people who have grants already,'' he says, but he also emphasizes the difficulty of really determining this potential. ''It's not clear who will make it in the long run. That's the one thing I've learned after many years of hiring people: you just don't know.'' He's not without optimism, though. ''None of our newer faculty are without funding, and that's an indication that we're doing something right.''"}, {"section_title": "Rachel Bernstein", "text": "San Francisco, CA, USA http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.006"}]
