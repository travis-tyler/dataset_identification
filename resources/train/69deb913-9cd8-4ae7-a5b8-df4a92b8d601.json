Introduction", "text": "In the twenty-first century, legislatures and educational bureaucracies creak into action at the publication of the latest international league tables of educational attainment.\n1 In the U.S., such concerns have a long history and a particular focus on math, dating back to post-Sputnik anxiety about falling behind in a technological race with economic and national security implications. This led to reforms like the \"New Math\" of the 1960s, measures like the Education for Economic Security Act of 1984, and debates like the current \"Math Wars\" about classroom pedagogy. But these are only the most recent manifestations of national math anxiety. More than a century ago it was British fear of German technological ascendancy that spurred a reform movement demanding better mathematical, technical and scientific education. Concern with educational policies is not misplaced, according to a voluminous (if inconclusive) literature on the determinants of economic growth. 3 But growth regressions have yielded few insights into the importance of different types of knowledge, education, or skill. Large panel datasets rarely have information more detailed than gender-and level-specific enrollment or attainment rates. An oft-cited analysis indicating that engineering students raise growth while law students lower it is the exception rather than 1 Influential comparative projects include TIMMS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study; International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement), PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment; OECD), and ALL (Adult Literacy and Lifeskills; Statistics Canada and OECD). 2 This fear was captured in the title of a well-known and pessimistic analysis of the industrial position of the country: \"Made in Germany.\" See Sanderson (1999) . 3 A few influential studies that investigate the connection between schooling and economic growth include Levine and Renelt (1992) , Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) , Barro and Lee (1994) , Barro (1997) , Sala-i-Martin (1997) , Bils and Klenow (2001) , and Hanushek and Kimko (2000) . the rule. 4 In studies of individual labor market outcomes, the consistent and powerful predictive capacity of human capital variables is not in question. Debate concerns only the precise mechanisms at work, for example whether education primarily screens ability or creates it, or whether skill-or college-premia are increasing in an era of rapid technological change. In this context, achievement and skill test results are often introduced as measures of ability alongside educational attainment and experience variables. Invariably, ability measured in this way matters; occasionally, it is broken down by specific skill areas such as quantitative and verbal reasoning. 5 In a study of the U.S. labor market, Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995) found that cognitive ability had greater predictive power than educational attainment, with mathematics the ability most highly correlated with wages. Similarly, Rivera-Batiz (1992) found that \"quantitative literacy\" significantly (in both senses) raised the probability of full-time employment among U.S. workers. Outside the U.S. recent studies have found numeracy to be positively associated with labor force participation, full-time employment, annual weeks worked, and income in Britain, Canada, and Australia. 6 Often numeracy dominates literacy as an explanatory factor, particularly for women and among the less educated.\nInterest in the historical evolution of human capital has been given fresh stimulus by the recent development of very-long-run growth models. These models attempt a unified explanation of pre-modern Malthusian dynamics and modern economic growth, typically assigning a key role to a fertility transition in which families switch from 4 Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1991) . 5 Studies with evidence on general cognitive ability include Neal and Johnson (1996) and Heckman (1995) . 6 See Chiswick, Lee, and Miller (2003) for Australia; Charette and Meng (1998) and Finnie and Meng (2001) for Canada; Parsons and Bynner (2005) for Britain. eighteenth centuries. But there is little information available on the rest of Europe. Allen's (2003) conclusion that human capital has no ability to explain progress and poverty in Europe between 1300 and 1800 may result more from his use of urbanization as a proxy than from literacy's actual irrelevance. Indeed, Baten and van Zanden (2006) reach the opposite conclusion using book production to measure human capital.\nWhat of numeracy as a historical measure of human capital? For Weber, Sombart, and Schumpeter, numeracy was at the very heart of modern, rational capitalism. They traced the roots of both to the invention of double-entry bookkeeping in late medieval\nItaly. Carruthers and Espeland (1991) describe in some detail the process of abstraction and organization inherent in compiling a ledger, which made possible the development of concepts like capital, depreciation, and rate of profit. 10 It is no accident that the introduction of Arabic numerals into Europe (by the merchant Leonardo of Pisa, a.k.a.\nFibonacci) and the earliest accounts of mathematics education date from this same time and place. Numerous scuole d'abbaco thrived in Renaissance Florence according to Goldthwaite (1972) , where the young sons of the commercial classes studied for a year or two a mathematics curriculum that would change little before the nineteenth century."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Italy remained the European center of publication and instruction in mathematics and accounting until at least 1500, according to Swetz (1987) .

It came to have a powerful rhetorical significance, as a symbol of meticulousness and probity. Equally important was the triumph of \"political arithmetic\" as the favored tool for assessing the experiment of republican America and influencing public opinion. This presupposed a certain basic level of numeracy. society he or she inhabits. Approximation in age awareness manifests itself in the phenomenon of age heaping in self-reported age data. Individuals lacking certain knowledge of their age rarely state this openly, but choose instead a figure they deem plausible. They do not choose randomly, but have a systematic tendency to prefer \"attractive\" numbers, such as those ending in 5 or 0, or even numbers, or in some societies numbers with other specific terminal digits. Age heaping can be assessed from any sufficiently numerous source of age data: census returns, tombstones, necrologies, muster lists, legal records, or tax data, for example. While care must be exercised in ascertaining possible biases, such data are in principle available much more widely than signature rates and other proxies for human capital.\nAge heaping is a well-known phenomenon among demographers. Already a halfcentury ago influential studies by Bachi (1951) and Myers (1954) investigated age heaping and its correlation with education levels within and across countries. Myers (1976) demonstrated the correlation at the individual level between age awareness and income. For others, including epidemiologists, age heaping is a problem to be solved, a source of distortion in age-specific vital rates. In this context it remains a standard topic in U.N. analyses of developing country population data. 13 Development economists and anthropologists use age heaping as a measure of data quality and consistency.\nMeanwhile, historians have studied age heaping as a topic of interest in its own right. A pioneering example is the study by Herlihy and Klapisch-Zuber (1978) of the Florentine tax records from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In a chapter devoted to age 13 Discussions of age heaping as a problem in the demography literature include Coale and Kisker (1986) , Preston, Elo, Rosenwaike and Hill (1996) , and Vallin, Mesl\u00e9, Adamets, and Pyrozhkov (2002) . Denic, Khatib and Saadi (2004) reported ages in 1881 with discrepancies of from two to five years. While countywide age heaping had a limited impact on individual outcomes once other county characteristics were controlled for, individual age discrepancy has a significant impact on socio-economic status, wages (10% higher for 0-discrepancy individuals), and the probability of rural-urban migration. What these studies have in common is that all find evidence of significant age heaping, and that it varies across individuals or groups in a way consistent with its interpretation as a measure of human capital.\nResearchers in a number of disciplines are familiar with age heaping, and it has been deployed as an indicator of human capital in studies of particular times and places.\nBut several different measures of age heaping have been employed, complicating comparisons. And more generally, awareness of age heaping is somehow less than the sum of these parts. Age heaping has an unexploited potential to yield new insights into the comparative historical evolution of human capital. In this paper we sketch the outlines of an age heaping methodology. Sections II and III use simulations to investigate the reliability of various available measures of heaping for the first time. Sections IV and V establish the connection of age heaping with another measure of human capital -literacy, at both the individual and aggregate level, in both contemporary and historical data.\nSection VI provides an illustrative example of age heaping's potential to track human capital over a very long span of time and across widely differing societies. Section VII offers concluding thoughts and suggestions for further research."}, {"section_title": "II. Measuring age-heaping", "text": "To deploy age-heaping as a useful indicator of human capital, we require a measure that allows us to track its variation over time and across groups. This is a question of how much age heaping is present in the sample, conceptually distinct from the question whether age heaping is present at all. For the second of these questions, the familiar Pearson chi-squared statistic would be suitable:\n(1)\nwhere H is chosen to stand for heaping and P for Pearson, i indexes the k ages to be considered, and n i and \u02c6 n i are the observed and expected frequencies, respectively. Note that the chi-squared statistic does not attempt to estimate a parameter such as, for In this paper two indices based on the chi-squared statistic are considered. Both are mathematically scale-independent, and both weight deviations by the age's expected sample share so as to reduce the influence of potentially unreliable observations. They differ in their methods for standardizing the deviations. The first, dubbed the \"ABC\"\nIndex after the initials of authors, is a weighted sum of the squared percentage deviations from predicted values:\nwhere the notation is as before and N denotes the sample size. If possible discrepancies between expected and actual sample size are ignored, H ABC can be rewritten as\nthat it is in fact a scaled version of the chi-squared statistic.\nSquaring the deviations has the effect of heavily weighting outliers. The second index, \"Lambda,\" avoids this by relying on the absolute value of the percentage deviations:\nNeither the ABC nor the Lambda Index embodies particular assumptions about how expected frequencies are generated. Both can take on a wide range of values depending on the number of ages k and the particular distribution of expected frequencies."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "Several commonly used indices aggregate observed and expected frequencies over terminal digits before calculating deviations. Bachi's index sums the differences between actual and expected frequencies of each terminal digit, considering only the 15 The Lambda Index was proposed by Mokyr (1983) , who also considered a \"Gamma\" index, which can be rewritten as\n, showing it to be a weighted chisquared type index. In simulations, Gamma's performance did not differ in interesting ways from that of H ABC and H \u03bb .\npositive values -intuitively similar to the use of absolute values in (3). 16 The resulting sum is expressed relative to sample size:\nwhere I(j) is an indicator variable as defined above, and j indexes terminal digits from 0 to 9. The Bachi index is not mathematically scale dependent, weights terminal digits with positive deviations equally, and makes no assumptions about how to derive the expected frequencies for each terminal digit. If all expected terminal digit frequencies are assumed to be 10%, H B can take values between 0 and 0.90 and can be intuitively interpreted as an approximation of the percentage of the sample reporting an inaccurate age.\nAnother commonly used measure is Myers' Blended Index, which differs from those considered thus far by making a specific assumption about expected frequencies, and by making an adjustment to observed frequencies. Predicted terminal digit shares are set at 10% (meaning the index must be applied to age intervals that are multiples of 10 years). This is of course not always a realistic assumption; in a sample of individuals aged 60 to 79, one would expect more ages ending in 0 than in 9, for example. Rather than adjust expected frequencies accordingly, H M adjusts the observed frequencies using a \"blending\" procedure. 17 Unlike H B , which considers only positive deviations and expresses them relative to N, the Myers Index sums the absolute values of all deviations, and expresses them relative to 2N:\nwhere \u02dc n j is the \"blended\" observed frequency of a particular terminal digit j. The index is not mathematically scale dependent, and can vary between 0 and 0.90 like the Bachi.\nThe indices considered so far can be used to detect any type of heaping, and do not rely on particular mechanisms for generating expected frequencies (with the exception of the Myers Index). More specialized measures focus on a particular type of heaping. The well-known Whipple Index is designed to capture heaping on ages ending in 0 or 5. H W sums the frequencies of all ages ending in 0 or 5 and expresses the result relative to one-fifth the sample size:\nThe summation notation in the denominator (rather than the N used in Equations 2-5) is meant to emphasize that H W must be defined over an interval in which each terminal digit occurs an equal number of times, such as 23 to 62. Implicitly, equal terminal digit shares in unheaped data are assumed. This would be correct for a uniform distribution of ages, but can only be approximate for typical samples in which frequency decreases with age.\nThe Whipple index makes no adjustment to correct for this problem. H W can range from 0 in the case of no observations on 0s and 5s, through 1 in the case of a uniform distribution of terminal digits, to 5 in the case of 100% heaping. In application, H W is typically multiplied by 100.\nAn alternative index of heaping on the terminal digits 0 and 5 makes a less restrictive assumption regarding expected frequencies: that they evolve approximately linearly over any three year age range. The \"Multiples of Five\" index is a simple, equally weighted, average of the frequencies of terminal digits 0 and 5, each expressed relative to the average frequency of immediately adjacent ages, as in the following example:"}, {"section_title": "III. Evaluating Indices of Age-Heaping", "text": "Which of the indices defined in Section II is best? The familiar criteria used to assess estimator performance, bias and variability, are not directly applicable here, as the indices under consideration are not estimators of unknown parameters. Three desirable properties of an age-heaping index are statistical scale-independence, a linear response to the degree of heaping, and the ability to reliably rank samples from populations with different degrees of heaping. Because the distributions of the indices are unknown, these properties must be investigated by simulation."}, {"section_title": "a. Simulation details", "text": "Three types and five degrees of heaping are distinguished in the study. The types are: heaping on even numbers, heaping on multiples of five, and mixtures of the two. The degrees are: for the pure types, 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent of the sample subjected to heaping; and for the mixed type 5 percent even-heaping plus an additional 5, 10, 15, or 20 percent multiples of five heaping. The predominance in the mixed scheme of heaping on multiples of five over even-heaping conforms to the pattern found in a wide range of historical datasets. The mixed schemes are the focus of most discussion here.\nThe three heaping patterns were imposed on random samples drawn from distributions in which frequencies decrease with age, as is typical of data from military, census, and randomly-sampled sources. More specifically, samples of size 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 were drawn from the 23-42 range of a N(20,10) distribution rounded to integer values, then heaped according to the relevant scheme. The entire exercise was repeated for the wider age range 18-57, yielding results sufficiently close to those reported here as not to merit separate discussion. 1000 repetitions were carried out for each sample size and heaping scheme.\nAs noted in Section II, the ABC, Lambda, and Bachi indices do not embody specific assumptions about expected frequencies. In the simulation study, expected frequencies were generated using locally weighted regression. The intuition is to use a regression of observed frequencies on age to generate predicted frequencies, allowing the estimated relationship to vary locally. For each age, the slope is estimated using only data in a window around that age (here set to include 80% of all observations), using a kernel (here the tricube) to weight them inversely with the distance from the age being considered. This approach is similar to other smoothing methods, in particular kernel density estimation. It has the advantage of being easily implemented and flexible, making no a priori assumptions about the form of the underlying (unheaped) distribution of ages.\nIts potential disadvantage is oversensitivity to (undersmoothing of) the observed, randomly-or systematically-heaped frequencies. In principle, this problem can be addressed by optimal choice of bandwidth. But this choice depends on the type and degree of heaping and on the underlying distribution of unheaped ages, all of which are unknown in practice. Hence, a uniform (non-optimal) bandwidth was applied for all sample sizes, heaping schemes, and indices. The evaluation of the ABC, Lambda, and\nBachi indices is in fact a joint evaluation of the index itself and the lowess method of deriving expected frequencies. Similarly, the Myers Index is evaluated together with its blending method of adjusting observed frequencies."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1 about here.", "text": "As an example of the results, Figure 1 displays kernel density estimates of the distribution of the Lambda Index under the mixed heaping scheme with a sample size of 1000. The leftmost curve corresponds to no heaping, the rightmost to maximum heaping.\nIt is evident that on average the index value increases with the degree of heaping, as it was designed to. The graph also indicates for this specific case that the increase is not linear with the degree of heaping, that the distribution is right-skewed at low degrees of heaping, that the variance of the distribution increases, and that there is substantial overlap in the distributions for successive degrees of heaping."}, {"section_title": "b. Scale dependence", "text": "The indices under study are mathematically independent of scale by construction.\nBut they may be statistically scale dependent, in the sense that their expected value may be a function of sample size. Random sampling variation always creates deviations between observed and expected frequencies, even when the population is unheaped.\nSince such deviations are squared, converted to absolute values, or considered only when positive in Equations 2-5, there is no tendency for them to cancel each other out, so that the means of these indices are not zero even in the absence of heaping. When such deviations are expressed relative to expected frequencies or sample size, however, they tend to diminish in larger samples. This creates what is termed here statistical scale dependence, which creates the same difficulties as mathematical scale dependence. A useful gauge of reliability in discerning the degree of heaping turns out to be the probability of incorrectly ranking sample pairs. A ranking error occurs when the sample from a population with a low degree of heaping, say 05-05, yields an index value exceeding that for the sample from a population subject to a greater degree of heaping such as 05-10. We could write this as H for the Bachi Index. The probability of a negative difference, hence a ranking error, is\ngiven by the shaded area, which in this case equals 0.15. Table 1 is that none of the indices perform reliably in small samples.\nIn samples of 250, the \"all-purpose\" indices routinely misrank samples from unheaped populations as having more heaping than those from 05-05 populations: 37% of the time.\nThe Whipple Index offers dramatically better performance for low degrees of heaping, and remains the best by a small margin even with more severe heaping. In large samples, the accuracy of all indices is much improved, the error probabilities comfortably small.\nAgain the Whipple Index is clearly the most accurate of the group, especially in distinguishing among relatively low degrees of heaping. It bears emphasis that the Whipple is quite incapable of capturing forms of heaping other than multiples of five.\nAmong the more flexible indices, the Bachi offers the lowest error probabilities. While all indices have trouble reliably distinguishing fine differences in the degree of heaping, the results in Table 2 indicate considerably better accuracy for larger heaping differences. Here again, the Whipple Index is clearly the most reliable -so long heaping on terminal digits 5 and 0 characterizes the data. In large samples, all indices are extremely accurate, with incorrect rankings not a practical problem.\nTables 1, 2 about here."}, {"section_title": "IV. Age heaping and illiteracy today", "text": "To assess age heaping's potential as a measure of human capital, we begin by using contemporary data to investigate its range of variation and its correlation with illiteracy, the most commonly available alternative indicator. The Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) sponsored by USAID are a rich source of individual-level data on the health, nutrition, and household demographics of women in developing countries. Indices of age heaping and rates of illiteracy were calculated from the DHS data for women aged 23-42 from 415 regions in 52 countries. A functional definition of illiteracy was used in the surveys: the inability to read \"easily\" or to read \"a whole sentence. The probability of reporting a multiple of five age is modeled as a logistic function of both individual characteristics and regional illiteracy. Table 4 reports the estimated marginal effects of each explanatory variable, evaluated at the mean of all variables. In the most basic model, personal illiteracy raises the probability of reporting a multiple of five age by 5.7 percentage points, a large effect relative to the six points of excess frequency observed at these ages, and the estimate is highly statistically significant. When regional illiteracy is added to the equation, its estimated effect is significant in both senses of the word. Increasing the regional illiteracy rate by one standard deviation (26.8) from its mean (47.7) increases the predicted probability of an 19 These surveys overlap the regional data sources and include repeated surveys of the same country, but not the same households in the same country except by chance.\nindividual reporting a heaped age by about three percentage points, equivalent to the effect of individual illiteracy in this equation. In columns three and four the effect of the regional illiteracy rate is estimated separately for literate and illiterate individuals. The constants (not reported) of course differ across the two groups. But so do the slope coefficients; among illiterates, the marginal effect of regional illiteracy is more than twice that among literates. Illiterates are in this sense more dependent on their neighbors. We can probe the determinants of age heaping more deeply by adding age-group dummies to the explanatory variables. The probability of reporting a heaped age can vary with age itself, even controlling for personal and social illiteracy. One reason is that older individuals are more likely to forget their ages. 20 (The extremely old, who sometimes deliberately exaggerate their age, have been excluded from the sample.) Secondly, society may provide different incentives to different groups to distort their true age. For example women still single in their thirties or beyond might feel pressure to report a low age to increase \"marriageability\", and this distortion could be associated with some form of heaping (though not necessarily multiples of five). 21 Finally, the degree of regional illiteracy may have been greater when today's older individuals were young, or alternatively the quality and quantity of education may have changed in ways not captured by personal illiteracy but relevant for calculating or knowing one's age. In cross sections like the DHS data, the time trend that might capture such effects is indistinguishable from an aging effect. The third model in Table 4 therefore adds 20 See the discussions in Kaiser and Engle (1993) and Ewbank (1981) . 21 See Retherford and Mishra (2001) and Narasimhan et al. (1997) .\ndummies for age below 30 and age greater than or equal to 40 (thereby taking the 30s as the reference group).\nBoth personal and regional literacy continue to exert a substantial impact in the expanded model. Personal illiteracy raises the probability of reporting a \"heaped\" age by 2.1%. Regional literacy has a similarly powerful effect; starting from the sample mean, increasing the illiteracy rate by 20 percentage points raises the probability of any individual (literate or not) reporting a heaped age by some 2.4%. Finally, the age-group effects indicate that the probability of reporting a heaped age rises with age itself, by 2.5% from the 20s to the 30s, by a further 1.4% in the 40s and above. Experimentation with alternative specifications confirms the impression that the largest increase in ageheaping occurs in the 30s, which might suggest cultural influences or a recent expansion of schooling, rather than age-induced forgetfulness. The individual-level analysis thus confirms that age-heaping reflects a number of different factors, all of interest to economists: personal human capital, social capital in the form of record keeping, awareness of the calendar, age-specific rights and responsibilities, or generalized education, as well as cultural factors specific to particular societies."}, {"section_title": "V. Age heaping and illiteracy in the past", "text": "Are the patterns identified in Section IV for contemporary developing countries also to be found in historical data? We seek an answer to this question in U.S. census data from the nineteenth century, specifically the Integrated Public Use Micro Samples (IPUMS) of the censuses of 1850, 1870, and 1900. 22 Records for nearly 650,000 men and women aged 20-69, with data on race, age, literacy, and birthplace were extracted from the IPUMS databases. Given the difficulty of precisely estimating age heaping in small samples, only the 83 American states and mostly-European foreign birthplaces with at least 100 observations were used. In the early censuses, literacy was defined simply as the ability to read and write any language. The absence of any reference to proficiency makes illiteracy rates lower than in the DHS data.\nAs shown in Figure 6 , age heaping and illiteracy vary quite widely across birth regions with at least 100 observations, from less than one percent among the white Regression analysis reveals patterns that vary only slightly over time and between groups. The estimated effects of birth region illiteracy on age heaping are strong, positive, and statistically significant in all cases (Table 5) . Indeed, the relationship is stronger than in the DHS data. For comparability, the semilog specification was retained although there is little evidence of nonlinearity in the IPUMS data. With two exceptions, point estimates of the slope cluster around 0.008, a value clearly greater than the figures near 0.006 for the Whipple Index in Table 3 . Also greater are the regression R 2 s in the census data, indicating a less noisy relationship in historical than in contemporary data.\nThe estimated slopes imply that a one standard deviation increase in illiteracy predicts an increase in age heaping of from .7 to .9 standard deviations, depending on the sample in question. In two cases, coefficient estimates are lower: blacks in 1870 and native whites in 1900. In both cases this can be attributed to sample composition. 23 It is worth noting that the correlation of illiteracy and age heaping is quite robust, emerging also in pooled and region fixed-effects models. Individual data permit a more detailed analysis of the determinants of age heaping. Table 6 reports for the IPUMS data the marginal effects estimated from regressions like those underlying Table 4 (DHS data), in which the probability of reporting a multiple of five age is modeled as a logistic function of personal illiteracy, the regional illiteracy rate, and age group. Dummy variables are added for women (both genders being present in this sample), and for the Irish. Irish immigrants constitute 6% of the sample, trailing only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio among birthplaces. They present high values of illiteracy, but very high values of age heaping relative to the rest of the sample. (African-American populations display the reverse pattern after the Civil War: high values of age heaping, but extremely high illiteracy rates, relative to the sample average.) 23 In the case of African-Americans, the slope declines as former slaves in the Southern states enter the sample in 1870. (In the 1850 census, slaves were not individually enumerated, so the IPUMS data include only free blacks.) Values of both illiteracy and age heaping among the former slaves are initially bunched around extremely high values, without displaying a very systematic relationship. By 1900, significant differentiation among freed black populations emerges, conforming well to the typical log-linear relationship. As for native whites, one third of the decrease in slope in 1900 is due to the addition of South Dakota to the sample, another third to other Midwestern and Western states.\nThe estimates indicate that the probability of reporting a heaped age depends on both personal illiteracy and the illiteracy rate in the region of birth, in all censuses and for all groups. And the order of magnitude of the estimated effects is quite similar to that in the contemporary DHS data. For native whites, regional illiteracy is initially the more powerful factor; in 1850 personal illiteracy raises the probability of reporting a heaped age by less than 1%, while a 20 point increase in regional illiteracy raises the same probability by 4%. Even a literate person in a highly illiterate society is not so unlikely to report a heaped age, then. By 1900, it is instead personal illiteracy that dominates, raising heaping probabilities by over 3% (exactly the excess frequency observed for ages divisible by five), while a 20 percentage point increase in illiteracy raises this probability by only 2%. African-Americans show a similar trend in the relative strength of the two effects, though both are more powerful than among whites in 1900. Among native-born Americans, then, age heaping comes more and more to indicate personal than social circumstances. Among immigrants, by contrast, the evolution is in the opposite direction, making generalization difficult. In some other respects there is a measure of convergence, both within and across groups. Among both native-and foreign-born whites, initial malefemale differences diminish to statistical and meaningful insignificance by 1900. And in all three groups, clear differences in heaping propensity by age diminish markedly. In this respect convergence between groups is also evident; the ageing -age heaping effect is initially much stronger in the immigrant and African-American populations, and among them it diminishes most strongly. This is again consistent with age heaping reflecting less and less the individual's environment and demographic characteristics, more and more his or her individual human capital. "}, {"section_title": "VI. Human capital accumulation in the long run", "text": "The evidence indicates that age heaping is well correlated with literacy, at both the aggregate and individual level, in both contemporary and recent historical periods, within countries around the world and between them. In addition to its inherent interest as an indicator of numeracy, age heaping can therefore also be taken as a proxy for literacy.\nIn both senses it is a measure of human capital. But age data are available for many times and places where other measures such as literacy are not. Age heaping can be estimated from any documentary or archaeological source yielding a sufficiently large sample, from tombstones to marriage registers, necrologies, legal records, muster lists, and of course census data. To illustrate age heaping's potential as culture-and time-spanning index of human capital, we calculate values of the Whipple Index from published and archival data from several countries, over a period running from classical antiquity up through the nineteenth century (Figure 7) . Tombstone data may be subject to bias in age heaping, but the direction is unclear. On the one hand, primarily wealthier families would have been able to afford funerary monuments; on the other, ages may have been estimated by relatives or religious authorities. In Figure 7 , Duncan-Jones' index of rounding has been converted to a Whipple Index by a simple linear transformation and averaged over men and women."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "The figures for Italy, France (Gaul) and Germany are tightly clustered in the 250-300 range, while that for the Alpine region is something of an outlier (with respect to other provinces not shown in Figure 7 as well). The next available estimate is for one of medieval Europe's most advanced regions, Tuscany. Our calculation covers both sexes and ages 23-62, and is based on data from the celebrated Florentine cadastre of 1427 published by Herlihy and Klapisch-Zuber (1978) . Within Tuscany the Whipple Index varies from 189 for males in the city of Florence to 314 for women in the smaller towns and rural areas. The overall average of 287 shows no meaningful change from Italian values in the Roman Empire a millennium before.\nMoving forward a century to the years around 1500 reveals continued stagnation in human capital levels. The apparent increase in Italian age heaping is in fact probably a regional difference, for the later figure is an average for the southern towns Pozzuoli and Sorrento (modern Campania), based on census data reported in Duncan-Jones. 25 Though data specific to Roman Campania are lacking, the Renaissance value of 378 exceeds that of all Roman provinces but the Alpine region, making any sort of improvement since the earlier period highly unlikely. The German estimates for this period refer to the Southwest region (modern W\u00fcrttemberg). They are based on new archival data exploited 24 The figures for Italy and the Alpine region are simple averages of constituent provinces: Rome and Italy outside Rome in the first case, the provinces of Noricum and Pannonia in the second. Aggregation is advisable where possible due to likely small sample sizes underlying Duncan-Jones' figures. Noricum is in modern Austria. No data are available for Raetia to its west in modern Switzerland. Pannonia, to its east, is in modern Hungary, hence no longer geographically in the Alps. In Roman times, however, the two provinces were ethnically similar and economically integrated. 25 The Pozzuoli census was conducted in 1489, that of Sorrento in 1561. Geography rather than chronology dictated averaging Pozzuoli with Sorrento rather than Tuscany (1427). The original source for the Southern data is Beloch (1937 Other countries in the sample display somewhat different patterns, though sharing the general downward trend. In Germany, the decrease in age heaping is later and more rapid. German estimates for the decades around 1700 are for the town of Lippborg in western Germany (near the Ruhr). The data from the family and soul registers preserved in the city archive are analyzed using age heaping techniques for the first time here. 30 In the space of a few decades, age heaping in Lippborg fell from values around 300, typical of both late medieval and Roman Germany, to decisively lower levels near 200. This rapid fall must have continued, for by the time census data become available for the birth cohorts of the mid-nineteenth century, age heaping has all but disappeared.\nIn the U.S. and Italy, the decrease in age heaping appears to have followed a two- "}, {"section_title": "VII. Summary and directions for future research", "text": "Age heaping has the potential to broaden and deepen the empirical foundation for research on human capital and its role in economic development. It is both a complement and a substitute for literacy-based measures. It complements literacy by revealing different cognitive abilities -abilities that are equally important in determining individual labor market outcomes today, and which arose in tandem with the market economy historically. It is also complementary in the sense of yielding insights not only about individuals but also about the societies in which they live. Age heaping can be a substitute or proxy for (il)literacy, as the two are well correlated between and within countries, in aggregate and individual data, in contemporary and historical contexts.\nThough tenuous at very low levels of illiteracy and age heaping, this correlation is remarkably robust over the full range of observed variation in contemporary and historical data. The type of age heaping that predominates in historical data on European adults (on multiples of five) can be accurately measured using a computationally simple, intuitive indicator: the Whipple Index. With large samples (1,000 or more), even small differences in the Whipple Index reliably reflect differences in the underlying populations. Even with samples as small as 250, differences of the magnitude frequently observed in the historical record (e.g. 250 vs. 150) very rarely result from random variation and can be considered reliable indicators of population differences.\nOur preliminary exploration of age heaping as a measure of human capital illustrates the breadth and power of the approach. It yields comparable estimates from data that range widely in sources (tombstones, tax records, death records, and census data), over time (from antiquity to the turn of the twentieth century), and across space Kernel density estimates (Epanechnikov kernel, bandwidth .01); mixed heaping schemes as described in text; sample size 1000; repetitions 1000. .0 Marginal effects of estimated coefficients of logistic regression, evaluated at means of all variables; IPUMS data on adults aged 20-69; degrees of freedom for the chi-squared likelihood ratio test are 5 or 6 depending on the model, but in all cases the p-value is zero to three decimal places."}]
