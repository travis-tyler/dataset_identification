[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a teaching module on the topic of pressure, developed with STEM approach, on the academic achievements of the students as well as on their attitudes towards STEM. The study employed the explanatory sequential design, as one of mixed method research designs. On the quantitative aspect of the study, a pre-test and post-test control group, quasiexperimental design was used, while phenomenological design was utilized for qualitative aspects. The sample group of the research comprises of 33 7 th grade students studying in a village school located in a district of one of the metropolitan municipalities in Turkey for the Spring Semester of the 2017-2018 school year. A STEM education approach was used in the experimental group for teaching the subject of \"Pressure\" while utilizing the approach as stipulated in the curriculum for the control group. An academic achievement test, an attitude scale for STEM, semi-structured interviews, and the student diaries are the data collection tools used in the study. A significant difference was found between the experimental group and the control group, with the former showing increased academic achievement over the latter in the research. A significant difference was also found between the experimental group and the control group, with the former showing more positive attitudes towards STEM than were shown by the latter. The opinions of the students on STEM education were analyzed in order to study the results obtained from quantitative data. Five themes -feelings and opinions, positive aspects, skills gained, features and problems faced, and the learning process were obtained-as well as 26 codes-with the content analysis of semistructured interviews and students' diaries. It was concluded that involving STEM-based implementations in teaching the subject \"Pressure\" increased the academic success rate and attitude scores of students while helping the students to develop positive perceptions of STEM education. In future studies, certain influences of STEM education implementations, such as self-confidence of students, the ability to present creative solutions, communication skills, for example, may be studied. "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Science, with its structure based not only on observations, but also inferences, is a human activity facilitating human lives by researching the mysteries of the world, nature, and the universe, as well as directing scientists to question what they wonder about (Knorr-Cetina, 2013; \u00d6zcan, 2013) . Science, with its structural openness to change, is modernized and developed in line with society's requirements. On this matter, technological tools are of great importance; in fact, computers, tablets, and smartphones have ultimately become essential elements of our lives in 21st century. The generation of the millennium age, popularly named \"Generation Z\", has grown in direct touch with these technological tools. This situation forms a basis for Generation Z to have a greater need for the environments enriched with technology than does Generation Y, the previous generation, thus making Generation Z more successful in respect to technological field. Despite these developments, adopting traditional methods in education negatively affects the interests and attitudes of Generation Z students to the lessons. In order to inspire students' interests in their lessons, as well as to encourage positive attitudes, their learning environments should be enriched with technology in their design and structure (Gu, Zhu, & Guo, 2013; Jones, Jo, & Martin, 2007; Prensky, 2012; Thompson, 2013) . Research suggests that the students studying in these technically rich environments would gain such skills as productivity, entrepreneurial ability, innovativeness and critical thinking, which would in turn help the countries to achieve the economic and political objectives (Aydeniz, 2017; Bybee, 2010) . The regulations to be applied to the educational policies for improving the national capacity for innovation have a material impact on educating the individuals in science literacy equipped with these abilities, and for these individuals to show interest in fields related to innovation (OECD, 2018) . Considering these issues, many countries have started to focus on STEM education in order to achieve their targets.\nIn order to gain international recognition as one of the developed countries, to to succeed in the struggle in spite of today's competitive conditions, and to have a voice in the technological and innovative fields fields, each and every country must review its own system of education with an innovative approach. In recent years, the focal point of the regulations applied to educational policies has been in STEM education (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as have the studies carried out to improve this educational method (Le\u00f3n, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, & Liew, 2015; NRC, 2011; OECD, 2018) . Since it was first recognized in the United States as part of efforts to making changes on the field of education in the late 1990s, STEM has awakened the interests of European countries and Asian countries with advanced economies like Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, thus taking its place in the educational systems and governmental policies of these countries (Blackley & Howell, 2015) .\nSTEM is a radical change movement applied to the educational field in the 21st century (Land, 2013) . The generation that will constitute the labor force of the future is expected to have the skills of 21st century like reasonable thinking, problem solving, communicating, having a facility with teamwork, innovativeness and productivity, working systematically, as well as utilizing the technology on the highest level possible (Association for Career and Technical Education, National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium and Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2010; Bybee, 2010; Kertil & G\u00fcrel, 2016; Morrison, 2006; Omundsen, 2014; Wagner, 2008) . It has been recognized by many countries to apply an interdisciplinary approach like STEM education, instead of traditional methods in order for these projected skills to be gained (Gonzalez & Kuenzi, 2012) . STEM education is an interdisciplinary approach gathering science, technology, engineering and mathematics that are traditionally presented separately, as well as providing learning experiences for the students to adapt these disciplines into their lives (Vasquez, Comer, & Sneider, 2013) . STEM education means organizing of the educational activities related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines as integrated (Gonzalez & Kuenzi, 2012) . In other words, integrated STEM education is the teaching of the information and skills within the main discipline by being gathered together with the other STEM disciplines, after being shaped with the interest and lives of the students and teachers (\u00c7orlu, Capraro, & Capraro, 2014) . Integrated STEM education ensured different points of view to be generated for STEM implementations. Roehrig, Moore, Wang, and Park (2012) discuss these points of view under two different models as the content integration and context integration. The content integration means the preparation of a teaching program that is structured or based on a flexible STEM, where more than one discipline is adapted; while context integration teaches a discipline by placing it on the center, without ignoring the unique characteristics, depth and difficulty of the main discipline, as well as deciding on the respective contexts from the other disciplines (Kertil & G\u00fcrel, 2016) . Keeping the curriculums and examination systems within the Turkish Educational System under control constitutes a significant impediment for ensuring the flexibility required for content integration (\u00c7orlu, 2013) . Therefore, it would be a suitable approach to employ context integration for integrated STEM education studies that are planned for implementation in Turkey.\nIn recent years, the results of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), carried out internationally by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as well as the examinations carried out in our country by Student Selection and Placement Center (\u00d6SYM), show that the success levels of Turkish students in the fields of science and mathematics are below the expected levels (Aydeniz, 2017; Han, 2015; OECD, 2012) . It can be said that the studies of the Turkish Educational System on compliance with the European Union standards began with the curriculums based on a constructive approach regulated in 2005 (Akg\u00fcnd\u00fcz, 2016; G\u00f6mleksiz & Bulut, 2007) . Similarly, the updates carried out on the curriculums in 2013 and 2017 were discussed from the perspective of an approach based on research and questioning. Here, it was aimed at combining a discipline together with other disciplines in terms of subject and class level. Such studies taken together may be considered to be the steps that possess the characteristics to make up the infrastructure for STEM education.\nAlong with changes made in the educational system, STEM leads to changes in the industrial areas of the countries as well, and the Industry 4.0 movement may be cited for this subject matter. Industry 4.0 is a revolutionary movement aimed at equipping factories with the machinery and operators endowed with the ability to communicate directly with each other via the internet, thus ensuring the production of higher-quality products within a shorter period of time (Lasi, Fettke, Kemper, Feld, & Hoffmann, 2014) . Industry 4.0 has the potential to enable the Turkish industrial sector to be carried to the top in terms of contribution to become a major contributor to the economy while serving to eliminate deficits with other countries in terms of the industrial sector (Industry 4.0, 2018) .\nThe echoes of STEM education, having emerged in developed countries and progressed with various implementations in these countries, can be perceived across Turkey, as well. The most significant objective of STEM activities in Turkey, an objective that is projected to be achieved, is to prioritize national needs instead of directly adopting the implementations of developed countries. With this purpose in mind, helping students earn the skills of the 21st century by including the required implementations, by guiding them through the requirements of qualified science and mathematics education and by offering flexible curriculums, can all be counted within the objectives (\u00c7orlu, 2017; Knezek, Christensen, Wood, & Periathiruvadi, 2013 ).\nAn examination of STEM education studies on the progress of STEM in Turkey shows a concentration on the development and adaptation of a scale towards achieving STEM, the organizational structure of STEM education, and the influences on the students of STEM education implementations. Several key areas fell within the scope of the experimental studies, including identifying the effects of STEM education implementations on the behaviors of students; determining students' interest in STEM career areas; and measuring comprehension of STEM, scientific process skills and success levels (Ayar, 2015; Baran, Canbazo\u011flu Bilici, Mesuto\u011flu, & Ocak, 2016; G\u00fclhan & \u015eahin, 2016; Karahan, Canbazo\u011flu Bilici, & \u00dcnal, 2015; S\u00fcmen & \u00c7al\u0131\u015f\u0131c\u0131, 2016; Yamak, Bulut, & D\u00fcndar, 2014; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & Altun, 2015) . The studies on secondary school students are comprised of STEM education implementations, regulated for teaching different subjects in the Turkish Ministry of National Education (MoNE) Science Curriculum. Examining the studies carried out with secondary school students, there was no study in which STEM education implementations were applied for teaching the subject \"Pressure\" within MoNE Science Curriculum. Additionally, other reasons for the selection of the subject of \"Pressure\" for this study include the convenient and related structure of the subject with engineering, mathematics, and science disciplines as well as the challenges that students confront while trying to comprehend the gains from the subject of \"Pressure\" (Akg\u00fcn, Tokur, & \u00d6zkara, 2013; Goszewski, Moyer, Bazan, & Wagner, 2013; Pathare & Pradhan, 2011; Muliyani & Kaniawati, 2015; \u00dcnal, 2005; Wijaya & Muhardjito, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "The Importance and Objective of the Research", "text": "It is of great importance for Turkey to be ranked among the competitive and powerful economies, making integrated STEM education as integral a part of Turkey's educational system as it is in other countries. Therefore, the way STEM is adapted into the educational system of our country, and how it would be implemented efficiently are two key areas of concentration. Examining the national literature within this context, it can be seen that studies on STEM education have centered on secondary school students, high school students, and teacher candidates over the last five years. STEM studies with secondary school students in Turkey have been mainly carried out with formal and informal learning environments and have been based on the curriculums. Reviewing the national studies methodologically reveals that the qualitative or quantitative research methods were frequently applied and that mixed method studies were rarely seen where these two methods were applied together. The mixed method studies where the qualitative and quantitative variables are analyzed together are of great importance in terms of providing more detailed information on the efficiency of STEM education. In this study, we attempted to present the impacts of STEM implementations on students in a detailed manner by using the mixed method in our research.\nThe National Education System does not provide flexibility for teachers in terms of large-scale examinations and the time needed for covering the learning objectives. Besides, teachers in different disciplines lack some knowledge and skills. This may lead to some challenges in adapting the integrated STEM implementations into national curricula. Therefore, reorganization of topics in the science curricula based on an integrated STEM education concept may lend assistance to the teachers applying STEM within their lessons. Within this context, this study is based on teaching the subject \"Pressure\" within the curriculum of Science via STEM education. The objective of this study is to identify the impacts on students' academic achievements and their attitudes towards STEM of a teaching module, concerning the subject \"Pressure,\" developed with the STEM approach. In line with this purpose, we searched for answers on the following research questions:\n1. Is there a significant difference between the academic achievement points of the groups, where either STEM education or the approach as stipulated by the curriculum are applied for teaching the subject \"Pressure\"?\n2. Is there a significant difference between the groups in terms of attitude points towards STEM, where either STEM education or the approach as stipulated by the curriculum is applied for teaching the subject \"Pressure\"?\n3. What are the opinions of the group, where STEM education is utilized, concerning STEM education during the teaching process of the subject \"Pressure\"?"}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "The mixed method of research is defined as the research in this study, where the qualitative data is collected, analyzed, and integrated via one or more than one data collection tool, using both qualitative and quantitative methods (Figure 1) . Figure 1 . Explanatory Sequential Design (Creswell & Clark, 2017) The most significant contribution of using the quantitative and qualitative methods together is to produce the opportunity to study and analyze the research problem at all points (Creswell & Clark, 2017; Niglas, 2010) . In this study, explanatory sequential design was used as one of the mixed method research designs. This is a design where the quantitative data is collected and analyzed in the first phase, and where the qualitative data is collected and analyzed in order to provide explanations of the reasons for results obtained from the quantitative results. With this design, research is subjected to interpretation of the results obtained from data analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data together (Creswell & Clark, 2017; Niglas, 2010) . Quantitative data collection tools were used to collect and analyze in this study, and then the second phase steps were initiated, where the qualitative data were collected and analyzed under the light of quantitative data. All of this data was interpreted as a whole as we produced the results of the study. The design was aimed at reaching at better explanations regarding the reasons for the data obtained from the quantitative data collection tools in the study, using explanatory sequential design.\nThe quantitative aspect of the research was designed with a pre-test, post-test control group semi-experimental design. In this design, the experimental and control groups are designated from the ready groups having similar structures with each other with regards to the input characteristics predicted from the pre-test. While the experimental group is subjected to the experimental process, the control group is maintained with routine implementations. It attempts to detect the impact of the experimental process by comparing the difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of both groups (Fraenkel, Wallen, & Hyun, 2012) . The qualitative aspect of the research was designed in line with the phenomenological design. The phenomenological design considers the perceptions of individuals about a fact or incident based on their experiences while defining that fact or incident (Yin, 2016) . In this study, our objective is to reveal the meanings ascribed to STEM education by the students, as well as their perceptions of their experiences with STEM education"}, {"section_title": "Study Group and its Characteristics", "text": "The study group was comprised of 33 7 th grade students, studying in a village school located in a district in one of the metropolitan municipalities of Turkey in the spring semester of the 2017-2018 school year. The sampling of the study was determined with the convenient sampling method, as one of the probabilistic sampling methods. The convenient sampling method saves both time and effort for the implementers in terms of reaching the convenient sampling (Patton, 2002) . Having a long-term implementation period, as well as a requirement for setting the technological tools and materials ready before the implementation process begins, can be counted as key reasons for choosing the convenient sampling method for this study.\nThe two intact seventh grade classes from the village school were selected as the experimental and control groups. For this reason, the experimental and control groups had different numbers of students. The study group was comprised of 33 students, while 20 students (n=20) made up the experimental group where the STEM education approach was applied, and 13 students (n=13) were included in the control group where the approach as stipulated by the respective curriculum was (Table 1) , on teaching the subject \"Pressure.\" The students within the experimental and control groups were between 11 and 12 years old. Moreover, the socioeconomic (level of income, educational background of the parent, status of the residential home, access level for social activities and technological tools, for example) and the academic achievement levels of the students comprising both groups possessed similar structure, according to the feedback received from the teachers. Before the implementation process began, the approvals of the students within the study group were obtained stating that they voluntarily participated in the study. Semi-structured interviews were performed in order to detail the opinions of students within the experimental group, where the STEM education approach was applied, on the educational process, as well as to obtain more data. While deciding on the students to be interviewed, the academic achievement test results were accepted as the sampling criterion. Thus, criteria related sampling, which is one of the purposeful sampling strategies, were used in selecting the study participants (Creswell & Clark, 2017; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & \u015eim\u015fek, 2016) . Following the academic success test, the scores of the experimental group were ranked from the highest to the lowest for selecting four students from each of the high, middle, and low level groups. Since one of the experimental group members (comprising of 12 members) did not come to school on the day of the interview, the interview included 11 group members. Additionally, the student diaries, in which the students within the experimental group would convey their feelings and opinions concerning each lesson at the end of every lesson, were utilized as qualitative data resources."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Tools", "text": "We sought to ensure data diversity in the study by providing support for the quantitative data collection tools with qualitative data collection tools.

Thus, the distribution of questions and the number of acquisitions were regulated in compliance with each other, and the required steps were taken for ensuring the content validity. We were careful to select questions that are valid and reliable during the formation process. Within this context, the examination questions of previous years by MoNE on the subject \"Pressure\" (Secondary Education Exam, Public Boarding School Exam, Placement Test, Transition from Primary to Secondary Education), and the questions that were deemed suitable as per the table of specifications were added into the pool of questions. Comprising 25 items, AAT were analyzed by 2 science educators and 2 science teachers in order to evaluate the test in terms of suitability and comprehensiveness for the students. After receiving the opinions of the experts, 5 items were removed from the test. A pilot version of the test comprising 20 items was carried out with the 20 8th grade students, who were provided with the lessons on the subject \"Pressure.\" The data obtained from the pilot version was subjected to substance analysis, and the internal consistency coefficient of \"KR-20\" was calculated in order to settle the question of the reliability of the achievement test. The coefficient KR-20 obtained following the pilot version was calculated as .82, thus proving the test to be reliable. After applying the amendments on the test as deemed necessary, the final form of the test for the implementation process comprised of 20 items.

Examining the codes and themes, which can be seen in Figure 4 , the students think that STEM education is exciting, educatory, and useful in terms of preparing for life, entertaining, encouraging cognitive enhancement, as well as having the characteristics to ensure them to realize the skills that they are gifted.

On the other hand, the students facing problems with the usage of technology, putting the design into implementation, and respecting the ideas of group members caused them to feel less successful, compared to other students.

Some of the statements by the students on this matter, which are in the SSIs and SDs, are as follows: "}, {"section_title": "Discussion, Conclusion and Suggestions", "text": "In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of a teaching module developed with the STEM approach about the pressure concept on students' academic achievement and on their attitudes towards STEM. During the teaching process of the Pressure concept, it was ascertained that the differences between the post-test mean scores concerning the academic achievement of these two groups, where the STEM education approach and the approach as stipulated by the respective curriculum were applied, were significant in favor of the experimental group. Additionally, the differences between the pre-test and post-test scores of these two groups were significant in favor of the experimental group; there is no significant difference between the control group pre-test and post-test (Figure 8 ). The reasons of the differences between two groups in terms of academic success are thought to be in the individuals' capacities to access the information by themselves, as well as in having the opportunity to put them into implementation by correlating the information with engineering and technological disciplines.\nExamining the literature, we can find certain studies showing that STEM education has a positive impact on the academic achievement, which is consistent with the results of this study (Ceylan & \u00d6zdilek, 2015; Cotabish et al., 2013; \u00c7evik, 2018; Le\u00f3n et al., 2015; Owen & \u00c7apan, 2017; Toma & Greca, 2018; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & Selvi, 2017) . Han, Capraro, and Capraro (2015) indicated that project-based STEM education, carried out within the scope of mathematics, led to a greater success for students with low performance levels, compared to those having medium or high-performance levels. Kakarndee, Kudthalang, and Jansawang (2018) reached the conclusion that the academic achievements and creative thinking skills of high school students improved in another study, where the impact of STEM education on students was researched. The results of these studies, as in the current study, show that STEM education is efficient in terms of improving the academic success levels of students towards the respective subject. On the other hand, it was found in another study carried out in Turkey by \u00d6ner and Capraro (2016) that there is no significant difference between the success levels in science and mathematics of the students studying in schools that apply STEM education approaches and the students that study in schools in which the teaching approach is stipulated by the respective curriculum. However, the researchers explained that insignificant differences between these two types of schools could be due to the fact that the current structure of the schools using STEM education does not meet the requirements for STEM education and that there is no proper mechanism for auditing the success levels of these schools.\nIn the teaching of the Pressure concept, a significant difference was also found between the posttest attitude mean scores of the STEM education supplied group and the traditional curriculum supplied group. Additionally, the difference between the pre-test and post-test attitude mean scores of these two groups was found to be significant in favor of the experimental group (Figure 9 ). The reasons for this difference between the two groups in terms of attitude scores towards STEM are thought to be that the participants have a better opportunity to observe their personal skills within the scope of STEM areas during the STEM education implementation; that they are provided with the opportunity to display these skills; that technological tools and software, used during STEM education implementation, increase the interest of students towards STEM areas; and that they can create a product in line with the information obtained from STEM implementations. Having a positive attitude toward STEM plays a significant role in students' career plans in the field of STEM, as well as increasing their interest in such fields.\nThe idea that the implementation of STEM education provides a positive impact on the attitudes of the students within the respective fields, is supported by many studies (Ayd\u0131n, Saka, & Guzey, 2017; Baran et al., 2016; Chonkaew, Sukhummek, & Faikhamta, 2016; Guzey et al., 2016; G\u00fclhan & \u015eahin, 2016; Karakaya & Avg\u0131n, 2016; Karahan et al., 2015; Yamak et al., 2014; Toma & Greca, 2018; Yerdelen, Kahraman, & Ta\u015f, 2016) . In a study where the attitudes towards STEM, including the relationships between these approaches and STEM career fields, were researched, it was suggested that the students having positive attitudes toward STEM are more prone to building careers in such fields (Yerdelen et al., 2016) . Since the career groups of the future are thought to be in STEM areas, the students are expected to tend to have career opportunities in these areas. It is thought that students in teaching and learning environments of STEM education develop a positive attitude towards these areas, thus planning their careers in these areas, as well. The results of another study carried out by Toma and Greca (2018) shows that the students develop a positive attitude for STEM education, while also suggesting that the teachers are unwilling to utilize STEM education in their lessons, and they need detailed directives during the implementation process. On the other hand, certain studies also suggest that the STEM activities do not cause any statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m & Selvi, 2017) .\nFive themes -feelings and opinions, positive aspects, skills and features gained, problems faced in the learning process-, as well as 26 codes, were obtained with the content analysis of semi-structured interviews and students' diaries. The opinions of the experimental group reveal the reasons for differences between the two groups in terms of academic achievement and attitude. Regarding their learning processes with STEM education, the students commented on the fact that they played a much more active role in learning, that the class environment became more entertaining, that the technology was utilized effectively, that the activities and designs were frequently included, that the information provided became permanent, and that the learning process was easier. They also emphasized the fact that that the knowledge they gained is much more lasting, and that the learning process is easier. The students expressed feeling that STEM education is exciting, educatory, useful in terms of preparing for life, entertaining, encouraging cognitive enhancement, as well as having the characteristics to ensure them to realize the skills with which they are gifted, and together this supports the idea that students developed a positive attitude for STEM. Moreover, the students stated that their skills and characteristics with regards to self-confidence, discovering, designing, hand-skills, creative thinking, and socialization would be improved in time thanks to STEM education, statements which not only support the idea of developing a positive attitude, but which are also signs of a sense of achievement. The qualitative findings of the research further support the idea that many skills aimed for the individual achievement in the 21st century can be gained with STEM education. When considered from this point of view, in many studies within the literature emphasize that STEM education is the most suitable approach for improving the skills of the 21st century (Bybee, 2010; Ejiwale, 2012; Ostler, 2012) . Students need a number of skills during STEM education, including researching, using technology, working in groups, creating products, and making presentations. In STEM environments, students are offered opportunities to develop these skills.\nDuring the implementation process for STEM educational activities, it is necessary to organize the learning environment in advance, to prepare the required technological equipment and infrastructure as well as the layout plans of the groups and the materials. Such preparations will prevent possible time loss for lessons and will encourage the planned teaching process to be carried out as required.\nFuture studies may focus on research planned in accordance with STEM education in different grades and in different subjects of the curriculum. In this way, adapting many subjects in the curriculum with STEM education will be a guide for those preparing the curriculum and for the teachers. Researchers who plan to carry out studies on STEM education might develop course contents with clear and detailed directives to be used by teachers with the limited knowledge, and this will promote the use of STEM approaches in the courses. Additionally, certain influences of STEM education implementations such as the self-confidence of students, the ability to present creative solutions, and communication skills may be studied in upcoming research.\nIn this study, the group in which STEM education was implemented consisted of 20 students. Teachers who would like to carry out STEM training implementations in crowded classrooms are advised to select equipment that is within reach and economical, to determine the number of students in the groups based on the availability of technological equipment, and to provide detailed information about how to implement STEM education implementations before the implementation occurs. This study was limited to a 12-hour period. Nevertheless, in this short period of time, the STEM education approach improved students' achievement, attitude, and 21st century skills. STEM training activities can be incorporated into the classroom more frequently in order for students to gain 21st century skills completely.\nWhen STEM education implementations were examined, it was observed that the activities were mostly carried out in a laboratory environment. However, since there were no laboratories in the selected schools, STEM activities were conducted in a classroom environment. It became compulsory to allocate specific time before the lessons, due to the fact that the tools and equipment to be used in the course of the activities in the classroom need to be prepared in advance and the proper location and infrastructure need to be provided in order to use the technological equipment. The laboratory environment is thought to be more advantageous for STEM education as it provides the equipment to be used by the students, provides regularity in using the technological equipment, and makes it available to use large and practical tables where students can work comfortably. The company \"Hayat Textile\" uses always the same method for distributing its products. The products to be distributed are carried with the companies own vehicles. The track distortions cannot be eliminated despite the fact that the roadworks are carried out annually on a regular basis. The municipal employees decide to designate the reason for distortions on this road. With the researches carried out on this matter, it was found that the reason for distortions on the road is caused by smaller vehicles carrying relatively heavy goods. The municipal employees contact with Hayat Tekstil and explain the situation. Then the company \"Hayat Tekstil\" decides to consult to an engineering firm for a healthy transportation on this route. You are working on these engineering company and you are expected to design a vehicle that protects the road against distortions while carrying the products of Hayat Tekstil.
