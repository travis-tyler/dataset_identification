[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective. To describe the prevalence of recent physical, sexual, and emotional violence against children 0 -19 years of age in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) by age, sex, and perpetrator. Methods. A systematic review and analysis of published literature and large international datasets was conducted. Eligible sources from first record to December 2015 contained age-, sex-, and perpetrator-specific data from LAC. Random effects meta-regressions were performed, adjusting for relevant quality covariates and differences in violence definitions. Results. Seventy-two surveys (2 publications and 70 datasets) met inclusion criteria, representing 1 449 estimates from 34 countries. Prevalence of physical and emotional violence by caregivers ranged from 30% -60%, and decreased with increasing age. Prevalence of physical violence by students (17% -61%) declined with age, while emotional violence remained constant (60% -92%). Prevalence of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) ranged from 13% -18% for girls aged 15 -19 years. Few or no eligible past-year estimates were available for any violence against children less than 9 years and boys 16 -19 years of age; sexual violence against boys (any age) and girls (under 15 years); IPV except for girls aged 15 -19 years; and violence by authority figures (e.g., teachers) or via gangs/organized crime. Conclusion. Past-year physical and emotional violence by caregivers and students is widespread in LAC across all ages in childhood, as is IPV against girls aged 15 -19 years. Data collection must be expanded in LAC to monitor progress towards the sustainable development goals, develop effective prevention and response strategies, and shed light on violence relating to organized crime/gangs."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Violence in childhood is a global health and human rights issue. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are recognized as among the most violent geographic areas globally, particularly for young people (1, 2) . An estimated 58% of children 0 -17 years of age in LAC (more than 99 million) experience physical, sexual, or emotional abuse each year (3) . Health consequences include physical injury, mental health problems, and increased risk of substance use, among others (4 -6) . Violence drains the health, social, and judicial sector budgets, with expenditures for treating survivors and prosecuting perpetrators (7) . Furthermore, early exposure to violence has been linked to multiple forms of violence perpetration and victimization in adulthood (8) .\nPreventing and responding to violence against children is a global priority, as evidenced by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the priorities of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and LAC governments (9) . All LAC countries are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (10) and have supported the Organization of American States' resolutions on violence and human rights (11, 12) . Many countries have developed national laws and policies to address violence in childhood; for example, at least 10 LAC countries prohibit corporal punishment in all settings (13) .\nTo effectively prevent and respond to violence in childhood, an understanding of the epidemiology of violence is needed, including how exposure to physical, sexual, and emotional violence differs by age, sex, and perpetrator. Effective prevention efforts may vary depending on the type of violence, the perpetrator, and the age and sex of those exposed. For example, strategies for preventing physical violence against primary school-aged boys may differ substantially from those for preventing sexual violence against adolescent girls. Similarly, interventions addressing IPV will differ from those addressing violence by parents or guardians. To date, no data synthesis has been conducted in LAC to comprehensively explore the patterns of violence among boys and girls of various ages or the relative perpetrator composition.\nDrawing on data from a previously published, large-scale, global data synthesis effort (14) , this paper: (i) summarizes available age-, sex-, and perpetrator-specific data on violence in childhood in LAC; (ii) presents age-and sex-specific estimates of the prevalence of physical, sexual, and emotional violence by perpetrator groups; and (iii) discusses gaps in age-, sexand perpetrator-specific data, comparability, and implications for effective monitoring. Given these objectives and the complexity of violence in LAC, this analysis did not aim to capture all forms of violence against children. For example, organized crime is an important driver of violence in LAC, but it is difficult to quantify (15) and has not been adequately measured due to methodological challenges. Furthermore, inclusion in this review was limited to prevalence estimates that were age-, sex-, and perpetrator-specific. Hence, this paper does not represent all available data on violence and children in LAC. While this paper adds to the epidemiologic understanding of violence in childhood, findings should complement qualitative data that describe wider contexts and types of violence."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "A systematic review and analysis of published literature and large international datasets meeting eligibility criteria were performed.

All definitions of violence and perpetrators were accepted. Only surveys with samples representative of children living in a specific geographic area or school-based populations were considered. Both self-reports and caregiver proxy reports (e.g., from MICS) of violence were included. Data from surveys reporting age bands up to 14 years or recall periods up to 14 years were eligible, but only reports over a narrow age range (5 years or less) were included given the goal of summarizing the prevalence of recent violence.

Estimates were adjusted for quality-related covariates, including the definition of violence, such that overall estimates would reflect higher-quality surveys with the strongest definitions. The mean estimate and 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) for each age was plotted separately for children of each sex. Where the prevalence was not reported as a percentage or proportion with a standard error or 95%CI, it was calculated from data in reports or through author communication. Estimates from groups of fewer than 10 participants were excluded.\nTo produce prevalence estimates by category of perpetrator, estimates with similar perpetrator definitions were combined. For violence by caregivers, MICS questions that measure physical punishment and psychological aggression by caregivers were included. GSHS questions on being physically attacked were included as violence by students, in accordance with how they have been interpreted in previous GSHS data analyses, despite ambiguity in question wording (26, 27) . For IPV, a range of definitions (e.g., husband, cohabiting partner, non-cohabiting romantic partner) were included (28) . Estimates were adjusted for differences in definition. The population (i.e., the denominator) differed for each category of perpetrator summarized. Estimates of violence by caregivers included the entire population of children; estimates of school violence were computed for children and adolescents in school; estimates of IPV were for ever-partnered adolescents. Thus, the prevalence of each form of violence cannot be directly compared.\nFor each survey, the child's age and the recall period for the measure of violence were relevant. Where surveys reported violence over an age range larger than 1 year and up to 5 years, the midpoint of the age range was used and the prevalence was assumed to pertain to that age (e.g., for a sample of 15 -17-yearolds reporting an average prevalence, the prevalence was assumed to represent students aged 16 years).

Older adolescent boys may be vulnerable to violence by other boys and men related to organized crime or gang involvement (31, 32) , as well as nongang activity (33) . The lack of age-specific estimates available in large surveys means that violence against older adolescent boys may receive less attention than it should in prevention and response efforts. Additionally, gaps in data on IPV for girls are notable since child marriage is a concern (34) and is correlated with higher risk of IPV (35) ; thus, understanding prevalence, co-occurrence, and risk factors for both outcomes would aid policy and programming (36) . Gaps in data on sexual violence and by teachers/authority figures will change with expansion of the LAC Violence Against Children Surveys (20) . While most LAC countries prohibit physical corporal punishment (and sexual violence) by teachers, prevalence of such violence must be monitored, as some surveys show it to be widespread (14) .\nWithin surveys that met inclusion criteria, past-year physical and emotional violence by caregivers and by other students were common exposures across ages in childhood-both among boys and girls. Physical violence by caregivers and students alike appeared to decline slightly with age, while emotional violence remained fairly constant. IPV against girls aged 15 -19 years was also substantial, with 15% -20% of ever-partnered girls reporting past-year physical violence, 15% -20% reporting emotional violence, and roughly 4% reporting sexual violence."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Sustainable Development Goals. Addressing violence against children in LAC requires monitoring progress towards the SDGs. Goal 4 (Quality Education) focuses on ensuring access to quality primary and secondary education and Prevention programs. The widespread nature of violence requires multiple approaches. This analysis highlights the need for prevention in both school and home settings, and urgently calls for more data to inform prevention efforts in other settings, such as the community. Prevention in school environments must be targeted as a matter of urgency. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (37) and the INSPIRE group (38) have issued guidance on effective programming to reduce violence against children, including in schools. Recommended programs have been tested for efficacy on peer violence and bullying (39) . The campaign \"Safe to Learn\" (40)-conceived by the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, UNICEF, UNESCO, United Nations Girls' Education Initiative, and the United Kingdom Department for International Development-will bring renewed attention to ensuring that schools are safe spaces.

Also, this analysis did not include some key forms of violence, e.g., homicide, trafficking, and organized crime/gangs. There may have been residual confounding related to violence definitions and survey quality variables, which could partly explain age-and sex-differences in prevalence estimates. Since adjusting for violence definitions and survey quality variables is unlikely to have captured all biases across cultural settings (e.g., unobservable factors), the estimates presented are likely to be lower bounds-i.e., where fewer acts of violence are reported than occur. Under-reporting of certain forms of violence, particularly sexual violence, is likely, due to the stigma associated with victimization and fear of potential reprisals.\nEstimates were based on community, household, and schoolbased surveys, and thus were unlikely to have included children who live outside of family care, out-of-school, on the street, or in institutions. For some forms of violence, data from a limited number of countries were available, which may change once more countries conduct prevalence surveys. Although the literature search did not place restrictions on language, Spanish or Portuguese language journals not indexed by the databases may have been missed. Review of grey literature and reference lists was beyond the scope of the literature search. Finally, there were limited cross-national data examining children's experiences of violence according to other key vulnerabilities, such as disability, race, or belonging to an indigenous community-hence, these differences were not highlighted in the analyses but are likely to be important (44)."}, {"section_title": "Caregiver emotional violence against boys", "text": "Source: Prepared by the authors from the study results, based on data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (19) and Demographic and Health Surveys with MICS questions (16) .

RESUMEN Objetivo. Describir la prevalencia de la violencia f\u00edsica, sexual y emocional infligida recientemente en ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as de 0 a 19 a\u00f1os en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe (ALC) seg\u00fan la edad, el sexo y el agresor. M\u00e9todos. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo una revisi\u00f3n y un an\u00e1lisis sistem\u00e1ticos de la bibliograf\u00eda publicada en los grandes conjuntos de datos. Las fuentes desde los primeros registros hasta diciembre del 2015 que cumpl\u00edan los criterios fueron las que conten\u00edan datos espec\u00edficos de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe en funci\u00f3n de la edad, el sexo y el agresor. Se realizaron metarregresiones de los efectos aleatorios, con ajustes pertinentes para las covariables de calidad y las diferencias en las definiciones de violencia. Resultados. Setenta y dos encuestas (2 publicaciones y 70 conjuntos de datos) cumplieron los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n, que representaban 1.449 estimaciones de 34 pa\u00edses. La prevalencia de la violencia f\u00edsica y emocional infligida por cuidadores fue del 30% al 60% y disminuy\u00f3 al aumentar la edad. La prevalencia de la violencia f\u00edsica infligida por estudiantes (17% a 61%) disminuy\u00f3 con la edad, mientras que la violencia emocional se mantuvo constante (60% a 92%). La prevalencia de la violencia f\u00edsica infligida por la pareja fue de 13% a 18% para las ni\u00f1as en edades de 15 a 19 a\u00f1os. Fueron pocas o inexistentes las estimaciones que cumplieran los criterios realizadas el a\u00f1o pasado sobre: la violencia de todo tipo contra los ni\u00f1os y las ni\u00f1as menores de 9 a\u00f1os y los ni\u00f1os entre los 16 y 19 a\u00f1os; la violencia sexual contra los ni\u00f1os de cualquier edad y las ni\u00f1as menores de 15 a\u00f1os; la violencia infligida por la pareja, salvo en ni\u00f1as de 15 a 19 a\u00f1os; y la violencia infligida por figuras de autoridad (por ejemplo profesores) o por pandillas o el crimen organizado. Conclusi\u00f3n. La violencia emocional y f\u00edsica infligida por los cuidadores y estudiantes es generalizada en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe en todas las edades en la ni\u00f1ez, al igual que la violencia infligida por la pareja hacia ni\u00f1as en edades entre los 15 y 19 a\u00f1os. Se debe ampliar la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe para dar seguimiento al progreso hacia los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible, elaborar estrategias eficaces de prevenci\u00f3n y respuesta, y arrojar luz sobre la violencia en relaci\u00f3n con el crimen organizado y las pandillas."}, {"section_title": "Palabras clave", "text": "Maltrato a los ni\u00f1os; abuso f\u00edsico; violencia; salud del ni\u00f1o; salud del adolescente; Am\u00e9rica Latina; Regi\u00f3n del Caribe."}]
