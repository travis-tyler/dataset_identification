[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In endotherms, metabolic performance is associated with a wide array of ecological traits, including species distribution. Researchers have suggested that the northern boundaries of North American passerines are limited by their ability to sustain the high metabolic rates required for thermoregulation. Blackcapped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; BC) are year-round residents in most of Canada and the northern half of the United States, whereas Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis; CA) are found exclusively in the southeastern United States. These species hybridize along a narrow contact zone that has been moving northward at a rate of about 1.6 km per decade, coincident with warming temperatures in Ohio. The location of the chickadee hybrid zone in Ohio closely matches air temperature isotherms, further suggesting that metabolic rate may correlate with distribution in these species. We tested the hypothesis that distribution patterns of chickadees are linked with their rate of metabolism. For populations of BC and CA chickadees, we measured basal metabolic rates (BMRs) and cold-induced peak metabolic rates from areas that differ in winter temperatures and supplemented this information with data from other studies. Although our findings suggest a general relationship between lower air temperatures and higher metabolic rate among blackcapped chickadee populations, this trend was not robust across all locations. There was no significant relationship between lower air temperatures and metabolism in Carolina chickadees. Within Ohio, hybrids had a significantly higher mass-corrected BMR than either parental species. We suggest that the mtDNA-nDNA mismatch of hybrids may produce less efficient mitochondrial protein complexes, which in turn affects the efficiency of ATP production, thereby increasing rate of oxygen consumption to meet ATP demands."}, {"section_title": "The Relationship of Metabolic Performance and Distribution in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Black-Capped and Carolina Chickadees Introduction", "text": "Metabolic performance is a fundamental physiological attribute that correlates with many aspects of a species' ecology, including its distribution, survival, behavior, and life history (Aschoff and Pohl 1970; Weathers 1979; White et al. 2007; Wiersma et al. 2007b) . Two indices are commonly used to assess metabolic performance: (1) basal metabolic rate (BMR), the minimum metabolic rate of a quiescent, postabsorptive animal, in its thermal neutral zone and rest phase (McNab 1997) ; and (2) peak metabolic rate (PMR), the maximum rate of energy expenditure, often achieved by exposing birds to cold in metabolic chambers (Wiersma et al. 2007a ). Cold-induced PMR defines the maximum heat generating capacity of an endotherm and correlates positively with endurance of cold (Swanson 2001) . Because the BMR makes up 25%-40% of a bird's field metabolic rate (Bryant 1997 ) and often correlates with field metabolism (Daan et al. 1991; White and Seymour 2004) , it has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in the wild. Unlike the BMR, which is largely a function of central organs (e.g., brain, heart, kidneys, and gut ; Taigen 1983; Rolfe and Brown 1997; Hoppeler and Weibel 1998) , heat generation in birds during cold exposure relies on shivering by skeletal muscles (Bennett 1991; Weibel et al. 2004) . Although within-species comparisons of BMR and PMR often show a positive correlation (Hinds and Rice-Warner 1992; Dutenhoffer and Swanson 1996; Likenes and Swanson 1996; Rezende et al. 2002; Wiersma et al. 2007a) , some studies have shown that these two variables are unrelated (Koteja 1987; V\u00e9zina et al. 2006) .\nThe impact of metabolic performance on the distribution patterns of birds remains controversial (Root 1988b (Root , 1989 Castro 1989; Repasky 1991; Canterbury 2002) . In North America, there is evidence that the northern limits of some bird species are correlated with metabolic performance. Root (1988b) found Figure 1 . Position of the chickadee hybrid zone in relation to mean minimum winter temperatures. We approximated zone position from North American Breeding Bird Survey data (http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/bbs.html) ; Tanner 1952; Brewer 1963; Rising 1968; Robbins et al. 1986; Grubb et al. 1994; and Sattler and Braun 2000. Isotherms are based on the mean minimum winter temperature as depicted in The National Atlas of the United States (U.S. Geological Survey 1970) . A color version of this figure is available in the online edition of the Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. that the northern boundary of 60% of birds wintering in North America coincided with isotherms of minimum daily January temperature and concluded that winter distributions are limited to areas where the birds do not need to raise their metabolic rate more than 2.5 times BMR. Some investigators have challenged Root's analyses and conclusions, rendering the accuracy of her predictions uncertain (Castro 1989; Repasky 1991; Canterbury 2002) .\nVariation in metabolic performance across populations of the same species, especially those with a large geographic range that transects multiple thermal environments, has not been addressed (Root 1988a; Swanson, forthcoming) . Such studies could provide insights into the role of metabolism in defining distributional limits of species and insights into how the local environment impacts levels of adjustment of metabolic rate. One might surmise that individuals of the same species inhabiting generally warmer areas will have a lower BMR and PMR than birds that inhabit colder climes-the local adjustment hypothesis. Hence, birds of the same species that experience different winter isotherms might be expected to show corresponding adjustments to BMR and/or PMR.\nNorth American chickadees (family: Paridae) provide a unique system for exploring possible relationships between metabolic performance and distribution. Black-capped chickadees (BC; Poecile atricapillus) are year-round residents in most of Canada and the northern half of the United States, whereas Carolina chickadees (CA; Poecile carolinensis) are found exclusively in the southeastern United States. The ranges of these two species meet in Kansas eastward to New Jersey where they form a narrow band of hybrids (Ohio: Bronson et al. 2005; Pennsylvania: Reudink et al. 2007; Missouri: Sawaya 1990; Virginia and West Virginia: Sattler and Braun 2000) . The northern limit of CA chickadees is associated with an isotherm at \u03ea6.7\u040aC (mean minimum January temperature; Repasky 1991), and BC chickadees live as far north as the \u03ea26.5\u040aC isotherm (Canada Department of Energy, Mines and Resources 1974; Smith 1993) .\nVariation in thermal environments suggests that ambient temperature (T a ) is associated with the distribution of BC and CA chickadees (Fig. 1) . Unlike a number of other hybrid zones, the contact zone between BC and CA chickadees includes southward extensions of BC chickadees into upper elevations of the Appalachian Mountains as well as extensions into Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas; each interdigitation southward occurs in a region with colder winter climate than other regions at similar latitudes (U.S. Geological Survey 1970) . In addition, as ambient temperatures have warmed, populations of CA and BC chickadees have moved northward. Over the last half-century, the mean daily January temperature in Ohio has warmed by approximately 4\u040aC (NOAA 2008) . Coincidentally, the contact zone between BC and CA chickadees in Ohio has been moving northward at a rate of approximately 1.6 km per decade (Whea-ton 1882, Trautman 1940; Grubb et al. 1994; Bronson et al. 2003a Bronson et al. , 2003b .\nWe examined metabolic performance of five populations of BC chickadees from Alaska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New York and two populations of CA chickadees from Ohio and Tennessee to test the hypothesis that distribution is related to metabolic performance. In cold temperate climates, winter-acclimatized birds increase their BMR, PMR, and cold tolerance relative to summer-acclimatized birds, in response to the increased energetic demands of thermoregulation Swanson 1990; Cooper and Swanson 1994) . Using strong inference (Platt 1964) , we envisioned several nonmutually exclusive hypotheses that could describe the relationship between BMR, PMR, and latitude in these species. If chickadees optimize their metabolism for the local environment, birds living at higher latitudes should have a higher BMR and PMR compared with conspecifics at lower latitudes. Alternatively, chickadees may not exhibit any latitudinal variation in metabolism.\nHybridization between species of chickadees could impact metabolic performance of offspring, which in turn may affect the position and northward movement of the hybrid zone. Oxidative phosphorylation and oxygen consumption of endotherms are largely a function of their mitochondria (Pon and Schon 2001; Weibel and Hoppeler 2005) , and protein complexes within the mitochondria consist of polypeptides encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Because the mtDNA is maternally inherited, hybrid chickadees will have polypeptides derived from both the BC and CA genomes. If mitochondrial genes have diverged in tandem with mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nuclear genome, one might predict that ATP production of hybrids would be less efficient than that parent species, perhaps as a result of increased proton leak or less efficient metabolic enzyme activity (Dobzhansky 1936; Stuart et al. 1999; Harper et al. 2002; Ellison and Burton 2008) . Assuming that muscle mass is not affected by hybridization, we hypothesized that hybrids would have a higher BMR than either parental population due to greater oxygen consumption needed to overcome inefficiencies in ATP production. Assuming that maximum oxygen consumption is limited by the rate of ATP synthesis, we also predicted that hybrids would have a lower PMR than either parental population if hybrids do not compensate for this inefficiency through other physiological means (e.g., higher muscle mitochondrial density or increased activity of metabolic enzymes)."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Capture of Birds", "text": "We trapped 181 chickadees (BC, CA, and hybrids) in Ashland County, Ohio (40\u040a51\u0408N, 82\u040a10\u0408W), during three winters from December 2003 through February 2006.

Based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis (Vos et al. 1995) , with modifications proposed by Kingston and Rosel (2004) , we designated birds as BC, CA, or hybrid. At the time of capture, we punctured the bird's brachial vein using a 25-gauge needle, collected blood in a heparinized capillary tube, placed the sample in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS; Longmire et al. 1988) , and stored it at 4\u040aC. We extracted DNA from samples using the methods of Bronson et al. (2003a) . We digested extracted DNA from blood samples with restriction enzymes EcoRI and TaqI, followed by two rounds of PCR (preselective and selective) to both amplify fragments and fluorescently label them for detection. Fragments were sized using GeneMapper, version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and we assigned individuals to populations using STRUCTURE, version 2.1 (Pritchard et al. 2000) . In addition to the birds above, we also analyzed extracted DNA from 18 CA chickadees previously captured in Lawrence County, OH (38\u040a43\u0408N, 82\u040a34\u0408W; Sattler and Braun 2000) for inclusion as an additional parental population. We analyzed 245 loci from 218 individuals using 100,000 estimation steps after 50,000 burn-in steps and each value of K (the number of clusters) from 1 to 5. We achieved the most logical population structure using a K of 2, and we classified birds as hybrids if they were assigned a 25%-75% probability of belonging to either parental species. We also used restriction fragment length polymorphism to determine mitochondrial haplotypes of chickadees from Ohio, Wisconsin, and Tennessee, using methods described by Reudink et al. (2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Measurements of Basal Metabolic Rate", "text": "Birds collected in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Tennessee were transported to the lab for measurements of metabolism. For mea-surements of BMR, we removed food from birds 2 hrs before measurements to assure that they were postabsorptive. Then, at 2000 hours we placed birds in 1-L stainless steel chambers lined with dark brown Teflon to reduce reflective radiation and minimize adherence of water molecules to the chamber (Porter 1969) . Each chamber contained a wire-mesh platform and a plastic perch above a layer of mineral oil to capture feces, thus eliminating them as a source of water vapor. Rubber gaskets rendered the lids airtight and excluded light. We placed four chambers into a temperature-controlled cabinet maintained at 32\u040aC, a temperature within the thermal neutral zone of these species (Rising and Hudson 1974) , using a Peltier device (Sable Systems Pelt 4). To monitor T a within the chambers, we inserted 30-gauge copper-constantan thermocouples into each chamber. Compressed air was directed through a column of Drierite to remove water and then through mass flow controllers (Tylan/ Mykrolis, Chaska, MN) that we previously calibrated using a glass bubble meter (500 mL; Levy 1964), and the air was then sent into the chamber. An automated system of solenoids sequentially sampled the outflow air from each chamber. Excurrent air passed through a Dew Prime II hygrometer to measure dew point (EdgeTech, Marlborough, MA), through tubes containing silica gel, ascarite, and another layer of silica gel to remove water and CO 2 , and then through an Ametek S3AII oxygen analyzer to measure fractional concentration of oxygen. We directed outputs from the oxygen analyzer, dew point hygrometer, and thermocouples to a CR23X micrologger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with a 1-min sampling rate. Data from each chamber were recorded for 12 min before the solenoid system switched to the next chamber; we continued measurements throughout the night.

Two hours before measurements, we removed food to assure that birds were postabsorptive. We measured PMR using a system similar to that for BMR, except that the temperature of the chamber was controlled by a mixture of antifreeze circulating in copper coils that surrounded the chamber, with the entire assembly insulated by Styrofoam. The temperature of the antifreeze was controlled by a refrigerated water bath (NESLAB RTE-140, Pittsburgh, PA). Incurrent air was a mixture of 79% helium and 21% oxygen (heliox; Rosenmann and Morrison 1974) . We set the initial water bath temperature at 32\u040aC, and birds were allowed a minimum of 30 min to adjust to the chamber before we began decreasing T a by about 1.0\u040aC per min. Measurements terminated when oxygen consumption no longer increased with a decrease in chamber temperature .

We took the highest 10-min mean over the entire test period as PMR.

We also obtained approximations of BMR for Ohio BC (Ashtabula County, OH) and CA chickadees (Hamilton County, OH) from Table 4 of Munzinger (1974) .

This \"machinery-matching\" strategy is consistent with the seasonal metabolic variation found in permanent resident, winter passerines (Hart 1962; Dawson and Marsh 1989; Marsh and Dawson 1989; O'Connor 1995; Likenes and Swanson 1996; Likenes 2005) . In a previous study, winter BC chickadees had a standard metabolic rate that was 18% higher than that of summer birds (Cooper and Swanson 1994) . In addition to seasonal variation, there is also evidence of significant winter-to-winter variation in both BMR and PMR of BC chickadees, which are negatively correlated with the mean minimum temperature of that season (Swanson and Olmstead 1999) . This suggests that chickadees use seasonally variable, temperature-associated metabolic limits in order to facilitate winter survival. The presence of lower metabolic rates during both the summer and less severe winters implies some physiological cost to maintaining machinery that would result in increased metabolism year-round or during times when a lower level would suffice, although the physiological mechanisms controlling this variation remains unknown (V\u00e9zina et al. 2007; Swanson, forthcoming) . Thus, we predicted that metabolic rates would be negatively correlated with temperature across our sampling sites: northern birds would have higher metabolic rates than conspecifics at lower latitudes.\nOur data did support the notion that metabolism of BC chickadees is associated with winter temperatures (Fig. 4) South Dakota BC chickadees had a significantly higher mass and PMR than any other BC chickadee population in the continental United States, even though the temperature profile of South Dakota is similar to that of Wisconsin. Researchers have consistently recorded masses around 13 g for this South Dakota population (Cooper and Swanson 1994; Dutenhoffer and Swanson 1996; Swanson and Likenes 2006) . However, even after correcting for mass, these birds still had higher PMR than any other population in this study. Although possibly influenced by slight differences in methodology, such as rate of cooling during PMR tests (see Swanson 1990; Cooper and Swanson 1994) , these data suggest that South Dakota chickadees have means other than increasing mass to elevate metabolic rate, such as elevating oxidative enzyme activity (Likenes 2005) . It also suggests that this population may be exposed to environmental factors other than temperature that require an elevated metabolism. Southeastern South Dakota has the lowest forest cover, approximately 4% (Castonguay 1982) , among all of our sampling sites, and the effects of both wind and temperatures below the thermoneutral zone become much more pronounced in isolated woodlots. Wind exposure can elevate metabolic rate in small birds (Bakken and Lee 1992; Dolby and Grubb 1999; Bakken et al. 2002) . The exceedingly fragmented woodland landscape of South Dakota may amplify the effect of wind and explain in part why these birds had a higher metabolic rate than conspecifics at similar latitudes.\nWe saw little variation in mass-corrected BMR of chickadees across a wide range of latitudes (Fig. 5 ), suggesting that with the exception of Alaskan BC, chickadees may increase their body mass in response to lower T a rather than altering tissuespecific rates of metabolism. Additional sampling locations may clarify whether Alaskan chickadees are simply an exception to this conclusion, or whether the trend observed in Figure 4 is robust throughout the BC range. Sharbaugh (2001) reported measurements of Alaskan chickadee standard metabolic rates (SMR) that were closer to our measurements from the continental United States (SMR: 0.254 W in winter 1994 , 0.338 W in winter 1995 . However, the data for Alaskan birds must be interpreted with caution, as sampling protocols were not consistent with other locations: Alaskan chickadees in both of these studies (Grossman and West 1977; Sharbaugh 2001) were housed in outdoor cages with ad lib. food throughout the winter. In addition, Grossman and West (1977) used only five birds for multiple measurements, indicating that at least three of the data points used in our analysis are cases of pseudoreplication.\nThe Ohio chickadees represent a moving hybrid zone with forces opposing gene flow between the two species. Most hybrid zones are maintained by some form of endogenous selection (Barton and Gale 1981 , 1985 , which favors alleles within a complementary genetic background and selects against individuals of mixed ancestry (Barton and Gale 1993) . Despite evidence of gene flow across the contact zone (Sattler and Braun 2000) , previous studies revealed that there is selection against hybrid reproductive success (Bronson et al. 2003a ). These results suggested to us that the genetic incompatibilities of hybrids might have additional physiological manifestations beyond reproduction.\nOhio chickadees provided us with the opportunity to explore the metabolic consequences of being a hybrid. One hypothesis is that there will be no observable difference between hybrids and parental populations, either because selection has already removed individuals with severe mitochondrial inefficiency during the months preceding our sampling or because the two species' genomes are so similar that metabolism is not penalized by hybridization. However, we predicted that Ohio hybrids would have a higher BMR and a lower PMR than BC or CA chickadees in the same environment. Due to the role of mitochondrial function as a regulator of metabolism (Tieleman et al. 2009 ), a mismatch of proteins encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes, such as could be the case in hybrids, may not produce a properly functioning metabolic system due to misassembled metabolic proteins. In our study, Ohio hybrids did have a higher BMR than both BC and CA chickadees, after including mass as a covariate. Although speculative, we think that the higher BMR of hybrid chickadees may be due to genetically induced mitochondrial deficiencies.\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that nDNA-mtDNA interactions are disrupted by hybridization events, impairing the function of metabolic enzymes-specifically those encoded in the mtDNA (Breeuwer and Werren 1995; Edmands and Burton 1999; Sackton et al. 2003; Perrot-Minnot et al. 2004; Zeyl et al. 2005; Ellison and Burton 2008) . For example, cytochrome c oxidase (COX; complex IV of the electron transport system) contains 13 subunits, three of which are mitochondrial encoded (Grossman et al. 2004) . In addition to the reduced fecundity and viability observed in interpopulation hybrid marine copepods (Tigriopus californicus; Edmands 1999), Edmands and Burton (1999) also detected reduced COX activity in individuals with mtDNA subunits from one population and a mixed (hybrid) nuclear background. Further, the low fitness and reduced ATP synthesis of F 3 hybrids can be restored through maternal but not paternal backcrosses, which allow the parental nuclear-mitochondrial genomes to be reassembled. Although BC and CA chickadees have a relatively small divergence in nuclear DNA (!0.3%, based on restriction fragment mapping), they exhibit a mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence of about 7% (Mack et al. 1986; Sawaya 1990) .\nOhio BC chickadees were larger, and they did not differ from hybrid or CA chickadees with respect to PMR or cold tolerance after including mass as a covariate. PMR reflects the maximum limit of oxidative respiration in muscle cells, and for many winter passerines, heat production facilitated by shivering thermogenesis is energetically demanding. We proposed that Ohio could be the northern thermal limit of the CA chickadee population because of the relationship between temperature isotherms and the hybrid zone. Thus, we predicted that higher PMRs would convey an advantage to Ohio BC chickadees over Ohio CA chickadees during periods of thermal challenge. It does appear that BC chickadees are better adapted to the cold weather found in northern areas of Ohio, and the northward movement of CA chickadees may be facilitated by the increase in winter temperatures observed over the past half-century."}]
