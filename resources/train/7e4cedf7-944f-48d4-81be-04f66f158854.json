Measuring the quality of educational programs (i.e., how much knowledge or skill students gain) is difficult. Because few direct measures are available, indirect outcome measures, such as graduation and student loan default rates, are often used. Although no single outcome can be used to fully measure something as complex as educational quality, looking at multiple outcome measures (e.g., graduation rates, pass rates on licensing exams, employment outcomes, and student loan default rates) can shed light on the quality of education provided by schools."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "For the purposes of this report, we refer to private for-profit schools as for-profit schools and private nonprofit schools as nonprofit schools.

Students with these characteristics tend to have less positive educational outcomes 2 These programs are authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.

For example, students who are low-income, minority, or older generally have lower graduation rates than other students regardless of sector. 5 To respond to your interest in student outcomes at different types of schools, this report addresses the following questions. Consequently, student outcomes at different types of schools can be associated with differences in student characteristics, as well as school type. Accounting for differences in student characteristics as much as possible allows for more meaningful comparisons between types of schools and a better understanding of the school's role in producing student outcomes. This can be done in different ways, such as using statistical models or comparing outcomes for similar groups of students or graduates.\nThe studies in our literature review did not separately analyze outcomes for students at minority-serving institutions."}, {"section_title": "What does research show about graduation rates, employment", "text": "outcomes, student loan debts, and default rates for students at forprofit schools compared to those at nonprofit and public schools, taking differences in student characteristics into account? 2. How do pass rates on licensing exams for selected occupations compare among graduates of for-profit, nonprofit, and public schools? We used the following methodologies to develop our findings (see app. I for a detailed discussion of our scope and methodologies). We began by contacting representatives from several higher education associations representing schools in all three sectors to obtain their perspectives on key issues discussed in this report. To identify comparative research on outcomes that controls for student characteristics, we conducted a literature search and rigorously reviewed the data and methodologies used by external researchers and only reported findings that were based on sound methods and reliable data. \u2022 For most outcomes we reviewed, we relied primarily on studies using data from Education's Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS), which tracks a nationally representative sample of first-time students for 6 years. BPS graduation rates are 5 Research shows that being a racial or ethnic minority may be associated with less positive educational outcomes in part because certain minorities are more likely to have risk factors (such as having a parent who did not finish high school) that can affect educational achievement. more representative of first-time students than graduation rates from other data sources because they include part-time and transfer students. BPS also collects self-reported information on earnings and employment status, as well as extensive data on student characteristics. \u2022 Some of the graduation rate studies included in our review used data from Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). IPEDS captures detailed enrollment data from all schools participating in federal student aid programs; however, IPEDS graduation rates include only full-time, first-time students and exclude a significant number of other students (e.g., those who attend parttime or transfer to another school). Because of this limitation, we gave greater weight in our report to studies using BPS data to calculate graduation rates; however, studies using IPEDS data had similar results. \u2022 Studies in our review that analyzed debt levels used data from Education's National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS), which collects detailed data on financial aid and student loans for a large, nationally representative sample of students. \u2022 One study in our review analyzed school default rates using data from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), which is Education's central database for federal student aid loans and grants. We found a relatively small number of studies that compared student outcomes across sectors and accounted for differences in student characteristics (see app. II for the list of studies included in our literature review). This body of research also has certain limitations. For example, while BPS has some of the best available data on outcomes and student characteristics, it does not represent the experience of more recent students. 6"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Because the most recent cohort of students started during the 2003-2004 school year, BPS does not include outcomes for students who enrolled more recently. Further, while two studies in our review conducted regression analyses that account for multiple student characteristics simultaneously (which allows for a more rigorous comparison), other studies analyzed subgroups of students, accounting for a single characteristic at a time. Despite these limitations, we believe that the studies included in our review provide insight on the comparative outcomes of students attending different types of schools. To compare the performance of graduates from for-profit, nonprofit, and public schools on professional licensing exams, we analyzed pass rates for selected exams for first-time test takers. 7 Because demographic information on test takers was generally not available, directly controlling for the characteristics of test takers in our analyses was not possible. However, because our analysis of licensing exam pass rates focuses on outcomes for program graduates, it may partially mitigate the effect of differences in student characteristics on exam results since some characteristics, such as race, age, and income, are associated with lower graduation rates. For this analysis, we focused on schools that participate in federal student aid programs. We selected occupations in which passing an exam was generally required and significant work experience was not required prior to taking the exam. We also used Education data to select occupations that (1) had programs in multiple sectors, including the for-profit sector, and (2) had sufficiently large numbers of students graduating from these programs. When possible, we used exams offered by national organizations to maximize the number of states in our analysis. We excluded from our analyses states that did not require the exam in an occupation. For occupations that use state or multiple exams, we used Education data to select four states in which the numbers of graduates and the distribution of graduates across sectors provided the best chance to detect any statistically significant differences that might exist between sectors. Results for individual states are not generalizable to other states and it is possible that sector comparisons in other states would show different results or would differ as to whether the results were statistically significant. We assessed the reliability of the data from each test included in our analyses by interviewing representatives knowledgeable about the data, reviewing relevant data and related documentation, and conducting additional analyses. We determined that these exam data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of comparing pass rates across sectors. For more detailed results from our analyses of licensing exam pass rates, see appendix III. We conducted our work from November 2010 to December 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings. On November 10, 2011, we briefed cognizant congressional staff on the results of this study and this report formally conveys the information provided during these briefings. (See app. IV for the slides we used to brief the requesters.) The small number of available studies that accounted for selected student characteristics, such as gender, race, or income, suggests that student outcomes vary by type of school. Student outcomes include graduation rates, employment outcomes, student loan debt, and default rates. Two studies show that for-profit school students had higher graduation rates for certificate programs, similar graduation rates for associate's degree programs, and lower graduation rates for bachelor's degree programs than students at nonprofit and public schools. 8\n"}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "We reported graduation rate findings for certificate, associate's degree and bachelor's degree programs from two studies that used BPS data. For bachelor's degree programs, we also reviewed several studies using IPEDS data, which had similar findings. The term \"graduation rate\" refers to students who complete a higher education program and receive a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award. For example, one study found that 36 percent of low-income students who started at for-profit schools completed a certificate, compared to 6 percent at 2-year Limited Research Suggests that For-Profit School Students Generally Have Different Outcomes than Nonprofit or Public School Students Graduation Rates public schools. 9 In contrast, 3 percent of low-income students who started at for-profit schools completed a bachelor's degree, compared to 49 percent at 4-year public schools and 13 percent at 2-year public schools. 10 An ongoing study suggests that students who started at for-profit schools had similar annual earnings, but higher rates of unemployment compared to students who started at nonprofit and public schools. For example, students who started at for-profit schools during the 2003-2004 school year and were no longer enrolled after 6 years were more likely to have been unemployed for more than 3 months, compared to students who started at nonprofit and public schools. Three studies show that a higher proportion of bachelor's degree recipients from for-profit schools took out student loans and that they generally had higher total student loan debt than bachelor's degree recipients from nonprofit and public schools. For example, one study shows that, among low-income students who graduated in 2007-2008, the percentage who borrowed was greater at for-profit schools (99 percent) than at nonprofit and public schools (83 and 72 percent, respectively). Two studies show that for-profit schools have higher default rates than 4year public schools, but the results are mixed when comparing for-profit schools to other types of schools. One ongoing study shows that for-profit 9 This study does not differentiate between 2-and 4-year for-profit schools, nor does it control for the type of program a student starts in or whether a student transfers to a higher degree program. Graduation rates are for the highest degree attained within 6 years. As a result, students who start in a certificate program and complete an associate's degree are included in the associate's degree graduation rate. Similarly, students who start in an associate's degree program and complete a bachelor's degree will be included in the bachelor's degree graduation rate. BPS data show that few, if any, students at forprofit and nonprofit schools start in certificate programs and complete an associate's degree within 6 years, while a small percentage of students at public schools do so.\nAn Education official told us that some teaching programs have historically required students to pass a licensing exam to graduate, so pass rates would always be 100 percent and therefore not a reasonable measure of program quality."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "We included 2-year public schools in our analysis because some students who started at these schools may have transferred to a 4-year school to complete a bachelor's degree program.

The nine licensing exams for which graduates of for-profit schools generally had lower pass rates were for Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN), Radiographers, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), Paramedics, Surgical Technologists, Massage Therapists, Lawyers, and Cosmetologists. On some exams, the differences across sectors were statistically significant, but relatively small. For example, 85 percent of graduates earning a bachelor's degree from for-profit nursing programs passed the RN exam, compared to 87 percent of such graduates from nonprofit schools. While we were unable to calculate overall pass rates on the 10th exam (for Funeral Directors), separate analyses of the two sections of the exam suggest that graduates of for-profit schools had similar or better pass rates than graduates of nonprofit and public schools. 12"}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "One study used NSLDS data to calculate default rates and IPEDS enrollment data to control for selected student characteristics. While the graduation rates calculated in IPEDS exclude part-time and transfer students, IPEDS enrollment data include these students. The other study used BPS data to calculate default rates. In general, a lack of statistical significance can mean that there is no actual difference or that the sample sizes are too small to detect any differences. While for-profit graduates as a group 12 It was not possible to compare the overall performance of graduates on the Funeral Director exam because data on the combined pass rate for the two sections of the exam (Arts and Sciences) were not available.\nThe District of Columbia is counted as a state in reporting on the number of states from which licensing data were collected."}, {"section_title": "For-Profit School Graduates Generally Had Lower Pass Rates than Graduates from Other Schools on Licensing Exams We Reviewed Exam Results", "text": "generally had lower pass rates, some individual for-profit schools had relatively high pass rates. For example, 9 of the 40 for-profit schools in our analysis of the radiographer exam had pass rates of 100 percent in 2010. 13 Several experts and higher education association officials said that licensing exam pass rates are one reasonable measure of school quality. However, exam pass rates also have some limitations when used for this purpose. For example, relatively few postsecondary graduates overall take licensing exams, as many occupations do not require a license. Further, pass rates on licensing exams only measure the performance of students who both complete a program and take the exam. Data were not available to compare the total number of students who begin a program with those who take the exam. Consequently, a high pass rate may not provide complete information about the quality of a program if a large number of enrolled students do not finish a program or do not take a licensing exam. 14 Differences in student populations may also affect pass rates. While focusing on graduates can mitigate the effect of differences in student characteristics, it may not completely eliminate the impact of these characteristics on test results. Nevertheless, the federal government has a strong interest in ensuring that schools that receive federal student aid funds are appropriately preparing graduates for any required licensing exams. We provided a draft copy of this report to Education for review and comment. Education did not have comments on the report. In addition, we shared relevant sections of the draft report with (1) the authors of studies included in our literature review and (2) the states and entities that 13 In most cases, the pass rate data provided by testing entities did not identify individual schools. As a result, it was not possible to conduct further analyses on school characteristics that might be associated with higher pass rates. 14 For example, a school may enroll 100 students in an educational program. If 75 students do not complete the program or choose not to take a required licensing exam, only 25 of the initial 100 students will take the exam. If all 25 pass the exam, the program will have a 100-percent pass rate. This school will have the same pass rate as a school that enrolled 100 students, who all completed the program, took the exam, and passed."}, {"section_title": "Limitations Agency Comments", "text": "provided licensing exam data to us.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. To address our objectives, we (1) conducted a structured literature review of recent studies comparing selected postsecondary student outcomes at for-profit and nonprofit and/or public schools and (2) collected and analyzed pass rate data for selected licensing exams for first-time test takers from for-profit, nonprofit, and public schools, focusing on schools that participate in federal student aid programs. To identify recent research on comparative postsecondary student outcomes at for-profit, nonprofit, and public schools, we conducted a structured literature review. We searched numerous bibliographic databases-including Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), ProQuest, Education Journals, PsycINFO, National Technical Information Service (NTIS), EconLit, and WorldCat-for articles or studies published from January 2000 through July 2011 that used data from 2000 or later. We employed a variety of search strategies to identify research related to student outcomes such as graduation rates, employment outcomes, earnings, student loan indebtedness, and default rates. In addition to searching the bibliographic databases, we identified studies through citations in previously identified work and through a review of several higher education news publications. We also asked higher education associations, researchers, and Education officials to identify any relevant studies and included such studies in our review. We defined \"studies\" broadly to include published peer-reviewed journal articles; ongoing studies submitted to journals for formal publication by academic researchers; unpublished studies by higher education associations, academic researchers, and other experts; and studies issued or commissioned by different higher education associations, researchers, the Congressional Research Service, or Education. In order to focus on studies that compared postsecondary student outcomes at for-profit and nonprofit and/or public schools, we examined all initial search results and restricted our formal review to studies meeting the following criteria: \u2022 focused on the U.S. student population; \u2022 used at least some data collected in 2000 or later; \u2022 addressed at least one of the following student outcomes: graduation rates, earnings, employment outcomes, student loan debt, and default rates; \u2022 compared outcomes of for-profit schools with outcomes of nonprofit and/or public schools; and \u2022 contained original analysis controlling for at least one student characteristic (e.g., race, gender, and age). We identified 32 studies that met these screening criteria. For each of these studies, we conducted a rigorous review of the research methodology, including the research design; objectives; data source; analyses conducted; and any applicable data-related or methodological limitations. As a result of this review, we excluded 21 studies due to methodological limitations and retained 11 for our analyses (see app. II for a list of the 11 studies). Seven of the 11 remaining studies included information on graduation rates, 1 study focused on employment outcomes, 4 studies included information on total student loan indebtedness, and 2 studies included information on student loan default rates at schools. All of these studies included comparative analyses of student outcomes at for-profit and nonprofit and/or public schools, while controlling for at least one student characteristic, and all were determined to be methodologically sound. 3 To identify potential occupations for our analyses, we reviewed information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook and Education data on the largest fields of study by enrollment. We also spoke with and reviewed information from representatives at national credentialing organizations, state licensing bodies, testing companies, and other entities involved in occupational licensing, to learn more about which occupations require practitioners to pass an exam, which states require practitioners to pass specific exams, and the availability of exam data. To identify educational programs of study associated with our potential list of occupations, we reviewed Education's Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes. We initially considered more than 20 occupational fields. 4 We restricted our analysis of licensing exam data to occupations that met the following criteria. 5"}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "Practitioners are generally required to pass a licensing exam in order to work. 6\nPassing a licensing exam is generally not a requirement to graduate from a program of study. 8 To ensure that we selected programs with sufficient numbers of graduates across sectors, we used CIP data to determine the number of students completing each program in each sector in school year 2009. 9 As we identified potential occupations and programs and spoke with representatives from state and other licensing entities, we further refined our list by eliminating occupations where available data would not allow us to both (1) reliably identify the type of school at which test takers completed an educational program and (2) reliably distinguish first time test takers from repeat test takers. 10 Licensing exams in the following 10 occupations met our criteria and the associated exam entities agreed to provide us with data: Registered Nurse (RN), Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), Radiographer, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Paramedic, Surgical Technologist, Massage Therapist, Lawyer, Cosmetologist, and Funeral Director. We generally collected licensing exam pass rate data for first-time test takers for calendar years 2008, 2009, and 2010 to allow us to identify pass rate patterns and account for any data anomalies that might occur in a single year.

In addition, using the student (rather than the school) as the unit of analysis resulted in larger comparison groups, which increased the likelihood of detecting any statistically significant differences that might exist between sectors. Generally, there were not substantial differences between the overall sector pass rates and the mean school pass rates. 31 In some cases, sector differences in student pass rates were statistically significant, but differences in the mean school pass rates were not. This may be due to the fact that analyses of mean school pass rates are based on fewer observations than analyses of overall sector pass rates. There are some limitations related to using licensing exam pass rates as an indicator of school quality. First, although experts and higher education association officials told us that licensing exam pass rates are one reasonable measure of school quality, relatively few postsecondary school graduates take licensing exams because many occupations do not 29 To calculate mean school pass rates, we counted the number of school programs in our data.

Therefore, this analysis is limited to specific programs for which graduates require licensure and does not provide information on the quality of other types of postsecondary programs. In addition, reliable data were not available to estimate the number of students who begin programs likely to lead to specific occupations requiring a license; as a result, we could not compare the number of students who begin a program to those who complete the program or to those who take the relevant licensing exam. Therefore, a school could have a high licensing exam pass rate, but could also have a high drop-out rate if the students least likely to pass the exam did not complete the program. Additionally, a school could have a high exam pass rate if those graduates least likely to pass the exam decided not to take it. Although student characteristics, such as race and income, have generally been found to be correlated with student outcomes, data were generally not available on the characteristics of licensing exam test takers. As a result, controlling for these factors in our analysis was not possible. Exam pass rates may be affected by the extent to which schools in one sector serve a higher proportion of nontraditional or disadvantaged students. Similarly, schools that attract better prepared students may have higher licensing exam pass rates, which may not be a direct function of the quality of the education provided. Although focusing on outcomes for graduates can mitigate the impact of student characteristics, it may not completely eliminate the effect of these characteristics on test results. Lastly, the number of schools and students for some of the exams in our analysis was quite small. For example, there was only one for-profit law school in Florida and only one for-profit, two nonprofit, and two public law schools in Georgia. Similarly, there were only 5 for-profit paramedic programs compared to 368 public paramedic programs (see app. III for data on the number of programs and test takers for each exam).
