Time series plot of shoreline change for representative transects along eastern Perdido Key, Florida, over the period 1920 to 2013. Shoreline position is shown relative to the 1920 location. Of significance are two shaded episodes of erosion (A and C), and a shaded episode of accretion (B). The erosional episodes (A and C), appear to be directly associated with the passage of major storms, while the timing of the accretion episode (B) appears to be the cumulative result of two major nourishment projects along eastern Perdido Key in 1985 and again in 1989-1991. The first nourishment took place in 1985, in response to the passage of Hurricane Frederic in 1979, and just prior to the passage of Hurricane Elena. ................................................................................ 38\nvii\n\n\f2.9.

Time series plot of shoreline change along eastern Perdido Key, Florida, over the period of increased storminess, 1998 to 2013. Shoreline position is shown relative to the 1998 location. Three distinct periods of shoreline retreat at four representative transects along the eastern section of the island are highlighted. Erosional episode (A) is consistent with the passage of Hurricane Georges (1998). The area shaded (B) is representative of Hurricane Ivan's impact (2004) and the cluster of storms in 2005 \u00ad Dennis, Arlene and the distal passage of Katrina. The third erosional episode (C) is consistent with the passage of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, as well as Tropical storm Ida (2009). The unusual cluster of storms over the short-term period have significantly impacted shoreline morphology. ..................................................................... 42\n2.13. Rate of shoreline change between transects 234 and 240, on the easternmost portion of the island, over the period of increased storminess, 1998-2013. During this interval, the eastern portion of the shoreline eroded heavily, as shown in Fig. 2.11, while the recurved spit in the vicinity of T-234 grew into the inlet at a rate of approximately 3.5 meters/year. ........................ 43\n2.14. Three dimensional representation of shoreline change along Perdido Key over the period 1920 \u00ad 2013. The figure was created using a time series gridded surface of the linear regression of shoreline change from 1920 \u00ad 2013. The colors represent shoreline change, in meters, relative to 1920. Positive values indicate accretion and negative values show erosion. The two peaks to the eastern terminus of Perdido Key reflect the positive contributions of the beach nourishment projects (1985 and 1989-1991) that took place in this locale. Additionally, the dredging of Pensacola Pass contributed sediment to the beach face between transects 234 to 240 which facilitated accretion in this area. The missing quadrant of data along the eastern segment of Perdido Key reflect the partial coverage obtained from T-sheets between 1920 \u00ad 1965. ............ 44\n3.1.

Historical shoreline change for the eight range monument locations along the eastern section of Perdido Key. The non-linear, dynamic nature of shoreline movement over this portion of the island resulted in low R2 values and was likely due to the effect of hurricanes over the study period (1974-2010). The shoreline behavior at R-65 is noticeably different from the other monuments (R-31 to R-60). The position of the shoreline at R-65 is influenced by its close proximity to the inlet at Pensacola Pass........................................................................................ 84\n3.7.

The bottom image, taken after Hurricane Ivan, reveals the destruction of the primary dune system as well as the presence of overwash fans extending approximately 400 ft inland\nix\n\n\ffrom the shoreline. A significant quantity of sand was also moved offshore of the primary bar following Hurricane Ivan, resulting in an increase in island width, primarily along the undeveloped portions of the shoreline. ......................................................................................... 87\n3.10. Alongshore variation in the height of the foredune along Range Monument 36 from 1974 to 2010. The zero mark along the horizontal axis represents the monument location starting point. The highest foredune height of +12 ft was recorded prior to the passage of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and followed a six year period of storm quiescence. The loss in elevation subsequent to storm passage is evident in the 2004 Post-Ivan and 2005 profiles. .............................................. 88\n3.11. Comparison of post-Opal, post-Ivan and post-Dennis beach profiles at Perdido Key monument R-36.

Time-series plots of three representative transects (1670, 1750 and 1790) taken along Zone 2 of the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island (See Fig. 4.8, inset for location). The figure reveals significant shoreline retreat around the year 1980. Over the period 1979 to 1994, approximately 3 million cubic yards of material were removed from the inlet as a result of dredging and inlet maintenance and contributed to the erosion observed southeast of the inlet at Zone 2.

An estimate of the future shoreline position to the year 2100 based on current trends of shoreline movement along Little St. George Island. This End Point Rate (EPR) estimate of the shoreline indicates a landward regression of approximately 50 meters from its most recently mapped (2013) shoreline position. This represents a mean rate of retreat of approximately -0.6 m/yr. ............................................................................................................................................ 139\n4.16. Forecast future shoreline position along the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island for the year 2100 shows an overall island-long seaward advance. The forecast indicates that the segment immediately surrounding the inlet zone (Zone 2) is dominated by erosion to the north of the inlet and accretion south of the inlet. The remainder of the island's shoreline on both sides of the inlet is dominated by accretion. On average, the portion of the island north of the inlet (Zone 1) is projected to undergo a mean rate of advance of 0.98 m/yr over the next century,\nxiii\n\n\fwhile the zone to the south (Zone 3) of the inlet is projected to accrete at a mean rate of 2.76 m/yr. ............................................................................................................................................ 140\nxiv\n\n\fABSTRACT\nThe ability to accurately quantify shoreline variability along sandy beaches is essential in order to establish aggressive mitigation strategies, based on recent global climate change projections. This investigation employed a suite of coastal data -- topographic maps, aerial photography, high-resolution satellite imagery, and Lidar survey data-- to establish decadal trends of shoreline movement along sandy barrier islands on the northwest and southeast coasts of Florida. An extensive collection of data was assembled for the project, comprising nearly two dozen historic shoreline positions dating from the mid-19th century to the present. The techniques used to detect morphologic change with time were the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and a modernized analytical approach, Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R (AMBUR). The latter approach was modified with a storm function to provide a forecast of the shoreline under predictions of more intense storminess.\nResults reveal that severe storms produce dramatic morphological alterations of the coast and in some cases, can result in shoreline retreat in excess of 50 meters during a single event. Special emphasis was placed on rates of change during the past decade and a half period (19952013) of active storm conditions. Of the three study areas analyzed, Little St. George Island returned the highest average rate of change of -4.33 m/yr in response to increased storminess. The average rate of change along Perdido Key in response to storms was -0.57 m/yr. Northern Merritt Island however, demonstrated the most stable shoreline of the three study sites and returned an overall mean rate of change of 0.41 m/yr. The results reveal that shoreline orientation, along with engineering projects, affect shoreline position over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The trends of shoreline movement also indicate that nearshore bathymetry wields some influence on the behavior of local segments of a barrier island's shoreline. Tidal inlet dynamics were found to cause increased shoreline fluctuations and more notably, accelerated rates of erosion, especially immediately downdrift from the inlets.\nThis project also enumerated volumetric and morphologic change in coastal dunes along a low-profile barrier island. The investigation established that natural dune recovery is directly related to the duration and frequency of storms. Further, the intensity of individual storms was found to be strongly correlated to trends in dune stability and shoreline evolution. Results show that the maintenance of viable dune fields is dependent on several ancillary factors. Such factors include: sediment supply via longshore drift or artificial nourishment, island width, dune field\nxv\n\n\fwidth, continuity of the dune complex, inner-shelf bathymetry and dune re-vegetation. In many cases, dune re-vegetation after storm passage delayed volumetric loss, favoring dune growth and reducing erosion. The analyses indicated that beach and dune recovery was initiated approximately six years following a major storm event. The results demonstrate that the most stable dunes were located along undeveloped and un-nourished segments of the island. In areas where nourishment had taken place however, foredune volumetric loss was significantly less pronounced. The results of this project provide a better and more detailed understanding of the vulnerability of coastal environments to the effects of climate change.\nxvi\n\n\fCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\nResearch Significance The study of coastal landforms and the morphological changes that occur over a variety of spatial and temporal scales in response to fluctuating physical processes, define the field of coastal geomorphology (Pethick, 1984). One of the most important problems in modern coastal geology is quantifying and analyzing the physical response of the shoreline to storms and sealevel rise. The impacts of both these factors are projected to amplify in the near future under global climate change, and pose an unprecedented erosional threat to the natural equilibrium of coastlines (Strauss et al., 2012; Tebaldi et al., 2012, Thieler et al., 2013). Further, as coastal populations burgeon, beaches have transitioned to sites of intense residential and commercial development. The combined environmental effects of sea-level rise, storms and increasing coastal density include significant shoreline retreat, damage to coastal dunes, destruction of lowlying infrastructure and loss of biological habitat. These consequences present severe social, economic and environmental hazards for terrestrial and marine communities that rely on the coastal zone for their livelihood (Fletcher et al., 2003; Oliver-Smith, 2009). As a result, understanding the many complex mechanisms that act as catalysts to alongshore variability in shoreline movement, and predicting the response of the shoreline is critical to planning future coastal zone management strategies. Many studies have developed methodologies for quantifying trends in shoreline change over the last few decades (Bruun 1988; Cowell, Roy and Jones, 1992; Thieler and Danforth, 1994; Crowell and Leatherman, 1999; Niedoroda et al., 2003; Thieler et al., 2005; Stolper et al., 2005). A brief summary of these techniques is provided in Appendix A. Along the United States Gulf and Atlantic coasts, previous shoreline change assessments have provided estimates of movement of the land-water boundary over large coastal segments (scales of hundreds of kilometers). Few studies exist that enumerate shoreline change-rates for specific coastal segments on a smaller, regional scale of tens of kilometers. Also, the majority of previous shoreline change analyses were conducted using data obtained from limited technology, and resulted in high values of positional and measurement uncertainties. Those studies also assessed shoreline movement assuming linearity of the coastline. Coastal dynamics are non-linear and\n1\n\n\fmany of the earlier predictions that defined preceding studies may no longer be relevant, especially along shorelines with unique orientations.\nThis dissertation addresses the limitations mentioned above and presents an updated approach for quantifying and analyzing shoreline change. The methods presented here are intended to be easily transferable to other coastal settings with the purpose of proactively planning for the likely effects of coastal erosion in the coming decades.\nResearch Design and Objectives This project focused on the geomorphology of sandy barrier island environments. The study compiled a highly detailed and updated inventory of historical and recent (up to the year 2013), shoreline positions for three barrier island segments (Perdido Key, Little St. George Island and Northern Merritt Island) along varying sections of the Florida coast. This dataset, containing a high sampling frequency of digitized shorelines from historical survey maps, aerial photos and Lidar data, is one of the most extensive databases in existence for coastal Florida. This comprehensive historical record presents new opportunities to investigate current and future time series analyses of shoreline change along the aforementioned coastal settings. Over 3,400 individual measurements of shoreline movement were made to aid in detecting erosion-prone zones and predicting the evolution of future shorelines over varying time scales. The main objective of this project was the development of robust estimates of shoreline change using state-of-the-art GIS mapping and innovative analytical methods that model the non-linear trends in coastal behavior. The anticipated outcome of this work was to quantitatively assess changes in shoreline position with improved spatial resolution and accuracy. More precise estimate of shoreline movement facilitate cost-effective mitigation and adaptation strategies that address the near-term effects of climate change on coastal environments. As the research progressed, several corollary objectives of this project included:  Determination of barrier island shoreline behavior relative to recent conditions on a scale of tens of kilometers.  Evaluation of the specific influence of short-term, high intensity events (coastal storms) on the evolution of sandy barrier island shorelines.  Identification of erosion \"hotspots\" along the study sites to aid with coastal construction trends and future mitigation measures based on climate projections.\n2\n\n\f Investigation of the role of anthropogenic practices (beach nourishments, engineered inlets, armored structures) in influencing shoreline change along barrier islands.\n Examination of shoreline variability along coastal settings with unique (non-linear) coastal orientations.\n Quantification of the degree to which nearshore formations influence longshore patterns of shoreline change.\n Comparison and evaluation of foredune recovery in response to storms along undeveloped and developed segments of a low-profile barrier island coastline.\n Determination of the time it takes for beach and dune equilibration following a major storm event.\nPrincipal Results and Publication Status by Chapter This document consists of three manuscripts that are under peer review or in the process of being submitted. Each chapter represents an individual publication and as such, the reader may observe similarities in various sections. One manuscript has been submitted to Geomorphology, another is being submitted to Marine Geology, and the final document will be forwarded to Earth Surface Processes and Landforms. Appendices have been added to allow the reader to understand past modelling methodologies, view raw data and analyze a sample of the statistical code used to obtain rate-of-change statistics for one of the study areas. The primary findings and publication status for each investigation are given below.\nChapter 2: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Decadal-Scale Patterns in Barrier Island Response to Storms: Perdido Key, NW Florida Principal Results: The results from this study indicate that the barrier shoreline along Perdido Key is an extremely variable feature with distinct zones of accretion and erosion that are pervasive over long-term and short-term time periods. A three-dimensional (3-D) time series plot of shoreline change highlighted the temporal persistence of these zones, separated by an offshore inflection point near the center of the island. The trends appeared to be strongly associated with the presence of nearshore geomorphic features. The majority of the observed changes along Perdido Key were in part due to the severe erosion fueled by major storms, and to lesser extent smaller tropical systems. This study also revealed that sand availability and sediment transport\n3\n\n\fassociated with changes in inlet dynamics can lead to considerable shoreline variability through shoaling and sediment bypassing events.

The project revealed that overwash, resulting from elevated storm surge caused significant erosion of the foredune complex. This was especially true in regions where the island was narrow and the coastal dune field was discontinuous. Results show that the maintenance of viable dune fields is dependent on several factors. Such factors include: sediment supply via longshore drift or artificial nourishment, island width, dune field width, continuity of the dune complex, and inner-shelf bathymetry. Authors: Ravi D.

The data demonstrate elevated rates of erosion along Little St. George Island on the Gulf coast of Florida and a relatively stable shoreline dominated by accretion, on Northern Merritt Island, along the Atlantic coast. Tidal inlet dynamics were found to cause increased shoreline fluctuations and more notably, accelerated rates of erosion downdrift from the inlets. Quantification of shoreline movement demonstrated that storms dominate barrier island geomorphic change. The results also highlight that shoreline orientation coupled with the presence of offshore shoals wield some influence on the behavior of local segments of the shoreline over a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

It is well documented that the interplay between the sediment budget, deltaic subsidence and wave dynamics driven by storms and sea level variations are the main contributors to coastal change (May, Dolan and Hayden, 1983; Niedoroda et al., 1995; Komar, 1998). However, anthropogenic influences related to commercial and residential development, coupled with the impetus to protect coastal natural resources, have also strongly influenced shoreline change (Komar, 1996; Hobbs et al., 1999; Finkl, 2002; Slott, Murray and Ashton, 2010). The shoreline, expressed as the position of the land-water interface over time, generally serves as the main indicator of coastal erosion or accretion (Genz et al., 2007; Hapke et al., 2010; Jackson, Alexander and Bush, 2012). Of all the features along the coastal zone, the shoreline's position is the most dynamic. Rapid changes in shoreline position can strongly affect coastal habitats and lead to catastrophic socio-economic loss along low-lying coastal barrier islands (Chu et al., 2006). Barrier islands are increasingly susceptible to increasing sea level and coastal inundation caused by extreme storms and human activities such as inlet modification (Nebel, Trembanis and Barber, 2011). Quantifying the temporal and spatial changes of the shoreline along these islands can aid in identifying future erosion hotspots and enacting countermeasures to mitigate the hazard. Along the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida, barrier islands dominate the coastal landscape (Stapor, Matthews and Lindfors-Kearns, 1991). The importance of these features in serving as a driver of economic growth, together with their benefits in protecting fragile ecosystems from high-energy coastal winds and storm surge, has been well documented (Stone and McBride, 1998; Stone et al., 2004; FitzGerald et al., 2008). The prospect of higher magnitude storms as a direct result of climate change may assume the major role in driving\n6\n\n\fshoreline recession, especially along barrier environments (Elko et al., 2002; Elsner, Kossin and Jagger, 2008; Mousavi et al., 2011). The morphological response of barrier islands to an individual storm event may vary as a function of storm intensity, wave energy, shoreline orientation, coastal substrate, island topography and island width among other factors (Davis, 1997; Forbes et al., 2004).\nPrevious large-scale assessments (103 to 104 km) of shoreline change have been conducted along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast (Miller et al., 2004). These studies revealed that Florida's Gulf Coast shorelines receded at an average rate of -0.8 m/yr during the period 18552001 with a noticeable increase to -1.5 m/yr over the three year interval (1998-2001) (Morton et al., 2004). This study is unique when compared to previous regional analyses of shoreline change along the Gulf of Mexico coast. In the current study, we attempt to evaluate the influence of short-term high intensity events (coastal storms) on the behavior of a typical sandy barrier island shoreline, Perdido Key, Florida, on a more detailed scale of tens of kilometers. We also explore the variability in the rates of historical and recent shoreline change along the coast, due to beach nourishment projects as well as engineered structures, such as inlets. The nature of the Perdido Key shoreline presents a unique opportunity to investigate morphological change along a barrier island in a setting that is moderately developed on one end of the island and devoid of human influence on the other. Based on the analysis of the rate-of-change statistics, we attempt to develop guidelines for future coastal erosion countermeasures that may work to curb shoreline erosion. Additionally, we provide an updated methodology for predicting the evolution of barrier shorelines.\n\nGulf Coast Barriers\n\nRegional Setting\n\nBarrier islands make up approximately fifteen percent of the world's coastlines and can\n\nbe found in almost every type of climate and geological setting (Davis, 1997). One of the most\n\ndistinguishing features of the Gulf of Mexico coastline is the presence of these islands.\n\nAccording to Miller et al., (2004), approximately 70 percent of the northern Gulf of Mexico\n\nshoreline is characterized by the presence of these narrow, shore-parallel sand deposits.\n\nThe origin and geometrical influence of these dynamic coastal features reflects a tenuous\n\nequilibrium between sediment supply, wave and tidal forces and more recently, anthropogenic\n\n7\n\n\factivities (Hoyt, 1967; Hayes, 1979; Nebel, et al., 2011). Reinson (1992) noted that barrier islands are geologically young, having originated during the mid-Holocene deceleration in postglacial sea-level rise, about 4,000 \u00ad 6,000 years ago. Three common theories have been proposed to explain barrier island development. The first concept is based on sediment aggradation and the subsequent emergence of offshore bars. According to DeBeaumont (1845), barrier islands form when an offshore bar vertically accretes up to the water surface as incoming wave action in shallow waters facilitate sediment accumulation. The second major theory as postulated by Gilbert (1885), suggested that littoral and longshore currents transport sediment that aid the formation of a sand-spit parallel to the coast. Eventual breach of the sand-spit by rising seas or storm wave activity results in barrier island formation. The third theory proposes barrier formation as a result of the separation of beach and dune complexes due to coastal submergence (McGee, 1890). No single theory has emerged as dominant in explaining barrier island genesis. Therefore, it is most likely that barrier formation had a combined mode of origin, both by coastal submergence and spit progradation.\nCoastal Environments The northwest coast of Florida is home to a variety of coastal environments, including\nsalt marshes, drowned karst topography, mainland beaches and of course, sandy barrier islands (Miller et al., 2004; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). Coastal change along the northwest Gulf coast is largely fuelled by strong winds and wave action associated with tropical cyclones (Niedoroda et al., 1985; Morton and Sallenger, 2003; Morton and Miller, 2005; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). The barrier islands along Florida's northwest coast all occur in regions of moderate tidal range and wave energy and are situated on a low-gradient passive margin shelf (Stone et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006)\nPerdido Key is a relatively narrow, sandy barrier island with an eastern portion in Escambia County, Florida, and a western portion in Baldwin County, Alabama (Figure 2.1). As the westernmost barrier island in Florida, Perdido Key stretches approximately 24 km from its eastern end at Pensacola Pass to Perdido Pass on the west (Figure 2.2). The surficial sediment along Perdido Key consists primarily of medium-grain quartz sand with small amounts of organic matter (Rakocinski et al., 1996). According to Brooks, (1982), Perdido Key lies on the northern flank of the southwestward trending Gulf Coast sedimentary basin. The formation of\n8\n\n\fPerdido Key as well as other barrier islands along the northwest region of Florida, is postulated to have resulted from the longshore transport of sediment supplied by an eroding Pleistocene core (Otvos, 1982; Stone and Stapor, 1996). Net sediment drift along Perdido Key is westerly and is estimated to be between 30,000 and 55,000 m3/yr (Browder and Dean, 1999b). Wave direction in this region is primarily from the southeast. The average annual wave height is approximately 0.5 m, with a mean wave period of roughly 6.0 s (Morang, 1992; Browder and Dean, 1999a). The gulf tides in the study area are principally diurnal and microtidal (Browder and Dean, 2000). The mean tidal range is 0.38 m (Foster, Spurgeon and Cheng, 1999).\nThe analysis of shoreline change for this investigation was carried out along an approximately 20 km stretch of Perdido Key, shown in Figure 2.2. There are 208 sequentially numbered survey reference points, designated as \"transects\", spaced along the shoreline approximately 100 m apart. This study employs these reference points to delineate various areas of significance within the study area. The area under investigation is divided into four main shoreline sections beginning from the Florida-Alabama boundary at transect 33, extending eastward to the terminus of the island, in the vicinity of the Pensacola Pass channel, at transect 240 (Figure 2.2). Due to the availability of a significantly greater temporal density of spatial data for the Florida portion of the island, the analysis of shoreline change began at transect 33 and extended eastward, excluding the westernmost three kilometers of the island. Proceeding eastward from transect 33, the first 4 km of shoreline contains primarily residential properties up to approximately transect 73. The next 2.6 km of shoreline (transect 73 to approximately transect 103) comprises the largely undeveloped Perdido Key State Recreation Area. A second area of development eastward from the Perdido Key State Recreation Area stretches along the shoreline for another 3.2 km up to transect 133, and is significantly more developed than the first area of development. The final shoreline segment (transects 133-240) lies within the confines of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. This section stretches approximately 11 km to the eastern end of the island and is undeveloped (Foster et al., 1999; Browder and Dean, 2000).\n9\n\n\fDeterminants of Coastal Change Along barrier island coastlines, short-term morphologic changes resulting from extreme events (coastal storms, extra-tropical storms) play a major role in modifying shoreline equilibrium (Miller et al., 2004; Stone et al., 2004). Several studies have examined the specific influence of coastal storms on the shorelines of the U.S coast. Anderson, Frazer and Fletcher (2010), used a probability-weighted model to confirm that the passage of storms result in both short-term and long-term shoreline reconfigurations. Other authors, in examining the response of varying coastal settings to storms, have concluded that long-term trends in shoreline movement were strongly correlated with the occurrence of extreme storm events (Fenster and Dolan, 1994; Zhang et al., 2002; Nebel et al., 2011). Regardless of the time scale under consideration, storminduced extreme wave and water-level conditions seem to be key drivers of barrier island dynamics. However, supplementary studies also suggest that other storm-related factors such as tidal conditions, storm surge duration and coastline orientation are important components when considering the impact of extreme events on coastline geomorphology (Cooper and Orford, 1998,; Kish and Donoghue, 2013).\nSea-level Change Throughout geologic history, the rate of sea-level change has fluctuated over varying\ntime scales due to changes in the spreading rate of mid-ocean ridges, tectonic and steric effects as well as glacial advance and retreat (Church and White, 2011). Over the short to moderate term, late Quaternary glacial dynamics have led to major variations in sea level (Huybrechts, 2002; Balsillie and Donoghue, 2011). At the greatest extent of the last glacial period, approximately 21,000 years ago, global sea level stood about 130 m below present level (Fairbanks, 1989; Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006). Following the disappearance of the northern hemisphere ice sheets approximately 8,000 years ago, sea-level rise rates slowed considerably. The past 6,000 years have seen only minor changes in eustatic sea level (Fairbanks, 1989). The sea-level history of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has mirrored eustatic sea level variations since the last glacial maximum. As a result, it is a reliable proxy for evaluating the pattern of global sea-level change over that time (Fairbanks, 1989; Donoghue, 2011)\nIt is well documented that sea-level change is the main catalyst for long-term barrier evolution (Gilbert, 1885; McGee, 1890; Stolper, List and Thieler, 2005). According to the\n10\n\n\fIntergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), Summary for Policymakers, global mean sea-level rise by the end of this century will likely be in the range of 0.26 to 0.98 m depending on the greenhouse gas emissions scenario (IPCC, 2014),\nLong-term tide gauge data for the past 150 years reveal a global long-term average rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm/year (Miller and Douglas, 2004; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Church and White, 2011). More recent measurements from satellite altimetry (post-1993) reveal an average open ocean mean sea level rate of 3.2 +/- 0.4 mm/year (Church and White, 2011; Strauss et al., 2012). Satellite altimetry data for the Gulf of Mexico since 1993 indicate rates of 3.1 +/- 0.4 mm/year (NOAA-LSA, 2014; NOAA-NOS, 2014). Based on measurements obtained from two long-term tide stations in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we established the rates of relative sea-level change in the Perdido Key region. The Cedar Key, Florida, tide gage, approximately 420 km southeast of the center of Perdido Key, has recorded an average 1.8 +/-0.1 mm/yr rise in sea-level over the period 1914-2012. Another tidal station located in the immediate vicinity of Perdido Key at Pensacola, Florida (Figure 2.2), approximately 17 km east of the center of Perdido Key, has recorded an average 2.19 +/- 0.23 mm/yr sea-level rise over the period 1923-2012 (Figure 2.3) (NOAA-NOS, 2014).\nRegional Storm History As climate change induces ocean-surface thermal expansion, storm-related water levels\nwill also increase, thereby enhancing erosion along barrier island shorelines (Zhang et al., 2002; Fiore et al., 2009). This scenario is of particular importance to barrier islands along the northwest Gulf of Mexico coast such as Perdido Key, as the relatively warm coastal waters in this region promote hurricane intensity. According to Elsner et al., (2008), the strength of a tropical cyclone is directly associated to the sea-surface temperature below the cyclone, and as the seas warm, the ocean's increased energy acts as a catalyst to higher cyclone wind speeds. Along with the warming waters off the coast of Perdido Key, the fairly shallow offshore bathymetry in this area often leads to elevated surge with hurricane passage and may accelerate coastal morphologic change.\nFigure 2.4 shows the tracks of hurricanes (categories 1-5) and less-intense tropical storm systems where the eye has passed within 140 km of Perdido Key between 1867 and 2013 (NOAA-CSC, 2014). The 140 km distance was chosen based on the model of Keim et al.\n11\n\n\f(2007). That study, centered on the full historic record of landfalling hurricanes for the eastern United States, found that the mean radius to hurricane-force winds for major (Cat. 3-5) storms was 120 km. This was said to be a conservative estimate. For the current study, a 140-km radius was used, in order to account for the fact that the Gulf of Mexico region is one of the more active locales for major storms. Of the 32 hurricanes that have passed nearby Perdido Key, ten have been categorized as major storms (categories 3-5) (Table 2.1). Five major storm events have impacted the area in the period from 1979 to present, with four of the major storms all clustering within a 10-year period: Erin and Opal (1995), Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005).\nAlthough major storms (categories 3-5) have been observed to result in significant coastal morphological response, less severe, slow-moving storm systems (subtropical and tropical systems, plus winter cold fronts) also contribute to shoreline adjustment on the northern Gulf of Mexico (Stone et al., 2004; Houser, Hapke and Hamilton, 2008). In addition to the 32 hurricanes that have passed within a 140 km radius of Perdido Key, 18 less-severe weather systems with varying landfall position (shore-perpendicular approach as opposed to oblique) have also impacted the study site over the past approximately 150 years (1867-2013). Most notably, in the last decade (2004-2014), a cluster of eight storms of varying intensity (Ivan, Dennis, Cindy, Katrina, Gustav, Ike, Ida and Debby) (Table 2.1) have passed within 140 km of Perdido Key, and have had a significant impact on the morphology of the barrier island.\nStorm Surge Barrier islands along the Gulf of Mexico coast have been found to be particularly\nvulnerable to the impact of coastal surge resulting from storm passage (Mousavi et al., 2011). According to Pugh (1987), coastal storm surges can be described as the difference between the observed water level and the predicted astronomical tide. In previous studies documenting change resulting from storm surges along Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island adjacent to Perdido Key, authors found that elevated wave amplitudes associated with storm surge are a major cause of foreshore erosion, dune retreat and overwash (Claudino-Sales, Wang and Horwitz, 2010; Kish and Donoghue, 2013; Bambach, 2013). Additionally, along the coast of Santa Rosa Island, Houser et al., (2008), noted that storm surge resulting from hurricanes making landfall at significant distances outside the established 140 km perimeter of hurricane-force winds \u00ad Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Georges (1998) -- caused considerable shoreline erosion and\n12\n\n\foverwash. Since 1995, five hurricanes have produced localized storm surge along the Perdido Key coast in excess of 1.5 m, with Hurricanes Opal (1995), Georges (1998) and Ivan (2004) all producing local storm surges of 3 m or more. Table 2.2 lists surge height values for storms that have impacted the area under investigation within a 140 km radius.\nHurricane Opal made landfall approximately 20 km east of Perdido Key on October 4th, 1995 (Figure 2.4). Wind speeds in the vicinity of Perdido Key were reported to be approximately 38 m/s (approx. 85 mph) (Tracy and Cialone, 1996). Data from a deep water wave buoy in the nearby Gulf of Mexico indicated a maximum wind gust value of 34 m/s and a maximum significant wave height of 8.3 m. Storm surge estimates as a result of Opal in the Perdido Key area varied between 2.5 to 4 m (Clark and LaGrone, 2006). Hurricane Ivan struck the Gulf coast on September 15, 2004 as a Category 3 storm, approximately 14 km west of the FloridaAlabama state line. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP, 2004), Ivan generated sustained winds at landfall of 40 m/s. At the Pensacola tide gauge station, Ivan's storm surge was recorded at 2 m higher than Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), approximately four times the normal tidal range (Claudino-Sales et al., 2010). Additionally, an observed wave height of 15 m was reported by NOAA Buoy 42040, located in the north central Gulf of Mexico, approximately 120 km southwest of Perdido Key (FDEP, 2004).\nAnthropogenic Impacts Coastal geomorphology and by extension, the rates of shoreline change along a given\ncoast can be influenced by anthropogenic activities (Komar, 1991; Browder and Dean, 1999b; 2000; Hapke, Kratzmann and Himmelstoss, 2013). These human-induced practices include, but are not limited to, artificial beach nourishment and engineering projects such as dredging (Komar 1991; Fletcher et al., 2003). The entrance channel at Pensacola Pass adjacent to the eastern end of the study area (Figure 2.1) has been undergoing modification since 1878 (Foster et al., 1999). In the following decades up to 1991, the channel underwent several episodes of dredging with roughly 30 million cubic meters (m3) of material disposed offshore (Browder and Dean, 2000). Although approximately 1.9 million m3 of dredged material has been placed on the adjacent shorelines of Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island, a net loss of sediment has been noted from the littoral system (Browder and Dean, 1999b).\n13\n\n\fAlong the shoreline of Perdido Key, beach nourishment projects have been carried out on three occasions: 1985, 1989-1991 and more recently, the latter months of 2011 into early 2012. The 1985 project emplaced roughly 1.9 million m3 of sand along an approximately 1200-m stretch of coastline between transects 223 to 233 on the eastern end of the island (Browder and Dean, 2000). A more extensive nourishment followed during the period 1989 \u00ad 1991, and involved the placement of 4.2 million m3 of sand onshore between transects 153 to 233 (Browder and Dean, 1999a). The 1985 nourishment had a constructed berm height of +3.1 m relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum and represented an approximately 1 m increase in elevation from the previous height of the natural berm (Wang et al., 2013). The 1989 nourishment returned a berm height of +1.3 m NAVD88 (Browder and Dean 2000). More recently, the 2012 beach replenishment delivered roughly 400,000 m3 of sand just west of Pensacola Pass between transects 196 to 233 (Figure 2.2). This project differed from previous nourishment episodes in that it positioned sand nearshore of Perdido Key as a swash-zone berm (Wang et al., 2013). Once delivered, the sediment was graded to establish a berm height of +0.91 m NAVD88.\nNearshore Morphology Along with the effects of sea level, storms and human-induced activities, the presence of\nnearshore bathymetric features can also impact patterns of coastal change along barrier island shorelines (Foster et al., 1999; Hapke et al., 2010). According to Schwab et al., (2013), the existence of shoreface attached ridges can have significant effects on the sediment budgets and transport rates along shoreline segments. Foster et al., (1999), noted the occurrence of several submerged ridge features, trending obliquely from the Perdido Key shoreline southeastward into Gulf of Mexico. Figure 2.1 shows the location of three offshore bathymetric features (B1, B2 and B3). The nearshore features labeled B1 and B2 are offshore sand ridges and correlate with seaward projections in the 4 m contour. The third bathymetric feature (B3), is a trough characterized by a noticeable irregularity in the 8 m contour.\nAlong with the presence of nearshore bathymetric features, a complex of ebb shoals can be found approximately 6 km eastward from feature B3. Previous studies have shown that shoal alterations (i.e., reducing size or elevation) alter the sediment equilibrium of surrounding beaches and usually intensifies erosion (Komar, 1996; Galagano, 2009). One of the more prominent shoal systems in this region (Caucus Shoal), exists in close proximity to the Perdido Key shoreline.\n14\n\n\fThe Caucus Shoal is located to the west of Pensacola Pass and has depths between 6 to 8 m. Numerous dredging activities carried out primarily by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers have significantly altered the volume of the Caucus Shoal and other ebb shoal systems in the vicinity of the inlet channel at the eastern terminus of Perdido Key (Browder and Dean, 2000).\n\nShoreline Compilation\n\nMethodology\n\nCoastal change measurements for the Gulf of Mexico shorelines of Perdido Key spanning\n\n93 years (1920 to 2013) were obtained and incorporated into the analysis. Shoreline data for\n\nPerdido Key extending back to the year 1867 was available for the study but was not included\n\ndue to partial alongshore coverage. The historic shoreline data used for both the long-term and\n\nshort-term analyses represents one of most extensive collections of shoreline data for the region.\n\nData were derived from multiple sources, including United States Geological Survey (USGS)\n\ntopographic maps, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) T-sheets. A vast\n\nquantity of aerial imagery was also obtained from several agenices (United States Department of\n\nAgriculture, USGS, NOAA, Florida Department of Transport, and the Florida Department of\n\nEnvironmental Protection, Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems (FDEP-BBCS) (Table 2.3).\n\nIn some cases, data with missing coordinate system information was georegistered with ESRI\n\nArcGIS\u00a9 tools, using Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) orthophotography (2006-\n\n2007) as the registration base. Initially, digital images were assigned to the Florida State Plane\n\nCoordinate System (NAD83, Zone 16 North). However, for final analysis, data were reprojected\n\nto UTM coordinates (NAD83, Zone 16 North).\n\nOne of the most important considerations when analyzing shoreline change is the chosen\n\nproxy (Crowell, Leatherman and Buckley, 1991). Shoreline positions in many of the historical\n\ncharts used in this study were reported as the mean high water line (MHW). However, the actual\n\nshoreline proxy may have been the High Water Line (HWL). The proxy-based HWL shoreline\n\naccounts for the effects of variable tides plus run-up, whereas the datum-based MHW Lidar-\n\nderived shoreline are tied to the NAVD88 elevation and its relationship to local MHW (Ruggiero\n\net al., 2003). While the variation between the MHW line and the HWL may in some cases be of\n\nminor importance (Crowell et al., 1991; Nebel et al., 2011), inferred changes in shoreline\n\nposition can be influenced by the chosen datum, and a resulting bias may exist between the two\n\n15\n\n\fproxies. Variations in the HWL and MHW-Lidar derived shorelines in the northern Gulf of Mexico are almost negligible due to limited high tide range (approx. 0.2 m) and steep (approx. 0.05 degrees) slopes on the upper shore face (Morton and Miller, 2005).\nThe more recent shorelines (post-1998) used in this study were derived from Lidar data and based on the line of Mean High Water (MHW). The Lidar-based shoreline is defined by the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD88) elevation for the regional MHW line and represents an average of MHW elevations compiled from several tide gauges (Weber et al., 2005). For aerial images used in this analysis, the position of the shoreline was delineated using the visible \"wet line\". Generally, the wet line will approximate the HWL, but a considerable uncertainty may be present due to daily tidal variations as well as other factors such as wind-generated wave run-up (Kish and Donoghue, 2013).\nShoreline Change Rate Uncertainty Shoreline change-rates at individual transects are generally a function of the total\ncalculated shoreline position uncertainty (Hapke et al., 2013). The reliability of any shoreline change rate calculation is a function of two main types of uncertainty: (1) positional uncertainty, and (2) measurement uncertainty. Overall uncertainties in shoreline position are generally determined by estimating the individual errors associated with the original data sources, the orthorectification process and shoreline digitization (Fletcher et al., 2003; Hapke et al., 2013). Positional uncertainties are based on inaccuracies of the shoreline location at the time of survey acquisition (aerial images and T-sheets). These uncertainties may be due to a myriad of factors including, but not limited to, the seasonal state of the beach, tidal stage or the occurrence of storms (Fletcher et al., 2003; Genz et al., 2007). Measurement uncertainties are a function of the accuracy of user-based manipulation of photo or map products.\nFor the earlier shorelines in this study, uncertainties were quantified based on studies such as Crowell et al., (1991) and Miller et al., (2004). The reported positional accuracy of historical maps and charts at a scale of 1:20,000 is in the region of \u00b110 meters (Crowell et al., 1991; Morton and Miller, 2005; Nebel et al., 2011). For older aerial photos, the ArcGIS Georeferencing tool was employed to register co-ordinates to a recently acquired image with preassigned co-ordinates. The root mean square (RMS) error of the transformation for most images was in the range of 3 to 7 m. In some cases, due to a limited number of identifiable features on\n16\n\n\fthe island around the Gulf Island National Seashore, the RMS errors were larger (approximately 10 m).\nThe Perdido Key shoreline has been mapped by airborne Lidar over the period 1998 \u00ad 2007. According to Stockdon et al., (2002), each Lidar-derived shoreline has an associated Lidar position error and can be as great as 19 m for newly developed Lidar methods relative to HWL positions. For this study, we adhered to the Miller et al., (2005) estimate of \u00b11.5 m for the Lidar position error associated with Gulf of Mexico shorelines. Comparison of aerial imaging and Lidar data obtained during a one-year interval (2006 -2007) yielded position error values of approximately \u00b1 10 m along the length of the Perdido Key shoreline evaluated (Figure 2.5).\nShoreline Change Analyses and Calculation of Rates Rate of change statistics were calculated using two methods. The frequently used USGS\nDigital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.0, was first employed. DSAS is a freely available tool developed by Thieler et al., (2009), and designed to function within the ESRI ArcGIS environment. The DSAS technique utilizes a baseline measurement method (Leatherman and Clow, 1983) to compute rate-of-change statistics for series of shoreline positions.\nThe AMBUR (Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R) package designed by Jackson et al., (2012), was the second method used to assess shoreline change trends. AMBUR is a recently developed tool capable of emulating DSAS output. However, AMBUR also provides the opportunity to quantify changes along coastlines with curved characteristics, which can be challenging for shorelines with transects cast at right angles to the baseline. Unlike the DSAS technique, AMBUR is also capable of providing a visual, non-linear forecast of shoreline positions using an updated statistical approach.\nIn most shoreline change studies, linear regression has been the most commonly applied technique and arguably the most statistically precise method of estimating rates of shoreline evolution over time (Crowell and Leatherman, 1999). However, a growing body of research has revealed that linear regression may not be the best technique to model short-term temporal changes in shoreline behavior (e.g., accelerations or decelerations due to extreme storm events and human activities) (Fenster and Dolan, 1994; Morton and Miller, 2005; Jackson et al., 2012). As a result, in order to account for trend variations, we quantified the rates of shoreline change over both the long and short-term using both the end point rate (EPR) and the \"least-squares fit\"\n17\n\n\flinear regression rate (LRR) methods. This was accomplished by generating adjacent, orthogonal transects originating from a baseline, with 100-meter spacing (Figure 2.2). Transects were visually checked to ensure every shoreline established an intersection point with these orthogonal features.\nThe EPR calculation is simply defined as the distance from the oldest to the youngest shoreline divided by the number of years that have elapsed to yield a rate-of-change statistic. The oldest and youngest shorelines are referred to as the \"end points\". EPR is calculated using the equation:\n\nR = Dm/T\n\n(1)\n\nWhere R is the rate-of-change, Dm is the distance in meters between two dated shorelines, and T\n\nis the elapsed time between the two shoreline positions.\n\nUnlike the EPR calculation, the LRR method utilizes all shoreline data. The shoreline\n\nchange rate calculated by the LRR method is the slope of the line that is the least squares\n\ndistance to the shoreline points at each transect. The equation used to calculate the LRR is:\n\n\n\n=\n\n \n\n(2)\n\nWhere xy is the sample variance between dates (x) and their shoreline position (y), and xx is\n\nthe variance of the date samples.\n\nAnother metric that is helpful when assessing the variability of shoreline movement is standard deviation. The standard deviation (SD) of shoreline change provides a measure of shoreline position variability (Jackson, 2004). This calculation is helpful in measuring the fluctuation in shoreline positions, and can assist in identifying shoreline segments influenced by one or more parameters (Jackson, 2004). The SD is calculated using the equation:\n\n =  =  - 2\n\n(3)\n\nWhere N = the number of transects, SCi is the calculated change in shoreline position between varying time periods and is the mean shoreline change.\n\n18\n\n\fFor the shoreline change rates developed in this investigation, the convention of shoreline accretion being defined by positive values, with negative numbers signifying shoreline erosion was adhered to. Additionally, the dynamics of inlet erosion and accretion are assumed to affect the alongshore rates of change and as a result, the curved sand-spit at the eastern end of the island was analyzed separately.\nResults Previous shoreline change estimates for the Western Florida Gulf coast region have returned long-term erosional values of -0.8 \u00b1 0.9 m/yr with accretion rates in the range of 0.9 \u00b1 1.2 m/yr (Miller et al., 2004). Studies have also confirmed that higher rates of erosion have been noted at the presence of inlets (Clark, 1993; Rosati, 2005; Galagano, 2009). This study is unique relative to previous analyses of shoreline change that have been conducted along the Gulf of Mexico coast in that it focuses on shoreline change trends along a sandy barrier island on a localscale (tens of kilometers). The mean long-term (1920-2013), and short-term (1934-1983), (19982013) retreat rates for the Perdido Key shoreline are shown in Table 2.4.\nLong Term (1920 - 2013) Shoreline Change on Perdido Key An examination of the long-term shoreline history of the island over the period 1920 to\n2013 reveals a unique pattern of erosion and accretion (Figure 2.5). An inflection point in the vicinity of transect 125 separates the two processes observed. Over the 93-year period, approximately 54 percent of the Perdido Key shoreline experienced erosion with the remaining 46 percent of the shoreline displaying net accretion. Additionally, the long-term erosional signal extends westwards along Perdido Key for approximately 12 km, from the vicinity of Pensacola Pass on the eastern end, through the GINS and the developed portion of the key, to the vicinity of transect 125. The average rate of change along Perdido Key for all 208 transects (T-33 to T-240) over the long-term returned a value of -0.17 m/yr. For transects displaying erosive characteristics (transects 125 \u00ad 233), the average LRR rate of erosion was -0.52 m/yr. On the other hand, the mean rate for transects displaying accretion (transects 33 \u00ad 124) was 0.44 m/yr. The greatest change (~210 meters of coastal retreat) occurs between transects 213 and 233 (Figure 2.6), and is associated with the dynamics of the inlet near Pensacola Pass at the eastern end of the island. A long-term time series plot of four representative transects (transects 133, 153, 173 and 193),\n19\n\n\ftaken along the eastern half of Perdido Key reveals a noticeable cyclicity between periods of accretion and erosion, highlighting the dynamic nature of this portion of the island. Of significance are two distinct zones of erosion and one zone of accretion that have contributed to significant morphologic change (Figure 2.8). The erosional episodes (A and C), seem to be directly associated with the passage of storms, while the timing of the accretion episodes (B), coincides with the two nourishment projects that occurred in 1985 and again in 1989-1991.\nFigure 2.9 is a plot of the standard deviation of shoreline change along Perdido Key over the long-term (1920-2013). The figure highlights locations where shoreline movement was highly variable during this period. High values of standard deviation occur along three distinct regions of Perdido Key: between transects 63 to 65, 108 to 114 and 168 to 177. While these elevated values of standard deviation are indicative that the shoreline's movement along these sections is more variable than other portions of Perdido Key, the locations also coincide with the presence of nearshore bathymetry features (B1, B2 and B3). Further, the inflection point separating the two processes of erosion and accretion coincides with the presence of a significant offshore bathymetric feature between transects 125 and 130.\nShort-Term (1934-1983) and (1998-2013) Shoreline Retreat Analysis of short-term coastal change along Perdido Key was focused on two time\nperiods: 1934-1983 (prior to artificial beach nourishment), and 1998-2013 (storm influenced interval). The 1934-1983 analysis was focused at understanding natural shoreline movement along Perdido Key, without the addition of nourishment sand. The 1998-2013 analysis was aimed at understanding the coastal response to major storms over the short-term, including the passage of two major storms and six storms of lesser intensity during that period. Shoreline retreat rates over the two short-term eras show higher variability in erosion rates than over the long-term (1920-2013).\nDuring the short-term pre-nourishment era (1934 \u00ad 1983), the alongshore end-point rate values reveal erosion on the eastern half of the island, and accretion in the west, with the changeover occurring in the vicinity of transects 125 to 130 (Figure 2.10). The mean EPR of shoreline change over this period was approximately -0.36 m/yr for all transects. Approximately 44 percent of transects displayed an average shoreline erosion rate of -1.14 m/yr while the average rate of accretion for transects with positive EPR rates (56 percent of transects), returned\n20\n\n\fa value of +0.49 m/yr. Three small localized erosional areas also appeared on the westward end of Perdido Key during the 1934-1983 era, past the inflection point at transect 125. Further, along the eastern portion of the island where erosion dominated, a restricted pocket of minor accretion was noted in the vicinity of transect 201. This may have been due to the passage of Hurricane Frederic (1979), which made landfall approximately 80 km west of Perdido Key and moved sediment shoreward forming offshore bars. The increase in spatial extent of both erosion and accretion along Perdido Key during this time period seem to be directly related to the influence of Hurricane Frederic.\nAn analysis of the period defined as \"storm-influenced\" (1998 \u00ad 2013) indicates that the average shoreline retreat rate for transects displaying erosive properties (46 percent of transects), was much more rapid (-2.33 m/yr) over this short-term era as opposed to the two other periods analyzed (Table 2.4). Although 54 percent of alongshore transects demonstrate positive rates of change (1.07 m/yr), the overall average rate of change over the storm influenced interval returned a value of -0.57 m/yr. The highest retreat rates during the storm-influenced era were found adjacent to the eastern end of Perdido Key (Figure 2.11), from the region of the Gulf Island National Seashore at transect 175 to the vicinity of the inlet near Pensacola Pass at transect 233. Detailed analysis of the alongshore patterns in Figure 2.11 also indicates that a significant erosional hotspot (~ 210 meters of landward retreat), exists between transect 210 and 233. This accelerated rate of erosion over the short term is almost directly attributable to the increase in hurricane activity and intensity beginning with the passage of Hurricane Erin in 1995. The severe impacts resulting from the passage of Hurricanes Erin and Opal (1995), Ivan (2004), Dennis (2005) and the subsequent effects of smaller storms Arlene, Cindy, Katrina, Rita and Wilma (all in 2005), Gustav, Ike (2008) and Ida in 2009, contributed to the critical erosion experienced along the undeveloped National Seashore property on the eastern part of the island. Figure 2.12 highlights distinct zones of shoreline retreat at four representative transects within the Gulf Islands National Seashore area along eastern Perdido Key. This recessive trend is consistent with the passage of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, and the cluster of storms in 2005 that negatively impacted shoreline morphology.\nWhile the short-term rate of erosion more than doubled during this time period when compared to the other eras, Figure 2.11 shows higher variability alongshore with areas of accretion extending further eastward along Perdido Key up to transect 175. These small pockets\n21\n\n\fof accretion are very likely due to the shoreward transport of sand that occurred along sections of the study area with the incidence of Hurricane Ivan. According to the FDEP (2004), significant volumes of sand was transported landward during the storm, resulting in the catastrophic erosion of the upper beach and primary dune system. While the erosive patterns on the eastern half of Perdido Key seem to be consistent with the passage of frequent tropical systems during the storm-influenced period, the dynamics of alongshore transport resulting from the presence of the inlet in this area appears to also be responsible for the heavy erosion along this section of the island. Further, the erosion along this reach of Perdido Key seems to be intensified by the refractive effects of the ebb shoal system in this locale, resulting in a loss of sediment from longshore transport, coupled with a directional reversal in net sediment transport.\nInlet Morphologic Change An analysis of shoreline change was also carried out on the curved portion of the Perdido\nKey shoreline beginning from transect 234 to the eastern terminus of the island adjacent to the inlet at transect 240 (Figure 2.13). Mapping the rate of shoreline change along the eastern terminus of the island over the storm-influenced period (1998 \u00ad 2013) indicated shoreline advance at a rate of 3.5 m/yr. Over time, the shoreline in the immediate vicinity of the inlet has evolved from a curved orientation to a relatively stable, well-defined feature. The seaward advance observed along the eastern terminus of Perdido Key in the vicinity of the inlet, reflect the positive contributions of beach nourishment projects (1985 and 1989-1991) that took place in this locale. Further, dredging of Pensacola Pass contributed sediment to the beach face in this area which may have facilitated shoreline accretion.\nDiscussion Examination of both the long-term and short-term history of the island's shorelines has revealed that patterns of shoreline change are distinctly different between the eastern and western sections of Perdido Key. Shoreline movement (primarily erosional) along the eastern section of Perdido Key appears to be driven principally by storm effects, the presence of the inlet, and the occurrence of shoals in the vicinity of the entrance channel. In direct contrast, shoreline accretion categorizes the western, developed portion of the island. The presence of residential and commercial buildings along the western segment of Perdido Key appear to have acted as\n22\n\n\fartificial barriers to erosion and aided accretion. Here, beach width increased as wave action transported sediment to the beach face. In general, the island displays a type of rotational instability, with the western half (transects 33-124) advancing, and the eastern half (transects 125-233) undergoing net retreat. These results are consistent with the findings of Hayes (1979) that suggest wave-dominated barriers, such as this one, may display rotational characteristics.\nCorrelation between Storm Occurrence and Shoreline Evolution The period of greatest erosional change has been the storm-influenced interval from 1998\nto 2013, during which a cluster of major and smaller storms significantly influenced the island's morphology. Prior to the period of increased storminess however, the data indicate two historical storm events in the late 19th century (late 1880's) and early 20th century (1917) that resulted in extreme erosion and facilitated the opening of temporary inlets. Both inlets were closed (sediment-filled) by the 1920's.\nThe bulk of the shoreline movement over the post-storm period (1998 to 2013) occurred during the decade encompassing four major storm events \u00ad Hurricanes Erin and Opal (1995), Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005). In the subsequent decade, another group of less severe storms, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike (2008), tropical storm Ida (2009) and more recently, tropical storm Debby (2012), impacted the study area. The relatively brief return periods for these storm systems have worked to delay any natural beach recovery to pre-storm conditions that might have been expected to occur following the major storms. The period between 1998 and 2013 witnessed erosional hotspots spreading further alongshore to the western end of Perdido Key. Our analyses over both the long and short-term time periods indicate that, as storm intensity and frequency changes, the large-scale coastline shape of Perdido Key shifts, causing areas of greatly accelerated coastal erosion to alternate with areas of considerable accretion (Figure 2.11).\nEven though major storms since 1998 have resulted in consistent shoreline retreat, the recent passage of the less-intense Tropical storm Debby (July 2012) also led to significant erosion along Perdido Key. The most recent shoreline (2013), reveals significant landward retreat of approximately 25 meters between transects 233 \u00ad 234 from the previous 2010 shoreline. During the passage of TS Debby in July, 2012, a University of South Florida Coastal Research Laboratory (USF-CRL) nearshore wave gauge, located approximately 0.4 miles offshore from the mainland (shown in Figure 2.1), recorded a storm-induced wave amplitude of\n23\n\n\f2.1 m, along with a period of 10.6 seconds. Additionally, an elevated water level of approximately 0.15 m above normal tide level was also measured at the USF-CRL wave gauge (Wang et al., 2013). These high wave events resulting from the passage of Tropical storm Debby highlights the erosive effects of smaller storms.\nFactors Contributing to High Erosion Rates While the effects of storms dominate the high erosion rates along Perdido Key, two other\nprocesses appear to act in concert to magnify the erosive effects noted in our results: 1) dredging of the inlet at the eastern terminus, and 2) bathymetric features (offshore sediment bars). When barrier island shorelines occur near inlets, the resulting deficiency in sand supply has usually resulted in erosional hot-spots with anomalously high rates of retreat (Hayes, 1979; Foster, 1995; Galgano, 2009). In the case of Perdido Key, our results confirm these findings. The presence of Pensacola Pass on the eastern end results in a deficiency in the sediment supply from the inlet moving westward. Trapping of the westerly-directed littoral drift at the inlet starves the adjacent eastern section of Perdido Key. This results in accelerated erosion downdrift of the inlet, predominantly along the undeveloped portion of the island to as far west as transect 125.\nAlthough at least three artificial beach fill projects have taken place along the eastern portion of Perdido Key, these modifications appear to have only slowed the rates of erosion until the passage of the next major storm. While previous research has generally emphasized the accretive effects of beach nourishment (Nordstrom, 2005; Absalonsen and Dean, 2011), our analyses reveal that the episodes of artificial beach fill along the eastern section of Perdido Key have temporarily slowed, but not significantly decreased, the rates of erosion over time.\nThe database of historical shoreline change presented in this study also provides clear evidence that nearshore geomorphology exerts some control on shoreline behavior. At the western side of Pensacola Pass, the large ebb shoal complex appears to intensify erosion losses in the vicinity of the eastern terminus of Perdido Key by creating a local reversal in the net sediment transport from the channel westward. Along with the ebb shoal's effects, the presence of the offshore bar, B2, (Figure 2.1) in the vicinity of transects 113-123, appear to correlate with the discussed pivot between accretion and erosion.\n24\n\n\fConclusion Quantifying historical and recent trends of shoreline movement along sandy beaches is imperative in order to establish aggressive mitigation strategies, based on recent projections of global climate change. Additionally, as population density and infrastructure projects along coastal barrier islands increase, it is essential to improve methods for quantifying and predicting the complexities of shoreline change. This study revealed distinct trends of shoreline change along the sandy barrier island of Perdido Key, Florida. The shoreline change assessment included an analysis of nearly two dozen historic shoreline positions, from the early twentieth century to the present. The results demonstrate that the cause of shoreline change along Perdido Key is multifaceted and complex. Major hurricanes, and even clusters of lesser storms, dominate coastal geomorphic change along this barrier island. Four major storms during the recent decade (1995-2005), brought significant morphologic change to Perdido Key. The clustering of these major storms, coupled with less intense storms with high wave energy in 2008, 2009 and 2012, have acted to decrease the island's stability, resulting in major recession of the shoreline. Although a progressive pattern of long-term erosion was observed along the eastern section of Perdido Key, a pattern of accretion was found on the western end. A threedimensional (3-D) time series of shoreline change over both long and short time scales highlights the temporal persistence of distinct zones of erosion and accretion along Perdido Key (Figure 2.14).These trends appear to be strongly associated with the presence of geomorphic features. The persistence of the accretionary signal on the island's western end may be related to the addition of material from the nearshore bathymetric feature B1 (Figure 2.1). This study also revealed that sand availability and sediment transport associated with changes in inlet dynamics can lead to considerable shoreline movement for neighboring shorelines through shoaling and sediment bypassing events. In order to mitigate erosion, options such as mining of the large inletrelated shoals or even channel relocation may be beneficial in counteracting shoreline retreat, especially along the GINS area. Future work along Perdido Key will hopefully characterize sediment found offshore of Perdido Key to determine if the patterns of onshore shoreline retreat are fuelled by the presence of nearshore sediment sources. Near-future climate projections can be expected to have a significant impact on the morphology of barrier islands such as Perdido Key. Climate models project more intense storms and accelerated sea-level rise in the near future. Given these projections and the results of our\n25\n\n\finvestigation into the historic shoreline record, coastal managers might expect at least 1.5 m/yr of retreat along the Perdido Key shorelines.\n26\n\n\fTable 2.1.

The area immediately adjacent to the Pensacola Pass inlet on the extreme eastern end of Perdido Key is strongly accretional.\n36\n\n\fFigure 2.7.

Of significance are two shaded episodes of erosion (A and C), and a shaded episode of accretion (B). The erosional episodes (A and C), appear to be directly associated with the passage of major storms, while the timing of the accretion episode (B) appears to be the cumulative result of two major nourishment projects along eastern Perdido Key in 1985 and again in 1989-1991. The first nourishment took place in 1985, in response to the passage of Hurricane Frederic in 1979, and just prior to the passage of Hurricane Elena.\n38\n\n\fFigure 2.9. Standard deviation of shoreline change rates for each interval of time over the period 1920 to 2013. Three distinct spikes in the standard deviation correlate with the presence of nearshore bathymetry features B1, B2 and B3 seen in Figure 2.1.\n39\n\n\fFigure 2.10.

Three distinct periods of shoreline retreat at four representative transects along the eastern section of the island are highlighted. Erosional episode (A) is consistent with the passage of Hurricane Georges (1998). The area shaded (B) is representative of Hurricane Ivan's impact (2004) and the cluster of storms in 2005 \u00ad Dennis, Arlene and the distal passage of Katrina. The third erosional episode (C) is consistent with the passage of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, as well as Tropical storm Ida (2009). The unusual cluster of storms over the short-term period have significantly impacted shoreline morphology.\n42\n\n\fFigure 2.13. Rate of shoreline change between transects 234 and 240, on the easternmost portion of the island, over the period of increased storminess, 1998-2013. During this interval, the eastern portion of the shoreline eroded heavily, as shown in Fig. 2.11, while the recurved spit in the vicinity of T-234 grew into the inlet at a rate of approximately 3.5 meters/year.\n43\n\n\fFigure 2.14. Three dimensional representation of shoreline change along Perdido Key over the period 1920 \u00ad 2013. The figure was created using a time series gridded surface of the linear regression of shoreline change from 1920 \u00ad 2013. The colors represent shoreline change, in meters, relative to 1920. Positive values indicate accretion and negative values show erosion. The two peaks to the eastern terminus of Perdido Key reflect the positive contributions of the beach nourishment projects (1985 and 1989-1991) that took place in this locale. Additionally, the dredging of Pensacola Pass contributed sediment to the beach face between transects 234 to 240 which facilitated accretion in this area. The missing quadrant of data along the eastern segment of Perdido Key reflect the partial shoreline coverage obtained from T-sheets between 1920 \u00ad 1965.\n44\n\n\fCHAPTER THREE\nCOASTAL DUNE RECOVERY AND SHORELINE EVOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO STORMS ALONG EASTERN PERDIDO KEY, NW\nFLORIDA\nIntroduction Coastal dunes are best developed in areas of ample sand supply. They function principally as sand reservoirs, and are modified by both gradual and catastrophic events (Goldsmith, 1978; Woolard and Colby, 2002). Dunes form an essential part of the coastal environment, within which sediment movement is facilitated by aeolian and marine processes, as well as humaninduced activities such as the construction of coastal protection structures (Elko et al., 2002; Pye and Blott, 2008. Increases in dune elevation and sediment volume are generally aided by winddriven sediment transport from the beach, as well as, ecological factors such as vegetation cover. The presence of a dune system is imperative in order to delay coastal retreat and shield low-lying backshore areas in the event of extreme storm conditions (high winds, storm surge) (Woodroffe, 2002; Ruz, Anthon, and Faucon, 2005). According to Carter (1988), the larger the sediment reservoir in coastal dunes, the more effective are these landforms as a buffer to high-energy processes. In many cases, dependent on the wind and wave regime, accumulated dune sediment may be transported and used to resupply the subaerial beach and backshore areas (Pye, 1991; Sherman and Bauer, 1993). The United States coastline is home to approximately thirty percent of the world's barrier islands (Glaeser, 1978; Stutz, Pilkey and Trembanis, 1999; Stutz and Pilkey, 2002). Along the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida, these shore-parallel features dominate the coastal landscape (Stapor, Matthews and Lindfors-Kearns, 1991). The presence of coastal dunes along these islands extending landward from the shoreline to the vicinity of the backshore, complement the overall morphology of barriers in this area. Dune elevations along the barrier islands of the northwestern Florida coast are typically low, averaging less than 4 m (Claudino-Sales, Wang and Horwitz, 2008). In some areas along this region however, favorable conditions, such as well sorted medium to fine grained sand, persistent onshore winds, and the presence of vegetation aid in the accumulation of sand leading to dune heights in excess of 10 m (Kurz, 1942). The overall low elevations and general discontinuity of the dunefields along the northwestern coast of\n45\n\n\fFlorida suggest a high level of susceptibility to large-scale coastal modification (overwash and inundation) associated with the passage of extreme weather events (Ritchie and Penland, 1990; Elko et al. 2002; Claudino-Sales et al., 2008; Houser and Hamilton, 2009; Mousavi et al., 2011). Storms act as a catalyst to elevated water levels, strong winds and high amplitude waves that result in large-scale beach and dune elevation/volumetric changes (Houser, Hapke and Hamilton, 2008). In general, if foredune height is exceeded due to high water levels associated with stormsurge and wave run-up, overwash occurs (Sallenger, 2000). Foredune breaching increases the risk of catastrophic damage to inland habitats and infrastructure due to scouring and flooding (Stone et al., 2005).\nThe moderately warm waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico promote hurricane activity (Mousavi et al., 2011). The passage of extremely energetic storms in this region have resulted in significant morphological change along the barrier island coasts of Perdido Key and neighboring Santa Rosa Island (Houser et al., 2008; Bambach, 2013; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). Several authors have examined the impact of multiple hurricane events on varying sections of the dune complex along Santa Rosa Island. Houser et al., (2008), investigated the relationship between foredune height and the extent of storm surge that occurred with Hurricane Ivan's passage in 2004. They concluded that overwash penetration correlated with low foredune elevation, especially along narrow sections of Santa Rosa Island. Pries, Miller and Branch (2008), conducted a quantitative comparison of dune volume, based on dune height and width on a small segment of Santa Rosa Island, prior to and following the occurrence of Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005). They found that wider dunes experienced less erosion following hurricane passage. Further, Pries et al., (2008), suggested that the distance between the foredune complex and the shoreline was an important indicator of the likelihood of severe erosion. In another study performed by Claudino-Sales et al., (2008), a 70 percent foredune loss along the entire length of Santa Rosa Island was noted following Ivan's passage. Additionally, a decrease in elevation of the foredune complex along with significant sediment redistribution onto offshore bars as well as into the back-barrier bay of the island was observed (Claudino-Sales et al., 2008). The aforementioned studies have collectively documented the importance of key variables such as barrier island width, dune height, wave amplitude, wave period, wind activity and the presence of vegetation in assessing dune vulnerability to storms, and post-hurricane dune recovery along several segments of SRI (Houser et al., 2008; Claudino-Sales et al., 2008; Pries et al., 2008;\n46\n\n\fBambach, 2013). However, no such analysis of the impact of storm passage on the dune complex has been conducted along the barrier island adjacent to the west of Santa Rosa Island, Perdido Key. Perdido Key presents a unique opportunity to systematically investigate and quantify the regional-scale destruction, survival and post-storm recovery of dunes due to the passage of multiple storms along a narrow barrier island of low elevation.\nFor this study, beach-dune elevation profile data obtained from ground surveys carried out by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), as well as Lidar-derived elevation data were examined in order to quantitatively analyze dune aggradation (during periods of storm quiescence) and erosion resulting from storm impact. The emphasis of the study was landward of the surf zone, where large volumes of sediment are moved by the incessant forces of winds, waves and tides (Figure 3.1). The environments to be principally assessed in this study are the backshore and the foredune complex. The foredune complex is characterized by the presence of incipient dunes, foredunes and the foredune ridge (Woodroffe, 2002; Masselink and Hughes, 2003). The main goal of this study was to develop a better understanding of the beach and dune dynamics along Perdido Key, by analyzing foredune and shoreline change along developed, undeveloped, nourished and unnourished coastal segments. Additional objectives of this work were to: 1) quantitatively analyze and describe the pre- and post-storm morphological changes on dune fields along a section of the low-profile barrier of Perdido Key following hurricanes over the period 1974 \u00ad 2010; 2) test the hypothesis that, in locations where the island is wide and the pre-storm dune is relatively high (3 m or higher), post-storm erosion is minimized and complete removal of the dune system due to storm surge is unlikely; 3) test the premise that storms accelerate dune volume loss over the short-term; 4) evaluate the response of dunes along undeveloped areas to beach nourishment, and contrast with the response of dunes along developed, un-nourished portions of Perdido Key; and 5) determine how long it takes for a beach-dune system to equilibrate after episodes of storm passage and beach nourishment.\nStudy Area As the westernmost barrier island along the NW Florida Gulf of Mexico coast, Perdido Key extends approximately 24 km from Pensacola Pass at its eastern end to Perdido Pass on the western terminus (Figure 3.2). Trending parallel to the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, this narrow, sandy barrier island of low topographic relief has a maximum width of 1.85 km, a\n47\n\n\fminimum width of approximately 0.1 km, and an average width of about 0.35 km. Perdido Key's formation, along with other barrier islands along the NW region of Florida, is thought to have resulted from sediment supplied by the erosion of a Pleistocene scarp that forms the mainland shore in this area (Otvos, 1982; Stone and Stapor, 1996; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). According to Stone and Stapor, (1996), the Pleistocene core was likely submerged during the marine transgression approximately 12000 years ago. As a result, shoreface beach and dune deposits along Perdido Key are of Holocene age. The surficial sediment along the beach system is composed predominantly of quartz sand, with grain sizes ranging between 0.2 to 0.4 mm (Stapor, 1973; Florida Geological Survey, 1993; Rakocinski et al., 1996). A small percentage of the sediment (~ 1%) consists of the heavy minerals ilmenite and rutile (Stone and Stapor, 1996). Net sediment drift along the island is westerly from the vicinity of Pensacola Pass and is estimated to be between 30,000 and 55,000 m3/yr (Browder and Dean, 1999b). Wave direction incident to the shoreline is largely from the southeast. The average annual wave height is approximately 0.6 m, while the mean wave period is approximately 6.0 seconds (Morang, 1992; Browder and Dean, 1999a). Tides in the area are diurnal and microtidal, with a mean tidal range of 0.38 m (Foster, Spurgeon and Cheng, 1999; Browder and Dean, 2000). Table 3.1 provides a brief summary of the physical characteristics of Perdido Key.\nThe study area for this investigation comprises the entire length of the PK unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore (GINS), found along the eastern portion of the barrier, along with an adjacent developed segment of the island (Figure 3.2). The GINS segment of the study site was specifically chosen because it represents a relatively untouched section of coastline with minimal anthropogenic modifications and an absence of large infrastructure such as condominiums and modified beach front property. The GINS extends approximately 11 km from its western extent near FDEP survey monument R-31 (Figure 3.2), eastward to Pensacola Pass at R-65, and remains largely undeveloped with one major recreational facility (beach access area) located westward of R-36. In order to do a comparative analysis between the responses of a nourished and unnourished, undeveloped dunefield (R-36 to R-65), with that of a developed, unnourished setting, the research area was extended to include range monument 31, approximately 5000 ft (1.5 km) to the west of R-36 (Figure 3.2).\nPerdido Key's beach-dune habitat is made up of numerous rows of discontinuous sand dunes located approximately 30 to 40 m adjacent to the surf zone (Rakocinski et al., 1996). Foredunes\n48\n\n\falong the island are basically ephemeral features that range in morphology from small coppice mounds to semi-continuous ridges (Looney et al., 1993; Rakocinski et al., 1996). According to Browder and Dean (2000), crests of some landward dune ridges along the shoreline have an average elevation of 5 m in some areas. The primary vegetation of the frontal and secondary dunes of the study area consists of sea-oats (Looney et al., 1993). According to Woodhouse et al., (1968), sea-oat covered dunes are perfectly suited for coastal environments, as they are capable of withstanding the stressors associated with storm passage. Among other thriving plant species in the frontal dunes along Perdido Key are Florida rosemary, beach morning glory and railroad vine. Further inland, the secondary dunes support a range of plant species, including, but not limited to, cordgrass, salt grass, saw palmetto, slash and sand pines, as well as scrubby shrubs (Looney et al., 1993).\nThree artificial beach nourishment projects have been carried out along the study area, in 1985, 1989-1991, and more recently, late 2011 into early 2012 (Foster et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2013). For this investigation, the first two replenishment projects formed part of the analysis. The 1985 nourishment project emplaced roughly 1.9 million cubic meters (m3) of sediment along an approximately 1200 m stretch of coastline between R-60 to R-64, adjacent to the eastern terminus of the island (Figure 3.2). A more extensive beach fill followed over a two-year period, 1989 \u00ad 1991, and involved 4.2 million m3 of dredged material from the entrance channel at Pensacola Pass being placed onshore from R-40 to R-64 (Browder and Dean, 1999a). The 1985 beach nourishment was constructed to a berm height of +3.1 m relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum, whereas the 1989 nourishment created a berm height of +1.3 m NAVD88 (Browder and Dean 2000).\nMethods Ground Surveying and Airborne LIDAR Surveying\nIn order to evaluate the extent of coastal dune change over the 1974-2010 period, groundbased elevation profile data were acquired from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems (FDEP-BBCS) database. To supplement the ground-based data, airborne Lidar elevation data was obtained and analyzed with the aim of modeling the response of the dune system to the high energy physical processes associated with storms.\n49\n\n\fThe FDEP-BBCS maintains a series of survey monuments located at 1000-foot (305 m) intervals along the coast of Florida. These range monuments are used as reference points for the collection of beach and dune profile survey data. The survey monuments are sequentially numbered, beginning with the first monument (R-1), at the western limit of the Florida portion of Perdido Key, followed by subsequent locations in ascending order from west to east (Leadon, 1999). For this study, ground-based surveying data were obtained using both the transit technique as well as the more recent method of differential global positioning system (dGPS) surveying. The transit technique uses a benchmark of known position and elevation as its reference point. From that starting position, a series of elevations are then quantified along a transect line cast perpendicular to the shoreline, using a stadia rod placed at a predefined horizontal spacing (Leadon, 1999). Elevations are measured to a precision of 0.01 feet and the result is an accurate cross-sectional profile of the backshore and much of the foreshore. Since the year 2000, differential GPS has been adopted as the most common ground-based surveying method in geomorphological studies, especially those that include analysis of topographic modification (Young, 2012). Other than its advantages in terms of accuracy, speed and density of elevation data, differential GPS allows a single operator to efficiently accomplish data collection without the need for an established starting point (Mitasova et al., 2005). Using ground based differential GPS, elevation and distance measurements can also be obtained within \u00b1 0.01ft (Harley et al., 2011). In some cases however, vertical elevations measured by differential GPS may have less precision (\u00b1 0.03 ft) relative to conventional ground control surveying (Young, 2012).\nWhile ground surveys provide critical information about the changes pertaining to beach and dune field topography, the introduction of airborne Lidar has facilitated the rapid collection of highly accurate and densely sampled coastal elevation and positional data (Woolard and Colby, 2002). Acquiring Lidar data involves the use of laser scanners mounted to an aircraft, along with a kinematic differential GPS and an aircraft inertial navigation platform that measures the twoway travel time between the aircraft and an object (Brock et al., 2006). According to Brown (1993), the accuracy and precision of Lidar data is enhanced when the aircraft flies at low altitudes. The horizontal resolution of Lidar data is approximately 1 m, while the vertical accuracy of the data ranges from 0.02 to 0.1 m (Young, 2012). An inherent advantage of using Lidar data is that it covers the entire width of the barrier island. This significantly enhanced the\n50\n\n\fpossibility of analyzing the entire subaerial mass balance of the island, allowing for a more extensive study of the morphologic changes in dune volume and sand movement along each range monument prior to, and after storm occurrence. The presence of vegetation can result in inaccuracies in the data obtained from Lidar. However, contemporary Lidar data acquisition can render a \"bare ground\" topographic data set, improving on the precision and processing capabilities of the measurements obtained (Brown, 1993; Young 2012).\nTable 3.2 lists the collection date and source of each data set used to construct the beach profiles along the study area. The raw version of the elevation data (ground survey and Lidar) was obtained in ASCII format. An indexed database was then created by assigning a numeric value to each space-delimited row of x, y and z points. Once indexed, the data were exported for processing into a GIS. From each data set, sand volume along each transect (described below), dune elevation and the distance from the benchmark to the shoreline was determined. For this study, the shoreline position was defined as the line of Mean High Water (MHW) relative to the location of the Pensacola tide gauge (Figure 3.2). At this tide station, the MHWL has an elevation of 0.91 ft above Mean sea Level.\nThis manuscript reports values of elevation, distance, and volume in both imperial and metric units to ensure consistency with data reported by state (FDEP-BBCS) and federal agencies (USGS). Beach profile data obtained by both the BBCS and the USGS were in imperial units (feet).\nVolumetric Change: Trapezoidal Integration In order to quantify the volumetric variation of coastal dunes prior to and after storm\npassage, the numerical method of trapezoidal integration (TI) was used. This method employs a graphical representation of a dune profile, based on a plot of profile length (x-axis) versus dune elevation (y-axis), to approximate the area under the curve (dune profile), by dividing the dune into trapezoidal segments. The area of each trapezoidal segment is then determined by adding the vertical sides of a given section (y0 + y1), dividing that value by two, and multiplying the result by the width of the given trapezoid:\nArea =  (average height between two adjacent points within profile) \u00d7 width\n51\n\n\fTo calculate volume per meter of shoreline length as opposed to cross-sectional area, a value of 1 m (~ 3.3 ft) was set to account for the alongshore width. Upon obtaining the area of each trapezoid, the dune volume per alongshore meter for the particular transect profile was found by adding the areas of all the trapezoids under the curve, and multiplying by 1 to account for the 1-meter width of the profile (Richardson, 2013). Figure 3.3 illustrates the trapezoidal integration method and identifies the area under the curve calculated to obtain dune volume. For both the ground-based profile elevation data as well as the Lidar data, the TI method was employed to calculate the total volume per linear meter of shoreline for each respective range monument profile.\nArc-Map Analysis ArcMap GIS software (version 10.2), developed by the Environmental Systems Research\nInstitute (ESRI) was used to identify dune elevation and accurately plot the locations of the eight range monument profiles. The 3D Analyst extension within ArcMap was employed to assist with calculating the total volume across the length of each profile line, based on recent Lidar elevation data. In order to carry out a comparative visual analysis of the shoreline position prior to 1974 and in some cases following the 2004-2005 hurricane seasons, aerial photos were geo-referenced and rectified using the ArcGIS platform.\nRecent Storm History of Perdido Key (1974 \u00ad 2010) Along the barrier islands of the northwestern Florida coast, significant changes to island morphology have been accelerated by the impacts of 5 major hurricanes (category 3 to 5 based on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength), and the nearby passage of 6 less intense storm systems (tropical storm to category 2 hurricane strength) between 1974 to 2010 (Table 3.3). These 11 storm systems passed within a 140 km radius of the study area and differed in storm track, intensity and landfall location (Figure 3.4). Hurricanes Frederic (1979), Erin and Opal (1995), Georges (1998), and the closely-spaced Ivan (2004), Arlene, Dennis and Katrina (2005) resulted in significant landward shoreline retreat and beach profile adjustment, along the shoreline of Perdido Key (FDEP, 2007; Douglas and Browder, 2005). Hurricane Frederic's landfall as a category 3 hurricane approximately 70 km west of the Florida/Alabama state line resulted in catastrophic damage to the previously well-established dune system along the regional coastline (Balsille and Clark, 1979). At the Pensacola tide gauge, located approximately 25 km northeast from the center of Perdido Key (Figure 3.2), a storm\n52\n\n\fsurge of 11 ft (~ 3.5 m) was recorded following Frederic's impact. The successive passages of Hurricanes Erin and Opal in 1995 substantially damaged, and in many cases destroyed coastal infrastructure, including roads and utilities (Leadon, 1996; Stone et al., 2004). Hurricane Opal's effects were particularly severe near Fort Walton Beach (~ 70 km to the east of Perdido Key), where a 12 to 14 ft (3.6 to 4.2 m) storm surge inflicted offshore transport and landward overwash of beach material (Leadon, 1996; Claudino-Sales et al., 2008). Leadon, Nguyen and Clark (1998), found that the devastating effects of Opal (severe erosion, storm surge flooding) resulted in major dune destruction along the northwest coast of Florida, with residential structures as far as 1400 ft inland being damaged.\nNine years after Hurricane Opal's passage, the impact of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 imposed extreme wind, wave and storm surge conditions along the northwestern Florida coast (Stone et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005; Houser et al., 2008; Claudino-Sales et al., 2008). Ivan made landfall as a strong category 3 storm, approximately 27 km west of Perdido Key, and translated huge quantities of sediment to the back-barrier along segments of Santa Rosa Island in the form of washover fans (Wang et al., 2005). According to Claudino-Sales et al., (2008), sustained hurricane force winds of around 130 mph were recorded, with the maximum wind velocities occurring over the Perdido Key Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore (Figure 3.2). Based on wave buoy data obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), an open-water storm surge in excess of 49 ft (15 m) was measured as Ivan approached the mainland. At the Pensacola tide gauge, the storm-surge accompanying Ivan's landfall was recorded at 6.5 ft (2 m) above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW), exceeding the standard tidal range by a factor of 4 (Wang et al., 2005). According to the FDEP (2007), the erosion caused by Hurricane Ivan along the regional coast of NW Florida was significantly more severe than that caused by Opal.\nThe unusually active hurricane season of 2005 was associated with additional beach and barrier erosion along the northwest Florida coast (Clark and LaGrone, 2006). Less than a year after Ivan's passage, tropical storm Arlene (June 10, 2005) made a direct hit on the western portion of Perdido Key, inflicting additional damage on the already vulnerable beach and dune system. Exactly one month after Arlene's landfall, Hurricane Dennis (category 3 at landfall) struck Santa Rosa Island with sustained wind speeds in excess of 115 to 120 mph. According to Clark and LaGrone, (2006), the majority of the coastal areas throughout northwest Florida sustained substantial beach and dune erosion due to the storm. Hurricane Dennis' storm surge at\n53\n\n\fPerdido Key (approximately 60 miles west of the eyewall) was estimated to be 5 ft (1.5 m) above MLLW (Claudino-Sales et al., 2008).\nThe impact of Hurricane Ivan, followed in quick succession by the subsequent effects of Arlene and Dennis, resulted in several sections of Perdido Key's shoreline being designated as critically eroded (FDEP, 2008). In the ensuing years, although no direct landfalls have occurred in close proximity to Perdido Key, the distal passage of weaker storm systems (Hurricane Gustav, Tropical Storm Ike, Tropical Storm Ida) have also contributed to altering the beach, dune and back-barrier morphology by interrupting any natural beach recovery that may occur.\nResults Analysis of the aerial imagery, ground-survey profile data, and pre- and post- storm Lidar data reveal that, along eastern Perdido Key, the dunes and shoreline underwent significant morphological change during the period 1974 \u00ad 2010. Sediment volume change for each monument location over the 36-year period is visually presented in Figure 3.5 and reported numerically in Table 3.3. Figure 3.5 further details the timeline of storm passage along the survey monuments, and also depicts the chronology of beach nourishment projects, which have been undertaken along the eastern portion of the island. Shoreline change data for each monument is displayed in Figure 3.6 and values are listed in Table 3.4. Topographic dune and sediment volume change as well as shoreline position fluctuations for each monument location studied are detailed below.\nTopographic, Sediment Volume and Shoreline Changes Range Monument R-31\nThe eastern segments of the study area have been modified by post-storm nourishment projects at various times. In order to analyze coastal segments that were not influenced by beach nourishment, two un-modified locations (R-31 and R-36), were included in the study. Monument R-31 represents a developed segment which has not undergone nourishment. Further, a number of hotels dominate the coastal landscape near the shoreline in this area. Monument R-36 represents an undeveloped segment that has also not been nourished. A distance of 1.6 km (~5,000 ft) separates R-31 and R-36.\nThe profile at R-31 (Figure 3.7) is located along the widest portion of the island (~ 1.64 km from shoreline to back barrier), and exhibited a relatively stable beach and foredune\n54\n\n\fcondition over the study period. A noticeable foredune complex approximately 16 ft high, was translated landward between 1974 and 1983, possibly as a direct result of the impact of Hurricane Frederic. Frederic's impact along R-31 resulted in approximately 60 ft of shoreline erosion (Figure 3.6). The effects of the 1995 storm season, with Hurricanes Erin and Opal's passages, on the dune complex along R-31 are noticeable in Figure 3.7. The post-Erin and Opal profile data collected in 1996, reveal a substantial upward and landward translation of the dune profile with a foredune elevation of approximately 15 ft. Along with dune erosion, the collective impacts of Erin and Opal resulted in approximately 60 ft of shoreline retreat from the 1994 shoreline position. The impact of Hurricane Georges in 1998 resulted in minor sediment aggradation to the foredune. Both the post-Opal and post-Georges profiles reveal steep shorefacing scarps (Figure 3.7) reflective of the elevated surge heights and short wave periods associated with the collective impacts of Erin, Opal and Georges.\nThe relatively inactive storm period following the passage of Georges in 1998 prior to Ivan in 2004, resulted in a gulfward translation of the berm and dune profile. Over the six-year period of storm dormancy (1998 to 2004), the total volume of sand gained along the profile was 94 ft3 per lateral meter or 15.5ft3/yr per lateral meter of shoreline (Figure 3.5). Prior to Ivan's landfall, foredune elevation along R-31 was approximately +15 feet. Ivan produced a storm surge exceeding 14 ft above mean sea level (MSL) along with persistent winds of 120 mph (Wang et al., 2005). As a result, extensive overwash and inland flooding occurred along R-31 as storm damage from the hurricane resulted in significant loss of the frontal dune system and destruction of numerous upland infrastructure in and around this location. Comparison of preand post- Ivan Lidar data (Figure 3.8) coupled with aerial photography (Figure 3.9) reveal the lowering of the frontal dune system along R-31, along with expansive storm-induced overwash deposits extending over 450 ft inland from the shoreline. Interestingly, Ivan's impact along R-31 led to approximately 10 ft of seaward shoreline advance.\nHurricane Dennis (2005), made landfall approximately 40 km west of R-31 and resulted in around 20 ft of additional shoreline retreat from the post-Ivan position (Figure 3.6). The dunes that survived Ivan experienced further erosion and decrease in sediment volume following Dennis. The foredune elevation decreased from 11 ft following Ivan to around 4 ft after Dennis, resulting in a flat washover platform. The total estimated subaerial volume of sediment removed along the profile following Dennis was 33 ft3 per linear meter of shoreline. Following Dennis, a\n55\n\n\fnet accumulation of sediment occurred between 2005 and 2006. The increase in sediment volume change over this period was approximately 100 ft3/yr per linear meter of shoreline. Concurrent with the gain in sediment volume following the 2005 storm season, Figure 3.6 demonstrates a minor shoreline progradation along R-31 up to the year 2008. The cumulative effects of Gustav, Ike and Ida appear to have led to a further decrease in sediment volume along R-31. The most recent foredune profile acquired in 2010 reveals an elevation of approximately 14.5 ft, the same elevation prior to Ivan.\nRange Monument R-36 The profile at R-36 is located along a very narrow portion of the island (< 0.19 km) and\ndisplays an easily identifiable foredune complex approximately 100 ft from the benchmark starting position. R-36 is the only portion of the island that is both undeveloped and unnourished. As a result, R-36 is the best representation of the beach in its natural state. The influence of storm passage on dune morphology along this profile is clearly evident. The maximum dune height of approximately 12.5 ft (~ 4 m) was observed prior to Hurricane Ivan. By 2010 however, the foredune eroded to an elevation of 10.2 ft, a decrease of roughly 3 feet (Figure 3.10). This decrease in dune height can be attributed to the recent effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike (2008), as well as the passage of Tropical Storm Ida in 2009. The cumulative impacts of Hurricanes Erin and Opal in 1995 resulted in the almost complete removal of foredunes along R-36. According to Stone et al., (1996), wave buoy data indicated an open water wave amplitude of 8 m coupled with a 13 second wave period as Opal approached land. Opal significantly lowered the foredune complex along R-36, and was a major overtopping event. A significant quantity of sand was transferred landwards from the active beach during Opal's passage. Additionally, substantial volumes of sand were deposited into deep nearshore waters (out to -15 ft NGVD) (Figure 3.11). Following the effects of Opal, the shoreline along the vicinity of R-36 eroded approximately 50 ft from the 1994 position. The period between Hurricane George's passage (1998), and prior to Hurricane Ivan's landfall (2004) resulted in foredune sediment aggradation of approximately 3 ft. This period of quiescence allowed for the beach and dune systems to approach a relatively stable state. Over this six-year period, the rate of dune sediment volume gain along R-36 was 1.6 ft3/yr per lateral meter (Figure 3.5).\n56\n\n\fThe dune system at R-36 displayed a drastic change following the collective effects of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. Hurricane Ivan's passage in 2004 resulted in destruction of the berm and frontal dune along with substantial portions of secondary dunes along R-36. The foredune elevation decreased from approximately 12.5 ft prior to the storm to 5 ft after the storm. According to a study conducted by Clark and LaGrone (2006), the open-coast storm surge during Ivan was estimated to have been in excess of +14 ft NAVD88. This surge and accompanying storm wave run-up facilitated dune erosion across the profile and the upper beach. Along with the foredune loss, the effects of Hurricane Ivan produced a landward retreat of the shoreline on the order of approximately 15 ft (Figure 3.6) from the pre-Ivan shoreline position. Figure 3.12 depicts pre Ivan / post Dennis georectified aerial images along R-36. A significant change was evident following Hurricane Ivan, with the berm, backbeach and dune elevation all lowered as sand was transported landward into overwash deposits. With the passage of Dennis in 2005, the foredune complex along R-36 was almost totally eroded, leaving an almost horizontal washover platform in its place. Further, Dennis' impact resulted in approximately 40 ft of landward shoreline movement. The Lidar images in Figure 3.13 mirror the changes observed in the georectified aerials in Figure 3.12, and detail the loss of frontal dune elevation coupled with the accumulation of sediment in the backshore, behind the monument starting location. Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis' cumulative impacts resulted in an average rate of sediment volume loss along R-36 over the two year period following Ivan of 37.5 ft3/yr per lateral meter of shoreline.\nRange Monument R-40 No inland infrastructure exists behind range monuments 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65. As\nsuch, these monuments lie within the confines of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Nine years of dune elevation data were acquired along R-40 between 1974 and 2010. This profile was nourished once during the 1989 \u00ad 1991 beach fill project. R-40 displays a foredune complex approximately 150 to 250 ft from the monument starting position. The maximum elevation of the foredune along this profile was 14.5 ft, observed in 2010. Similar foredune elevations of 13.5 ft and 13.4 ft respectively are noted in the pre-Ivan (2004), and 2006 profiles. Figure 3.14 shows that the effects of Opal, Georges and Ivan resulted in foredune erosion coupled with a landward translation of the berm and dune profiles. Following Opal, the foredune height displayed an elevation of approximately 10 ft. The impact of Hurricane Georges resulted in a seaward shift of\n57\n\n\fthe dune profile with a foredune elevation of around 1 ft greater than the post-Opal foredune height. Hurricane Ivan facilitated a landward retreat of the beach and dune profile and resulted in a steep shore-facing scarp with a maximum foredune elevation of 11.5 ft. Notably, although the effects of Opal, Georges and Ivan resulted in cycles of landward and gulfward movement of the incipient and established foredunes, the post-storm morphological signature of the fordune complex along R-40 appeared to stabilize at an elevation around 11.5 ft. Hurricane Dennis (2005) however, resulted in substantial dune face and beach erosion, lowering the elevation of the foredune to approximately 4 ft.\nThe analysis of volume change along R-40 demonstrated that the majority of the sediment volume change occurred during the period 1998 to 2004, following the impact of Hurricane Georges and prior to Ivan (Figure 3.5). The measured average rate of volume gain over the six-year period of storm dormancy was about 5 ft3/yr per lateral meter of shoreline. Following Ivan's impact however, approximately 100 ft3 of sediment per lateral meter was lost along R-40. The cumulative impacts of Ivan and the active storm season of 2005 resulted in significant sediment volume loss along R-40. However, a noticeable accumulation of sediment was observed during the period 2006 to 2008. The average sediment accumulation rate for R-40 over this time was approximately 50.6 ft3/yr per lateral meter of shoreline.\nResults of shoreline change along the coastal segment of R-40 reveal the impact of storms on shoreline movement. Shoreline erosion was observed with the influence of Frederic, Opal, Ivan and Dennis. The most significant landward retreat took place with the passages of Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis (Figure 3.6). Following Ivan, the shoreline retreated about 20 ft. Dennis resulted in additional shoreline erosion, displacing the land-water boundary a further 50 ft inland from the post-Ivan position. After 2005 however, the shoreline steadily prograded seaward by approximately 75 ft to its 2008 position. The storm seasons of 2008 and 2009 resulted in further shoreline erosion along R-40, highlighting the dynamic nature of the shoreline along this undeveloped, nourished segment.\nRange Monument R-45 Analysis of the data from 1974 to 2010 indicate that the morphologic behavior of the\ndunes along R-45 has constantly changed. R-45 is located along one of the narrowest portions of the island, measuring approximately 0.2 km from shoreline to backbarrier. In 1974, the location\n58\n\n\fof the foredune was approximately 150 ft from the benchmark (Figure 3.15). Following the passage of Hurricance Frederic (1979), the 1983 profile revealed a significant lowering of the dune crest by approximately 2 ft from the 1974 position. Although the 1983 profile shows dune erosion, a net accumulation of sediment can be observed, as the dune profile extended further seaward. The profile line acquired in 1996 following Hurricane Opal revealed landward berm movement along with severe dune deflation. An incipient foredune, approximately 4 ft in elevation can be observed approximately 340 ft from the monument location, while the established foredune is visible at a height of 7 ft, 25 ft from the benchmark. The effect of Hurricane Georges in 1998 was similar to that of Opal, but the dune profile displayed a more erratic morphology. While the foredune increased to a post-storm elevation of 9.5 ft, the 1998 profile exhibited significant scarp development along the Gulf-side dune face. The period of storm inactivity between 1998 and 2004 prior to Hurricane Ivan, acted as a catalyst to dune stability. The pre-Ivan foredune height along R-40 measured approximately 11.5 ft. Ivan's impact along R-45 led to substantial beach and dune erosion. Figure 3.16 reveals the location of the profile line at R-45, taken on a washover fan that was devoid of vegetation and rendered featureless following Ivan's passage. Further, the shoreline at this location accreted approximately 45 ft following Ivan's impact resulting in an increase in island width along this location. The highest elevation of the dune field following Ivan was 6.5 ft, a decrease of 5 ft from the pre-Ivan foredune elevation. Dennis's (2005) impact on the dune system was even more catastrophic. Figure 3.15 highlights a flattened dune complex extending almost 700 ft from the monument starting location. Additionally, the post-Ivan seaward shoreline advance was reversed with Dennis's impact as the shoreline eroded significantly (approximately 100 ft). In 2007, the foredune accreted to an elevation of 8.5 ft and a well-established subaerial beach and dune morphology began to emerge as the shoreline began to accrete seaward. However, the collective impacts of Gustav, Ike and Ida led to further lowering of the foredune to an elevation of 6 ft in 2010.\nR-45 was the beneficiary of sediment from the 1989/1991-beach nourishment. The analysis of sediment volume change highlighted the gain in sediment resulting from nourishment along R-45 (Figure 3.5). In the period subsequent to the 1989-1991 nourishment and prior to Opal, the average sediment accumulation along R-45 was 17.4 ft3 / yr per lateral meter of shoreline. During the period of storm lag (1998 to 2004 Pre-Ivan), R-45 experienced a net gain\n59\n\n\fof sediment in the range of 57 ft3 per lateral meter (9.5 ft3 / yr per lateral meter). With the impact of Ivan and Dennis however, the total estimated subaerial volume of sediment removed along this profile was approximately 215 ft3 per lateral meter of shoreline. The storm seasons of 2008 and 2009 also resulted in a loss of 84 ft3 per lateral meter of shoreline.\nRange Monument R-50 Along with range monuments R-40 and R-45, R-50 has been nourished once during the\n1989-1991 beach replenishment project. The profile at R-50 displays a foredune complex in the region of 180 to 250 ft from the monument, with a maximum elevation of approximately 13 ft. The maximum height of the established foredune occurred in 2004 prior to Hurricane Ivan. Hurricane Frederic (1979) resulted in erosion of the foredune complex, decreasing the elevation from approximately 11 ft prior to Frederic, to 9 ft after its landfall (Figure 3.17). The storm seasons of 1995 and 2008 also resulted in significant morphological change along R-50. Analysis of the profile following the 1995 storm season revealed a landward translation of the dune and berm profile with signs of scarping along the Gulfward dune face. While a net gain of sediment volume was noticed following the passage of Opal in 1995 (Figure 3.5), approximately 30 ft of shoreline erosion from the 1994 shoreline position was observed (Figure 3.6). The 1998 post-Georges profile along R-50 is analogous to the 1996 (post-Opal) overall elevation profile morphology, revealing the location of incipient dunes and an established secondary dune system along the backshore. Additionally, Georges' impact in 1998 resulted in almost 20 ft of shoreline erosion along R-50. The six-year storm lag between 1998 and 2004 resulted in an overall gain of 24.7 ft3 per lateral meter (4.1 ft3/yr per lateral meter) of subaerial sediment volume along the profile line. Ivan's impact on the shoreline resulted in a minor landward retreat of approximately 15 ft, as well as a volume loss of 156 ft3 per lateral meter, from the pre-Ivan sediment volume. Ivan's impact also led to erosion of the dune profile and a resulting foredune decrease of approximately 4.5 ft from the pre-Ivan elevation. Along the profile, overwash resulted in the destruction of the majority of incipient dunes. Dennis' (2005) passage diminished the foredune elevation by a further 6 ft, and resulted in the creation of a flat, extensive washover platform devoid of vegetation. Dennis caused an additional 60 ft of shoreline erosion from the post-Ivan position. Following Dennis' effects, a net sediment accumulation of close to 100 ft3 per lateral meter occurred over a three year period (2006-2008). The absence of storms over this period\n60\n\n\ffacilitated an advance of the shoreline. As with the other range monument profiles, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as well as tropical storm Ida resulted in erosion of the shoreline and a net loss of sediment. The sediment volume change over the years 2008 to 2010 was about 80 ft3 per lateral meter with an average rate of 26 ft3/year. By 2010, the elevation of the foredune along R-50 was 6 ft, with the profile displaying characteristics of a steep seaward-facing scarp.\nRange Monument R-55 Ten profiles were acquired along R-55 between 1974 and 2010 (Figure 3.18). This area is\none of the wider portions of the island, approximately 0.33 km from shoreline to backbarrier. R50 received sand from the 1989/1991 beach nourishment project and, based on the net westerly regional sediment transport, this section of the island may have also been the recipient of additional sediment from the earlier nourishment in 1985. The 1974 profile at R-55 displays a foredune complex approximately 11 ft high extending around 150 ft from the range monument starting position. Between 1974 and 1985, the foredune retreated landward by ~ 150 ft along with a concurrent net loss of sediment volume (Figure 3.5). The post-storm profiles taken after Hurricanes Opal (1995) and Georges (1998) revealed a gulfward advance of both dune profiles. Foredune elevations after those storms returned relatively high values of ~ 11ft for both the 1996 and 1998 profiles. Further, a net loss of sediment volume on the order of approximately 90 ft3/ year per lateral meter, with an average rate of 15 ft3/yr per lateral meter was observed along R-55 between the six year period after Georges' passage and prior to Ivan's impact. Ivan and Dennis' cumulative impact resulted in around 80 ft of cumulative shoreline retreat and was accompanied by dune volume loss and elevation decrease. The foredune elevation decreased from approximately 11.5 ft prior to Ivan to approximately 6.5 ft after Ivan. Dennis led to severe erosion along this profile by a further 4 ft from the post-Ivan foredune height. In the three year period following Dennis, no major storms occurred, allowing for an increase in subaerial sediment volume along R-50. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike (2008), despite their distal passage, resulted in shoreline retreat and foredune elevation loss along R-50.\nRange Monument R-60 The profile at R-60 is located adjacent to the inlet at Pensacola Pass and extends ~ 240\nkm from shoreline to the bayside beach. This location is the only site within the study area that\n61\n\n\fwas nourished twice. Figure 3.19 reveals a morphological signature along this profile that differs from the other segments of the island that have been nourished. The pre-Frederic profile (1974) displayed a foredune elevation over 14 ft, extending approximately 700 ft from the monument. Frederic's passage resulted in significant deflation of the foredune complex by ~ 9 ft and landward migration of the berm coupled with severe shoreline retreat. After the first artificial beach fill in 1985, the profile acquired that same year along R-60 revealed a constructed dune height in excess of 9 ft. The findings of the current study detailing morphologic change along R60 in 1985 are consistent with those of Browder and Dean (2000) which showed that the 1985 beach nourishment was constructed to a berm height of + 9 ft (+3.1 m) relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum. A significant net increase in sediment volume was also observed along the profile following the first nourishment project in 1985 (Figure 3.5). Approximately two years after the second replenishment project took place over the period 1989-1991, a sudden decrease in sediment volume, coupled with an abrupt shoreline retreat occurred along R-60 (Figure 3.6). It appears that this decrease is due to the refractive effect of the ebb shoal complex which coincides with the location of R-60 (Figure 3.2). The presence of the ebb shoal complex located between R-59 and R-61 may have facilitated a reversal in the direction of net littoral sediment transport. Generally, areas of sediment transport divergence are highly erosional as sand is moved in both directions (Browder and Dean, 2000; Rosati, 2005; Olsen Associates, 2006).\nThe general trend of the R-60 profile displayed a noticeable increase in sediment volume leading to a well-defined foredune complex prior to Hurricane Georges' passage in 1998. Over the six year period following Georges' landfall and prior to Ivan's impact, the total sediment volume decrease along R-60 was about 207 ft3/ yr per lateral meter, with an average rate of 34.5 ft3/ yr per lateral meter. Ivan's (2004) and Dennis' (2005) landfall resulted in a further loss of sediment volume. However, the average rate of sediment volume change over the two-year 2004-2005 period was only 33.5 ft3/ yr per lateral meter. Ivan's impact resulted in shoreline retreat and a decrease of foredune elevation by approximately 3 ft from the pre-Ivan height. Dennis' impact was largely influenced by Ivan's \"footprint\" and resulted in almost complete deflation of the dune profile with noticeable scarping along the Gulf-side dune face. The shoreline migrated approximately 30 ft landward after Hurricane Dennis. Though less intense than either Ivan or Dennis, the storm seasons of 2008 and 2009 resulted in a significant amount\n62\n\n\fof beach erosion, sediment volume loss and scarping along the dune face as observed in the 2010 profile.\nRange Monument R-65 The profile at R-65 is located adjacent to the eastern terminus of Perdido Key, along the\nundeveloped portion of the GINS, and has never been nourished. The nourishment projects that were undertaken in 1985 and later in 1989/1991 stopped approximately 1000 ft to the west of R65. The eastern end of Perdido Key in the immediate vicinity of the inlet at Pensacola Pass lies within a zone of high random fluctuations. This study revealed that the shoreline in the region of R-65 underwent periods of advance and retreat from the late 1800's to present. Ivan's and Dennis's passage in 2004-2005 resulted in considerable erosion along this sector of the coast. Since Dennis however, the eastern end of the island along R-65 continues to advance seaward. The record of shoreline change in this region is skewed by the localized sediment progradation updrift of the inlet. As a result, positive change in the rates of shoreline change since Dennis may mask the natural long-term record of retreat.\nThe dune profile elevation data (Figure 3.20) at R-65 displays a large foredune approximately 13 ft high based on its 2004 pre-Ivan position. A foredune complex of similar elevation was noted over the period 1974 to 1998, indicating a relatively stable, established dune system. The relatively quiet post-Georges (1998) to pre-Ivan (2004) period resulted in a welldeveloped beach-dune system of established and incipient dunes extending seaward approximately 1200 ft from the benchmark. The period of storm quiescence resulted in an increase in sediment volume of approximately 102 ft3 per lateral meter (17ft3/yr per lateral meter). Ivan's impact led to a decrease of 6 ft in the foredune height from its pre-Ivan elevation, coupled with landward shift of the berm. Dennis' impact along R-65 was similar to the effects seen along all the other range monument locations: a severe reduction of the foredune, yielding a uniform washover platform approximately 2.5 ft high. The most recent survey profile data (2010), indicates that the profile has recovered to an elevation of 9 ft. However, signs of scarping are also evident along the gulfward dune face.\n63\n\n\fDiscussion Storm Influence on Dune Morphology\nThe results demonstrate that dune erosion and sediment volume change along the study area (R-31 to R-65) varies alongshore, with significant morphologic change occurring in response to elevated wind and wave conditions associated with storms. The hurricane history of Perdido Key during the study period (1974 to 2010) comprised cycles of greater or lesser storminess. Three primary dune erosive processes based on Sallenger's (2000) impact scale - inundation, overwash and scarping -- were observed through the analysis of the aerial images, ground-survey and Lidar data. Storms of higher magnitude (Frederic, Opal, Ivan, Dennis) resulted in inundation and overwash while weaker storms (Ike, Gustav, Ida) resulted in dune erosion and sediment redistribution.\nAfter the passage of Frederic in 1979, a 16-year period of relative calm, coupled with two major beach nourishment projects, facilitated coastal dune accretion. Over this period (1979 \u00ad 1995), aerial images of the study area displayed elevated foredunes, with heights averaging 14 ft and covered with vegetation. The data further highlight the significant influence of intense hurricane events beginning with Opal in 1995, and ending with Dennis in 2005, in redistributing large volumes of sand from the nearshore foredune to the back barrier area as well as offshore. Opal's landfall in October, 1995, resulted in extensive overwash across the Perdido Key study area. Additionally, a significant volume of eroded dune-sand was transported to the shallow nearshore, adjacent to the beach. With each major storm passage, the analyses indicate further erosion of the established and incipient dunes and the foredune system, especially along the narrower sections of Perdido Key, as well as beach erosion along the approximately 6 miles of undeveloped land within the GINS (R36-R65).\nAlong the majority of range monument profiles, the impacts of Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005) led to catastrophic damage to the primary dune system, considerably lowered the berm elevation and moved substantial quantities of sand landward as well as offshore of the primary bar. However, some of the profiles along the island's western end experienced shoreline growth. While Ivan's impact resulted in significant dune erosion and loss of sediment volume, Dennis' passage led to the almost complete destruction of both incipient and established dune fields. Further, the data reveal that Dennis' impacts were magnified by Ivan's passage only a few\n64\n\n\fmonths previously, and highlights the significance of storm frequency in causing rapid morphologic change to the beach and dune system along areas of low topographic relief.\nThe data illustrate that, following the passage of high-energy, intense storm events, dune elevation decreased, making the island increasingly susceptible to enhanced erosion during future hurricane passages. The majority of dunes along the wider, undeveloped portions of the island such as at R-55 and R-60 experienced dune erosion but were not completely flattened following hurricane events. When the complete inundation of the foredune occurred on narrower sections of the island such as at R-40 during Dennis, sand was redistributed as overwash sheets on the landward side of the island, often resulting in an increase in island width at this location. This agrees with the findings of Claudino-Sales et al., (2008) who, in a study conducted along Santa Rosa Island, found that island width is a major factor influencing dune survival after storms.\nQuantitative Analysis of Shoreline Retreat and Volume Loss While some studies have analyzed shoreline configuration and sediment volume change\nfollowing high intensity, extreme events along Perdido Key (Browder and Dean, 2000; Olsen Associates, 2006), few have examined the data quantitatively on a long-term basis. The current investigation covers a 36-year period (1974-2010), including periods of storminess and quiescence. According to the data, the average rate of shoreline change for the coastal segment between R-31 to R-60 revealed a negative net profile distance trend, demonstrating an overall landward retreat of the shoreline. The rate of shoreline change for this section of the beach varied from -13.7 to -0.19 ft/yr (Table 3.5). The R2 values of these rates returned low values that varied from 0.01 to 0.51. The non-linear, dynamic nature of shoreline change along this section of Perdido Key coastline resulted in low R2 values and was likely due to the effect of several hurricane events during the study period. The data further reveal that a long-term erosional signal exists between R-31 to R-60 extending from the developed portion of the island at R-31, eastward through the GINS at R-60 (Figure 3.21). In the vicinity of R-60, a significant erosional hotspot exists. According to Thornton et al., (2007), erosional hotspots are coastal segments that display significantly higher rates of retreat than adjacent areas. Results show recession rates of up to -13.7 ft/yr at R-60. The severe erosion experienced at R-60 (the eastern limit of the GINS) appears to be due to the reversal of net longshore transport in the vicinity of R-60. Instead of sediment following the westerly direction of longshore drift, the shallow waters of the ebb shoal\n65\n\n\fat R-60 create an area of transport divergence, moving sand in multiple directions and resulting in the highly erosional signal at R-60. Similar findings have been noted by Bowder and Dean (2000).\nThe shoreline behavior at R-65 is clearly an outlier. The position of the shoreline at this location is dominated by its proximity to the inlet at Pensacola Pass. As opposed to the other range monuments (R-31 to R-60) which show a trend of erosion over the study period (19742010), the shoreline at R-65 advanced at a rate of 6.5 ft/yr. The eastern terminus of the island has been modified largely due to inlet dynamics and storm passage.\nVolume change from shoreline to foredune crest along the Perdido Key range monument profiles varied according to location. Across R-31 to R-65, measurement of volume began at the dune crest closest to the shoreline and continued to the line of Mean High Water (0.91 ft). In general, significant decreases in volume totals were observed following the passage of storms (Figure 3.5). Over the entire period evaluated (1974 to 2010), the rate of volume change was predominantly negative, but varied from a gain of 2.7 ft3/yr per lateral meter, to a loss of -22.5 ft3/yr per lateral meter. The R2 values for those rates vary from 0.06 to 0.74. The R-squared values are relatively low and reveal that storm events accelerated sand loss in large quantities, followed by periods of recovery. This resulted in the data displaying a trend analogous to a descending staircase pattern in which the decrease in sediment volume was non-linear (Figure 3.5).\nVolume gain was observable only at R-65, along the eastern end of the island, while the other seven locations displayed a net decrease in volume over the 36-year time span of this study. At R-65, 2.7 ft3 of sediment per lateral meter was gained per year. Previous studies have documented that dunes are less affected by storms and extreme events when they occur along wider portions of an island (Stone et al., 2004; Claudino-Sales et al., 2008). The eastern end of Perdido Key in the locale of R-65 provides an excellent example of a wide portion of a barrier island, providing additional substrate for dune development. Further, R-65 is in the vicinity of the eastern spit, facilitating sediment accumulation and a subsequent net volume gain at this location. It should also be noted that R-65 is the monument closest to the landfall of Hurricane Ivan. Although the storm eroded the foredune from the pre-Ivan elevation, the decrease in volume was minimal and may be due to the increased relative width of the barrier island there.\n66\n\n\fThe most extreme case of volume loss was noted at R-31 where a net volume change of approximately -22.5 ft3/ yr per lateral meter was observed, significantly higher than the other range monument locations (Figure 3.22). Although monument R-31 is located along one of the wider portions of the island, it differed from all the other range monument locations in that significant development exists on the landward side of the monument. The volume change at this location highlighted the effect of upland development on dune morphology. While the dunes along the undeveloped locations were altered primarily due to storm impact, beach nourishment and inlet dynamics, the elevation of the dune system along R-31 was not significantly affected by storm passage. Near-coastal infrastructure (residential and commercial buildings) in the vicinity of R-31 appeared to minimize foredune elevation loss as the dune was repeatedly rebuilt in the same place. However, while the average foredune elevation was high, the dune was not maintaining itself and a continual volume loss was observed. The results demonstrate that the overall rate of sediment volume change along R-36--the only monument that was undeveloped and un-nourished-- returned the lowest rate of sand volume loss. This un-nourished and undeveloped section of the beach experienced less volumetric loss (-4.9 ft3/yr) from 1974 to 2010, compared to developed or nourished portions of the beach (Figure 3.22).\nEffect of Beach Nourishment on Dunes In addition to natural factors (storms, nearshore bathymetry, and sediment supply) that can\nalter the morphology of beaches and dunes, human-induced activities also affect coastal change. It is well documented that anthropogenic modifications such as beach nourishment alter the rate of shoreline movement and sediment volume change along the coast (Van der Wal, 2004; Absalonsen and Dean, 2011; Hapke et al., 2013).\nComparison of the trapezoidal integration graphs of volume change demonstrate that following the 1985 nourishment, dune accretion rates were higher in the immediate area of the beach nourishment (R-60). Although sand was only placed along the stretch from R-60 to R-64, the nearby range monuments to the west of R-60 (R-55, R-50 and R-45) experienced an increase in sediment volume, apparently benefitting from the net westerly transport of sediment in this area. Prior to the 1985 nourishment, Figure 3.5 reveals that R-55 was experiencing a net loss of sediment at a rate of 46.6 ft3/yr per lateral meter. The additional sand from the 1985 nourishment changed the formerly negative sediment budget of the foredunes along R-55 and R-45 into\n67\n\n\fpositive, and resulted in an increase in the net accumulation of sediment along R-60 and as far west as R-50. The impact of the second beach fill (1989 to 1991) appeared to be cumulative along R-45, R-50, R-55 and R-60 as the upward trend of sediment accumulation continued, leading to a net gain in sediment. The sediment volume accretion results agree with those of Van der Wal (2004), who found that dune accretion and sediment volume rates increase after beach nourishment.\nPrevious studies have found that nourished beaches provide enhanced protection from dune erosion and volume loss associated with high wave run-up when compared to un-nourished beaches (Nordstrom et al., 1977, Pstuty and Ofiara, 2002). The results reveal that in the case of Perdido Key, this was not necessarily the situation. The data demonstrate that the addition of sand appeared to have buffered the effects of shoreline erosion along the nourished portions of the island. However, volumetric loss in response to storm events was much higher along the wider, up-drift portions of the undeveloped nourished areas (R-60, R55 and R-50) than along the narrower, down-drift undeveloped, nourished segments (R-40 and R-45). Although the downdrift range monument locations were nourished only once, their low rates of sediment volume change (positive or negative) appear to reflect the contribution of longshore transport processes. Additionally, other factors such as storm-induced overwash and the offshore storage of sediment that can be re-transferred to the beach may have resulted in a less dramatic loss of sediment along R-40 and R-45.\nForedune Recovery According to Andrews (1970), foredunes reestablish their form dependent on the amount of\nsand retained following erosive episodes, the available sediment supply, assistance from prevailing winds and re-vegetation. Houser and Hamilton (2009), showed that foredune recovery along Santa Rosa Island was related to island width and the amount of overwash penetration. In the case of Perdido Key, the results highlight that the high frequency of storm impact along with storm intensity, consistently delays foredune recovery. While storms of higher magnitude (Opal, Ivan, Dennis) resulted in significant sediment re-distribution, less-intense storm events exacerbated the removal of sand from the subaerial beach and dune system to offshore areas. As a result, natural foredune recovery along Perdido Key is highly dependent on future storm occurrence and frequency.\n68\n\n\fForedune recovery after Hurricane Frederic (1979), along the wider, undeveloped portions of the island was aided by the large quantities of sand supplied to the system during the 1985 and 1989-1991 nourishments. The six-year storm hiatus that occurred between 1998 and 2004 allowed for foredune accretion along all transects. Foredunes along the undeveloped, nourished portions of the island such as at R-40, R-45, R-50, R-55 and R-60, accumulated sediment at an average rate of 0.36 ft3/yr per lateral meter during the quiescent period. Over the same period, the foredune along the unnourished, undeveloped segment of the island along R-36 recovered from an elevation of approximately 10 ft after Hurricane Georges in 1998, to elevations exceeding 12 ft prior to Ivan, and exhibited an average gain in sediment volume at a rate of 0.33 ft3/yr per lateral meter. R-36 is along one of the narrowest portions of the island and as a result, the dune recovery process was slower there than along the rest of the island. R-31, located along the widest section of the island, saw a relatively stable foredune, with no significant elevation change over the 1998 to pre-Ivan period. Instead, foredune recovery along this location (R-31) entailed a gulfward translation of the dune profile, resulting in a net increase in sediment volume. Greater dune accretion on the developed portion of Perdido Key (for example, at R-31) than on non-developed portions following the effects of the 2004/2005 storm seasons is likely related to beach management practices similar to the dune restoration project that was undertaken by the FDEP-BBCS in early 2006 (FDEP, 2008). That project involved dune re-vegetation along R-31 to R-34 and resulted in an almost immediate accumulation of sediment along R-31 as shown in Figure 3.5.\nThe clustered storm activity beginning with Hurricane Ivan (2004) contributed to delaying the foredune recovery process. Along every range monument, Hurricane Ivan produced a decrease in foredune height. The subsequent impact of Hurricane Dennis (2005) rendered the topography of the barrier nearly featureless, as profiles were characteristic of largely flat washover platforms. The lack of foredunes following Dennis' impact may have facilitated the exchange of aeolian driven sediments between the beach and the back-barrier, initiating the poststorm foredune recovery. While the passages of Hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Tropical Storm Ida over the 2008-2009 storm seasons impacted the dunes and interrupted recovery, the 2010 dune profiles reveal foredune recovery (increase in dune elevation and sediment volume) along all the transects. Along R-31, dune re-vegetation appears to have acted as a catalyst to trap sand, as the\n69\n\n\fforedune complex along this monument rapidly increased from a post-2005 elevation of approximately 4 ft to approximately 14 ft in 2010.\nThe discontinuous nature of the dune field along Perdido Key may have also advanced dune recovery during periods of storm quiescence. Between R-31 and R-65, several pockets of wellvegetated areas compliment the discontinuous dune field. According to Priestas and Fagherazzi (2010), dune field discontinuity can aid foredune recovery, as an absence of areas without vegetation tend to act as a local source of sediment to adjacent dunes with the aid of prevailing winds. The onshore winds associated with the lesser intense 2008-2009 storm seasons may have also transported sediment to the dune fields along Perdido Key, thereby assisting with foredune recovery along the locations analyzed.\nTrends of Beach and Dune Stability R-36 represents the only area along the Perdido Key study site that has not been\nnourished and is designated as undeveloped. As one of the narrower portions of the island, this segment of the beach displayed possibly the most stable topographic and volumetric profile and represents a prototype of the beach in its natural state of equilibrium. Within the 36 year study period, two eras existed where storms neither impacted the area nor were any active nourishments projects undertaken. As a result, the behavior of the dune complex along R-36 during these two periods were used as proxies to evaluate the time it takes for the dune system to stabilize to a pre-storm pattern. The first period following Frederic (1979) up to the first beach nourishment in 1985, represented a six-year interlude from storms as the beach and dune system equilibrated after Frederic's impact. The net volume change along R-36 during this time was approximately 10 ft3 per lateral meter. Interestingly, three other range monuments (R-40, R-50 and R-60) along the undeveloped portion of the GINS appear to have stabilized close to R-36 prior to the first nourishment.\nThe second period of interest was the interval following Georges (1998), up to the impact of Ivan (2004). As outlined in the previous section, this six-year era of storm quiescence, coupled with no artificial sand replenishments, enabled natural recovery of the dune and beach profile. During this second interval of no storm passage, R-36 exhibited an increase in sediment volume of approximately 10 ft3 per lateral meter. The average rates of loss per year along R-36 for both time periods are quite similar and appear to be a good example of the beach and dune system\n70\n\n\ftending to stability. Additionally, Figure 3.5 reveals that the majority of the volume profiles along the GINS tend to mimic R-36's behavior. According to Morton et al., (1994), it may take as long as a decade after a major storm for the pre-storm erosion pattern to become clearly evident. The analyses of volumetric change and foredune recovery for transects along Perdido Key indicate that dune recovery is restored within approximately six years following a major storm event.\nConclusion Few studies have analyzed the effects of extreme storms on coastal dunes along Perdido Key. This project differs from previous works both in terms of the density of data collected, and the period analyzed, which included several years of post-storm activity. The project was also unique in that it also focused on foredune recovery along differing settings (developed, undeveloped and unnourished as well as nourished and undeveloped) during times of storms as well as non-hurricane activity. The sensitivity of the measurements did not allow for a quantitative examination of minor increases in sea-level. As a result, mean sea level rise over the period of the study (1974-2010) was assumed constant and is presumed to have resulted in a uniform contribution to the rate of dune evolution. Analysis of barrier island elevation profile data has contributed to further understanding of the morphological evolution of Perdido Key over varying spatial and temporal scales. This investigation established that, in the case of Perdido Key, natural dune recovery and overall morphological evolution is directly related to the duration, strength and frequency of storms. While storms are considered to be the main catalyst to dune morphologic alteration, storm intensity appears to be the key factor controlling the survival and recovery of low-lying dunes along Perdido Key. However, site-specific factors such as island width, dune elevation prior to storm passage, and the continuity of the dune complex also play an integral role in the morphodynamics of dunes on a barrier island.\nThe results show that storms of varying intensity result in storm surge that erodes the foredune complex. The data reveal that, along those areas where the foredunes were high and well developed, less sediment was translated to the backbarrier, with a significant portion of the eroded material being transported offshore. Additionally, during times of minimal storminess, the data demonstrate either a landward or seaward migration of the foredune, possibly as a result\n71\n\n\fof the prevailing winds. The rate of foredune accretion appears to be largely controlled by sediment supply, as foredunes that were artificially nourished at least once displayed higher prestorm elevations. Based on the data collected, foredune movement also correlated well with shoreline migration. This was observable in all range monument profiles after storm passage, as a landward and upward translation of the beach and dune profiles correlated with shoreline displacement.\nThe study established that dune volume change from 1979 to 1985 and again from 1998 to 2004 prior to Hurricane Ivan, provide the best estimate of dune accretion rates along the eastern portion of Perdido Key, as the area experienced no storm surge-related dune erosion or addition of sand from beach-fill projects during these periods. While post-storm foredune recovery along the eastern portion of the island was found to not be immediate, signs of dune and beach equilibration began to occur approximately 6 years after major storm passage. Comparing the dune volumes between nourished and unnourished beaches indicates that artificial sand replenishment is beneficial to dune accretion as it results in an almost immediate increase in beach width and provides an increased supply of sediment. However, the effects of beach nourishment are not persistent in the long-term and storm passage as well as the alongshore transport of sand contribute to profile configuration. Beach nourishments along Perdido Key were found to have buffered the effects of erosion. However, once the fill dissipated, the pre-fill erosion pattern was noticeably evident.\nThis study also revealed that shoreline change rates agree well with rates of foredune recovery (change) on the undeveloped portion of the island. The data illustrate that, over the period of the study, transects R-31 to R-60 exhibited an erosional signal. Along the undeveloped, nourished areas (R-40 to R-60), the erosional signal is relatively uniform, while the undeveloped, unnourished portion of Perdido Key (R-36), revealed a slightly higher rate of shoreline erosion over the 36-year period. The moderately accretive shoreline signal along R-65 in the locale of the inlet at the eastern end of the island is attributed to the dynamics of sediment exchange at the inlet.\nMajor storms with relatively short return periods have resulted in cumulative negative effects along the Perdido Key dune complex. Projected increases in storm intensity as a result of climate change may be expected to significantly alter the natural equilibrium of this coastal system. When dunes are unable to fully recover from storm impact, they become increasingly susceptible\n72\n\n\fto large-scale coastal modification, resulting in increased vulnerability to the coastal zone. While nourishment and dune re-vegetation may aid beach and dune profile recovery following storm passage, the dynamics of littoral transport along the eastern portion of Perdido Key, coupled with the presence of the inlet in this locale could disrupt sediment re-distribution and cause the overall effects of storms to be enhanced along the beach and dune system. The health of a low-profile, narrow barrier island such as Perdido Key is dependent on a continuous, densely vegetated dune system of substantial width. This study should provide assistance to coastal managers and future researchers in assessing the morphologic conditions of dunes along Perdido Key, especially with predictions of increased storminess.\n73\n\n\fTable 3.1.

Historical shoreline change for the eight range monument locations along the eastern section of Perdido Key. The non-linear, dynamic nature of shoreline movement over this portion of the island resulted in low R2 values and was likely due to the effect of hurricanes over the study period (1974-2010). The shoreline behavior at R-65 is noticeably different from the other monuments (R-31 to R-60). The position of the shoreline at R-65 is influenced by its close proximity to the inlet at Pensacola Pass.\n84\n\n\fFigure 3.7.

The shoreline, defined as the physical intersection of the land-water boundary, is arguably the most important geomorphological component of the coastal zone (Dolan, Fenster and Holme, 1991; Mazzer and Dillenburg, 2009; Gens, 2010). The movement of the shoreline is commonly employed as a reliable index of coastal dynamics over a wide range of temporal scales, in response to the action of coastal agents (e.g., waves, tides, storm surge) (Dolan et al., 1991; Hapke et al., 2010). Over the long term, sealevel change and sediment supply are among the major factors that stimulate shoreline adjustment and produce discernible trends upon which to base future predictions (Honeycutt and Krantz, 2003; Frazer, Anderson and Fletcher, 2010; van Rijn, 2011). Climate models project an accelerating rise in sea level over the next century, as increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases enhance ocean warming and ice-sheet loss (Meehl et al., 2007; Church and White, 2011; Strauss et al., 2012; Ranasinghe et al., 2012; IPCC, 2014). As a result, shoreline retreat due to long-term sea-level rise is predicted to accelerate as well (Stone et al., 1997; Masselink and vanHeteren, 2014). In the short term, high-energy events, such as storms, are generally responsible for dramatic changes in coastal morphology and shoreline position, with consequent redistribution of sediment (Zhang, Douglas and Leatherman, 2002; Houser, Hapke and Hamilton, 2008; Hapke et al., 2010; Mousavi et al., 2011). Several recent investigations have also provided evidence that clustered storms with relatively rapid return periods exert considerable control over the evolution of sandy barrier islands (Miller et al., 2004; Elsner, Kossin and Jagger, 2008; Frazer et al., 2010; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). Contemporary research into large-scale coastal morphologic change has highlighted the importance of updated methods to quantify shoreline change (Hapke et al., 2011; Jackson, Alexander and Bush, 2012; Thieler et al., 2013). Using the extensive Florida coast as a laboratory, historic shoreline data have revealed a wide range of coastal response to\n101\n\n\fenvironmental change for both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state (Miller et al., 2004; Absalonsen and Dean, 2011; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). Over the period 1850-1970, Gulf coast shorelines displayed an average long-term rate of retreat of -1.6 meters/year (m/yr) (Dolan, Anders and Kimball, 1985; Davis, 1997). During the recent decades, however (1990-2005), the Gulf coast experienced significant morphological modification due to the passage and landfall of major hurricanes (e.g., Hurricanes Opal (1995), Ivan (2004), and Katrina, Dennis and Rita (2005)). The cumulative effects of these major storms resulted in an average rate of shoreline change over the short term of -2.3 m/yr (Miller et al., 2004; Absalonsen and Dean, 2011). Meanwhile, Florida's Atlantic coast shorelines displayed relatively modest erosion rates of approximately 0.2 m/yr over the 1850-1970 era (Dolan et al., 1985; May, Dolan and Hayden, 1983; Morton and Miller, 2005).\nThe main objective of this study was the development of robust estimates of shoreline change using state-of-the-art GIS mapping and innovative statistical methods that model the non-linear trends in coastal behavior. The study sites selected for this investigation were Little St. George Island on Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast (Figure 4.1), and the Northern Merritt Island barrier island complex (Figure 4.2) along Florida's Atlantic coast. Both sites are typical in that they are sandy barrier islands located in close proximity to inlets and are frequently impacted by storms. Corollary objectives of this project included:  Determination of shoreline behavior along two barrier island settings relative to recent\nconditions on a scale of tens of kilometers.  Identification of erosion \"hotspots\" along the study sites to aid with coastal construction\ntrends and future mitigation measures based on climate projections.  Examination of shoreline variability along coastal settings with unique coastal orientations.  Quantification of the degree to which the nearshore geologic framework has influenced\nalongshore patterns of shoreline change.\n\nGeologic Background\n\nStudy Area\n\nThe geologic evolution of Florida's coastal zone has been strongly influenced by multiple\n\ncycles of sea-level change (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). According to Reinson (1992), the mid-\n\nHolocene deceleration in postglacial sea-level rise approximately 5000 years ago provided the\n\n102\n\n\fcatalyst for modern barrier island development. Barrier islands host valuable ecosystems while simultaneously shielding the mainland from the effects of coastal hazards (Wang et al., 2006). The majority of these features trend parallel to the mainland coast and are found on low-gradient coastal settings (i.e., continental shelves on passive margins), with moderate tidal range, decreased wave energy and an abundance of sediment (Hayes, Kana and Barwis, 1980; Stone et al., 2004; Morton and Miller, 2005; Wang et al., 2006).\nLittle St. George Island is a pristine, uninhabited and undeveloped sandy barrier located along the northwest coast of Florida in Franklin County, about 11 km south of Apalachicola Bay (Figure 4.1). The island extends approximately 15 km in length with an average width of 0.5 km. Little St. George Island was formerly part of St. George Island. The two islands were separated in 1954 for navigation purposes and the channel was called Sikes Cut (Florida Department of Natural Resources, 1983). Elevations along the majority of the island range between 1 and 3.6 m above mean sea level (FDNR, 1983). The shoreline along the cuspate island is oriented in southeasterly and southwesterly directions (Corbett et al., 2002). Wind waves and tidal currents are the primary agents of sediment transport in the region (Miller et al., 2004). The sediment along the mainland shore is composed of fine-to medium-grained quartz sand with minor quantities of heavy minerals and shell fragments (Foster and Cheng, 2001; Corbett et al., 2002). Wave periods in the vicinity of Little St. George Island are generally shorter than 6.0 seconds in duration, with wave approach roughly perpendicular to the southeast-facing shoreline of the island (Morang, 1992). The area has a mean wave height of approximately 0.5 m and an average tidal range of 0.6 m (Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 2000; NOAA, 2011a). Along the southwestern portion of the island from West Pass to Cape St. George (Figure 4.1), littoral transport is approximately 88,000 m3/yr toward the west. Net longshore transport along the open coast of the island's southeastern segment from Sikes Cut to Cape St. George is from east to west and amounts to 133,000 m3/yr (Dean and O'Brien, 1987). An extensive system of nearshore and offshore shoals exist at the intersection of the southeast-facing and southwest-facing segments of Little St. George Island (Figure 4.2).\nThe northern segment of Merritt Island, coupled with the adjacent Cape Canaveral, form a distinctive barrier island complex along the southeast Atlantic coast of Florida. The area under investigation parallels the Volusia County coastline. It extends approximately 50 km from the undeveloped Northern Peninsula State Recreation Area in the north, along a heavily developed\n103\n\n\fand seawall-armored shoreline trending southeast, ending at the Cape Canaveral National Seashore (Figure 4.3). The Ponce de Leon inlet separates the northern portion of the barrier island complex from the southern portion. A large, south-trending ebb shoal highlights the nearshore area adjacent to the inlet (Figure 4.3). The topography of the southern portion of the barrier island complex is characterized by a prominent sequence of elongate beach ridges. These features record a near-continuous sediment supply and reflect past sea-level oscillations (Chaki, 1974; Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992a).Sediment transport in the area is facilitated by wind-driven waves and tidal currents (Morton and Miller, 2005). Wave approach is predominantly from the northeast (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1983) and as a result, littoral transport is approximately 380,000 m3/yr toward the south (Dean and O'Brien, 1987). Sediment along Northern Merritt Island consists of Holocene and Pleistocene well-sorted, fine-grained quartz sand with small amounts of coquina deposits (Brooks, 1972; Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992a). Tides in the vicinity are primarily semidiurnal with an average tidal range of approximately 0.85 m (National Ocean Service, 2014). Mean wave height in the area averages 0.65 m annually, with wave periods ranging from 6 to 7.3 seconds (National Ocean Service, 2014). Table 4.1 summarizes the essential characteristics of the two barrier island study sites.\nSt. George Island Storm History During the period 1856-2013, 96 storms of varying intensity passed within a 140 km\nradius of Little St. George Island (NOAA-CSC, 2014). Storm tracks are shown in Figure 4.4. The 140-km distance represents the radius of storm-force winds that result in elevated water levels associated with storm surges (Keim et al., 2007). Over the period 1995-2013, an unusually high concentration of storm activity was observed, as twelve storms impacted the area with a range of intensities (Table 4.2). Three of those storms were categorized as hurricanes (categories 1-5) based on wind speed (Saffir-Simpson Scale). Hurricane Dennis (2005), was the most recent major storm to have passed within 140 km of Little St. George Island. Although the trajectories and subsequent landfall of Hurricanes Opal (1995), and Ivan (2004), both fell outside of the established radius of hurricane-force winds, significant modification of the barrier island morphology along St. George Island (adjacent to Little St. George Island) occurred. Leadon (1999) and Wang et al., (2006), studied storm effects on St. George Island in response to Hurricanes Opal and Ivan. They observed a decrease in back-beach elevation along St. George\n104\n\n\fIsland ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 m across a substantial portion of the backbarrier, together with major dune erosion along the foreshore following the impact of Hurricane Ivan in 2004.\n\nNorthern Merritt Island Storm History Northern Merritt Island and the barrier island complex in this vicinity has been impacted\nby at least 93 storms of varying magnitude over the period 1873 to 2013 (NOAA-CSC, 2014). Storm tracks are shown in Figure 4.5. Over the last 20 years (1995 to 2013), four category one hurricanes and eight tropical storms impacted the study area, within a 140-km radius of Northern Merritt Island (Table 4.3). While not as intense as hurricanes, extratropical storms are known to cause substantial morphological changes to beach and dune systems (Foster and Cheng, 2001; Stone et al., 2004). Extratropical storms or \"northeasters\" as they are commonly referred to, are frequent in this area and tend to remain in the vicinity for sustained periods of time (Dolan and Davis, 1992; Morton and Sallenger, 2003). The duration of these storm systems coupled with their frequency of occurrence generally result in high-amplitude waves that continue through numerous tidal cycles (Gornitz et al., 1994). As a result, extratropical storms also cause extreme erosion along barrier island coastlines (Stone et al., 2004).\n\nShoreline Data Compilation\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to evaluate coastal change along the study sites, approximately two dozen data\n\nsets of historic and contemporary shoreline positions were compiled and digitized. The data were\n\nobtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) historical charts, U.S.\n\nCoast and Geodetic Survey (National Ocean Service) survey maps (T-sheets), aerial imagery and\n\nLidar (Light detecting and ranging) data from a variety of agencies (NOAA, United States\n\nGeological Survey (USGS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Florida\n\nDepartment of Transportation (FDOT), and Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\n(FDEP)). The shoreline database used to quantify change along Little St. George and Northern\n\nMerritt Island is listed in Tables 4.4 and 4.5 respectively.\n\nFor initial digitization within ArcGIS, historic shoreline data on the Gulf side were\n\nprocessed in the North American Datum, 1983 (NAD83), Florida State Plane Coordinate\n\nSystem, Zone North. Shorelines on the Atlantic side were assigned to the NAD83, Florida State\n\n105\n\n\fPlane Coordinate System, Zone East. In many of the older aerial images, the absence of a coordinate system required use of the Geo-referencing tool within ArcGIS to register and assign coordinates.\nMore recent shoreline data (1998 to 2007) was derived from Lidar data and orthophotographs (2008 to 2013). Since 1998, Lidar data have been collected every two to three years for coastal Florida. The Lidar data were referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). According to Stockdon et al., (2002), in order to acquire shoreline position from Lidar data, a conversion must be employed relative to a vertical tidal-based based datum. For this study, the line of Mean High Water was used as the vertical datum. Therefore, a vast amount of recent datum-based Mean High Water (MHW) shoreline data was available for use in this investigation. For orthophotos, shorelines were digitized using the vector (polyline) tool in ArcEditor/ ArcGIS version 10.2, at scales of 1:400 up to 1:1000. Shorelines mapped from orthophotos used the visual, proxy-based high water line (HWL) as the indicator of shoreline position. According to Shalowitz (1964), the HWL is defined as the maximum limit of wave reach during tidal high.\nOnce all shorelines were digitized and converted to vectorized shapefiles, they were merged into a common database in ArcGIS. The methods used to calculate and present rates of change utilized the ArcGIS platform and required unique identifiers within the attribute table of each shapefile (e.g., shoreline date, uncertainty of shoreline position) to ensure software compatibility. For final analysis, Gulf and Atlantic coast shoreline data were reprojected to the NAD83, UTM Zone 16 North coordinate system and the NAD83, UTM Zone 17 East coordinate systems respectively.\nShoreline Position Uncertainty and Error For this study, the established uncertainties of historic shoreline positions, as detailed by\nCrowell et al., (1991) and Miller et al., (2004) were used. Those studies found that the reported positional accuracy of historical maps and charts at a scale of 1:20,000 was approximately \u00b110 m. For aerial images that required geo-referencing in order to assign co-ordinates, a root mean square (RMS) error of approximately 3-7 m was maintained. On older images however, an inadequate number of identifiable features for cross-referencing resulted in RMS errors of up to 10 m. Relatively recent geometrically corrected images from aerial photographs were assigned a\n106\n\n\fshoreline position uncertainty of \u00b1 4.2 m to account for issues relating to image contrast and distortions.\nAccording to Stockdon et al., (2002), an associated global positioning satellite position error (\u00b11 m) along with a horizontal regression error (\u00b11.5 m) generally accompanies each Lidarderived shoreline. For this investigation, the estimate of \u00b11.5 m for the error associated with Lidar data was maintained. Comparison of aerial imaging and Lidar data along both Little St. George Island and Northern Merritt Island, obtained during a one-year interval (2006 -2007), yielded position error values of approximately \u00b1 5 m along sections of each shoreline evaluated.\nCalculation of Shoreline Change Rates Rates of shoreline change were calculated using two methods: the Digital Shoreline\nAnalysis System (DSAS), and the Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R (AMBUR). DSAS version 4.2, developed by the USGS (Thieler et al., 2009), was the first method used to obtain rate-of-change statistics. The initial step of the DSAS method involved creating a reference baseline that paralleled each study area's coastline. The baseline was digitized in ArcMap at a scale of 1:15,000 and placed onshore, contiguous to the most landward shoreline. The second phase of the DSAS procedure comprised casting transects at an approximately orthogonal orientation to the overall trend of shoreline movement. Transects were spaced 100 m apart along both coasts. The final portion of the DSAS procedure involved calculation of shoreline change rates using the desired statistical metric (e.g. least squares regression or endpoint rate methods).\nThe AMBUR software package was also employed to assess trends in shoreline movement. The AMBUR methodology, while similar to the DSAS in providing statistical data (linear regression, end point rate) to assist with analysis of the land-water interface, improves on the DSAS by delivering rate of change values along coastlines with non-linear orientations (Jackson et al., 2012). The improved and highly efficient method of casting transects along coastlines with curvilinear to highly sinuous features improved the customary practice of casting transects at right angles to the shoreline. The AMBUR technique used two baselines to evaluate change: an onshore and offshore baseline. The multiple baseline technique eliminated instances where multiple transects intersected along curved shoreline segments, as was the case with the DSAS method along Little St. George Island.\n107\n\n\fShoreline change-rates for both study areas over the long-term were obtained using the linear regression rate (LRR) calculation. According to Dolan et al., (1991), the LRR technique is most commonly employed to calculate shoreline change rates. While a distinct advantage of the method is that it utilizes all shoreline data, the technique is affected by outliers and tends to underestimate rates of change. The end-point rate (EPR) technique was then used to quantify changes over the short-term period. End- point rate calculations are determined by dividing the distance of total shoreline movement by the time elapsed between the oldest and youngest shoreline measurements at each transect (Dolan et al., 1991). While both methodologies (DSAS and AMBUR) produced rate of change statistics mentioned above, additional statistical outputs were also obtained (e.g. Weighted Linear Regression, jackknife), but were not included in this analysis. In the field of coastal geomorphology, only the LRR and EPR statistical outputs are thought to be representative of the cyclic and non-cyclic processes that contribute to shoreline alteration over specific time periods (Thieler et al., 2013; Morton and Miller, 2005).\nResults Shoreline accretion values are reported using positive values, while negative numbers indicate erosion. The rate-of-change statistics discussed are delineated based on AMBUR output. The average long-term and short-term change-rates for each location, coupled with the percentages of eroding or accreting transects, are listed in Table 4.6 (Little St. George Island) and Table 4.7 (Northern Merritt Island). Shoreline change data obtained by the DSAS method are included for reference and comparison.\nLong-Term (1856-2013) Shoreline Change on Little St. George Island Examination of the long-term shoreline history indicate that the barrier (Fig. 4.1) has\ndisplayed rotational instability, with one segment of the island (West Pass to Cape St. George) displaying mainly accretive characteristics, while erosion dominated the Gulf-facing eastern portion (Cape St. George to Sikes Cut). The presence of a pronounced inflection point in the vicinity of Cape St. George around transect 182 (Fig. 4.6) highlights the rapid transition between accretion and erosion. The average rate of long-term change along Little St. George Island was -1.8 m/yr. Among those transects undergoing retreat, the average rate of change was -3.4 m/yr. Accreting transects averaged 5.1 m/yr. Approximately 65 percent of transects along the 16 km\n108\n\n\f(10 m) of sandy shoreline experienced net erosion (Table 4.6). The highest accretion rate of 6.4 m/yr was observed on the barrier's southwestern segment near transect number 75 (Figure 4.6).\nThe shoreline change data along Little St. George Island revealed that the spatial extent of erosion was significantly higher than accretion, as almost two-thirds of the island experienced substantial net erosion. Shoreline retreat occurred primarily along the eastern Gulf-facing segment of the island extending from Cape St. George to Sikes Cut (Figure 4.6). Especially severe erosion was observed immediately east of the cape, and between transects 440-513 in the vicinity of the inlet, Sikes Cut. This erosional hotspot (transects 440-513) may be associated with the opening of the inlet in 1954, resulting in increased erosion downdrift (westward) of Sikes Cut.\nShort-Term (1995-2013) Shoreline Change on Little St. George Island The short-term signature of coastal change along Little St. George Island was evaluated\nin order to better understand natural shoreline movement in response to storms across an undeveloped barrier coast. The overall rate of change over the short term was much more rapid (-4.3 m/yr) than over the long-term (1856-2013) (Table 4.6). The results reveal a more complicated pattern of erosion and accretion (Figure 4.8) as opposed to the systemic pattern separating the two processes observed over the long term. Approximately 79 percent of transects evaluated over this period displayed erosive characteristics with 21 percent of transects advancing. For eroding transects, the mean rate of retreat (-10.1 m/yr) was almost three times higher than the average rate for eroding transects over the long-term (-3.4 m/yr). Similarly, for transects displaying shoreline growth over the short-term, the rate of advance was proportionately higher (17.1 m/yr) than over the long term (5.1 m/yr)\nThe western segment of the island between West Pass and Cape St. George displayed a variable pattern of erosion and accretion over the short term. The majority of transects along this section displayed shoreline retreat, with the presence of a major erosional hotspot between transects 32 to 181. Rates of shoreline movement along the western segment of the island ranged from +14 m/yr to -19.1 m/yr. In the vicinity of Cape St. George, a notable reversal from erosion over the long-term to accretion in the short-term occurred between transects 201 to 250 (Figure 4.8).\n109\n\n\fThe increased spatial extent of erosion and accretion along both segments of the island over the recent period might be attributable to the upsurge in storm activity in the region since 1995. The influence of Hurricanes Erin (1995), Earl (1998), Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005) all acted to disrupt the equilibrium of the shoreline. The direct impact of tropical storm Bonnie in 2004 (Fig. 4.4), in the vicinity of Cape St. George, appears to be in large part responsible for the complex pattern of shoreline change observed over the short term.\nLong-Term (1873-2013) Shoreline Change along Northern Merritt Island Shoreline change along the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island was\nquantified for approximately 2800 transects along 66 km (41 miles) of shoreline using the LRR method. The long-term (1873-2013) signature of coastal change was non-uniform, with cycles of erosion and accretion along the length of the study area (Fig. 4.9).\nRate-of-change statistics along Northern Merritt Island were first quantified by summarizing the overall island-wide shoreline change. To accurately demonstrate inlet influence on the barrier locale, the shoreline was divided into two oceanfront shoreline zones (Zones 1 and 3), and one inlet zone (Zone 2) (Fig. 4.9, inset). Zone 1 included transects 1 to 1494, located to the north of Ponce de Leon Inlet. Zone 2 comprised transects 1495 to 1799. Zone 3 consisted of transects 1800 to 2800, situated on the downdrift shoreline, south of the inlet.\nIsland-wide Shoreline Change Shoreline change along the coastline varied in magnitude and spatial extent as shown in\nFigure 4.9. Over the period 1873 to 2013, the overall mean rate of change was 0.17 m/yr. For transects displaying shoreline retreat, the average rate of erosion was - 0.78 m/yr (Table 4.7). The mean rate of accretion for advancing transects was 0.52 m/yr. Approximately 65 percent of transects displayed advancing behavior, with 35 percent eroding. The Ponce de Leon inlet zone (Zone 2) highlighted the extremes in both accretion and erosion. The highest long-term erosion rate (-5.9 m/yr at transect 1591) and the highest long-term accretion rate (12.1 m/yr at transect 1599) were both located within the inlet zone.\n110\n\n\fZone 1 - North of Inlet Throughout the long-term period, the shoreline segment within Zone 1 underwent an\noverall mean rate of change of 0.04 m/yr, representing a nearly stable shoreline along this segment of the barrier island complex (Table 4.8). Net accretion characterized this zone with the majority of transects along this reach (71 percent) experiencing a seaward advance.\nZone 2 \u00ad Inlet Zone The inlet zone was noticeably the most variable shoreline segment over the long term.\nAlong this section, the overall mean rate of change was -0.29 m/yr. Erosion dominated the Inlet Zone as 62 percent of transects displayed a retreating signature while the remainder underwent seaward movement. A significant erosional hotspot was noted along the southern portion of the inlet zone with the northern segment of the zone mainly characterized by progradation (Figure 4.9). A long-term time series plot of three representative transects (1670, 1750 and 1790) taken along the southern segment of the inlet zone revealed a dramatic retreat in the shoreline beginning around the year 1980 (Figure 4.11). Over the period 1979 to 1994, approximately 3 million cubic yards of material were removed from the inlet as a result of dredging and inlet maintenance (Foster, 1995). The consistent removal of sand from the littoral system over that 15year period in the region of the inlet may have contributed to the pattern of shoreline movement observed along the southern portion of the inlet zone.\nZone 3 - South of Inlet Along Zone 3, results demonstrate a repeating pattern of erosion and accretion over the\n140-year period. The overall long-term rate of change within this zone was moderately accretional with a value of 0.17 m/yr. Approximately 63 percent of transects analyzed in this zone underwent shoreline advance (Table 4.8). Moving southward from the inlet, a mild erosive signature was noted. However, around transect 1801, a pattern of accretion with minor pockets of erosion governed the majority of the downdrift shoreline along this zone. The mean rate of accretion for transects displaying shoreline advance was 0.38 m/yr. Eroding transects averaged -0.22 m/yr. The mean rate of erosion along this zone for segments displaying retreat was significantly less than the average erosion rate for the other two zones evaluated: -0.86 m/yr (Zone 1) and -1.63 m/yr (Zone 2).\n111\n\n\fShort Term (1995-2013) Shoreline Change along Northern Merritt Island The overall morphologic signature of change over the recent period (1995 to 2013),\nrevealed a predominantly accretive pattern for Zones 1 and 3. The inlet zone however, was governed by erosion (Figure 4.12). The short-term, island-wide overall mean rate of change was 0.41 m/yr, indicating modest short-term growth of the shoreline when compared to the long-term value of 0.17 m/yr. The average retreat rate for eroding shoreline segments was significantly more rapid (-11.2 m/yr) over the short term, than the average rate (-0.78 m/yr) over the entire study period. Of the approximately 2800 transects evaluated, 52 percent of transects indicated shoreline advance at a rate of 5.2 m/yr, while 48 percent of transects revealed a landward retreat of the shoreline.\nDiscussion A thorough, updated examination of both the long-term and short-term history of shoreline change along Little St. George and Northern Merritt Island revealed that patterns of coastal change are distinctly different on opposing sides of Florida's sandy coast. Although both coasts are characterized by low to moderate wave energy, this investigation demonstrated that Gulf coast shorelines exhibited higher rates of shoreline migration. Over the short-term, storm impact was the primary driver of shoreline change along these barrier islands. However, sediment redistribution resulting from engineering projects, nearshore bathymetric features and shoreline orientation all acted to affect the position of the shoreline. Variations in frequency and magnitude of these coastal agents strongly controlled the shoreline's morphologic change over time.\nComparison of Shoreline Change Rates with Previous Work This analysis yielded updated rates of shoreline change related to recently active storm\nconditions. Prior estimates of trends in shoreline evolution over varying timescales have been conducted over significantly larger regions of the coast (hundreds of km) (Miller et al., 2004; Morton and Miller, 2005; Absalonsen and Dean, 2011; Houston and Dean, 2014). The results presented here provided quantitative estimates of shoreline change over a much smaller scale (tens of km) and reveal more site-specific measurements. As detailed in Tables 4.6 and 4.7, the rates quantified in this study highlight significantly elevated values of change for both sites under\n112\n\n\finvestigation, when compared to previous estimates (Miller et al., 2004; Morton and Miller, 2005).\nAlong Northern Merritt Island, the overall long-term mean rate of change (0.17 m/yr) obtained is analogous to the rate reported by Morton and Miller (2005) of 0.20 m/yr. In a recent study conducted by Houston and Dean (2014), a long-term shoreline position change of 49 m along Florida's Atlantic Coast over a period of 134 years was found. The current study quantified a net shoreline position change of approximately 27 m over a 157-year period, at a rate of 0.17 m/yr. This investigation also detailed a lower short-term rate of change along Merritt Island (0.41 m/yr) when compared to the previously calculated rate of 0.70 m/yr by Morton and Miller (2005). Previous estimates of shoreline change over the short-term suggested that 29 percent of transects along Northern Merritt Island underwent erosion with 71 percent accreting (Morton and Miller, 2005). This study demonstrated that 48 percent of the shoreline along Northern Merritt Island experienced retreat over the short-term with 52 percent of the coastline showing signs of advance.\nAlong Little St. George Island, this study produced an overall shoreline change rate of -1.83 m/yr over the extended era (1856-2013). A recent analysis of shoreline change along St. George Island, adjacent to Little St. George Island found a mean shoreline change rate of -1.52 m/yr over the long term (Twichell et al., 2013). Miller et al., (2004) in a study that evaluated coastal change along Florida's barrier islands, found an average long-term shoreline change rate of -0.1 m/yr. This study detailed an average long-term rate of change (-1.83 m/yr) much higher than the Miller et al., (2004) estimate, highlighting the alongshore variability of such measurements on the Gulf coast. The short-term rates obtained in the current study also differed from the rates presented by Miller et al., (2004). The scale difference is also obvious in the shortterm data. The current data indicated a mean shoreline change rate of -4.3 m/yr over the shortterm while the Miller et al., (2004) estimate of change over the short-term returned a much lower value of 0.2 m/yr.\nLittle St. George Island Along Little St. George Island, the influence of barrier orientation on shoreline change\nwas evident. This study revealed that the western segment of the shoreline (West Pass to Cape St. George) was inclined towards accretion over the long-term. The eastern segment on the other\n113\n\n\fhand, displayed a consistent pattern of long-term retreat. Results of the effect of coastal orientation on shoreline movement over the long-term agreed with prior studies conducted along the Gulf of Mexico (Walton, 1973; Donoghue and Tanner, 1994; Kish and Donoghue, 2013). According to Donoghue and Tanner, (1994), storm waves and winds tend to come from the southeast in this region of the U.S. Gulf coast. Therefore, shorelines with a southeast-facing orientation are generally prone to erosion as opposed to coastlines with a southwest-facing orientation.\nShoreline change data along Little St. George Island indicated an increase in the spatial extent of erosion over the short-term. The accelerated rates of erosion on both segments of the island appeared to be directly related to the passages of three major hurricanes and nine less intense tropical systems over the 1995 to 2013 interval. A time series plot (Figure 4.13) of three representative transects (150, 180, 200) acquired along the southwestern segment of the island revealed that significant erosion occurred with the passage of tropical storm Bonnie (2004), which directly impacted this section of the island (Fig. 4.4). Following Bonnie's passage, five tropical storm systems and one major hurricane passed within 140 km of Little St. George Island over the next nine years. The cumulative effects of those storm systems and their frequent occurrence accelerated shoreline retreat along the island.\nIn addition to the effects of storms over the short term, dredging of the inlet at Sikes Cut magnified the erosive signature along the eastern segment of the island. The engineering activities that occurred over the 1995 to 2013 period by the US Army Corps of Engineers worked to amplify erosion on downdrift shorelines. A time series plot of representative transects along the eastern segment of Little St. George Island (Figure 4.14) indicated major shoreline erosion between the period 2005 to 2007. The last time the inlet was dredged was in 2007 (FDEP, 2008). Given that the overall direction of littoral transport along the open coast of Little St George Island is generally from east to west, the data indicate that shoreline retreat increased markedly following maintenance dredging of the inlet. The elevated rates of retreat along Little St George Island over the short-term demonstrated that the observed signal of shoreline change significantly exceeded any effects due to natural variability.\n114\n\n\fNorthern Merritt Island Along Northern Merritt Island, natural changes in the coastal system coupled with\nanthropogenic modifications have influenced shoreline evolution. Alongshore rates of change were highly variable, resulting in an alternating pattern of erosion and accretion. Long-term rates of shoreline movement demonstrated that the majority of the island's coastline remained relatively stable over the long term, 1873-2013. Over the short term, increased storminess resulted in a higher percentage of the shoreline undergoing retreat. However, the island-wide signal of shoreline change over the period of enhanced storminess (1995-2013), was dominated by shoreline advance. The noticeable stability of the shoreline in this locale appeared to coincide with increased structural armoring and beach nourishments that occurred over the short term, as tourism-related island development increased (USACE, 1998).\nTidal inlet dynamics along the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island resulted in significant shoreline fluctuations, especially along the southern portion of Ponce de Leon inlet. However, the erosive signature diminished with increasing downdrift distance away from the inlet, over both time scales evaluated.\nEffect of Nearshore Bathymetry The shoreline change trends observed in this study raise the possibility that nearshore\nmorphology wielded some influence on shoreline behavior. In the case of Little St. George Island, the data revealed a strong connection between offshore bathymetry and shoreline variability. Figure 4.2 details the extensive nearshore shoal system at the intersection of the western and eastern island segments. Although the observed changes in shoreline movement were accelerated by storms, the data reveal that the recent period of storminess did not produce significant overwash deposits on either segment of the island. As a result, movement of the landwater interface along Little St. George Island may also be due to lateral sediment transport. Over the short-term, the patterns of shoreline change demonstrate an increase in the spatial extent of erosion along the southwestern portion of the island. Based on the westerly direction of littoral movement, sediment may have bypassed the West Pass inlet and accumulated offshore in shoals on both sides of the inlet. The network of shoals appear to have moderated the storm-wave energy into this area as the shoreline in the immediate vicinity of West Pass inlet (transects 0-35)\n115\n\n\fprograded. However, with increasing distance away from the shoals, shoreline erosion dominated towards Cape St. George (Figure 4.8).\nAlong the barrier complex of Northern Merritt Island, the presence of offshore bathymetric features also contributed to the shoreline change patterns observed. Off the coast of Zone 2 in the vicinity of the Ponce de Leon inlet, the large ebb delta may have enhanced the erosional pattern along the southern portion of the inlet zone as seen in Fig. 4.9, before reverting to accretion in Zone 3. As detailed by Browder and Dean (2000), the prevalence of ebb deltas in close proximity to inlets intensify erosion in these areas, as well as along downdrift shorelines by altering the net direction of sediment transport.\nShoreline Forecasting Future estimates of climate change suggest increased storminess and elevated rates of sea\nlevel rise (Elsner et al., 2008; Strauss et al., 2012; Tebaldi et al., 2012; IPCC 2014). As such, the ability to provide a quantitative estimate of future shoreline position is imperative to aid mitigation and adaptation strategies. This study employed the recently developed \"ambur.forecast\" function within the AMBUR methodology to provide a visual and quantitative estimate of future shoreline positions along both study areas to the end of this century. Figure 4.15 reveals an estimate of the future shoreline position along Little St. George Island to the year 2100. This estimate was based on current trends and the introduction of two major (Cat. 3-5) storms per decade to the year 2100. The approximate position of the future shoreline indicates that, if left unaltered by human modification, the shoreline along Little St. George would naturally retreat further landward by approximately 50 meters from its most recent shoreline position. This represents a rate of retreat on the order of -0.6 m/yr.\nIn the case of Northern Merritt Island, the estimate of future shoreline position (Figure 4.16) to the year 2100 showed an overall island-wide seaward advance. The future shoreline indicates that the segment surrounding the inlet zone reveals a more pronounced cyclicity between erosion and accretion. The forecast further demonstrates that the remainder of the island's shoreline on both sides of the inlet will be dominated by accretion. The portion of the island to the north of the inlet reveals an average rate of advance over the next century of 0.98 m/yr. The shoreline to the south of the inlet shows an increased rate of accretion, 2.76 m/yr. The future rates of seaward advance along the coastline of Northern Merritt Island are promising,\n116\n\n\findicating decreased coastal land loss over the long-term. However, previous studies have noted that rates of shoreline change along areas that have been the recipient of nourishment projects and other engineered projects tend to distort shoreline change statistics (Hapke et al., 2011, Jackson, 2004). With Northern Merritt Island having been the recipient of several nourishment projects (USACE, 1998), care should be taken among the coastal management community when using the quantitative estimates of shoreline position provided in this study.\nAlong both study areas, portions of the shoreline were designated as protected (state parks) and thus only minimally influenced by humans. Little St. George Island remains a pristine environment with an absence of infrastructural development. As such, trends in shoreline change revealed the coastline's natural variability with distinct cycles of erosion and accretion. If left unaltered, the possibility exists that, with a sufficient supply of sediment from the Apalachicola River, quasi-equilibrium conditions can be achieved and the shoreline may even accrete seaward over the long term. In the case of the barrier island complex along Northern Merritt Island, this investigation revealed the persistence of a zone of erosion along the undeveloped Northern Peninsula State Recreation Area through varying time scales. As opposed to the rest of the island, this segment has not been the beneficiary of nourishment projects or shoreline-protection structures. As a result, the area has maintained its natural erosive signature with an average rate of erosion of -3 m/yr. It is imperative when predicting future shoreline positions that rates of shoreline movement along undeveloped areas and not only those influenced by human activities be incorporated into the analysis (Hapke et al., 2011; Thieler et al., 2013).\nConclusion This investigation revealed historical trends of coastal evolution along developed and undeveloped sandy barrier island segments on a scale of tens of kilometers. As such, this study enhances the database of historical shorelines over which shoreline change has been quantified along the northwest and eastern Florida coasts. The shoreline data revealed elevated rates of erosion along Little St. George Island and a relatively stable shoreline dominated by accretion along the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island. Quantification of shoreline movement along both study areas demonstrated that barrier island morphology is altered primarily by storm impact. A cluster of closely spaced storms over the short term had a dramatic impact on the morphology of the islands and enhanced the erosive signature along both areas.\n117\n\n\fOther variables such as inlet dynamics, nearshore bathymetry, shoreline orientation and the extent of coastal development were also found to be significant drivers of coastal change.\nBased on the modeled estimates of change obtained from this study coastal managers should expect approximately 0.6 m/yr of shoreline retreat along Little St. George Island to the end of this century. Despite the relative stability of the shoreline along Northern Merritt Island, increases in storminess have the potential to modify the coastal equilibrium in this locale. The area surrounding the inlet will be most affected due to the consistent removal and re-dispersal of sediment. The estimated rate of long-term change to the year 2100 is predicted to be approximately 0.3 m/yr along the entire shoreline. However, if dredging projects continue to remove and redistribute offshore material in the vicinity of the inlet, the coastal system will be significantly affected by storm impact.\n118\n\n\fTable 4.1.

In direct contrast, the western portion of the island (West Pass to Cape St. George) is entirely accretive. Transect no. 182, in the vicinity of Cape St. George acts as an inflection point between the processes of erosion and accretion. Transects are spaced 100 meters apart.\n130\n\n\fFigure 4.7.

Zone 1 includes transects 1 through 1494, which are located to the northwest of Ponce de Leon Inlet. Zone 2 includes transects 1495 to 1799, adjacent to the inlet. Zone 3 consists of transects 1800 through 2800 which are located on the downdrift shoreline, southeast of the inlet. The locale around Zone 2 (transects 1495 \u00ad 1799) is highlighted in the main figure to emphasize the sharp transition from accretion to erosion at the Ponce de Leon Inlet. Transects are spaced 100 meters apart.\n133\n\n\fFigure 4.10.

The figure reveals significant shoreline retreat around the year 1980. Over the period 1979 to 1994, approximately 3 million cubic yards of material were removed from the inlet as a result of dredging and inlet maintenance and contributed to the erosion observed southeast of the inlet at Zone 2. The datum for the y-axis is the onshore baseline.\n135\n\n\fFigure 4.12. Shoreline change rates over the storm-influenced short-term interval (1995-2013). The locale around Zone 2 (transects 1495 \u00ad 1799) is highlighted to emphasize the contrast between erosion and accretion in the vicinity of the Ponce de Leon Inlet. Note that the spatial extent of erosion has increased to the southern portion of Zone 1, immediately north of the inlet. Further, the influence of storms over the short-term has also increased the rate of erosion. Transects are spaced 100 meters apart.\n136\n\n\fFigure 4.13.

The datum for the y-axis is the onshore baseline.\n137\n\n\fFigure 4.14.

The datum for the y-axis is the onshore baseline.\n138\n\n\fFigure 4.15. An estimate of the future shoreline position to the year 2100 based on current trends of shoreline movement along Little St. George Island. This End Point Rate (EPR) estimate of the shoreline indicates a landward regression of approximately 50 meters from its most recently mapped (2013) shoreline position. This represents a mean rate of retreat of approximately -0.6 m/yr. Source of base figure: Google Earth Imagery.\n139\n\n\fFigure 4.16. Forecast future shoreline position along the barrier island complex of Northern Merritt Island for the year 2100 shows an overall island-long seaward advance. The forecast indicates that the segment immediately surrounding the inlet zone (Zone 2) is dominated by erosion to the north of the inlet and accretion south of the inlet. The remainder of the island's shoreline on both sides of the inlet is dominated by accretion. On average, the portion of the island north of the inlet (Zone 1) is projected to undergo a mean rate of advance of 0.98 m/yr over the next century, while the zone to the south (Zone 3) of the inlet is projected to accrete at a mean rate of 2.76 m/yr.\nSource of base figure: Google Earth Imagery.\n140\n\n\fAPPENDIX A\nSUMMARY OF PREVIOUS METHODS USED TO MODEL SHORELINE CHANGE\nThe Bruun Rule One of the most widely known models used for predicting shoreline change on sandy coasts\ndue to rising sea-level was developed by Bruun (1962, 1988). This model, often referred to as the \"Bruun Rule\", considers the two-dimensional shoreline response of the beach face to an increase in sea level, but ignores other important forcing agents such as storms and longshore sediment transport. The Bruun Rule assumes that the beach profile will return to an equilibrium shape following the removal of material (sediment) onto the adjacent shoreface or inner shelf due to an increase in sea level (Bruun, 1962; Schwartz and Fisher, 1980). Some additional assumptions of this model relevant to shoreline change include the landward evolution of the beach profile as the upper portion of the beach undergoes erosion. Also, the material eroded from the upper beach is assumed to be transported offshore and deposited in such a manner that there is equity in the volume of sediment eroded and deposited (Bruun, 1988). Mathematically, the model is depicted as:\nR = (L* / B + h*) S\nwhere R is the horizontal retreat of the shore, h* is the depth of closure or depth beyond which sediment exchange between the shore face and inner shelf is assumed to be minimal, B is the height of the berm, L* is the distance from the initial shoreline to closure depth, and S is the vertical rise in sea level.\nResearch has identified fundamental ambiguities associated with use of the Bruun Rule in predicting coastal recession (Dean, 1991; Ranasinghe, Callaghan and Stive, 2012). Studies conducted at various field sites have revealed that Bruun's assumption of profile equilibrium as sea level rises is almost impossible to achieve (Riggs, Cleary and Snyder, 1995). Additionally, the Bruun Rule neglects the dynamics of alongshore sediment transport within the coastal environment as well as the physical processes (wave height, wave energy) that contribute to the erosion of shorelines (Ranasinghe et al., 2012). These limitations make continued use of the Bruun Rule by managers in a variety of settings highly questionable.\n141\n\n\fShoreline Translation Model (STM) Cowell, Roy and Jones (1992) developed the Shoreline Translation Model (STM), which\nbuilt on some of the fundamental assumptions of the Bruun Rule. The STM incorporates several parameters that characterize the influence of the geological framework into sea-level rise driven shoreline change for barrier island environments. One of the highlights of the STM is that it's a mass-conserving, morphological-behavior model that allows for the incorporation of additional parameters for assessing shoreline evolution over time. The model provides added generality to the Bruun Rule by allowing for open sediment budgets on the shoreface, and time-dependent changes in shoreface and barrier geometries as well as balanced sediment budgets (sediment gains and losses) on gently sloping surfaces (Cowell et al., 2003).\nGeomorphic Model of Barrier, Estuarine and Shoreface Translations (GEOMBEST) Stolper et al., (2005) developed a geomorphic shoreline change model, GEOMBEST, to\nexplore the effects of variations in alongshore sediment transport near low-lying barrier islands. The model's output describes the evolution of barrier island morphology and stratigraphy resulting from fluctuations in sea level and sediment supply. GEOMBEST provides insight into barrier island response over decades-centuries time scales based on a range of factors: substrate composition, shoreface depth, substrate erodibility and shoreface geometry (Moore et al., 2010). GEOMBEST differs from models that rely on profile equilibrium such as the Bruun Rule and STM. It considers the disequilibrium found on some shorefaces and the resulting vertical profile displacement that result from changes in sea-level. This quality enables GEOMBEST to more accurately reflect the geological framework when simulating quantitative prediction of shoreline change (Moore et al., 2010).\nModel of Complex Coastal Systems The Model of Complex Coastal Systems (MoCCS) is a multi-dimensional model capable\nof simulating future morphologic coastal change (Donoghue et al., 2012). The MoCCS model is an enhancement of the earlier Coastal Systems Tract (CST-ASMITA) model (Niedoroda et al., 2003; Fagherazzi et al., 2004). The model consists of slowly changing forcing parameters such as sediment supply, sea level, winds and wave-current forces. Rapid changes in coastal morphology due to extreme events are also included within the model's regime and represent\n142\n\n\ftransient effects (Donoghue et al., 2012). The model is based upon a non-linear interaction between varying components of the coastal system and suggests that individual components should not be represented in isolation (Niedoroda et al., 1995, Cowell et al., 2003). Instead, the model output incorporates the diverse set of components within a coastal system. The model's strength lies in its ability to predict large-scale coastal morphologic change with high statistical reliability, based on future scenarios of SLR, winds and storm surge.\nSingle Transect Method One of the most widely used techniques of quantifying shoreline change is the Single-\nTransect (ST) method. Previous studies (Norcross, Fletcher and Merrifield, 2002; Hapke and Reid, 2007) have utilized the ST method to obtain shoreline change rates from a time series of historical shoreline positions. The Single-Transect method has also been employed in recent studies (Fletcher et al., 2003; Genz et al. 2007) to compute a shoreline change rate at each shoreline transect by using the statistical methods of end point rate (EPR) and weighted least-squares linear regression (WLSR). Essentially, the ST method calculates a shoreline movement rate at each transect by fitting a line to a plot of cross-shore distance versus time. An inherent advantage of the ST technique is that it takes into consideration the total positional uncertainty (errors) at each historical shoreline position, excludes data outliers and plots a trend line to the time series of historical shoreline positions (Fletcher et al., 2003; Genz et al. 2007). However, recent research has revealed a number of limitations with the ST method (Frazer, et al., 2010). The ST technique models shoreline change independently at each transect and incorporates data outliers, resulting in an overall uncertainty and variability in future shoreline positions (Frazer et al., 2010, Romine and Fletcher, 2012). In theory, adjacent transects should tell a similar story about the shoreline change occurring at a beach since neighboring transects along the length of a beach share sediment in the alongshore direction (Frazer, et al. 2010).\n143\n\n\fAPPENDIX B\nSAMPLE AMBUR \"R\" STATISTICAL CODE (LITTLE ST.

He attended the San Fernando T.M.L primary school, San Fernando Central and San Fernando West Secondary high schools. Ravi completed his Advanced-level education in April of 2000 from the Marabella Senior Comprehensive School.\nHe received his Bachelor of Science in Physics and Environmental Physics (First Class Honors--Summa Cum Laude) from the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad in the spring of 2005. He received his Masters of Science in Geology in Spring 2009 from the Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA while under a Fulbright Scholarship. The focus of his Masters research was the dynamics of mantle flow around triple junctions. His advisor was Dr. Jennifer Georgen.\nIn the Fall of 2011, Ravi returned to the Florida State University to pursue doctoral studies in the field of coastal geology under the direction of Dr. Joseph Donoghue and Dr. Stephen Kish. He served as the head teaching assistant for the Dynamic Earth Laboratory (GLY 1000L) while enrolled in his Ph.D. studies at Florida State University.\nHis current list of publications includes:\nSankar, R.D, Kish, S., and Donoghue, J.F.
