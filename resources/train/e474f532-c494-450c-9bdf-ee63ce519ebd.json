The typical sequential events of a CD8 + T cell response include proliferation of antigen-specific na\u00efve CD8 + T cells post-antigenic challenge to generate sufficient number of effector cells, eliminate antigenexpressing target cells, and differentiate into long-lived memory CD8 + T cells (1, 2) . At each stage of differentiation, CD8\n+ T cells gain different functions from cytokine production to cytotoxicity in effector cells and properties of rapid responsibility and longevity in memory cells (3) (4) (5) . The foundation of differentiation is the ability of activation-induced cell cycle progression, which requires precise chromatin modifications in a timely fashion at specific gene loci through concerted efforts of multiple chromatin modifiers (6, 7) . How these sequential events are coordinated at the chromatin level in CD8 + T cells during activation have just begun to be understood.\nThe cell division cycle is directly controlled by both positive regulators (cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdks) and negative regulators (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, Cdkn). Two families of Cdkns are active in resting T cells. The inhibitors of CDK4 family, including Cdkn2a [p16 and alternative reading frames (Arf)], Cdkn2b (p15), Cdkn2c (p18), and Cdkn2d (p19), and the Cip/Kip family, including Cdkn1a (p21), Cdkn1b (p27), and Cdkn1c (p57), play an essential role in maintaining the G0/ G1 phase during T cell development, differentiation, and function (8, 9) . Studies of individual Cdk inhibitor using genetically modified mice model reveal their distinct roles in T cell development and differentiation. Cdkn2a-deficient mice have thymic hyperplasia and increased peripheral T cell proliferation whereas increased expression of Cdkn2a leads to arrest of thymocyte development at DN3 stage (10, 11) . However, deletion of the alternative reading frames (Arf) of Cdkn2a in mice does not affect cell proliferation but enhance apoptosis of dividing cells (12) . Cdkn1c regulates cell division and is also involved in the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway (13, 14) . Less is known about the upstream events of the epigenetic regulation of these cell cycle regulators during CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation.\nEzh2 is a methyltransferase that catalyzes trimethylation of Lys-27 on H3 (H3K27me3) and is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex-2 (15) (16) (17) . Ezh2 is involved in important development processes such as X chromosome imprinting, early embryonic development, and multipotent progenitor's fate (15) (16) (17) . Ezh2 plays critical roles in T cell differentiation and function (18, 19) . Ezh2 was first reported to interact with Vav1 of TCR signaling via actin polymerization-dependent processes (20) . Ezh2 is also capable of positively regulating cytokine expression during CD4 + T cell differentiation (21) (22) (23) and has been implicated in Treg cell differentiation through repressing corresponding transcription factors (24, 25) . Another important phenotype of Ezh2-deficient T cells is enhanced T cells apoptosis during immune response (26, 27) . More recently, it has been demonstrated that Ezh2 maintains the fate of terminal effector CD8 + T cells by repressing the pro-memory gene sets (28) . Although it is reported that Ezh2 regulates Cdkn2a and Cdkn1c loci in tumor cell lines (29, 30) , the involvement of Ezh2 in activation induced CD8 + T cell cycle progression and apoptosis has not been fully characterized.\nHere, we focused on the cell cycle progression and apoptotic events during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation using two T cellspecific Ezh2 knockout models (Cd4Cre as a stable deletion and GzmbCre as an activation-induced deletion) and direct monitoring of na\u00efve CD8 + T cell divisions using long-term live imaging. We found that stable deletion of Ezh2 (Ezh2 fl/fl Cd4Cre + ) had both impaired proliferation and enhanced apoptosis whereas activation-induced deletion of Ezh2 (Ezh2 fl/fl GzmbCre + ) was only impaired in proliferation but not apoptosis. At the gene level, Ezh2 repressed Cdkn2a (p16 and Arf) and Cdkn1c (p57), both of which are essential for naive CD8\n+ T cells entering cell cycle post-activation. Furthermore, in the absence of Ezh2, naive CD8 + T cells exhibited a substantial delay of cell cycle completion in response to antigen stimulation."}, {"section_title": "MaTerials anD MeThODs animals and cells", "text": "Ezh2 (Ezh2 fl/fl ) mice were generated as described (20) and obtained from MMRRC repository.

We then analyzed the cell cycle progression after activation using the BrdU incorporation assay and found that Ezh2-deficient CD8 + T cells were fewer in S-phase but more in G0/G1 phase compared to WT cells (Figures 3C,D) .

After stimulation, additional alteration in proliferation, cytokines and chemokines, histone-related biological processes was observed ( Figure 4B ). This indicates that Ezh2 deficiency affects a wide range of molecular and cellular function of na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells in a temporal manner (Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material).\nWe then focused on apoptosis and cell cycle related genes which may explain the cellular defects we observed in the Ezh2-c-KO mice. Among 335 increased apoptosis related genes found in Ezh2-c-KO mice, 99 were detected in freshly isolated na\u00efve CD8 + T cells (Figures 4B,C) . As Ezh2 deletion occurs during T cell development in thymus in the Ezh2-c-KO mice, mature na\u00efve CD8 + T cells in periphery had already carried these defects and activation further exuberated the apoptosis process. In contrast, the expression of most cell cycle checkpoint genes were not significantly different between Ezh2-deficient and WT na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells but several cycle checkpoint genes including Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b were significantly increased after 72 h postactivation in Ezh2-deficient CD8 + T cells compared to WT CD8 + T cells (Figures 4B,C) . Together, the transcriptome analysis provides evidence of altered gene expressions that is responsible for activation-induced increased apoptosis and cell cycle defects in the absence of Ezh2.\nezh2 regulates h3K27me3 of Cdkn1c and Cdkn2a locus\nTo understand how early the changes in expression of cell cycle related-genes happens in the absence of Ezh2, we included four additional early time points (1, 2, 4, and 8 h after stimulation) during the course of 72 h after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. Ezh2 mRNA levels were increased at 8 h, peaked around 48-72 h after stimulation ( Figure 5A ). We then compared expressions of 12\nFigure 2 | Continued cell-cycle regulators and found that Cdkn1c (p57) was dramatically increased at 2 h and peaked at 4 h (>2-folds higher in Ezh2-deficient CD8 + T cells than in WT CD8 + T cells) after stimulation ( Figure 5A \n+ T cells compared to WT na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from 8 to 72 h after stimulation ( Figure 5A ). Cdkn2b (p15) was also expressed higher in Ezh2 deficient than in WT na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from 8 to 16 h ( Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). However, we did not find significant differences in gene expressions of either cell cycle activators such as Ccnd2, Ccnd3, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, E2F1, c-Myc, and Gadd45a or cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn1b (p27) between Ezh2-deficient and WT CD8 + T cells of Figure S3 in Supplementary Material. Together, these findings show that Ezh2 may regulate expression of Cdkn1c, Cdkn2aV1 (Arf), and Cdkn2aV2 (p16) in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells. To further determine whether the enhanced expressions of Cdkn1c, Cdkn2aV1 (Arf) and Cdkn2aV2 (p16) were the consequence of loss of Ezh2, we analyzed H3K27me3 in these genomic loci using ChIP assay. We found that H3K27me3 was present in the promoter region of Cdkn1c locus (Figures 5B,C) . The H3K27me3 occupancy was higher at the promoter region of exon 1a, but not exon 1b (Figures 5D,E) which indicates that na\u00efve CD8 + T cells activation induce more repression of Cdkn2aV1 rather than repressing Cdkn2aV2. These data suggest that Ezh2-mediated H3K27me3 regulates Cdkn1c, Cdkn2aV1 (Arf), and Cdkn2aV2 (p16) expressions during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation.\nimmediate Deletion of ezh2 affects activation-induced cell cycle but not apoptosis in cD8 + T cell Ezh2-g-KO and WT (Ezh2 fl/fl GzmbCre \u2212 ) mice were infected with LM-OVA, and OVA-specific CD8 + T cells were measured at day 7 after immunization. Comparable to the Ezh2-c-KO mice, Ezh2-g-KO mice also showed a marked defect in CD8 + T cell differentiation after LM-OVA infection in vivo (Figures 6A,B) . However, unlike Ezh2-c-KO mice, CD8\n+ T cells of Ezh2-g-KO mice had comparable percentages of live, apoptosis, and dead cells with CD8 + T cells of WT mice after in vitro stimulation (Figures 6C,D) and total live cells ( Figure 6E) . In contrast, we observed significantly decreased percentage of cells in S-phase and more in G0/G1 phase in na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells of Ezh2-g-KO mice compared to that of WT (Figures 6F,G) . Together, these findings indicate that regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis by Ezh2 are temporally separated events and loss of Ezh2 first affects cell cycle progression in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells. To determine whether altered transcriptional changes of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis related genes in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells observed from Ezh2-c-KO mice were also found in the Ezh2-g-KO mice, we sorted activated na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from WT or Ezh2-g-KO mice into undivided and highly divided (more than three divisions) populations after 72 h of stimulation (anti-CD3/ CD28) in vitro to allow GzmbCre expression ( Figure 7A) . We found that both undivided and high divided na\u00efve CD8 + T cells showed significantly decreased Ezh2 levels from Ezh2-g-KO compared to the WT mice ( Figure 7B) . Furthermore, expression of Cdkn2aV1 and Cdkn2aV2 were significantly increased, but no change in expression of Cdkn1c and apoptotic related genes could be observed in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO compared to that from WT mice (Figures 7C,D) ."}, {"section_title": "na\u00efve cD8", "text": "+ T cells Take longer to complete cell Division in response to activation after ezh2 Deletion\nThe increased G0/G1 and reduced S phase of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice suggested that immediate deletion of + T cells from WT or Ezh2-g-KO were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 48 h, and BrdU was added into culture for 1 h before harvest. Cell cycle was analyzed [representative in (F)] and percentages were summarized in (g) (3 repeats with 3 mice each time).\nEzh2 altered activation-induced cell cycle. To directly test this, we developed a method to track na\u00efve CD8 + T cell division after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in real-time using live cell imaging (Videos S1-S3 in Supplementary Material). We used 2.0 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm silicone inserts to culture activated na\u00efve CD8 + T cells and imaged the entire area of cultured cells to efficiently track the motile cells ( Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). We found that the first division of WT CD8 + T cells occurred at an average of 28.4 h (ranging from 23.6 to 33.4 h) after stimulation, which was little faster than that reported for CD4 + T cells using CFSE assay (32, 33) . Na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-c-KO mice had a significantly slower first cell division (44.7 \u00b1 3.1 h) than that of WT mice (28.4 \u00b1 0.9 h). The first cell division time of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice was also slower (mean 30.6 h, range from 24.1 to 36.8 h) than WT mice (Figures 8A,B) . Using live imaging, we could also observe the second round of cell division. Interestingly, the average time for second division of WT CD8 + T cells was 8.7 h (ranging from 5.8 to 11.7 h) (Figure 8C) , which was also faster than the reported 10 h (ranging from 6 to 12 h) in CD4 + T cells (32, 33) . Again, the average time of second division of CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice was 11.9 h (range from 8.8 to 26.3 h) and from Ezh2-c-KO mice was 20 h (Figure 8C) . Because we detected lower Ezh2 mRNA ( Figure 7B ) and the division time of some CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice had similar time as that of CD8 + T cells from WT mice, we suspected that the complete deletion of Ezh2 in Ezh2-g-KO mice may not have occurred. We further performed single cell genotyping of Ezh2 in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells of these mice after in vitro stimulation and found that Ezh2 was completely deleted in 28.3% cells, deletion of one allele happened in 17% of cells, and the remaining 54.7% of cells had no deletion (Figure 8D) . Thus, the delay of cell cycle completion would have been more severe had the deletion taken place in those 54.7% cells of the Ezh2-g-KO mice. Taken together, we tracked highly motile CD8 + T cells through their division events in real time after activation and demonstrated the precise time delay of cell cycle in Ezh2 deleted na\u00efve CD8 + T cells."}, {"section_title": "DiscussiOn", "text": "Ezh2 catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation to repress genes involving multiple critical biological processes in development and differentiation of T cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the role of Ezh2 in regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis are two temporally separable events during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation. Na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from spleen of Ezh2-c-KO mice had altered expression of cell cycle and apoptosis related genes prior to activation (Figure 4) and display cell cycle defects and increased apoptosis after in vitro and in vivo activation. However, if the deletion of Ezh2 in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells occurred only after activation in the Ezh2-g-KO mice, only cell cycle defect but no increase apoptosis could be observed in these activated na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells. This shows that cell cycle regulators (Cdkns) are more sensitive to the loss of Ezh2 than apoptosis related genes, and Ezh2 plays a critical role in repressing the expression of Cdkn genes during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation-induced proliferation. Expression of cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkns is tightly regulated in T cells (9) . Here we show that loss of Ezh2 resulted in altered expression of several key cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors including Cdkn2a (p16 and Arf) and Cdkn1c (p57) in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells after activation, which explained the cell cycle impairment of Ezh2-deficient na\u00efve CD8 + T cells in response to antigenic stimulation. However, loss of Ezh2 had limited impact on other key Cdkns including Cdkn2c (p18), Cdkn2d (p19), Cdkn1a (p21), Cdkn2b (p15), and Cdkn1b (p27) ( Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). In addition, a dramatic increase (70-fold) in expression of Cdkn1c (p57) in Ezh2 deficient na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells after 4 h stimulation also contributed to p53 mediated apoptosis pathway (8, 9) and increased apoptosis along with alteration of apoptosisrelated genes. These findings provide evidence of the regulatory role of Ezh2 in cell cycle inhibitors and apoptosis related gene expression via modification of H3K27me3 levels at these loci. Loss of Ezh2 during thymocyte development resulted in apparent alteration of gene expression observed in freshly isolated and 16 h stimulated na\u00efve CD8 T cells. But this transcriptional difference became less obvious at 72 h stimulation probably reflecting the selection of those less damaged dividing cells. However, in addition to the direct effects of Ezh2, the impairment of cell cycle progression of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells over the course (several days) of analysis after stimulation in the absence of Ezh2 could also be secondary effects resulting from the defects of gene expression regulators controlled by Ezh2. Thus, it was necessary to dissect the direct and indirect effects of Ezh2 in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation.\nApplying GzmbCre-mediated Ezh2 deletion allowed us to examine the early effects of losing Ezh2 in na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells and differentiated cell cycle defects from apoptosis. Several reasons could explain the less severe defects observed in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice compared to na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-c-KO mice. First, it takes time for the effect of Cre-mediated Ezh2 deletion to be observed phenotypically. Ezh2 deletion occurred in thymocyte development in Ezh2-c-KO mice whereas after activation of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells of Ezh2-g-KO mice. The different degree of impairments reflects the degree of cumulated defects in the absence of Ezh2. Second, deletion of Ezh2 was completed in CD8 + T cells of Ezh2-c KO, whereas we observed various degree of deletion of Ezh2 in stimulated na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from Ezh2-g-KO mice by single cell genotyping. Less than half (45%) of activated na\u00efve CD8 + T cells had complete and one allele deletion of Ezh2, indicating that the impact of activation-induced immediate deletion of Ezh2 in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells of Ezh2-g-KO mice could have been more severe if it were feasible to remove cells containing the undeleted Ezh2 loci from the analysis. Together, these findings show the sensitiveness of Ezh2 in processes involved inactivation-induced na\u00efve CD8 + T cell proliferation.\nThe importance of cell division for T cell function during an infection is apparent yet the precise time required for the resting na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells completing first and subsequent cell cycle has not been directly measured. Previous methods calculates indirectly estimated the average cell division time based on the dilution of cell division tracking dye (32) (33) (34) . In this study, we used live imaging to record cell divisions of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from WT, Ezh2-c-KO, and Ezh2-g-KO mice in response to in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28. To increase our efficiency of tracking motile T cells and their subsequent divisions over a long period of time, we cultured stimulated T cells in silicone inserts and imaged the entire chamber. The seeding number of cells was also optimized to accommodate their growth over the course of 72 h. With these optimizations in place, we directly observed several cells that underwent first and second round of divisions in response to stimulation. The average time for na\u00efve CD8 + T cells to complete the first division was approximately 28 h. The deletion of Ezh2 in na\u00efve CD8\n+ T cells resulted in significant delay of the first cell cycle completion. Although the subsequent second cell division took approximately one-third of time (8.5 h) in WT mice, the time of second cell division was further delayed in both Ezh2 KO mice. These observations reflect the cumulative defects in the absence of Ezh2. The live imaging setup can also track the localization and dynamics of specific fluorophore-tagged proteins and can serve as a crucial tool for understanding role of key regulators in cell division. In conclusion, our findings reveal a critical role of Ezh2 in regulation of cell cycle during na\u00efve CD8 + T cell activation by establishing a repressing state of Cdkn2a and Cdkn1c."}, {"section_title": "eThics sTaTeMenT", "text": "This study protocol was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute on Aging and approved by the Institutional Review Board.
