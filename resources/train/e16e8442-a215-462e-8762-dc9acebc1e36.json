[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report examines the relationship between high school academic curricula and students' persistence path through college, approximately 3 years after first enrolling. Data are from the 1995-1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students Survey, a longitudinal study of beginning postsecondary students who first enrolled in a four-year college in 1995-1996. Measures of high school academic preparation are based on academic courses taken in high school as reported by students on their college entrance examination applications. Approximately one-third of the students reported completing course work no higher than core curricula. One-half reported completing mid-level curricula, and the remaining one-fifth completed rigorous curricula. As of 1998, roughly two-thirds of students who had first enrolled in a four-year college in 1995-1996 were still enrolled in the same college. One-fifth had transferred to another institution, and 13% had left and not returned. The level of college students' high school curriculum was strongly related to their persistence in postsecondary education. This was true both for maintaining enrollment at their initial institution and, if they transferred, staying on track to a bachelor's degree. The difference between levels of academic curricula was especially notable with respect to staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Findings demonstrate a consistent advantage experienced by students who completed rigorous high school curricula, and to a lesser extent, by those competing mid-level curricula, over their peers completing core curricula or lower. However, the level of high school curricula students reported completing was also related to their family background characteristics and indicators of socioeconomic status. Two appendixes contain a glossary and technical notes. (Contains 14 tables, 10 figures, and 16 references.) (SLD) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document. The level of high school academic curriculum completed by beginning 4-year college students was associated with their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and also with the economic status of the student body in their high schools. Specifically, students from low-income families, students whose parents had no more than a high school education, and students who graduated from high schools in which 25 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches were less likely than their more advantaged counterparts to report completing rigorous high school curricula. Related in part to family income, racial/ethnic group differences also were apparent.

Asian/Pacific Islander students were the most likely to complete rigorous curricula (31 percent). While it appears as though White students were more likely than Hispanic students to complete rigorous curricula (20 percent versus 16 percent) and less likely to complete no higher than core curricula (29 percent versus 34 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion. High school academic curriculum also had an obvious association with where students first enrolled in college. As the level of curricula increased, so did students' likelihood of attending selective 4-year colleges or universities.3 For example, 71 percent of students who completed rigorous curricula enrolled in a selective college or university, compared with 40 percent who completed mid-level curricula and 32 percent who completed core curricula or lower."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Persistence 3 Years After Enrolling", "text": "As of 1998, roughly two-thirds of students who had first enrolled in a .4-year college in 1995-96 were still enrolled in the same college (including 6 percent who had left and returned; figure B).

The difference between levels of academic curricula was especially notable with respect to staying on track to a bachelor's degree (i.e., continuous enrollment in any 4-year institution). As the level of academic curricula increased, so did the proportion of undergraduates who stayed on track (figure D). As of 1998, the vast majority (87 percent) of those who had participated in rigorous high school academic curricula were still on track to a bachelor's degree, compared with 71 percent of those in mid-level curricula, and 62 percent of those who completed core curricula or lower. Correspondingly, the proportion of those who had left postsecondary education and did not return declined with each successive level of academic curriculum (from 17 percent to 10 percent to 4 percent). Figure C.Percentage distribution of 1995-96 beginning students' 1998 enrollment status in their first institution for those who began in a 4-year institution, by high school academic curriculum \n\nWith respect to students' background characteristics, there were no gender or racial/ethnic differences in the rates of persistence at first institution, but the same was not true for staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Prior to controlling for GPA, women were more likely than men to stay on track, but differences by race/ethnicity were not significant. After controlling for GPA, the gender difference disappeared, but Hispanic students' rate of staying on track was higher than that of White students. It is not clear why differences by gender and race/ethnicity should not have been the same for both measures of persistence (i.e., institutional retention and bachelor's degree persistence track). The findings of this study demonstrated a consistent advantage experienced by students who completed rigorous high school curriculaand to a lesser extent by those completing midlevel academic curriculaover their peers in core curricula or lower. Those who completed rigorous curricula were more likely to stay enrolled in their first institution or, if they transferred, to stay on track to a bachelor's degree. It stands to reason that the level of coursework completed by students in high school would be associated in part with their early education and opportunities to take advanced coursework. In this study, students from low-income families, those whose parents attained no higher than a high school education, and those who attended high schools in which a large proportion of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches all were less likely to have completed a rigorous high school academic curriculum than their more advantaged counterparts. It also stands to reason that students who complete a rigorous curriculum would score higher on their college entrance exams, enroll in more selective colleges and universities, and earn higher grades in their first year of college. All of these associations were demonstrated in this study. Yet, once all such related variables were taken into consideration, high school academic curriculum continued to play a role in how well students persisted toward their college degree. For both measures of persistencestaying continuously enrolled in the same institution (institutional retention) and staying on track to a bachelor's degree if they transferredstudents who completed a rigorous high school curriculum did better than those who completed no higher then core curricula. This finding held even when controlling for socioeconomic background, college admission exam scores, the type of college students first attended, how well they did in their first year, and other variables known to be associated with college persistence and degree attainment. Before taking first-year college GPA into account, both high school curriculum and levels of SAT scores were related to persistence. However, after GPA was taken into consideration, high school curriculum remained a significant factor, while SAT scores did not. These findings are consistent with Adelman's (1999) research on determinants of degree attainment. His findings demonstrated that high school curriculum was a stronger predictor of bachelor's degree attainment than standardized test scores or other measures of high school academic performance, leading the author to conclude: When academic intensity and quality of one's high school curriculum is such a dominant determinant of degree completion, and both test scores and (especially) high school grade point average or class rank are so much weaker contributors to attainment, college admission formulas that emphasize test scores and (especially) high school grade point average or class rank are likely to result in lower degree completion rates. (Adelman 1999, p. ix) In the current study, the benefit of a strong high school academic curriculum was particularly noteworthy for transfer students. Students who transfer from their initial 4-year college may be struggling either academically or socially, and attempting to find a better fit in another institution. Among students who first enrolled in college in 1995-96, one-fifth had transferred as of 1998. For these students in particular, as their level of high school academic curriculum increased, so did their likelihood of staying on track to a bachelor's degree (by transferring to another 4-year institution without a break in enrollment). Taken together, the results suggest that completing a rigorous academic curriculum in high school may help students overcome socioeconomic disadvantages such as low family income and parents with no college experience, as well as helping those who, for whatever reason, decide to transfer to another institution.

These differences were clearly evident when examining the destination of transfers. Staying on track to a bachelor's degree implies staying enrolled in a 4-year institution, so all transfers who stayed. on track transferred to 4-year institutions. However, there were also differences across high school academic curricula with respect to the selectivity of the 4-year institutions where students transferred (table A). Among all transfers who completed rigorous high school curricula, 40 percent transferred to selective institutions, compared with just 21 percent of their counterparts who completed mid-level curricula and 17 percent who Figure E.For 1995-96 beginning students who transferred from a 4-year institution, percentage distribution of enrollment status in 1998 with respect to earning a bachelor's degree, by high school academic curriculum 'Continuously enrolled in any 4-year institution. 2 Stopped out (break of 4 or more months) and/or enrolled in a less-than-4-year institution. 3 Core curriculum includes 4 years of English, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of mathematics, and 3 years of science. 4Mid-level curriculum exceeds core curriculum, but is less than rigorous.

Correspondingly, transfers who completed rigorous curricula were much less likely to transfer either to a lessthan-4-year or a for-profit institution (21 percent) than their counterparts in mid-level (40 percent) or core curricula or lower (46 percent). Examining the selectivity of students' first institution with their second. the likelihood of making a lateral transfer from selective to selective institution was much higher for those completing rigorous high school curricula (49 percent) than for those completing either mid-level curricula (33 viii percent) or no higher than core curricula (22 percent).

While the patterns of transfer appear to be similar among those who began in less-selective institutions (i.e., those completing rigorous high school curricula more likely than those in less rigorous curricula to transfer to selective institutions or to transfer laterally, and less likely to transfer to less-than-4-year or for-profit institutions), there is not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion. Transfers left postsecondary education at similar rates no matter what their high school academic curricula. As shown in figure E, 5 to 7 percent of transfers left postsecondary education altogether as of 1998."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Related Variables", "text": "In addition to high school academic curricula, many other variables can influence postsecondary education outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to use multivariate analysis techniques to disentangle the net influence of related variables on the outcome of interest. In this study, covariance adjustment techniques based on simple linear regression models were used to analyze two persistence outcomes: (1) continuous enrollment at the initial institution, and (2) staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Independent variables reflected students' academic experience in high school (academic curricula and college entrance exam scores), demographic char-acteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age), socioeconomic characteristics (income and parents' education), and the economic status of their high schools (the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches). Other variables reflected students experiences in their first year in college, including the type of postsecondary institution, full-or part-time attendance, and work status. In addition, because previous research has shown first-year grade-point average (GPA) to be a strong predictor of success in college (e.g.. Pascarella and Terenzini 1991), both analyses were run twice, once without GPA, and once including GPA as an independent variable.\nIn addition to high school academic curricula, many other variables may influence postsecondary education outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to control for their simultaneous effects to determine the net contribution of each variable to the outcome in question. In particular, as was shown in table 1, students' SAT composite scores were highly correlated with their high school academic curricula. Similarly, the likelihood of attending a selective institution was far higher for those completing rigorous academic curricula. Thus, covariance adjustment techniques using simple regression models (see appendix B under \"Adjustments of Means to Control for Covariation\" for details of method) were used to disentangle the net influence of related independent variables. Two outcome (dependent) variables were analyzed: (I) continuous enrollment in the initial institution, and (2) staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Each dependent variable was coded as a dichotomous measure (yes/no). Independent variables included in the regression models reflected students' academic experience in high school (academic curricula and college entrance exam scores), demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age at college entry), socioeconomic background (income and parents' education), and the economic status of their high schools (as measured by the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches). Other variables reflected students' experiences in college, including the type of postseconckiry institution in which students first enrolled, enrollment status (full or part time) when they first enrolled, and work status while enrolled. Finally, because independent variables may indirectly affect persistence through an association with college grades, and college grades are a strong predictor of success in college,9 each regression was run twice, once without and then with first-year GPA (entered as a continuous variable)."}, {"section_title": "High School Academic Curricula", "text": "The results indicated a strong association between high school academic curricula and both measures of persistence.

Other variables were also significantly associated with both measures of persistence after holding related variables consistent. For example, students whose parents did not attend college were less likely to persist than those whose parents were college-educated.6 In addition, students who started college attending part time and/or working full time were less likely to persist than their counterparts, as were those who first enrolled in less-selective 4-year institutions compared with those in selective institutions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The findings of this study demonstrated a consistent advantage experienced by students who completed rigorous high school curricula, and to a lesser extent by those completing mid-level curricula, over their peers completing core curricula or lower.

All of these factors relate to whether or not students have the opportunities to participate in and complete rigorous curricula. Moreover. students' success in staying in college was also related to where they first enrolled and how well they did in their first year.

Fennessey. and Pallas 1982). One study in particular , examined college graduation rates of high school seniors using the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) with respect to their social background factors and high school academic resources (defined as college or noncollege curriculum track, standardized test scores, and class rank). The authors concluded that academic factors were by far the strongest predictors of degree attainment. Once academic resources were taken into consideration, there were no differences by gender, modest differenL:es by race (Black students had higher completion rates), and larger differences by socioeconomic status. Recently, Adelman (1999) examined graduation rates among 1980 high school sophomores using High School and Beyond (HS&B) data. Through the analysis of high school transcripts, he developed a much more complex curriculum variable based on the intensity and quality of courses taken. The findings of this study indicated that the academic curriculum variable was a better predictor of degree attainment than standardized test scores or class rank. The current study examines the association between high school curricula and colleae persistence and transfer patterns for a cohort of students who first enrolled in a 4-year college in 1995-96, and who were followed up three years later in 1998 (BPS:96/98). Unlike age cohort surveys, the BPS survey is made up of all students who enter college in a given year, including older students who have delayed enrollment. In a previous report, Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick (1996) reported extensively on the persistence and degree attainment of an earlier BPS cohort who entered postsecondary education in 1989-90. However, the earlier survey data lacked measures of high school academic curricula. Thus, it was not possible to determine the impact of high school academic preparation on students' persistence or transfer behavior once they reached college. The newer BPS survey includes data obtained from the SAT and ACT testing agencies, which in addition to college admission test scores, contain self-reports of high school courses completed. BPS:96/98 also contains information on characteristics of the students' high schools from the Common Core of Data (CCD). These additional data provide the opportunity to examine students' academic preparation for college in more depth. Using these data, the analysis examines the association between levels of high school acadernic curricula on measures of persistence 3 years after first enrolling in a 4-year college or urnversity addressing the following questions: How were college students' high school academic curricula related to measures of postsecondary persistence? How did students' high school academic curricula relate to transfer behavior, in particular, whether or not they stayed on track to a bachelor's degree? To what types of institutions (i.e., more or less selective 4-year, or less-than-4-year institutions) did students transfer and how was this related to high school academic curricula? This analysis uses data from the first follow-up of the Beginning Postsecondary Students cohort who first entered postsecondary education in 1995-96 (BPS:96/98). In addition, student reported high school academic courses taken were derived from applications to take the SAT ur ACT college entrance exams. These data were obtained from Educational Testing Service (ETS) and the American College Testing (ACT) Program.2 Data were available for 93 percent of students at 4-year institutions (public and private not-for-profit) and for 43 percent of those at public 2-year institutions.

The core curriculum includes 4 years of English, 3 years of mathematics. 3 years ot. science. 3 years of social studies, and one-half year of computer science.3 The core curriculum represents the threshold for the lowest level of course taking in this analysis defined as follows: 2Previous research comparing student self-reports to transcripts indicates that although students tend to inflate their grades, they fairly accurately report the courses they took in high school. A 1999 analysis by the American College Testing Program's Department of Research Services compared courses reported by approximately 12,000 ACT test takers across the nation in 1995-96 with their high school transcripts. For courses identified in the high school academic curriculum variable. between I percent arid 17 percent of courses reported as taken or planned to take were not identified on their transcripts. This is generally consistent with two earlier ACT studies: a 1987 study of high school students in two states that found 94 percent agreement between selfreported courses taken and official high school transcripts; and a 1988 national study that found 87 percent overall accuracy of student self-report of courses taken compared to high school transcripts, without adjusting for missing data. However, the 1999 ACT analysis mentioned above also found that between 23 percent and 34 percent of self-reported grades for courses included in the high school academic curriculum variable were higher than those on high school transcripts. Based on these findings. selfreported grades are not included as an indicator of academic preparation/achievement. 3Data concerning computer science courses taken were not available for this study because the subject was not separately identified on admission test application forms. Core curriculum or below: 4 years of English, 3 years of mathematics, 3 years of science, and 3 years of social studies. Mid-level curriculum: exceeds core curriculum by the addition of at least I year of a foreign language; also, two of the mathematics courses must have included algebra 1 and geometry, and the science courses must have included two of the following: biology, chemistry, or physics.4 Rigorous curriculum: at least 4 years of English, 3 years of a foreign language, 4 years of mathematics (including precalculus or higher), 3 years of science (including biology. chemistry, and physics), 3 years of social studies, and at least 1 honors or advanced placement (AP) course or, if missing, an AP test score.5 Each successive curriculum level includes students who took at least the specified number of years of subjects and courses but did not meet the parameters of the next higher level. The distribution of beginning students in 4-year public or private not-for-profit institutions according to this definition of high school curriculum is shown in figure 1. Roughly one-third (31 percent) had completed academic curricula no higher than the core level, one-half had completed a midlevel curriculum, but did not meet the criteria for rigorous, and about one-fifth (19 percent) completed a rigorous curriculum.\nAbout one-fifth (19 percent) of 4-year college students who first enrolled in 1995-96 reported completing rigorous high school academic curricula (figure 1). Not only had these students taken chemistry, physics, and at least one advanced mathematics course (precalculus or higher), they had studied a foreign language for at least 3 years and completed 4 years of English. In addition, they reported taking at least one advanced placement (AP) course or test. At the other end of the spectrum, roughly one-third (31 percent) of 4-year college students had completed programs no higher than the core curriculum, which the National Commission on Excellence in Education (1983) considered the minimum requirements for high school graduation. The remaining 50 percent had completed high school curricula that fell between core and rigorous cur ricula (mid-level).

Other independent variables associated with persistence at the first institution after covariance adjustment included parents' education (those whose parents completed no higher than a high school education were less likely to stay continuously enrolled than their peers whose parents attended college),'\u00b0 attendance status when first enrolled (students who enrolled full time were much more likely to stay continuously enrolled than those who began part time), employment while enrolled (students who were working full time when they began college were less likely to stay continuously enrolled than those working part time or not working), and SAT scores (those scoring in the lowest quartile were less likely to stay continuously enrolled than those scoring higher). Table 10 shows the results of the same means adjustment analysis after including first-year GPA as an independent continuous variable in the regression model. Students' high school academic curricula continued to play a role in persistence at the first institution even when GPA was taken into account. Students who completed rigorous high school curricula were still more likely to stay continuously enrolled in their first institution than those who completed curricula no higher than core levels. Similarly, all the other variables that had been significant before adding GPA as an independent variable (i.e., adjusted estimates in table 9), remained significant after GPA was added with the exception of SAT scores. SAT scores no longer had a direct association with persistence at the first institution (adjusted estimates in table 10)."}, {"section_title": "4 7", "text": "Controlling for Related Variables Table 10.-Percentage of 1995-96 beginning students in 4-year institutions who were continuously enrolled in their first institution or attained a bachelor's degree as of 1998 and the adjusted percentage after taking into account the covariation of the variables listed in the  Table 10.Percentage of 1995-96 beginning students in 4-year institutions who were continuously enrolled in their first institution or attained a bachelor's degree as of 1998 and the adjusted percentage after taking into account the covariation of the variables listed in the 3 Least squares coefficient multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix B). 4Standard error of least squares coefficient, adjusted for design effect multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage (see appendix B). 5 Added as a continuous independent variable simultaneously with all other independent variables. 6 Mid-level curriculum exceeds core curriculum, but is less than rigorous.

For example, the disadvantage of starting college either attending part time (versus full time) or working full time (versus part time or not working) remained pronounced for staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Similarly, students whose parents did not pursue an education beyond high school were less likely to stay on track than those whose parents attended college. On the other hand, the influence of first institution type on the rate of staying on track to a bachelor's degree changed.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not entire populations. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampiing errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:96/98 Data Analysis Systems (DAS). The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. hi addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors'5 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 1, generated by the DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (less than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the stratified sampling method used in the NPSAS and BPS surveys. 15The NPSAS:96 samples are not simple random samples, and therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series   method.   50   n   0  Table B1.-Standard errors for table 1: Percentage distribution of high school academic curricula among 1995-96 beginning students in 4-year institutions, by selected student background and high school characteristics 'Core curriculum includes 4 years of English, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of mathematics, and 3 years of science. 2 Mid-level curriculum exceeds core curriculum, but is less than rigorous.

For example, in a comparison of males and females, only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k= 1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racial/ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k= 10 and the significance level of each test must be p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race/ethnicity, there are five racial/ethnic groups (American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and White, non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 4. 5(5 -1) k 10 2 Linear Trends While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using Student's t statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05.20 Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. Means and Taylorized standard errors were calculated by the DAS. Unweighted sample sizes are not available from the DAS and were provided by NCES. 20More information about ANOVA and significance testing using the F statistic can be found in any standard textbook on statistical methods in the social and behavioral sciences."}, {"section_title": "54", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Adjustment of Means to Control for Covariation", "text": "Many of the independent variables included in the analyses in this report are related, and to some extent the pattern of differences found in the descriptive analyses reflect this covariation. For example, when examining the percentages of those who were still enrolled or who had completed a degree at their initial institution 3 years after beginning postsecondary education, it is possible that some of the observed relationship with high school academic curriculum is due to differences in other factors related to academic preparation, such as college admission test scores, type of institution attended, and so on. However, if nested tables were used to isolate the influence of these other factors, cell sizes would become too small to identify the significant differences in patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. The method used in this report estimates adjusted means with regression models, an approach sometimes referred to as communality analysis. To obtain estimates that were adjusted for the covariation among the entire set of independent variables identified as significant in the descriptive analyses, a multiple linear regression2' was used to regress the dependent variable on the full set of independent variables. Each independent variable is divided into several discrete categories. To find an estimated mean value on the dependent variable for each category of an independent variable, while adjusting for its covariation with other independent variables in the equation, substitute the following in the equation: (1) a one in the category's term in the equation, (2) zeroes for the other categories of this variable, and (3) the mean proportions for all other independent variables. This procedure holds the impact of all remaining independent variables constant, and differences between adjusted means of categories of an independent variable represent hypothetical groups that are balanced or proportionately equal on all other characteristics included in the model as independent variables. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, attendance status and gender, are used to describe an outcome, Y (remaining enrolled at the first institution). The vari: ables attendance status and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing attendance status, A, and a dummy variable representing gender, G: "}]
