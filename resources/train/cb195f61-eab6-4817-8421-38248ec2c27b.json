Methods: In the present study, we investigated this issue using a large sample of adolescent children by applying structural equation modeling to examine the effects of several dopaminergic polymorphisms of the D1 and D2 receptor type on the reward function of the ventral striatum and orbital frontal cortex, and whether this relationship predicted the propensity to engage in early alcohol misuse behaviours at 14 years of age and again at 16 years of age.

Overall, the data imply that chronic drug use can lead to increased neuronal activation in response to drug-associated cues, and reduced response to natural rewards, a maladaptive process thought to facilitate the progression towards excessive drug choice (Volkow et al., 2009 ).\nWhile much attention in the field has focused on identifying addiction-related endophenotypes contributing to pre-existing abnormalities in reward circuit function, the search has been plagued by questions of causality: Do the observed reward-related abnormalities stem from chronic drug use itself, or from factors related to genetics that facilitate a progression towards excessive drug use, or some combination of both? Of importance, the longitudinal path from a potential genetic vulnerability to substance misuse outcomes later in life have not been investigated from such a neurodevelopmental perspective, due, in part, to the lack of sufficiently powered longitudinal genetic-neuroimaging studies (Conrod and Nikolaou, 2016) .\nUsing a uniquely large genetic-neuroimaging dataset (IMAGEN study (Schumann et al., 2010) , we addressed this unsolved issue by applying structural equation modeling [SEM] ) to examine whether the selective modulation of key components of the reward circuitry -ventral striatum (VS) and orbital frontal cortex (OFC) -by dopaminergic functional polymorphisms contribute to the degree of perilous alcohol use behaviour observed at 14 years of age and again at 16 years of age. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from 14 year old adolescence participants performing the monetary incentive delay (MID) task were used to quantify the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response of the VS and OFC during the anticipation of large and small rewards. The MID task has been used extensively to IMAGEN 5 investigate changes in neural activity in response to the processing of different stages of reward processing (e.g. reward prediction, anticipation of obtaining rewards of different magnitude or avoiding punishment, outcome processing) in typical and atypical populations, with findings that converge with both animal and human studies emphasizing the essential role of the VS and OFC in processing reward-related information (for review, see (Lutz & Widmer, 2014; Balodis & Potenza, 2015; Knutson & Heinz, 2015) . However, both hypo-responsiveness and hyperresponsiveness of reward-related brain regions (e.g., VS) have been reported during anticipation of reward in the MID task in substance dependent adults (for review, see (Balodis and Potenza, 2015) , so it remains uncertain what functional state (hyper vs hypo) of the reward system may actually precipitate a substance use disorder.\nNevertheless, the relevant reward signal (i.e. positive and negative reward prediction error signals) critical to the functioning of the VS and OFC are thought to originate in the midbrain dopamine system (Schultz, 2001; Schultz et al., 2000) . These reward signals are conveyed to the neural targets of the dopamine system where their impact reorganizes synaptic connectivity in a way that drives learning and motivation (Schultz, 2011 , Schultz, 2001 . For this reason, we focused on functional polymorphisms that would appear to alter dopaminergic signaling in the VS and OFC during reward valuation and prediction. To be specific, we selected the 7-SNP haplotype of the PPP1R1B gene \u2212 mRNA expression highest for G alleles of the rs87694 SNP (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2007) -because of its critical function in integrating dopaminergic and glutaminergic signaling (Svenningsson et al., 2004) , and its association with reward learning (Frank et al., 2007) and cognitive performance (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2007) .\nThe rs686 SNP of the DRD1\u2212the G allele linked to increases in DRD1 expression (Huang and Li, 2009 ) -selected because of the role D1 has in reward signalling (Ikemoto et al., 1997; Suhara IMAGEN 6 & Miyoshi, 2007) and addiction (Batel et al., 2008; Comings et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2008) . To date, the rs686 SNP of the DRD1 has yet to be investigated in the context of human reward-related learning or behaviour. Further, we selected the promoter rs12364283 SNP of the DRD2 gene -the C allele has been shown to confer higher transcriptional activity (Zhang et al., 2007) \u2212 because of the association D2 has with reward signalling (Assadi et al., 2009; Suhara & Miyoshi, 2007) , reinforcement learning (Baker et al., 2013; Frank & Hutchison, 2009) , and addiction (Noble, 1994; Noble, 2000) . Likewise, the Taq1A polymorphism (rs1800497) of the ANKK1 gene was also selected because of its association with striatal D2 receptor function (Thompson et al., 1997 ) but see (Laruelle et al., 1998) , altered activation of OFC (Cohen et al., 2005) and VS (Nymberg et al., 2014) , impaired reinforcement learning (Klein et al., 2007) , and addiction (Munafo et al., 2007; Noble et al., 1994; Abi-Dargham, 2004; Noble, 1998; Noble, 2003; Noble, 2000) .\nTaken together, we hypothesized that these specific dopaminergic functional polymorphisms \u2212 DRD1 rs686 , DRD2 rs12364283 , ANKK1 rs1800497 , and PPP1R1B rs87694 -may selectively modulate the VS and OFC BOLD signal (hyper vs hypo) during reward anticipation.\nIn turn, we predicted that the relationship between these SNPs and alcohol related behaviour at 14 years and 16 years of age would be indirect and be mediated by their effect on the reward response in these selected brain regions. Although less explored, because both the VS and OFC have been proposed to play an important role in reward learning (Frank & Claus, 2006) , adolescent risk-taking behaviours (Galvan et al., 2006; Conrod & Nikolaou, 2016) and the development of addiction (Pujara & Koenigs, 2014) , we used an interaction term to investigate the influence of the balance of activity between these two regions during reward anticipation as a IMAGEN 7\nvariable of interest in our SEM. Our proposed imaging genetics approach constitutes a natural application of SEM, which provides a means for modeling such complex interrelationships."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and Procedure", "text": "A community-based sample of young adolescents (N=2463) was recruited for the IMAGEN study (for details on the IMAGEN project, see Schumann et al. 2010 "}, {"section_title": "Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test", "text": "Problematic alcohol use behaviors were assessed twice, at 14 and 16 years of age, using the total score of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Bohn et al. 1995) via the online computer Psytools \u00ae (Delosis Ltd, London, UK) platforms at the participant's home.\nOf the 1840 adolescents in Time 1 (AUDIT mean = 1.56 \u00b1 0.06), 877 scored 0 on the AUDIT and thus had never used alcohol, whereas 963 adolescents reported the use of alcohol at some degree (score >0) ( Table 1) .

In brief, each trial consisted of anticipation, response, and feedback related cues.

Different cues distinguished between large reward (10 points), small reward (2 points) and neutral (zero points) conditions. After a random anticipation interval of 4000-4500ms length, the target appeared. Participants were instructed to respond to the target as quickly as possible via button press and informed that the points they earned would be converted into chocolate treats after scanning (i.e. we implemented image-acquisition techniques using a set of parameters compatible with all scanners that were held constant across sites (cf., Schumann et al, 2010) .

All regression results are presented in Table S2 . This analysis yielded two significant associations. First, DRD1 rs686 reliably predicted medial OFC BOLD signal (Beta = -.08, t = -2.7, p = .008) to the large reward anticipation cue (F(10, 1230) = 6.5, p < .001, r 2 = .05,), indicating that increasing the number of G allele was associated with a stronger medial OFC BOLD response to the large reward anticipation cue (see Figure 2 , middle panel). It is also worth noting that DRD1 rs686 also predicted medial OFC BOLD response to small reward anticipation, (Beta = -.07, t = -2.4, p = .014), but this relationship did not survive our correction for multiple-comparisons. Second, ANKK1 rs1800497 significantly predicted lateral OFC BOLD, (Beta = -.09, t = -3.1, p = .002) response to the large reward anticipation cue (F(10, 1227) = 2.9, p < .001, r 2 = .03), indicating that increasing the number of A2 alleles was associated with a larger decreases in lateral OFC BOLD signaling during large reward anticipation (see Figure 3C ). It is interesting to note that the rs686 SNP of the DRD1 gene reliably predicted both medial OFC and VS interaction (Beta = -.10, t = - high VS (15%, 10%, and 7% respectively) ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, the interaction effect on alcohol use at 14 years was plotted (see Figure 3C ), which indicated that when both the medial OFC and VS are highly active or inactive (i.e., synergistic), individuals displayed higher levels of Audit scores at 14 years of age. Finally, two significant indirect effects/paths from genes to alcohol misuse were identified: from rs686 SNP of the DRD1, through the medial OFC*VS interaction, to alcohol misuse at 14 years (ab= -.006, se=.003, 95% CI=-.013, -.01), and then on to alcohol misuse at 16 years (abc= -.002, se=.001, 95% CI= -.005, -.001) (Figure 3 A, orange path)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Human neuroimaging studies confirm that the reward function of the mesocorticolimbic system is altered in substance use disorders (Volkow et al., 2011; Volkow et al., 2012) .\nHowever, these data cannot distinguish whether the abnormalities observed in adults are induced by drug exposure or represent a pre-existing condition that predispose individuals to drug addiction, or a combination of both (Schoenbaum & Shaham, 2008; Schneider et al., 2012) . In the present study, we attempted to resolve this issue by examining the relationship between dopaminergic functional polymorphisms, VS and OFC reward functioning, and alcohol use behaviour in early adolescence.\nForemost, we found a novel association between the DRD1 rs686 (Huang & Li, 2009 ) and medial OFC activation during reward anticipation: reducing DRD1 expression (increasing G alleles) (Huang & Li, 2009 ) predicted an increase in medial OFC response (but not lateral OFC or VS) to reward predicting cues. This finding appears consistent with a plethora of evidence highlighting the role of D1 receptors and medial OFC in reward-related learning (Cetin et al., IMAGEN 18 2004; Durstewitz & Seamans, 2002; Hikosaka & Watanabe, 2000; Frank & Claus, 2006; Elliott et al., 2008; Elliott et al., 2000) . Further, D1 density differs quantitatively between subcompartments of the frontal cortex with the highest expression in the medial OFC (Hurd et al., 2001 ). Our findings suggest that a reduction in DRD1 rs686 expression may allow a greater proportion of D1 housing medial OFC neurons to become stimulated by dopaminergic reward signals, thereby intensifying its hemodynamic response. Although suggestive, this idea aligns with the proposal that the intensity of a reward response depends on the absolute number of interactions between dopamine and its post-synaptic D1 (or D2) receptors (Cox et al., 2015) pg. 99 , and further, with evidence demonstrating that when D1 receptors are more highly activated in OFC, behaviours becomes more focused, and reward associations learned more rapidly (Garske et al., 2013) . Taken together, this novel finding revealed that variation in expression DRD1 rs686 can modulate the reward response of the medial OFC.\nPerhaps more intriguing was the SEM findings, which point to a specific molecular pathway by which DRD1 rs686 modulated the balance of activity between medial OFC and VS during reward anticipation, and this specific balance of activity predicted the level of problematic alcohol use behaviours early in adolescence. Consistent with anatomical, functional, and computational evidence highlighting the interplay between medial OFC and VS during learning (Pujara & Koenigs, 2014) , a synergistic (hypo or hyper) response between medial OFC and VS during reward anticipation predicted elevated levels of problematic alcohol use behaviours. Such a synergistic relationship of activity between medial OFC and VS are interesting in light of known differential developmental trajectories for these regions in relation to reward processing and to increased risky behaviour during adolescents (Galvan et al., 2006) . In particular, differential recruitment of frontostriatal regions are typically interpreted in terms of immature IMAGEN 19 prefrontal regions or an imbalance between prefrontal and subcortical regions (Galvan et al., 2006) , a developmental pattern proposed to be exacerbated in those adolescents with a predisposition toward risk-taking (Galvan et al., 2006; Casey, 2015; Casey et al., 2008; Galvan et al., 2006) . However, our results seem to suggest that a synergistic recruitment of medial OFC and VS during reward processing may facilitate a progression towards excessive drug use behaviours in adolescents.\nNotably, the relationship between a synergistic medial OFC and VS reward response and problematic alcohol use may be explained in the context of a recent dual system model of decision making, which refers to the competition between an automatic and deliberative system during learning (McClure & Bickel, 2014) . According to this model, behaviours reflected in VS and OFC circuitry (the automatic system) develop slowly through the regular co-occurrence of stimuli and reinforcers, a process facilitated by positive (increase in dopamine activity) or negative (decrease in dopamine activity) reward prediction error (RPE) signals (Schultz, 2010) .\nWith sufficient experience, this learning process is thought to give rise to stereotyped or habitual (automatic) behaviours (McClure & Bickel, 2014) . By contrast, the role of the deliberative system, comprised of the dorsal lateral prefrontal/posterior parietal cortex, is to modulate behaviours by down regulating value-related responses in the automatic behavioural system (McClure & Bickel, 2014) .\nIn line with this model, we propose that an automatic system with low DRD1 expression may function at a supraoptimal reward state during positive RPE signalling, allowing behaviours to become more focused, and associations learned more rapidly (for example, see Garske et al. 2013) . Further, the dopamine-potentiation effects of addictive substances would compound this problem, resulting in an exaggerated reward response by the automatic system. Such a IMAGEN 20 maladaptive process may in turn prevent the deliberative system to sufficiently compete in the decision making process, failing to down regulate and implement control over high-valued drugrelated stereotype, possibly explaining how early drug use can quickly spiral to problematic use.\nAlternatively, an automatic system with high DRD1 expression may function at a suboptimal reward state and antagonize positive RPE signalling. In turn, the automatic system may bias behaviours that are highly rewarding (e.g. following high risk behaviours, drug use) to compensate for a chronically low \"reward\" state Comings & Blum, 2000) .\nFurthermore, the deliberative system may fail to recognize the need to down regulate such high value-related responses by the automatic system since these reward responses may appear normalized. Although speculative, the association between a synergistic response between medial OFC and VS by DRD1 rs686 (Huang & Li, 2009) , and early onset of alcohol misuse behaviour may provide initial support for such possibilities.\nA challenging question is why this pattern of activation between the medial OFC and VS directly predicted AUDIT scores at 14 years of age, and mediated the effect between the DRD1 rs686 and AUDIT scores at 16 years of age. Presently we can only speculate about the answer to this riddle. In regards to the former, it is important to point out that the relationship between the pattern of activation between medial OFC and VS, and AUDIT scores at 14 years of age preceded early alcohol use (see results), providing an explanation of how dopamine-related genes may predispose individuals to alcohol misuse. In regards to the latter, given the critical developmental period that the frontal and striatal brain systems go through between 14 and 16 years of age, and taking into account the impact alcohol use may have during this time period, perhaps imaging data at 16 years of age may provide better predictions of AUDIT scores at Time 2, as well as other risky behaviors. Alternatively, these findings could also be interpreted in the (Thompson et al., 1997) was associated with an increase in lateral OFC deactivation or suppression during reward anticipation. To note, this association is complicated by the difficulty in determining whether suppression or deactivations reflect an active process such as inhibition, a passive consequence of the redistribution of blood as activity is orchestrated within a distributed network (i.e. due to increase medial OFC activation) or a product of the baseline (Frankenstein et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, increasing A2 alleles, which have been associated with an increase in D2 density, may have strengthened the D2 inhibitory signal in lateral OFC, thereby reducing neuronal excitability for the purpose of suppressing competing behavioural responses maintained in working memory (Elliott et al., 2000; Elliott & Deakin, 2005) . Based on these findings, perhaps D2's role in addiction is only observed in later stages of addiction (Blum et al., 1993; Noble et al., 1994; Munafo et al., 2007) , which might be through impaired inhibitory control by lateral OFC. For instance, in a drug-using state (elevated dopamine levels), the lateral OFC should serve to inhibit the execution of competing behaviours to promote heighted drug-seeking behaviour. In an abstinent state (reduced dopamine levels), the lateral OFC may be unable to suppress drug-related behaviours that are not aligned with prosocial goals. Although speculative, how genetic variants related to D2 expression translate into a vulnerability to addiction warrants continued research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IMAGEN 22", "text": "Adolescence is thought to constitute a critical developmental period during which the frontal and striatal brain systems implicated in decision-making are particularly vulnerable to the addictive properties of drugs (Castellanos-Ryan et al., 2014; Conrod & Nikolaou, 2016) . Our study provides a potential genetic link to this vulnerability, supporting the possibility that alterations in OFC and VS signalling by DRD1 rs686 render youth susceptible to the early onset of substance misuse. Specifically, a genetic profile contributing to the presence of a suboptimal or supraoptimal balance between OFC and VS may present a primary risk factor of drug-seeking behaviour. Although speculative, it is possible that our findings may reflect a maladaptive Ushaped tuning of reciprocal projections between these brain regions during reward functioning (e.g., motivated behavior, working memory, and reward related learning) and dopamine signalling (e.g., dopamine concentration, dopamine receptor availability) (Cools & D'Esposito, 2011) . By moving out of the optimum level of dopaminergic stimulation (trough) towards either peak by excessive or low levels of dopamine stimulation, the mesocorticolimbic system may become hyper or hypo sensitive to rewarding events, possibly biasing the adolescent's action toward drug-related behaviours. Lastly, our results point to a regional specificity in the relationship between functional polymorphisms associated with D1 and D2 receptors and reward-related activity in the medial and lateral OFC, respectively.
