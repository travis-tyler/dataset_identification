The recommended 100-yr design significant wave height (SWH) has been, until 1990, of the order of 11 m. Comparable estimates of the 100-yr conditions were obtained by Palao et al. [3] and Panchang et al. [4] , who have reported considerable spatial variability in these estimates. However, these estimates have been exceeded since 2004 by several meters. Notable examples include Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita where SWHs exceeding 16 m were recorded at various locations (e.g., Jeong and Panchang [5] ; Panchang and Li [6] ). At other locations, smaller SWHs were recorded, but they still exceeded the 100-year estimates by several meters. As a result, it has become necessary to reassess the extreme wave climatology in the GOM region (e.g., Berek et al. [7] ). Similar efforts are underway to reassess extreme storm surge and coastal inundation effects in this region.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are developing methods to predict the coastal impacts of extreme storms on the coasts of the United States. The primary emphasis in these studies is on the numerical modeling of hurricanes (https://ipet.wes.army.mil/) and typhoons [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , whereas Demirbilek et al. [13] and Demirbilek and Nwogu [14] focused on modeling the effects of highly nonlinear storm waves on fringing reefs. These efforts are directed towards predicting where maximum coastal erosion will occur, where storm surge and waves will overtop beaches, where sand dunes will retreat landward, and where breaches will sever barrier islands and create new inlets. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, the surge level in Lake Pontchartrain was roughly the same as the design levels assumed for the Hurricane Protection System. On the east side of New Orleans, Katrina-generated surges were significantly greater than the design criteria, ranging from 5.2 to 6.1 m compared to the 3.7 to 4.3 m assumed in the design. Typically, these types of studies require the development of historical wind fields, which can then be used for developing design criteria for offshore structures and coastal protection systems such as levees.\nIn the GOM, wind/wave data can be obtained from NDBC buoys which provide data for a maximum duration of approximately 35 years. These data provide \"spot measurements\" and at other locations one must resort to numerical modeling to obtain the correct spatial variability in the wind (and in the resulting wave and storm surge) estimates. For numerical modeling purposes, four types of wind fields (on different spatial and temporal grids) are available:\n(1) Using the most sophisticated models available, the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) produces wind fields on an ongoing basis every 6 h. In the GOM, the simulations are made using their \"Western North Atlantic\" and \"North Atlantic Hurricane\" models, and wind fields are available on a 0.25 \u00c2 0.25 grids. These simulations represent the estimates of the entire GOM wind fields; however, they are not available prior to 1999. Thus, alternative methods must be explored if hindcasts for that period are needed. ( 2) The NCEP and the National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch have developed the \"Reanalysis\" wind field dataset, using a combination of mathematical models and data assimilation (Kalnay et al. [15] ). An example is shown in Fig. 1 (left) for Hurricane Gordon. These wind fields are available for the period starting at 1948 at a temporal resolution of 6 h; however the spatial resolution is coarse (2.5 \u00c2 2.5 ). As a result, some features of a hurricane may not be well represented by these data, despite their use in large areas such as the Atlantic [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . (3) A dataset representing hurricane measurements since 1995 has been developed by the National Hurricane Center [21, 22] . This dataset, called H*Wind, is available for the post-1994 period, and has been widely used by researchers for various applications (e.g., Kennedy et al. [23] ; Powell et al. [24] ). It is an estimate of the wind field based on available observations, viz., aircraft-based, land-based, sea-based, and satellite-based. Based on a standardization technique to process data from diverse sources, it provides wind fields at a resolution of approximately 6 km (an example is shown in Fig. 1 ). As may be expected, however, this dataset is not continuous (except in the recent past), does not cover all hurricanes, exhibits a spatial range limited to the immediate vicinity of the hurricane, and is available at irregular time steps. (4) A dataset pertaining to a limited set of storm parameters has been developed by the NOAA for a period going back to the second half of the 19th century. This dataset, called HURDAT, provides, at 6 h intervals, information such as the location of the storm center (LatC, LonC), storm direction (h s ), storm speed (V s ), maximum wind speed (V m ), and For recreating historical wind fields on a continuous basis for a grid covering the entire GOM, neither the H*Wind nor the Reanalysis wind fields are completely adequate. Planetary boundary layer models may be used to construct spatially varying wind fields for the GOM region (e.g., Thompson and Cardone [12] ), but this requires using a complicated wind model that may not be practical. Therefore, here we have taken the approach of developing wind fields using parametric formulations that depend on a limited set of parameters (HURDAT). This approach has been used, for instance, by Phadke et al. [25] and Sanchez et al. [9, 10] , for simulating tropical cyclones near Hawaii, and by McAfee and Pearson [26] for simulating mid-Atlantic hurricanes. Additionally, extensions to real-time surface wind forecasting using such models is possible (Xie at al. [27] ).\nA summary of five parametric models is given by MacAfee and Pearson [26] . These are the Rankine Vortex (RV) model [25] , the SLOSH model [28] , the Holland model [29] , the vortex simulation model [30] , and the Willoughby and Rahn model [31] . Sanchez et al. [9, 10] have used variations of these parameteric models in their studies of typhoon-induced flooding and inundation of the Pacific Islands by tropical storms, and provided corrections for asymmetric wind patterns and options for the parameterization of storm characteristics. In addition, Emanuel et al. [32] describe an alternative model with a structural form similar to the parametric vortex developed by Holland [29] . In general, these parametric models provide the wind speed V(x, y) as a function of hurricane parameters V m and P c , maximum hurricane wind speed and central pressure, and also other model-calculated quantities such as the radius to maximum wind (R m ), sea level pressure at the last closed isobar (P n ), etc. (Note that all numerical models do not include all these parameters.) As an example, for Hurricane Katrina, HURDAT provides the parameters noted at the bottom of this page.\nThese parameters, in combination with various parametric models, result in the wind field plots shown in Fig. 2 (left) . Typically, the basic models yield a symmetric pattern and asymmetry may also be parametrically introduced [33] , which leads to the plots shown in Fig. 2 (right) .\nThere is, of course, no consensus on which model should be used; nor is it reasonable to expect any one model to faithfully reproduce every hurricane. Researchers have had to make adjustments to suit individual cases or locations, as is noted later. For the purpose of recreating historical wind fields in the GOM, here we focus on the RV model (described in Sec. 2). This choice is based on the conclusions of Phadke et al. [25] who found that the first three models produced the same results in the core of the hurricane, however, the RV model had better overall agreement with data outside the core. The performance of this model is examined against data pertaining to five recent hurricanes in Sec. 2. The observed discrepancies are used to make adjustments to the RV model; these are described in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, the performance of the adjusted model is examined using wind data from twelve other hurricanes. The effect of the modified wind fields on wave simulation is also demonstrated."}, {"section_title": "The RV Model and its Application to Recent Hurricanes", "text": "The RV model provides a radially symmetric hurricane wind field as follows\nwhere V m is the maximum wind speed, R is the radial distance from the storm center, R m is the radius to maximum winds, and B is a shape parameter (% 0:5). The radius to maximum winds (R m in km) has been described by MacAfee and Pearson [26] as a function of the latitude (u in degrees), the central pressure (mb), and the pressure along the last closed isobar (P n in mb) as follows \nWilloughby et al. [34] provide an alternative formula to estimate R m as a function of the latitude and maximum wind speed. The importance of properly introducing asymmetry to the RV model has been emphasized by Liu et al. [35] . This can be accomplished by making an adjustment to V due to storm translation. The net motion-adjusted wind velocity may then be obtained as\nwhere h r is the angle between the storm direction and the radius to a particular grid point, and V is the estimated model wind speed, resulting from Eq. (1) [26] . For the wind direction, a circular wind flow pattern is assumed and a cross-isobaric direction correction b, proposed by Bretschneider [36] , can be applied to each grid point \nThe final wind flow is, thus, anticlockwise at a direction of (90-b) degrees to the radius at any point. 2008). At the location of one or more NDBC buoys in the GOM, wave heights recorded during four of these storms were larger than those recorded prior to 2004, and in some cases exceeded the 100-yr event [5, 6] . The HURDAT details of these hurricanes are provided in Table 1 . As can be seen, these data provide a total of 56 snapshots. (In actuality, more snapshots are available in the HURDAT dataset, but the others extend over regions outside the GOM, including land, and hence, are not considered.) These snapshots cover the entire range of hurricane development phases/levels (e.g., from the \"tropical storm\" category to category 5, central pressures ranging between 902 mb and 1005 mb, and wind speeds varying between 85 km/h and 285 km/h). Additionally, these storms were chosen because they had the largest number of HURDAT snapshots for validation.\nSome results of the wind fields calculated using Eqs. (1)- (5) for the set of parameters in Table 1 . A comparison suggests that the parametric model needs adjustment to obtain a better match with the data. In particular, for some storms the \"bean shape\" in the core is insufficiently developed and the distribution of the velocity contours is tighter (smaller) than the data (e.g., the plots show considerable underestimation in many areas, especially on the right side of the hurricane). Figure 5 shows the wind speed along the central East-West radial, calculated using not only the RV model (Eqs. (1)- (5)), but also the widely-used SLOSH and Holland models. All three models show a mismatch (and a similar mismatch was also seen in the N-S transect) indicating a need for adjustment. Wind speed errors are as large as 15 m/s, and when used with a wave model, the resulting errors in SWHs can be of the order of several meters, as shown in Fig. 6 .\nThis type of mismatch has also been observed in other studies and typically, adjustments may have to be made by using data to develop alternative equations. For example, Xie et al. [27] made adjustments to the Holland model based on four mid-Atlantic hurricanes. Instead of treating R m as independent of h, they found it preferable to describe it as a power series of h with the constants being determined on a case-by-case basis, for which details such as wind speeds at specific locations are required. For our work, such data are not available (especially for the pre-1994 period).\nSanchez et al. [9, 10] , MacAfee and Pearson [26] , and Willoughby et al. [34] also made adjustments which were tailored for midlatitude applications."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments to the RV Model", "text": "In order to make adjustments to the RV model, the calculated wind speed plots were compared with H*Wind plots for the five chosen hurricanes. In general, the RV-model results were frequently similar to H*Wind for strong hurricanes (e.g., for P c < 930 mb). In other instances, however, both the shape and the magnitudes were incorrect. Based on the differences, correction factors d h \u00f0 \u00de and C B were established. The first correction factor was intended to modify the RV-modeled hurricane shape and the second was intended to modify the size and velocity distributions. The net wind field V CRV is obtained in two stages, as follows\nA detailed examination of the modeled and H*Wind plots indicated that the comparison was acceptable for lower P c values (Fig. 7 (top) ), however, for larger values of P c the hurricane shape was more deformed relative to the modeled shape (Fig. 7 (bottom) ), i.e., the hurricane was less circular in shape and developed a more pronounced bean-shaped central feature than in the model.\nTo accommodate these features, it was necessary to appropriately deform the modeled RV contour shapes. Since the RV model produces largely circular contours, the values of the H*Wind data velocities along any circle (after appropriate normalization) can be used as a measure of the required deformation d(h). For example, denoting the H*Wind velocities at three arbitrary points P, Q, and B along a circle (shown in Fig. 8 ) by V P , V Q , and V B , respectively, the ratios d P \u00bc V P /V B and d Q \u00bc V Q /V B can be used as a measure of the deviation of the contour from a circle. A circle with radius 4R m is nominally selected for this purpose (to go sufficiently far from the center), and d(h) values are estimated at selected points on the circle. These estimates are used to calculate the deformation d(h) at other points by curve-fitting.\nTo be specific, the point with the smallest velocity on this circle was denoted by \"C.\" Two other points (A and B) were located on the circle in order to create radii perpendicular to the one to C (Fig. 8 (left) ). Using point B as the base velocity, the ratios d A \u00bc V A /V B and d C \u00bc V C /V B were estimated to provide measures of deformation at these points. These data are provided in Table 2 in the form of averages for each storm.\nThe values of d A for the 56 plots were found to vary in a relatively small range (64%) around the average, and hence, the average (%1:15) was used as the deformation factor. On the contrary, the ratio d C displayed less uniformity (varying between \u00c016% and \u00fe6% around the average) and was found to depend on the central pressure, as seen in Fig. 9 . Since 930 P c 970 for most of the cases examined, a best-fit line was used to define this deformation ratio as follows \nMultiplying the RV model velocities by d(h) changes the largely circular contour shape; however, it is first necessary to determine the locations with the closest correspondence to A, B, and C on the modeled contours. For the parametric model, theoretically (based on Eq. (4)) the radius to point A is in the same direction as the storm direction. However, the data show that this is not always true. The actual storm direction can be found from the 56 H*Wind plots (see Fig. 11 ). Generally, strong hurricane conditions agreed with this theoretical expectation the of storm direction and radius to A being collinear, however, for other hurricanes the storm speed, storm direction, and central pressure affect the orientation of A, B, and C. Using the 56 plots we attempted to determine the angles between the radius to A and the storm track (h c ). Unfortunately, no simple pattern emerged. Therefore, the data points were placed into 6 categories based on storm direction. While no meaningful difference between the two vectors was observed for 0 < h < 180, for the other sectors, the difference varied with P c and V s . The results are summarized in Table 3 . The net h used in Eq. (7) is, therefore, the sum of h r and h c . Figure 12 shows plots for the wind fields pertaining to H*Wind, the RV model, the RV model with the d h \u00f0 \u00de correction before applying the h c correction, and the RV model with the corrected h. The hurricane shape in Fig. 12(d) is a clearly substantial improvement over the basic RV model. However, the hurricane size and the velocity distribution are not well matched; thus, further adjustment is required.\n3.2 Development of Correction Factor C B . Imperfections at any grid point in the modeled velocity V RV1 are due to two reasons. The first is due to the fact that the modeled velocity is not at the 10 m elevation, whereas H*Wind is; the second is due to errors in the hurricane size and velocity distributions. The first error is addressed in this paper as a function of r, and the second as a function of both r and h. In other words, we provide a correction to the V RV1 using a correction factor C B that includes both sources of errors, defined as C B \u00f0r; h\u00de \u00bc f 1 \u00f0r\u00de \u00fe f 2 \u00f0r; h\u00de\nThe function f 1 r \u00f0 \u00de was chosen as a constant (%0.8) by Phadke et al. [25] . Figure 13 shows an example of the RV modeled wind and the corresponding data along the central transect for hurricane Katrina (0600 UTC, 8/27/2005), with an adjustment by a factor of Fig. 13(b) ). It is obvious that this adjustment leads to an underestimation outside the core. An examination of several such plots suggested that instead of using a constant, the following function was to be preferred\nThis leads to an improvement, as shown in Fig. 13(c) .\nAs to the correction necessitated by varying storm sizes, the function f 2 r; h \u00f0 \u00de was, for simplicity, described as\nIn order to estimate F 2 r \u00f0 \u00de and E h \u00f0 \u00de, the discrepancies D r; h \u00f0 \u00de between V RV1 and H*Wind at approximately 100 points along four radii (corresponding to h \u00bc 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 ) were In general, two patterns for the discrepancies were observed, as shown in Figs. 14 and 15 (left frames), based on wind-speed ranges. However, the similarity of the curves in the r-direction for different directions justifies the separation of variables chosen in Eq. (10) . For the storms with 36 m/s < V m < 50 m/s, the maximum discrepancy for each h, denoted by D m (h), occurred at approximately r \u00bc 4R m . Figure 14 (right) shows a composite of all discrepancies for such cases. A regression analysis was used to fit the following curve to rectify these errors For V m > 70 m=s, the pattern is largely reversed and the data (Fig. 15) suggested using the following form\nFor 50 m/s < V m < 70 m/s, the discrepancy between the modeled wind speed and H*Wind was negligible for the most part. Note that the left hand side of Eqs. (11) and (12) is a measure of F 2 r \u00f0 \u00de because\nAs a result of Eqs. (8) and (13), it may be seen that E(h) would represent the normalized velocity discrepancies along a circle with r \u00bc 4R m . To estimate E(h), the discrepancy along this circle at h \u00bc 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 were used. These four locations are denoted by A, B, C, and D, and the discrepancies at these locations are denoted by E A , E B , E C , and E D . A curve was fitted to the values at these four locations to estimate E(h) for other values of h, in a manner analogous to that for d(h). An examination of the data showed that these normalized discrepancies at A, B, C, and D varied with V m . As was the case for the radial error, the parameters showed different characteristics for large wind speeds V m > 60 m=s \u00f0 \u00deand for moderate wind speeds 36 m=s < V m < 50 m=s \u00f0 \u00de . A detailed examination of the discrepancies led to the following expressions\nIn general, we found that Table 2 Deformation ratios\nNumber of HWIND wind field data Transactions of the ASME \u00fe b 2 for p < h < 2p, where the constants a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , and b 2 are determined from the conditions E\u00f0h\u00de \u00bc E D at h \u00bc 3=2p and\nTo conclude, a detailed examination of five storms (approximately 56 plots) suggested that the 10 m elevation wind could be obtained by adjusting the RV model as follows\nThe effect of this second adjustment may be seen in Figs. 12(e) and 12(f) for Hurricane Ike and in Fig. 16 for Hurricane Katrina. We note that in the case of Hurricane Katrina, the shape obtained by the original RV-model is reasonable, although for both storms, the final adjusted velocities based on eq. (15) are significantly improved as compared to the original RV model results. The effect of our modifications on the wave heights during Hurricane Katrina is shown in Fig. 6 ; the differences are of a magnitude sufficient to influence extreme wave height calculations."}, {"section_title": "Validation and Effect on Wave Fields", "text": "As noted earlier, the Reanalysis wind fields are available on a 6-hourly basis, dating back to 1948, and have occasionally been used for wave and storm-surge hindcasting [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 37] . However, the coarse resolution (2.5 \u00c2 2.5 ) can be expected to adversely impact the wind and wave hindcasts in hurricane conditions. For example, considering the case of Hurricane Gordon, as mentioned in Sec. 1, winds resulting from the modified RV model are shown in Fig. 17 . The wave hindcast resulting from these wind fields is compared with data from buoy 42 003 in Fig. 18 . It is clear that the Reanalysis winds are inadequate for reliable wave height predictions and that the modified RV model results in better wave predictions, with a maximum difference on the order of 4 m.\nNonetheless, the Reanalysis winds can be used to provide the \"background\" windfields, viz., the windfields outside the hurricane and also the windfields that existed before the onset of the hurricane. The benefits of incorporating such background windfields have been indicated by Liu et al. [35] . We have, therefore, constructed a composite windfield dataset by merging the modified RV winds with the Reanalysis winds (the latter are interpolated onto a 5 km grid).\nThe parametric model equation (Eq. (16)) was tested against 17 storms (107 plots) covering a period from 1961 to 2008 (Table 4) ; these formed a subset of the entire H*Wind dataset. The others were not chosen because numerical data were not available for them or because they contained too many land points.\nFor each snapshot V x; y \u00f0 \u00de was calculated using Eq. (15) for a matrix containing 81 \u00c2 81 points on each side (at a resolution of approximately 5 km) covering a 4 \u00c2 4 region (approximately 6561 grid points per snapshot). Wind speeds from the modified RV model and the original RV models were compared with the H*Wind data for these grid points for each snapshot. The average of all of the absolute values of the percentage error at each grid point, denoted by AE, is presented in Table 5 . In general, in 14 out of 17 cases, the modified RV model (V CRV ) produces far lower errors than the original model. Disregarding small differences (say, less than 10%, which occur in eight cases), eight of the remaining nine showed significant improvements, while only one (i.e., Hurricane Dennis) showed considerable deterioration relative to the original RV model. The maximum improvement is for Hurricane Dean (30%). Unfortunately, for the two cases with maximum discrepancies (i.e., Hurricanes Dennis and Dean), the assessment depends on very few snapshots being available. In addition, a detailed comparison of both parametric wind fields against the H*Wind data was conducted for Hurricane Georges (1998) and the results are in shown in Fig. 19 .\nThe results indicate clearly that the CRV-model wind speed contour shape shows a better match with the H*Wind than the RV-model plot. The wave fields resulting from the two numerically generated wind fields are shown in Fig. 19 (bottom) . For both wind and wave fields, although the maximum values are largely the same, the spatial patterns are different, leading to a maximum of about a 61.8 m difference in wave height estimates at some locations. A difference on the order of about 3.5 m in the maximum SWH is obtained for Hurricane Katrina (see where buoy data are also shown) and about 4 m for Hurricane Ike (not shown). Such large differences have the potential to affect the calculations of extreme wave statistics. Finally, the effect of the two wind fields (V RV and V CRV ) on the 100-yr return period SWHs (defined by SWH 100 ) are examined. These extreme wave height calculations were made by fitting the Gumbel distribution to 51 years of simulations . The purpose of this exercise was merely to study the differences; actual estimates of SWH 100 would depend on the type of statistical model used, and other factors which will be discussed in a separate paper. The results (Fig. 20) show considerable differences in the spatial patterns. These differences (on the order of 4 m at some locations; see Fig. 20(c) ), are substantial relative to the SWH 100 obtained using the original RV model and also relative to the values used by API (2000) [1] . An integrated set of offshore and coastal models for winds, tides, waves, and storms (hurricanes and typhoons) is extremely useful in the planning and in the management of an emergency response pertaining to tropical storms that affect US coasts and islands. These models are also used in other areas of coastal engineering concerned with the design of coastal and wetland protection systems such as barrier islands, levees, and coastal navigation and harbor structures. In these applications, users need models with varying complexity and accuracy for calculating winds when modeling past storm events (hindcast), future storms (forecast), and hypothetical (synthetic) storms. Less resource-demanding models that run fast with a low-order accuracy may be used to perform quick simulations for decision-making and to determine if further modeling using models of higher accuracy is warranted. The parametric wind modeling approach described in this paper is intended to address these critical needs, which can be used to estimate winds when no other information is available for historical storms of interest. We have investigated the RV model and other similar recent parametric wind models with corrections for a large number of tropical storms in the GOM. We found that these models produced a substantial difference in wind speeds relative to the H*Wind data in the GOM. This motivated us to consider spatial adjustments to the shape and distributions to the contours produced by the RV model. We developed an adjusted model (CRV) applicable to asymmetric wind fields typically observed in tropical storms, and have conducted a thorough testing of it against H*Wind for several hurricanes.\nThe CRV model, for the most part, produced a better shape and distribution of the velocity plots. In a comparison performed for 17 hurricanes with 56 snapshots, the CRV model produced smaller percentage errors than the RV model. The CRV wind fields produced SWHs which were on the order of 4 m higher for some hurricanes examined. Results presented in Figs. 6 and 18 show a better match with data. The estimates of SWH 100 resulted in a 4-m difference (maximum) at some locations."}]
