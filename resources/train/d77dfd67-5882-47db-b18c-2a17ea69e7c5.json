There were changes in the classification of fields between 1985-91 and 1992-93. See the Technical Notes for information on the field classifications used. Because racial/ethnic data were collected by broad fields of study only, the definition of science and engineering used by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for this report must include fields normally not included. There is one instance where this difference has a large impactthe broad field of \"Social 10 Sciences.\" The U.S. Department of Education includes the field of history in this broad category, so when it collects the racial/ethnic data, this field is included. Before 1985, the broad category of \"Engineering\" included engineering technologies. This report is different from earlier reports in that it excludes engineering technologies so that trend data by race/ ethnicity are more consistent with the definition of science and engineering used in other NSF reports. If the reader is interested in earlier data for science fields (that are consistent from 1977 to 1993), please request Science and Engineering Degrees, by Race/ Ethnicity of Recipients: 1977-91, NSF 94-306 The number of bachelor's degrees in science and engineering (S&E) fields awarded to underrepresented minority students showed robust growth in the early 1990s, after a period of relatively slow growth from 1985to 1990. From 1990to 1993, the number of baccalaureate recipients with degrees in S&E increased 34 percent for blacks, 32 percent for Hispanics, and 43 percent for American Indians. The percentage increases for underrepresented minority groups were higher than the percentage increases found among white recipients (10 percent) and Asian recipients (26 percent) (table A). In 1993 there were similar numbers of black bachelor's degree recipients in S&E (24,421) and Asian recipients (24,504). The number of Hispanics earning bachelor's degrees in S&E fields hit an alltime high of 18,442, as did American Indians, 1,819. Among underrepresented minority groups, the increases in baccalaureate degrees vary by field of science or engineering. From 1990 to 1993 the percentage changes in baccalaureates awarded to underrepresented groups ranged from a 1-percent decrease in computer science degrees to an increase of 48 percent in psychology degrees (chart A). Underrepresented minorities comprised 28 percent of the \"college-age\" population (18-24 years old) in 1993, whereas baccalaureates earned by underrepresented minority students accounted for only 12 percent of the total S&E degrees in 1993. Although these slight differences exist, the gaps once found between the field choices of underrepresented minorities and whites have virtually disappeared. One-third of all bachelor's degree recipients of all racial/ethnic groups (except Asians, at 49 percent) chose S&E fields in 1993."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In this report the racial and ethnic categories among U.S. citizens who were degree recipients during the 1985-93 period are charted and tabulated. It is recognized that the concept of race/ethnicity is as much a socially constructed characteristic as a biological one. Scholars such as Farley and Allen have noted that \"the sociological reality of race is more important than its biological reality. Race collected only at the broad field level2 and according to the Federal racial/ethnic designations of degree recipients. The surveys were mailed to all accredited universities and colleges in the United States, including the U.S. territories, for completion by the institution. Followup for nonresponse and editing was conducted by letter and telephone. The overall response rate for institutions of higher education ranged between 94 and 96 percent between 1985 and 1993. Some institutions provided only the total number of completions, by award level and by sex; others provided the number of completions by award level, sex, and field but did not provide racial/ethnic data. Imputations for the years 1985 through 1993 were computer generated. Imputations were developed for institutions that did not provide complete racial/ethnic data. Some of these institutions had reported total degrees awarded but not racial/ethnic data, and others had reported totals that were larger or smaller than the sum of the racial/ ethnic components. In the first case, wherein institutions did not report any racial/ethnic data by field, NCES imputed data on the basis of an earlier response for each institution, if available.
