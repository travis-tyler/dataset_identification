A combination of CSF t-tau/A\u2424 1-4 ratio and MRI biomarkers or neuropsychological tests (free recall and trail making test B (TMT-B)) showed the best statistical fit in the AD vs. HC comparison, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 64% when applied to the prediction of MCI conversion (3.3-year observation interval, mean \u03ed 2.3 years). However, several single-predictor models showed a predictive accuracy of MCI conversion comparable to that of any multipredictor model. The best single predictors were right entorhinal cortex (prediction accuracy \u03ed 68.5% (95% CI (59.5, 77.4))) and TMT-B test (prediction accuracy 64.6% (95% CI (55.5, 73.4%))).

The prevalence of clinically manifest AD is about 2% at the age of 65 years but increases to about 30% at the age of 85 years (Wimo et al., 1997) .\nAt the mildest clinical stage of AD pathology, the clinical diagnosis is challenging since dementia symptoms are not yet fully expressed. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with aging is a clinical syndrome of focal cognitive impairment that has been associated with increased risk of AD . However, MCI may stem from a variety of different etiologies and pathologies and shows sometimes high rates of reversion back to normal, suggesting that the clinical symptoms of MCI can occur due to causes other than underlying AD pathology (Ritchie et al., 2001) . Thus, at an early stage, the diagnosis of AD is inherently difficult when based upon clinical symptoms only.\nThe biomarker-based assessment of the neuropathological characteristics of AD has been proposed to enhance the clinical detection of AD in early prodromal stages of the disease . The rationale for the use of biomarkers in diagnostics is that these biological tests may enable us to detect AD pathology to determine whether the MCI symptoms are due to AD pathology and represent early stage, prodromal AD. Such an etiological classification is important for the timely administration of disease modifying drugs, such as A\u2424 immunization currently tested in clinical trials, to prevent or slow down the clinical manifestation of AD-type dementia. Among the primary biomarker candidates recommended by consensus expert groups on biomarkers (Frank et al., 2003) are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based measures of phosphorylated Tau protein (ptau), t-tau protein, beta amyloid peptide (A\u2424 ) (Blennow and Hampel, 2003; Herukka et al., 2005; Hansson et al., 2006; Ewers et al., 2007) as well as MRI-based assessments of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (Jack et al., 1999; Kantarci and Jack, 2003; Schuff et al., 2009) . The hippocampus shows characteristic global and local subfield structural changes that are specific for AD in early stages of the disease (Csernansky et al., 2000; Frisoni et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009) . Entorhinal cortex has been previously reported to be especially sensitive for AD at the early prodromal stages of the disease (Du et al., 2001; Pennanen et al., 2004; Tapiola et al., 2008) . CSF biomarkers of total tau, p-tau, and A\u2424 have also been shown in numerous studies to predict the conversion from MCI to AD at clinically relevant levels of accuracy (Ewers et al., 2007; Herukka et al., 2007; Mattsson et al., 2009) .\nResults of recent studies of smaller sample size have shown that a combination of both MRI-based assessment of hippocampus volume and CSF based biomarkers may possess additive value for enhanced prediction accuracy Brys et al., 2009b) . A recent study as part of the large-scale multicenter trial of the American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using pattern recognition techniques of structural brain changes of gray matter, white matter and CSF space in the whole brain (Vemuri et al., 2008) showed that volumetric changes and CSF markers were associated with higher risk of AD in MCI when compared with each marker alone (Vemuri et al., 2009) . In addition to biomarkers, measures of both memory and nonmemory related cognitive ability may contribute to the prediction of AD in subjects with MCI (Jacobs et al., 1995; Devanand et al., 2007) . However, the effective gain in predictive accuracy by combining different biomarkers or neuropsychological variables for the prediction of AD in MCI has not been conclusively tested so far. Here, we examined on the basis of the data collected within the large-scale multicenter ADNI the accuracy of the combination of the automated MRI-assessed hippocampus and entorhinal measurement, major CSF-biochemical biomarker candidates, and neuropsychological tests for the prediction of the conversion of subjects with MCI to clinical AD over an observation time period of up to 3.3 years."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patients", "text": "Subjects with a complete data set of MRI, CSF and neuropsychological tests were drawn from the ADNI data set including 81 patients with AD, 130 amnestic MCI subjects, and 101 elderly HC (Figure 1 ). Neuropsychological assessment and MRI are routinely taken, and-in a subset of subjects-cerebrospinal fluid samples. Thus, the current sample with a complete data set was a subsample of the larger sample of subjects with amnestic MCI (N \u03ed 397), mild AD (N \u03ed 193) and HC (N \u03ed 229). The subsample who had completed the full data assessment was virtually the same in terms of age, Mini Mental State exam (MMSE), education, ADAS and Ray auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) compared with the remainder of subjects within the ADNI data sample (data not shown).

Variables including age, right and left hippocampus volume, and CSFconcentration levels of t-tau, p-tau 181 , and A\u2424 1-42 , were log-transformed to achieve normal distribution.\nTotal intracranial volume (TIV) was not used here as we did not anticipate it as a confounding factor for diagnostic classification (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2009 ), although we appreciate that TIV correction may have reduced further potential nondisease related variation in ROI volume.\nIn a first step, logistic regression analysis was used to establish a prediction model for the discrimination between AD and HC. In order to test the robustness of the model and to control for potential sample-specific overfitting, the logistic regression analysis was reiterated 1000 times using random-split resampling. In each trial, a logistic regression model was constructed on the basis of a subset of randomly chosen portion of two-thirds of the AD and HC (training set) and the predictive accuracy was tested in the remaining 1 \u20443 of the AD and HC subjects (test set). The sensitivity and specificity of the regression model for the test set was recorded within each resampling trial. The best regression model was defined as the particular regression model that was generated most frequently during the resampling trials. For the best model, the average sensitivity and specificity across resampling test trials and the regression coefficients together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the sampling distribution was reported. Predictors tested included left and right hippocampus volume and entorhinal cortex, CSF-measures of t-tau, p-tau 181 , A\u2424 1-42 , ratio of t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 and p-tau 181 /A\u2424 1-42 , age, gender and ApoE genotype. ApoE genotype was binarized into ApoE 4 allele carrier and ApoE 4 allele non-carriers. Note that in the most accurate model across the 1000 resampling trials, age, gender, and ApoE genotype were not significant predictors and thus did not contribute to the predictive accuracy of the models reported here. The prediction model derived from the first step was applied in the second step for the discrimination between MCI-AD converters and MCI-AD nonconverters.\nWe reported previously a logistic regression derived formula for the detection of AD based on ApoE genotype and CSF obtained antemortem tested in autopsy confirmed AD patients and living cognitive normal HC ). We tested here whether this algorithm including CSF-concentration of t-tau, A\u2424 1-42 , and number of ApoE 4 alleles (designated LR TAA ) could be augmented by the current MRI markers for the prediction of MCI to AD. To this end, the 2 prediction models (i.e., with and without neuropsychological markers) were rerun, but this time the separate CSF markers of total tau, p-tau 181 , and A\u2424 1-42 and ApoE genotype were substituted by the LR TAA predictor.\nIn addition to the biomarker-only models, we tested whether neuropsychological variables contributed to the predictive power of the biomarker based model. We repeated the random-split resampling based logistic regression analysis for the discrimination between AD and HC in the same way as described above, but this time feeding in the regression model also neuropsychological test scores including AVLT immediate and 30 minute free recall, AVLT recognition test, TMT-A and TMT-B, category fluency, digit span forward and digit span backward, Digit Symbol Substitution test and the Boston naming test. A correlation matrix was between all tests was computed across all subjects to check colinearity, using Pearson moment correlations.\nNote that the model established in AD vs. HC comparison on the basis of the best statistical fit of the logistic regression model may not necessarily translate into the model with the best classification accuracy (Schemper, 2003) . Therefore, we compared in a second approach the classification accuracy for each combination of the variables. In a first step, the coefficients were estimated in the AD vs. HC sample (in the whole sample) and then applied for the MCI prediction. Models for all possible combination of the 24 predictors including the biomarker candidates, neuropsychological variables, and demographic variables including age and gender were estimated, with the restriction of a maximal number of predictors of 4. This restriction of the maximum number of predictors in a particular model was done for computational reasons since the total number of possible combinations of 24 variables is exceedingly high. Moreover, models with high number of predictors are less attractive in terms of implementation in clinical practice. To keep the follow-up interval consistent across subjects, the follow-up interval was restricted to at least 1.9 years in MCI stable subjects and the time to conversion was maximally 2.1 years for MCI converters (n \u03ed 128 MCI subjects). Using bootstrapping with replacement, the classification accuracy for the MCI conversion prediction was recorded for each model estimated during each of 100 bootstrap trials. In each bootstrap trial, the different models were ranked according to the overall classification accuracy. The mean and 95% CI of the sampling distribution of the rank and classification accuracy indexes (total classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) were computed across bootstrapping trials. The 95% CI of the classification accuracies was used to test for statistically significant differences in the classification accuracy between different prediction models.\nNote that in the first cross-validation approach to establish the best prediction model in the AD vs. HC comparison, Type I error accumulation due to multiple tests or overfitting was controlled for by random-split resampling. Age and gender were tested as covariates in all models but were not found to contribute to prediction accuracy. The statistical significance threshold for variable entry was \u2423 \u03ed 0.05 and for removal of a variable from the regression model \u2423 \u03ed 0.1 was used. In the comparison of systematically varied prediction models on the basis of the 95% CI, the number of comparisons between models was limited to the models with the highest ranks of predictive accuracy, thus limiting the number of statistical tests. Second, as we did not find a significant difference based on the 95% CI, the conclusion of the current study holds regardless of Bonferroni correction.\nFinally, within the MCI sample, time to conversion to AD was tested via Cox regression analysis.\nThe analyses were conducted with open source statistical software package R (www.r-project.org/) and SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, USA)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Demographic variables for the different diagnostic groups are displayed in Table 1 . Among the subjects with MCI, 58 out of 130 subjects developed AD within 3.3 years of clinical follow up, with a mean follow up interval of 2.3 years (SD \u03ed 0.6). In order to check for co-linearity between the predictors, a Pearson-moment correlation matrix was computed among all predictors within the AD and HC subjects.

Bootstrapping was performed only in the full 2-year sample. 68.5 (59.5, 77.4) 53.4 (39.7, 67.1) 77.0 (66.5, 87.5) LERC and RHC 68.4 (60, 76.8) 70.8 (58.8, 82.9) 66.6 (54.5, 78.8 We used a widely applied method of cross-validation, determining the best logistic regression model in the training sample consisting of AD and HC subjects. Based on such a best-statistical-fit approach, CSF total tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratio, left entorhinal cortex and hippocampus volume were found to independently contribute to the classification of AD vs. HC subjects. When neuropsychological predictors were introduced, a combination of CSF total tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratio with performance on tests of immediate and delayed recall was found to yield the best model. This finding of independent contribution of different biomarkers to the prediction of risk of AD is consistent with previous results.\nFor the prediction of time to conversion from MCI to AD, Cox regression analysis showed significant contribution of a combination of multiple variables to predict time to conversion from MCI to AD. Previous studies reported that a combination of hippocampus rating or manual hippocampus volumetry (de Leon et al., 2006) contributed independently from CSF based core biomarkers (de Leon et al., 2006; Bouwman et al., 2007; Brys et al., 2009a) to the the prediction of AD in MCI subjects. Similarly, a combination of WAIS-R Digit Span, Selective Reminding Test (SRT) Immediate Recall and functional assessment measures and biomarkers including MRI based measures of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were found to best predict the time to conversion from MCI to AD within 3 years of clinical follow up (Devanand et al., 2007) . In larger multicenter studies including the ADNI trial, previous studies with a mean follow up interval of 1.5 years reported that MRI and CSF biomarkers may contribute independently to the prediction of AD (Vemuri et al., 2009 ). However, the clinical utility in terms of prediction accuracy was not evaluated for this relatively short follow-up interval used in that earlier study (Vemuri et al., 2009) . In a similar vein, Landau et al. recently reported that the combination of a decrease in FDG-PET uptake and impaired free recall shows a significantly elevated hazard ratio to develop AD dementia within 2 years (Landau et al., 2010) . These studies support the notion that biomarker and neuropsychological predictors are independently associated with the risk of AD.\nHowever, such results based on explained variance leave considerable uncertainty to what extent the actual predictive accuracy is enhanced by the addition of a particular marker in multipredictor models (Schemper, 2003) .\nIn the current study, the systematic combination of each of the 24 predictor variables in models with a number of maximally 4 predictors allowed for the direct comparison of single predictor models and more complex models based upon the 95% CI of the predictive accuracy. Our results showed that although there was a numerical increase by up to 11.7% in total prediction accuracy from the best single-predictor model to the best four-predictor model, this difference was not robust based on the bootstrapped 95% CI of the prediction accuracy. Although it is possible that a test of the same model in a larger sample or a combination of even more predictors may eventually lead to a significant improvement, the current results support the notion that some sparser and economic single-predictor models may be as good as any more complex model for the prediction of the clinical course to the progression from MCI to AD within a short time interval.\nA second finding of the current analysis is that a broad range of both biomarker and neuropsychological predictors yield comparable results. Previous studies have provided evidence for the utility of CSF and MRI markers of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex for the prediction of AD (Schmand et al., 2010) . We found that some neuropsychological predictors achieved a predictive accuracy that was comparable to that of biomarkers. Note that the best neuropsychological predictors included both memory measures (free recall) and nonmemory measures (TMT-B, digit span, and fluency). Free and cued recall of verbal list learning has been previously shown to be highly sensitive towards mild AD (Tierney et al., 1996; Tabert et al., 2006; Sarazin et al., 2007; Devanand et al., 2008; Fleisher et al., 2008) , even 10 years before the clinical manifestation of AD (Tierney et al., 2005) . Both immediate free recall and digit span were reported to be associated with the risk of development of AD in MCI in a previous study (Devanand et al., 2007) . Our current finding suggests that executive functions such as tapped by TMT-B (Arbuthnott and Frank, 2000) showed Table 4 Combined biomarkers and neuropsychological models for different follow up intervals. The overall classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the top ranked models during the bootstrapping trials for single and multiple predictor models are displayed for 2-and 3-year follow-up intervals. Bootstrapping was performed only in the full 2-year sample (Sarazin et al., 2007) , and fronal nonmemory neuropsychological measures (Jacobs et al., 1995; Tierney et al., 1996; Backman et al., 2005; Tierney et al., 2005; Tabert et al., 2006; Rozzini et al., 2007) show predictive value for the conversion from MCI to AD. It should be noted that the use of psychometric memory tests is somewhat controversial, since such tests were also used for the diagnosis of AD, thus posing the risk of circularity. On the other hand, one may argue that the inclusion of neuropsychologically impaired subjects such as in the case of amnestic MCI may render the test of neuropsychological prediction of progression harder since the variability in neuropsychological performance is reduced in such a clinical group. Eventually, the utility of any predictor will need to be validated in neuropathologically confirmed AD cases.\nThe current results also demonstrate that the predictive accuracy of the current biomarker models is not yet clinically sufficient within a follow-up interval of up to 3.3 years in the ADNI study. The limited predictive accuracy may be partially explainable by censoring effects. Although our results do not show an improvement of predictive accuracy between a 2-year and 3-year follow-up interval, the predictive accuracy of the current model is likely to improve with extended follow-up time and may reach a plateau only many years later. This hypothesis is consistent with findings of a meta-analysis showing a trend towards increasingly higher effect sizes of CSF biomarkers including t-tau, p-tau and A\u2424 1-42 during at least 6 years of clinical follow-up (Schmand et al., 2010) .\nThe current biomarker based model did take advantage of a clinical characterization, as a preselection of subjects in terms of presence of amnestic MCI was used. Thus, the results need to be interpreted in view of the clinical concept of MCI that may be supplemented by biomarker and neuropsychology based prediction of AD. An evaluation of biomarker and neuropsychological predictor supported models in subjects with nonamnestic subtype of MCI, which was not included in the current study, is desirable in the future. Previous studies have shown that the frequency of AD-like CSF-patterns composed of the concentration of tau and A\u2424 1-42 is significantly elevated not only in amnestic MCI subjects, but also in the nonamnestic subtype of MCI or subjective memory impairment when compared with normal controls . Presence of the AD like CSF pattern was associated with stronger cognitive decline in these groups ). Thus, it will need to be tested whether the current result pattern holds also in the nonamnestic type of MCI. None of the other authors have a conflict of interest to disclose."}]
