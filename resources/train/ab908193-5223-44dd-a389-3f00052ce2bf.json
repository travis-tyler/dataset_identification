[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a are not a simple mirror image, but exhibit significant differences in their spatial structure and seasonal evolution. In particular, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the equatorial Pacific cold tongue are larger in magnitude during El Ni\u00f1 o compared to La Ni\u00f1 a, resulting in positive skewness of interannual SST variations. The associated atmospheric deep convection anomalies are displaced eastward during El Ni\u00f1 o compared to La Ni\u00f1 a because of the nonlinear atmospheric response to SST. In addition to these well-known features, an analysis of observational data for the past century shows that there is a robust asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a. Most El Ni\u00f1 os and La Ni\u00f1 as develop in late boreal spring/summer, when the climatological cold tongue is intensifying, and they peak near the end of the calendar year. After the mature phase, El Ni\u00f1 os tend to decay rapidly by next summer, but many La Ni\u00f1 as persist through the following year and often reintensify in the subsequent winter. Throughout the analysis period, this asymmetric feature is evident for strong events in which Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 SST anomalies exceed one standard deviation in December. Seasonally stratified composite analysis suggests that the eastward displacement of atmospheric deep convection anomalies during El Ni\u00f1 o enables surface winds in the western equatorial Pacific to be more affected by remote forcing from the Indian Ocean, which acts to terminate the Pacific events."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the equatorial Pacific, prevailing easterly winds accumulate warm surface water to the west, lifting the thermocline in the east. The equatorial upwelling forced by these easterly winds induces stronger surface cooling in the eastern Pacific because of the shallower thermocline. The resulting zonal gradient of sea surface temperature (SST), in turn, drives the equatorial easterly winds that gather water vapor to fuel intense atmospheric deep convection over the western Pacific warm pool. Weakened (strengthened) easterly winds reduce (enhance) the eastern cooling and hence the zonal SST gradient, which positively feeds back to the surface wind changes. This so-called Bjerknes (1969) feedback is at the heart of interannual tropical Pacific variability, the El Ni\u00f1 o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, whose impact extends far beyond the tropical Pacific through global atmospheric teleconnections (e.g., Trenberth et al. 1998; Alexander et al. 2002) . Warm (El Ni\u00f1 o) and cold (La Ni\u00f1 a) ENSO events tend to last approximately 1-2 years and recur every 3-8 years.\nVarious theories have been proposed to explain what brings turnabouts between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a, including ocean wave reflection at the western boundary (Schopf and Suarez 1988; Battisti and Hirst 1989) , recharge/discharge of warm water volume due to Sverdrup transport (Jin 1997) , oceanic Kelvin waves forced by wind anomalies in the western Pacific (Weisberg and Wang 1997) , and ocean temperature advection by zonal currents associated with wave reflection at the western and eastern boundaries (Picaut et al. 1997) . [See Neelin et al. (1998) , Wang and Picaut (2004) , and Chang et al. (2006) for reviews of ENSO mechanisms.] Despite their differences, these theories agree that dynamical oceanic adjustments provide a slow restoring force to the unstable equatorial air-sea interactions. Irregularity and noncyclic behavior of ENSO have also led some authors to propose that ENSO is not a self-sustained oscillatory mode but a stable mode triggered by stochastic wind forcing (e.g., Lau 1985; Penland and Sardeshmukh 1995; Thompson and Battisti 2001; Kessler 2002) .\nEl Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a are strongly modified by the background seasonal cycle. In particular, the equatorial Pacific cold tongue exhibits a distinct annual variation despite the semiannual solar forcing (Mitchell and Wallace 1992; Xie 1994) . The associated zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific and accompanying easterly winds are strongest (weakest) in boreal summerfall (spring) when the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) moves farthest from (closest to) the equator. (In this paper the seasons refer to those in the Northern Hemisphere.) Both El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a develop in late spring-summer, when the climatological cold tongue is intensifying, and they peak mostly toward the end of the calendar year, resulting in a December peak in monthly SST anomaly variance. The physical processes responsible for this phase locking are still unclear but possibilities include nonlinear modulation of the annual cycle by interannual displacement of the thermocline (Xie 1995) , seasonal migration of the ITCZ and associated atmospheric heating (Tziperman et al. 1997; Harrison and Vecchi 1999) , delayed negative feedback from the Indian Ocean (Annamalai et al. 2005 ; Kug and Kang 2006; Ohba and Ueda 2007; Yoo et al. 2010) , and influence of the North Pacific Oscillation (Chang et al. 2007; Alexander et al. 2010) . The fact that both El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a amplify during the equatorial cold season confirms that the presence of strong zonal SST gradient, easterly winds, and upwelling in the background state is fundamental for the Bjerknes feedback.\nHistorically, El Ni\u00f1 o has drawn more attention than La Ni\u00f1 a, partly because it is associated with more severe climatic conditions, such as heavy rains in the coastal desert of Peru and sometimes failures of the Indian monsoon. In fact, composite analysis had only been attempted for El Ni\u00f1 o and not for La Ni\u00f1 a until the late 1980s. After the cold phase of ENSO was named ''La Ni\u00f1 a'' by Philander (1985) and its climatic impact caught public attention with one of the strongest events on record in 1988 -89 (e.g., Kerr 1988 , researchers began to treat El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a as complementary phases of ENSO. Indeed, most observational studies use linear techniques such as regression analysis, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, or warm-minus-cold composites to identify the canonical patterns and evolution of ENSO events, assuming that La Ni\u00f1 a is a mirror image of El Ni\u00f1 o.\nInterannual SST variations along the coast of Peru are known to be strongly positively skewed (Deser and Wallace 1987) . Burgers and Stephenson (1999) show that the SST anomaly skewness exhibits an intriguing geographical distribution, with large positive values in the eastern equatorial Pacific and small negative values in the western Pacific, reflecting that the SST anomalies associated with El Ni\u00f1 o are larger in magnitude than those associated with La Ni\u00f1 a. This deviation from normality led them to question the degree of linearity in the equatorial Pacific ocean-atmosphere system. They suggest that the proximity of the thermocline to the surface is the cause for the positive SST anomaly skewness in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and that therefore nonlinear oceanic processes are responsible for the asymmetry in the strength of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a. Jin et al. (2003) propose that nonlinear thermal advection by ocean currents contributes to the generation of largeramplitude El Ni\u00f1 os compared to La Ni\u00f1 as. Meinen and McPhaden (2000) show that for a given anomaly magnitude of warm water volume in the upper portion of the equatorial Pacific, positive values are associated with larger-amplitude SST anomalies than negative values, suggesting the importance of nonlinear processes.\nAsymmetry in the spatial distribution of equatorial Pacific rainfall anomalies between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a was highlighted in the study of Hoerling et al. (1997) on ENSO teleconnections. They noted that maximum amplitude rainfall anomalies along the equator are located east (west) of the date line during El Ni\u00f1 o (La Ni\u00f1 a), with a commensurate shift (approximately 358 of longitude) in the atmospheric Rossby wave trains forced by diabatic heating changes. Hoerling et al. (1997) suggested that the zonal displacement is due to the nonlinear dependence of atmospheric deep convection on total SSTs. On the periphery of the warm pool, even small SST deviations excite large rainfall deviations because of the high background SST values. Thus, maximum convection anomalies are shifted more than 5000 km west of the maximum SST anomalies (Deser and Wallace 1990) . Over the eastern cold tongue region, on the other hand, large positive SST anomalies can induce convection while negative anomalies have no further effect on the normally dry conditions. Indeed, an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) forced with perfectly symmetric positive and negative SST anomaly patterns successfully simulates the nonlinear atmospheric response that closely resembles the observed patterns (Hoerling et al. 1997) . The associated zonal shift of surface wind anomalies, in turn, is suggested to cause stronger positive SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific during El Ni\u00f1 o (Kang and Kug 2002) .\nThus, the asymmetry of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a involves nonlinear processes in both the ocean and atmosphere, which may be amplified by air-sea interactions. An alternative linear view is that ENSO represents zonal excursions of the ocean temperature front between the western warm pool and the eastern cold tongue by anomalous advection: its eastward (westward) displacement results in large positive (negative) SST anomalies to the east (west) of the climatological front (Schopf and Burgman 2006) . Previous studies of ENSO asymmetry have focused on the skewness of SST anomalies and its spatial pattern. It should be noted that this asymmetry in the magnitude of positive and negative SST anomalies may also arise from the asymmetry in the duration of warm and cold phases of ENSO when climatologies are defined as the time mean state.\nThe asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a has been noted in a few recent studies (Larkin and Harrison 2002; McPhaden and Zhang 2009; Ohba and Ueda 2009) . McPhaden and Zhang (2009) show that La Ni\u00f1 a tends to persist into the second year and reintensify in winter in their composite analysis for 1980-2008, although this feature is not evident for the earlier period 1950-77. For both periods, El Ni\u00f1 o tends to terminate rapidly after the mature phase, as shown in earlier studies by Rasmusson and Carpenter (1982) and others. Based on the observational analysis for 1980 -2002 , Kessler (2002 also points out that the transitions from La Ni\u00f1 a to El Ni\u00f1 o are slower than those from El Ni\u00f1 o to La Ni\u00f1 a. Ohba and Ueda (2009) suggest that these asymmetric transitions between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a can be attributed to the nonlinear response of surface winds to Indo-Pacific SST anomalies, although they did not clarify the relative role of the Indian Ocean SST anomalies associated with ENSO.\nIn the present study, we examine in greater detail the asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a, using a suite of observational and reanalysis datasets spanning the past 27-109 yr. We address the following questions. Is there a robust asymmetry in the duration of the two ENSO phases throughout the observational record? How do ocean-atmosphere anomalies evolve in association with the asymmetric duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a, and what causes this asymmetric evolution? Do SST changes in the Indian Ocean associated with El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a have any impact on the asymmetric wind anomalies in the Pacific? These are very important issues for climate prediction because long-lasting La Ni\u00f1 a can exert persistent climatic impact on the Indo-Pacific and distant regions through atmospheric teleconnections (e.g., Ropelewski and Halpert 1989; Cole et al. 2002; Hoerling and Kumar 2003) .\nThe datasets and analysis methods used in this study are described in section 2. In section 3, it is shown that there is a robust asymmetry in the duration of the two ENSO phases throughout the past century, especially for strong events. Through seasonally stratified composite analysis, we identify a pronounced asymmetry in the surface wind anomalies that develop in late fall over the far western Pacific, leading to the asymmetric evolution of thermocline anomalies in the central-eastern portion of the basin in the following seasons. We discuss a possible role for the Indian Ocean in this asymmetric evolution of surface wind anomalies over the far western Pacific. The last section summarizes the main results."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": "To identify any robust asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a, we analyze two monthly SST datasets spanning different periods: the Hadley Centre sea ice and sea surface temperature (HadISST; Rayner et al. 2003) for 1900-2008 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) optimum interpolation sea surface temperature version 2 (OISST; Reynolds et al. 2002 Reynolds et al. ) for 1982 Reynolds et al. -2008 . The HadISST is a long-term global SST analysis available on a 18 grid from 1870 to the present. It is based on historical in situ ship and buoy observations with satellite data blended in after 1982. The cold bias of bucket SST measurements prior to 1942 is corrected for, and missing grids are filled by optimal interpolation based on EOF analysis. The OISST combines satellite data with in situ observations and is available on a 18 grid from December 1981 to the present. The long, spatially complete data of HadISST helps us assess the robustness of asymmetry throughout the historical record, while the extensive spatiotemporal coverage of satellite observations used in the OISST allows for better resolution of SST variations with small amplitude and spatial scale (e.g., Okumura and Xie 2006) .\nSeveral other monthly ocean-atmosphere variables are analyzed in conjunction with the SST field: surface wind velocities and tropospheric air temperature from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis for 1948 (Kalnay et al. 1996 and from the NCEP-Department of Energy (DOE) reanalysis II for 1979 (Kanamitsu et al. 2002 , precipitation from the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) for 1979 (Xie and Arkin 1996 , and sea surface height and surface wind stress from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) analysis versions 2.0.2 and 2.0.4 for 1958 , respectively [see Carton and Giese (2008 for the description of the earlier version]. It should be noted that a representation of the Pacific ITCZ and associated meridional winds is substantially improved in the NCEP-DOE reanalysis II compared to the original NCEP-NCAR reanalysis presumably due to improved model physics of boundary layer and convection (Wu and Xie 2003) . The two versions of the SODA analysis use different wind products (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis in version 2.0.2 and the Quick Scatterometer data in version 2.0.4) but do not exhibit any apparent discontinuity in the equatorial Pacific across the two periods, and thus we merge them to form a single record for . The results shown in the following section do not change significantly by limiting the data period to 1958-2001. For each variable, monthly anomalies are calculated by subtracting the climatological monthly means over the analysis period. When two or more variables are analyzed together, a common data period is used to calculate the climatologies. The monthly anomalies are smoothed using a 1-2-1 filter. We choose not to remove linear trends from the data records since they are not consistent for the different data periods and may arise from interdecadal variability in the short records spanning the recent few decades. The SST trend in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific is small over the past century relative to the amplitude of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a (;60.28C). Although the tropical Indian Ocean shows a significant warming trend of ;1.08C from 1900 to 2008, we confirm that it does not significantly affect the composite anomalies for El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a.\nAs will be shown in the next section, the asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a is evident only for strong events. Based on the fact that most strong ENSO events peak toward the end of the year, El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a years are defined as those for which the 1-2-1 smoothed SST anomalies averaged over the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 region (58S-58N, 1208-1708W, hereafter called the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 index; Fig. 1 ) in December exceed 1 standard deviation and are below 21 standard deviation, respectively. This method picks out all strong cases of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a events according to the definition of Trenberth (1997) that is used in NOAA's operational ENSO forecast and many previous studies. Composite analysis is conducted for these El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a years separately. The El Ni\u00f1 o/La Ni\u00f1 a and subsequent years are denoted as ''year 0,'' ''year 11,'' . . . and the months of these years as (1940/41, 1949/50, 1986/87, and 1998/99) . These consecutive El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a years are regarded as single events in Trenberth's (1997) definition, but are treated as separate samples in our composite analysis because we are interested in how the ocean-atmosphere anomalies evolve before and after each peak of equatorial SST anomalies. The results shown in the following section are, however, not significantly affected by eliminating the second years from the analyses. The main results also do not change for slight modifications of the year selection criteria (e.g., expanding the reference months to include November and January) or by excluding the two extreme El Ni\u00f1 os of 1982/83 and 1997/98 in the composite."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Duration of El Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca", "text": "The long-lasting La Ni\u00f1 a of 1998-2001 caused extensive drought across the United States, southern Europe, and southwest Asia (e.g., Hoerling and Kumar 2003) . An examination of the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 index time series for 1948-2008 reveals many other strong, persistent cold phases spanning more than 2 yr (1949-51, 1954-56, 1973-76, 1983-86, and 2007-09; Fig. 1 ). During these persistent cold phases, negative SST anomalies reintensify each winter, evidenced by the sawtooth shape of the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 time series. Although there were two prolonged warm phases during this period (1990-95 and 2002-05) , none was as continuously strong as their cold counterparts. Indeed, there is no warm phase in which the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 index remains above 0.3-0.4 for more than 2 yr. In 9 out of 11 La Ni\u00f1 as the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 index remained negative through year 11, while 11 out of 12 El Ni\u00f1 os terminated rapidly by summer of year 11. The three major El Ni\u00f1 os of 1972/73, 1982/83, and 1997/98 were followed by a strong, persistent cold phase. ). In the second half of year 11, the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 indices for the composite El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a have the same sign and similar magnitudes. Most of the strong El Ni\u00f1 os and La Ni\u00f1 as that compose the composites develop in late spring. Horii and Hanawa (2004) have pointed out that warm events that commence in spring tend to grow larger and exhibit a more regular life cycle than those that commence in summer-fall. The El Ni\u00f1 o of 1986-87 did not begin until late summer and lasted through year 11 as many of the summer-fall-type events in Horii and Hanawa's (2004) analysis. The El Ni\u00f1 o of 2006/07 also began in late summer but terminated rapidly after the mature phase, triggered by intraseasonal variability emanating from the Indian Ocean ).\nAn expanded view of the composite evolution of SST anomalies along the equator during El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a is shown in Fig. 3 for three different periods and two datasets: 1900 -47 (HadISST), 1948 (HadISST), and 1982 . For the periods after 1948, composite surface wind anomalies are also overlaid. The greater persistence of La Ni\u00f1 a compared to El Ni\u00f1 o is apparent in all three periods and two datasets. In the composite El Ni\u00f1 o, positive SST anomalies are replaced by negative SST anomalies starting in summer of year 11, accompanied by a reversal of the zonal wind anomalies west of 1708W. In the composite La Ni\u00f1 a, on the other hand, negative SST anomalies persist through year 11 in the western-central Pacific and reintensify in winter. The persistent negative SST anomalies in the western-central Pacific are associated with persistent easterly wind anomalies west of 1708W, which would increase local upwelling and force upwelling Kelvin waves to the east. To the east of 1458W, the negative SST anomalies weaken significantly after the mature phase and then reintensify in the following fall-winter. In the La Ni\u00f1 a composite 1902 , 1905 , 1911 , 1918 , 1925 , 1930 , 1940 , 1941 , 1957 , 1965 , 1972 , 1977 , 1982 , 1986 , 1987 , 1991 , 1994 , 1997 , 2002 , 2006 La Ni\u00f1 a years 1909 , 1916 , 1933 , 1942 , 1949 , 1950 , 1955 , 1970 , 1973 , 1975 , 1984 , 1988 based on the OISST and NCEP-DOE reanalysis II, this decay of negative SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific is associated with anomalous westerly winds that intensify east of 1208W after the mature phase, which would reduce local upwelling and warm the ocean mixed layer Fig. 3 reveal several other interesting features consistent for different periods and datasets. During year 0 of the composite La Ni\u00f1 a, negative SST anomalies expand westward from the eastern Pacific. A similar westward propagation is evident for the negative SST anomalies that develop in year 11 of the composite El Ni\u00f1 o. In contrast, the reintensification of the negative SST anomalies toward the end of year 11 of the composite La Ni\u00f1 a occurs simultaneously across the basin. The positive SST anomalies associated with the composite El Ni\u00f1 o show a westward propagation similar to that seen for La Ni\u00f1 a in the early part of the record (1900-47). However, there is almost no westward movement during the later portion of the record (1948-2008 and 1982-2008) for El Ni\u00f1 o, in contrast to La Ni\u00f1 a. Composites for different epochs of Pacific interdecadal variability suggest that they tend to propagate westward (eastward) during cold (warm) epochs of the Indo-Pacific region (not shown), consistent with earlier studies that suggest that the propagation characteristics of ENSO changed after the Pacific-wide climate regime shift in late 1970s (e.g., Fedorov and Philander 2000; Wang and An 2002; Trenberth et al. 2002) . McPhaden and Zhang (2009) discuss the asymmetry in the propagation characteristics of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a, which cannot be explained by existing theories.\nThe time evolution of equatorial SST and wind anomalies for the two most recent persistent cold phases (1998-2001 and 2007-09 ) is shown in Fig. 4 . These plots reveal remarkable SST and wind anomaly structures that repeat 2-4 yr in a row. The negative SST and easterly wind anomalies intensify in winter and weaken in spring-early summer. The SST anomalies reintensify in late 2008/early 2009 simultaneously across the basin, consistent with the composite La Ni\u00f1 a (Fig. 3) . However, the reintensified equatorial cooling in late 1999/early 2000 exhibits pronounced westward propagation west of 1408W, while the simultaneous reintensification across the basin occurred again in late 2000/early 2001. As in the La Ni\u00f1 a composite based on the OISST and NCEP-DOE reanalysis II, anomalous westerly winds develop east of 1408W after the wintertime peaks of SST cooling in each year (early 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2008) . In spring-summer of 2008, these anomalous westerly winds are associated with ;18C SST warming off the South American coast. The heat budget analysis by Nagura et al. (2008) for 08, 1408W during 1998-2001, on the other hand, suggests that these anomalous westerly winds weakened the westward equatorial ocean current and hence the meridional shear between the South Equatorial Current and North Equatorial Counter Current, which in turn reduced tropical instability wave activity. The associated decrease in horizontal heat advection counteracted the warming due to a change in local upwelling, slowing down the transition from La Ni\u00f1 a to El Ni\u00f1 o.\nb. Seasonal evolution of ocean-atmosphere anomalies in the Indo-Pacific region . The equatorial cooling, easterly wind, and negative precipitation anomalies associated with La Ni\u00f1 a endure through the following spring-summer in the western-central Pacific.\nCompared to the El Ni\u00f1 o composite, the Pacific precipitation anomalies in the La Ni\u00f1 a composite are displaced westward by 108-158 in longitude and the large equatorial wind anomalies extend farther into the western Pacific throughout the developing and mature phases (Fig. 5) . From Oct 0 to Dec 0 the equatorial westerly wind anomalies associated with El Ni\u00f1 o rapidly weaken in the far western Pacific, nearly disappearing west of 1608E. The equatorial easterly wind anomalies associated with La Ni\u00f1 a do not show such a weakening. In many strong El Ni\u00f1 os, surface wind anomalies even become easterly in the far western Pacific after the mature phase (not shown). This wind reversal is responsible for the termination of El Ni\u00f1 o in Weisberg and Wang's (1997) ''western Pacific oscillator'' mechanism.\nAfter the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1 o in Dec Fig. 5 ). Harrison and Vecchi (1999) argue that this southward wind shift hastens the termination of El Ni\u00f1 o. Using an atmospheric GCM, Vecchi (2006) shows that the climatological seasonal movement of the western Pacific warm pool south of the equator is responsible for the southward shift of atmospheric convection and wind anomalies near the end of year. Ohba and Ueda (2009) argue that the meridional shift of the wind anomalies does not occur during the mature phase of La Ni\u00f1 a because of the nonlinear atmospheric response to SST anomalies, prolonging the equatorial easterly wind anomalies and hence the cold phase of ENSO. Our analysis, however, shows that a similar wind shift also occurs during La Ni\u00f1 a two months later in Feb 11 (Fig. 5) . It is not clear why the southward wind shift during La Ni\u00f1 a is absent in Ohba and Ueda's (2009) analysis, but it may be due to the different temporal smoothing (3-month running mean), wind product (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis), or analysis method (onesided lag regression).\nIt has long been known that ENSO variability exerts a significant impact on the Indian Ocean (see Schott et al. 2009 for a recent review). In the El Ni\u00f1 o composite, positive SST anomalies appear over the western-central tropical Indian Ocean in Jun 0 and persist through the summer of year 11 (Fig. 5) . During El Ni\u00f1 o, atmospheric deep convection is suppressed over the tropical Indian Ocean due to a change in the Walker circulation. The resulting increase in incoming solar radiation is mainly responsible for the warming of the Indian Ocean (Klein et al. 1999) , with ocean dynamics also playing an important role in the southwestern part of the basin (Xie et al. 2002) . In the eastern part of the basin, on the other hand, anomalous southeasterly winds associated with the suppressed convection strengthen the climatological alongshore winds and coastal upwelling off the west coast of Sumatra, inducing negative SST anomalies (Fig. 5) . This zonal SST dipole is most pronounced in Oct 0 and then the eastern pole decays as the climatological winds reverse from southeasterly to northwesterly (Tokinaga and Tanimoto 2004) . In Oct 0 , precipitation increases over the positive SST anomalies in the western Indian Ocean, suggesting an active role of the Indian Ocean SST anomalies in modulating atmospheric circulation during El Ni\u00f1 o (Watanabe and Jin 2002) . During La Ni\u00f1 a, the Indian Ocean exhibits a similar pattern and the evolution of ocean-atmosphere anomalies as those during El Ni\u00f1 o with the sign reversed. Compared to the El Ni\u00f1 o composite, the cooling of the western-central Indian Ocean is slightly weaker and delayed in the La Ni\u00f1 a composite. The alongshore northwesterly wind anomalies and coastal SST warming off Sumatra are also weaker during Aug 0 and Oct 0 in La Ni\u00f1 a compared to El Ni\u00f1 o. The eastern Indian Ocean warming is more pronounced off the northwest coast of Australia and persists through the summer of year 11. Figure 6 shows latitude-time sections of composite SST, surface wind, and precipitation anomalies averaged over the far western (1408-1708E) and western-central (1708E-1508W) Pacific. This figure confirms that the seasonal evolution of composite wind anomalies is quite symmetric between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a over the westerncentral Pacific throughout the developing and mature phases. In the El Ni\u00f1 o (La Ni\u00f1 a) composite, the center of the wind anomalies shifts south of the equator in Dec 0 -Jan 11 (Jan 11 -Feb 11 ), with anomalous northerly (southerly) winds developing north of the equator. In the vicinity of the equator, the wind anomalies do not weaken prior to the mature phase. The precipitation anomalies are quite symmetric as well for El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a although the center south of the equator is slightly more pronounced during Dec 0 -Feb 11 in the El Ni\u00f1 o composite compared to the La Ni\u00f1 a composite. In the far western Pacific (1408-1708E), on the other hand, a strong asymmetry is evident in the ocean-atmosphere anomalies (Fig. 6) . During La Ni\u00f1 a, on the other hand, the negative precipitation anomalies are about 1.5 times as large as the positive precipitation anomalies for El Ni\u00f1 o and persist until fall of year 11. In this longitudinal band, the equatorial easterly wind anomalies continue to strengthen until Mar"}, {"section_title": "11", "text": ". The center of the easterly wind anomalies moves north and south of the equator following the seasonal migration of the climatological rainband (e.g., north of the equator in summer-early fall and south in late winter-spring).\nThe composite evolution of sea surface height, surface wind stress, and SST anomalies along the equator is shown for El Ni\u00f1 o, La Ni\u00f1 a, and their sum in Fig. 7 based on the SODA analysis and HadISST for 1958-2007. The sea surface height anomalies, a proxy for the thermocline depth anomalies, exhibit asymmetric evolution for El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a similar to that of the SST anomalies. The sea surface height anomalies precede the SST anomalies by approximately one month, indicative of the subsurface influence on SSTs. During year 0 the sea surface height anomalies propagate eastward in both El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a in contrast to the SST anomalies that show westward (La Ni\u00f1 a) or almost no phase propagation (El Ni\u00f1 o). In the sum of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a composites, easterly wind anomalies develop over the far western Pacific in Nov 0 due to the weakening of the westerly wind anomalies during El Ni\u00f1 o. These easterly wind anomalies are associated with negative sea surface height anomalies that propagate from the western to the central-eastern Pacific in Nov 0 -Feb 11 . These features suggest that during El Ni\u00f1 o the weakening of the westerly wind anomalies in Nov 0 forces an upwelling oceanic equatorial Kelvin wave that rapidly terminates the equatorial warming. The timing of this wind change indicates that it is not caused by the decay of the equatorial warming but rather the other way around. Indeed, observational and modeling studies suggest that in addition to Rossby wave reflection at the western boundary, wind changes in the western Pacific force a large part of equatorial Kelvin waves that contribute substantially to the demise of El Ni\u00f1 o in 1997/98 (McPhaden and Yu 1999; Delcroix et al. 2000; Picaut et al. 2002; Boulanger et al. 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "c. Impact of the Indian Ocean SST anomalies", "text": "Previous studies suggest that the basin warming of the tropical Indian Ocean is responsible for the weakening or reversal of equatorial westerly wind anomalies over the western Pacific at the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1 o (Annamalai et al. 2005; Kug and Kang 2006; Ohba and Ueda 2007; Yoo et al. 2010) . The Indian Ocean warming increases tropospheric temperatures by moist adiabatic adjustment in deep convection and forces a baroclinic atmospheric equatorial Kelvin wave into the Pacific. The resulting equatorial low pressure anomaly induces anomalous northeasterly winds over the northwest tropical Pacific, causing surface wind divergence and suppressed deep convection in the subtropics ). It was shown in Fig. 5 that composite ocean-atmosphere anomalies over the Indian Ocean exhibit a similar seasonal evolution between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a with the sign reversed. This raises the question, does the The composite seasonal evolution of tropospheric temperature, surface wind, and precipitation anomalies along the equator for El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a are compared in Ocean to the Pacific induces anomalous surface easterly winds at its eastern edge, weakening the anomalous westerly winds between 1108 and 1608W. During La Ni\u00f1 a, the tropospheric cooling over the Indian Ocean also forces anomalous westerly winds at its eastern edge. However, the surface wind anomalies in the western Pacific are also influenced by the negative precipitation anomalies over the western half of the basin that induce easterly wind anomalies. Thus, the westerly wind anomalies forced by the Indian Ocean compete with the easterly anomalies induced by the Pacific rainfall anomalies.\nWe conjecture that the reason why the Pacific influence wins out over the Indian Ocean influence during La Ni\u00f1 a but not during El Ni\u00f1 o is that the Pacific precipitation anomalies are located farther west during La Ni\u00f1 a compared to El Ni\u00f1 o, which in turn is due to the nonlinear response of precipitation to SSTs (Fig. 9) . Thus, the 108-158 longitudinal shift of precipitation anomalies in the Pacific between El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a events seems to make a difference in the balance of local and remote wind forcing over the western Pacific. This zonal shift of the deep convection anomalies is also evident in the composite analysis of cloudiness anomalies based on shipboard observations from the International Comprehensive OceanAtmosphere Dataset (Woodruff et al. 2008 ) before the CMAP data period (not shown). The eastward displacement of precipitation anomalies during El Ni\u00f1 o may also enable atmospheric circulation anomalies forced by negative SST and precipitation anomalies in the northwest tropical Pacific to affect the equatorial winds. Analysis of Indian Ocean SST anomalies for individual El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a events suggests that the Pacific events tend to decay more rapidly when the Indian Ocean SST anomalies 1958-2007. are stronger and develop earlier (not shown). A recent study by Izumo et al. (2010) shows that ENSO forecasts can be significantly improved by including the state of the Indian Ocean SST anomalies in a simple statistical model. Finally, we suggest that the lack of a reversal in sign of the easterly wind anomalies in the western Pacific is responsible for the prolongation of La Ni\u00f1 a into the next year. The return to normal conditions or transition to El Ni\u00f1 o may be achieved via a buildup of the equatorial heat content due to slow oceanic adjustment (e.g., Jin 1997; Meinen and McPhaden 2000) , as suggested by a gradual increase in the equatorially averaged sea surface height anomalies in the La Ni\u00f1 a composite (Fig. 7) and individual multiyear La Ni\u00f1 a events (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "By analyzing a suite of ocean-atmosphere data for the past 27-109 yr, we have shown that there is a strong asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a. Both El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a typically begin in late springsummer and intensify through the equatorial cold season. While most El Ni\u00f1 os terminate rapidly after peaking toward the end of the year, many La Ni\u00f1 as persist through the following spring-summer and reintensify in winter; some even last through a third year and again strengthen during winter. The negative SST anomalies associated with La Ni\u00f1 a propagate eastward during year 0, but the reintensified cooling near the end of year 11 occurs simultaneously across the Pacific. Although this asymmetry in duration has been noted in a few recent studies, we demonstrate that it is a robust feature of ENSO variability throughout the past century.\nThe proposed mechanism for this asymmetric duration is summarized in a schematic diagram (Fig. 9) . Because of the nonlinear response of atmospheric deep convection to SSTs, the center of the anomalous precipitation is displaced 108-158 of longitude farther west during La Ni\u00f1 a compared to El Ni\u00f1 o. Through the developing and mature phases of La Ni\u00f1 a, the suppressed atmospheric convection drives strong anomalous easterly winds over much of the western Pacific. El Ni\u00f1 o exhibits a similar structure with reversed sign, except that a month prior to the mature phase, anomalous westerly winds begin to weaken in the far western Pacific. As suggested from previous studies, the delayed basin warming of the Indian Ocean increases tropospheric temperatures and forces a baroclinic atmospheric Kelvin wave into the western Pacific during El Ni\u00f1 o. The easterly winds induced by this Kelvin wave weaken the anomalous westerly winds over the western Pacific. The same mechanism appears to work during La Ni\u00f1 a, with the Kelvin wave forced by the basin cooling of the Indian Ocean inducing anomalous westerly winds at its eastern edge. However, the impact of local precipitation changes is so large that the anomalous equatorial winds remain easterly over the western Pacific. The enhanced duration of zonal wind anomalies in the western Pacific during La Ni\u00f1 a compared to El Ni\u00f1 o in turn leads to the prolongation of La Ni\u00f1 a conditions into a second and sometimes even a third year. Preliminary analysis of atmospheric GCM experiments support this hypothesis, the results of which will be reported in a separate paper.\nOur analysis focuses on strong El Ni\u00f1 os and La Ni\u00f1 as for which the Ni\u00f1 o-3.4 index exceeds one standard deviation at the mature phase (December). There is no apparent asymmetry in the duration of weaker warm and cold phases (see Fig. 1 SST anomalies are often centered in the central Pacific and do not extend to the South American coast (Ashok et al. 2007; Kug et al. 2009; Kao and Yu 2009) . Hoerling et al. (2001) also suggest that atmospheric deep convection responds linearly to moderate positive and negative SST anomalies. Thus, both the SST anomalies and the atmospheric deep convection response lack spatial asymmetry in weaker events. Warm events that do not develop until late summer-fall tend to be weaker and persist longer into the second year (Horii and Hanawa 2004) . The late onset may delay and weaken the Indian Ocean SST response and hence the remote negative feedback to the western Pacific (Sooraj et al. 2009 ). The timing, pattern, and magnitude of SST anomalies in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans appear to be important factors controlling the persistence of individual El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a events, as well as intraseasonal variability that causes event to event differences .\nCoupled ocean-atmosphere models need to be examined for their ability to simulate not only the asymmetry in amplitude, but also the asymmetry in duration of the warm and cold phases of ENSO. A realistic simulation of the climatological rainbands in the tropical Pacific and ENSO-related SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean are a prerequisite. A cursory look at the 2000-yr control integration of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model version 2.1 (GFDL CM2.1) indicates that this model exhibits asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a similar to what we have found in the observational record (Wittenberg 2009 ; see his Fig. 1 ) while a century-long control integration of the Community Climate System Model version 3 (Neale et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2009 ) shows very weak ENSO asymmetry. Analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multimodel dataset by Ohba et al. (2010) indicates that the observed asymmetry in the duration of El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a is poorly simulated in most coupled GCM except in a few models including the GFDL CM2.1. Compared to the models that simulate the transition of El Ni\u00f1 os to La Ni\u00f1 as after the mature phase, the models that simulate more persistent El Ni\u00f1 os show equatorial Pacific precipitation anomalies displaced farther west because of the unrealistically strong climatological cold tongue. In these models, the basin warming of the Indian Ocean is also much weaker than in the models of high El Ni\u00f1 o-toLa Ni\u00f1 a transitivity. Ohba et al. (2010) argue that the westward shift of the Pacific precipitation anomalies allows equatorial wind anomalies to persist longer over the western Pacific, in agreement with our hypothesis. These results reaffirm the importance of realistic simulation of the mean climate for realistic simulation of ENSO. Long simulations of climate models that successfully simulate the observed ENSO asymmetries will provide an opportunity to assess how these aspects of ENSO may be modulated by climate change and variability with longer time scales."}]
