The repository contains aggregated data collected NeuroImage 124 (2016) [1149] [1150] [1151] [1152] [1153] [1154] at 10 sites in the United States. Multimodal neuroimaging data, developmental histories, behavioral and cognitive assessments, and/or genomewide genotypes are now available for 1493 children and adolescents, aged 3 to 21 years. The goal of PING was to address the imbalance in existing imaging genomics data resources between those containing data collected from adult and elderly participants and the very limited data available from pediatric and adolescent participants. A wide pediatric age range for participants was included to allow investigators to search for interactions between age and genotype (i.e., to discover gene associations with developmental phenotypes). The PING infrastructure was designed specifically to address the challenges of large, multi-site studies involving multimodal imaging and assessment of behavioral phenotypes in a developmental context, and to facilitate the exploration as well as the dissemination of the sharable data. While PING was a cross-sectional study, all features of the PING infrastructure were designed to be extensible to longitudinal designs and the infrastructure currently supports ongoing longitudinal studies that have followed PING. Below we describe briefly the PING study and cohort; procedures for facilitating, standardizing, and optimizing data acquisition; procedures for processing the imaging and genomics data; and the infrastructure for sharing and exploration of accumulated data."}, {"section_title": "The PING cohort", "text": "Participants were recruited through local postings and outreach activities conducted in the greater metropolitan areas of Baltimore, Boston, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New Haven, New York, Sacramento, and San Diego. Children, adolescents, and young adults were screened as eligible for PING if they were between the ages of 3 and 20 years and fluent in English (some older 20-year-olds turned 21 by the completion of data collection). Exclusion criteria included: a) neurological disorders; b) history of head trauma; c) preterm birth (less than 36 weeks); d) diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or mental retardation; e) pregnancy; and f) daily illicit drug use by the mother for more than one trimester. Individuals with contraindications for MRI (such as dental braces, metallic or electronic implants, or claustrophobia) were also excluded from participating. Individuals with identified or suspected learning disability or ADHD were not excluded since these syndromes are fairly common in pediatric populations. Over 1700 participants were enrolled in PING at one of the 10 sites, however, only data from participants in whom acceptable data were obtained for at least two data types (i.e., demographic/ developmental, behavioral, genomic, imaging) are included in the PING repository. This sample consists of 1493 participants (780 males) for whom acceptable imaging, genomics, and/or cognition assessments were obtained; acceptable imaging data were acquired for 1239 of these participants (645 males); acceptable cognition data for 1453 participants (752 males), and acceptable genotyping is available for 1391 (719 males). Similar proportions of males and females participated across the entire age range. Written parental informed consent was obtained for all PING subjects below the age of 18, and child assent was also obtained for all participants between the ages of 7 and 17. Written informed consent was obtained directly from all participants aged 18 years or older. For more information about the PING cohort, see Brown et al. (2012) and Akshoomoff et al.

The NTCB was designed to tap key functions (executive function, attention, episodic memory, working memory, language, and processing speed) across the lifespan (ages 3 to 85 years). This computerized approach provides an economical method for assessing a wide range of cognitive abilities, which is appealing for large-scale studies. For pediatric studies, this also has the advantage of providing the same set of measures for use with young children, older children, and adolescents in an appealing format that provides automated data collection, storage, and scoring (Keator et al., 2008; McCarty et al., 2014) .

Specifically, a standard PING scan session included: 1) a 3D T 1 -weighted inversion prepared RF-spoiled gradient echo scan using prospective motion correction (PROMO), for cortical and subcortical segmentation; 2) a 3D T2-weighted variable flip angle fast spin echo scan, also using PROMO, for detection and quantification of white matter lesions and segmentation of CSF; 3) a high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) scan, with integrated B 0 distortion correction (DISCO), for segmentation of white matter tracts and measurement of diffusion parameters; and 4) a resting state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scan, with integrated distortion correction.

Through the involvement of PING neuroimaging investigators in the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the group has led the development of a fully automated procedure to correct for gradient field nonlinearities using displacement maps computed based on scanner-specific specifications provided by the MRI scanner manufacturers. The correction software developed in the UCSD MultiModal Imaging Laboratory (MMIL) was adopted as part of the routine pre-processing routine for all scans acquired as part of ADNI, and has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of longitudinal change estimates based on serial MRI scans (Holland and Dale, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Motion correction (PROMO)", "text": "An important recent advance in MRI acquisition technology is the development of real-time, or prospective, motion correction. The PROMO approach (White et al., 2010) , first applied widely in PING, utilizes three orthogonal spiral navigators together with a recursive image-based estimation strategy based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for motion measurement. The spiral k-space trajectory allows image-domain reconstruction prior to motion estimation, which when combined with the flexible EKF framework, allows for efficient image-based tracking within an a priori region of interest. Significant reduction of motion-related image degradation in pediatric imaging is possible with this method (Brown et al., 2010; Kuperman et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "EPI B 0 distortion correction (DISCO)", "text": "Single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) is an efficient MRI acquisition scheme for producing fast, high-definition images for diffusion weighted imaging and fMRI. However, EPI suffers from severe spatial distortions and intensity variations due to susceptibility-induced B 0 field inhomogeneity. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for integrating the HARDI and fMRI images with anatomical (T 1 -weighted) images in PING, i.e., for achieving accurate spatial registration of the information from different modalities. Since the B 0 distortion pattern depends on the exact position of the subject in the scanner, which may vary across scan sessions, correcting for such distortions is also essential for obtaining accurate estimates of change based on longitudinal MRI scans. Our group has developed a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for removing such spatial and intensity distortions from the EPI images obtained for HARDI and fMRI (Holland et al., 2010) . The method involves acquisition of brief scans with opposite phase encoding polarities (resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns) and subsequent alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. The DISCO method, which requires minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy and better crossmodality registration relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach."}, {"section_title": "Multimodal image analysis", "text": "Morphometric analysis of structural MRI data was performed using a specialized processing stream developed for PING that is based on FreeSurfer, with additional corrections and analyses developed at UCSD MMIL."}, {"section_title": "Structural MRI preprocessing", "text": "As described above, distortions caused by nonlinearity of the spatial encoding gradient fields were corrected with predefined, scanner specific, nonlinear transformations, provided by MRI scanner manufacturers (Jovicich et al., 2006) .

Cortical surface reconstruction involves skullstripping (S\u00e9gonne et al., 2004) , non-uniformity correction (Sled et al., 1998) , white matter segmentation, initial mesh creation (Dale et al., 1999) , correction of topological defects (Fischl et al., 2001; S\u00e9gonne et al., 2007) , and generation of optimal white and pial surfaces (Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale, 2000) . Subcortical structures were labeled using an automated, atlas-based, volumetric segmentation procedure (Fischl et al., 2002) ; volumes in mm 3 and average T 1 -weighted intensity (T1w) were calculated for each structure. Labels for cortical gray matter and underlying white matter voxels were assigned based on surface-based nonlinear registration to atlas based on gyral and sulcal patterns (Fischl et al., 1999b) and Bayesian classification rules (Desikan et al., 2006; Destrieux et al., 2010; Fischl et al., 2004; Salat et al., 2009 ). White matter voxels adjacent to the cortical parcels were also labeled (Salat et al., 2009 ). Fuzzy-cluster parcellations based on genetic correlation of surface area were used to calculate weighted averages of cortical surface measures (Chen et al., 2012) . Cortical thickness was calculated as the shortest distance between the white and pial surfaces (Fischl and Dale, 2000) . Maps of relative cortical areal expansion were created by resampling individual subject surfaces to a standard tessellation, such that the area assigned to each mesh vertex reflects the degree of expansion or contraction relative to the atlas (Chen et al., 2012; Joyner et al., 2009 ). T1w was sampled to the cortical surface at a distance of \u00b10.2 mm along the normal vector at each surface location, and T1w cortical contrast was calculated from gray and white matter values (Westlye et al., 2009 ). Average thickness, area, and T1w were calculated for each cortical parcel.

T 2 -weighted intensity (T2w) was calculated from the b = 0 image (averaged if multiple b = 0 images). To remove arbitrary intensity variation across subjects due to scanner settings (i.e., gain), T2w images were normalized for each subject. A linear fit with zero intercept was calculated between MD and b = 0 intensity values using each voxel within a brain mask as a separate data point. The slope of the linear relationship was used to scale the T2w images.\nAtlasTrack was used to automatically label long-range white matter tracts based on a probabilistic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations (Hagler et al., 2009 ). The fiber atlas contains prior probabilities and orientation information for specific long-range projection fibers, including some additional fiber tracts not included in the original description, such as cortico-striate connections and inferior to superior frontal cortico-cortical connections.\nImaging variables associated with morphometry are identified in the PING ontology and data dictionary with the prefix \"MRI_\" followed by additional labels appropriate for specific measures (e.g., \"cort_area\", \"cort_thick\", \"subcort_vol\", etc.); and those associated with diffusion data with the prefix \"DTI_\" followed by additional labels appropriate for specific measures (e.g., \"fiber\", \"aseg\").

The reference panel was created in a stepwise fashion in order to ensure that the included individuals were not admixed among six major continental populations (African, Central Asian, East Asian, European, Native American, and Oceanic) and that each continental population was represented by a reasonably large number of diverse individuals originating in the relevant continent. The assembled reference panel contained genotype information at 16,433 strand-unambiguous SNPs. These markers exhibited low LD (r-squared less than 0.1 was observed between 99% of marker pairs), and allele frequency was higher than 1%.\nTo assess ancestry and admixture proportions in the PING participants, we used a supervised clustering approach implemented in the ADMIXTURE software (Alexander et al., 2009 ) and probabilistically assigned each participant to six clusters corresponding to the six major continental populations. The genotype profiles of the six populations were defined by the individuals who made up the reference panel. Although some individuals could be easily associated with a particular continental population, other individuals were clearly admixed. Such admixture could easily be associated with important phenotypic variation and hence needs to be quantified (Goetz et al., 2014; Norden-Krichmar et al., 2014; Nievergelt et al., 2014; Libiger and Schork, 2012) .

First, raw image data in DICOM format is distributed using the dedicated image distribution platform on NITRC.org. The system used by NITRC (XNAT) is specifically built to host and download data across widearea networks. Processed imaging and genetics data are also shared by PING using hard drives that can be ordered as PING-IN-A-BOX systems.\nThe hard drive is shipped to customers (drive and shipping costs are billed to the recipient) and contains data in DICOM, Nifti, MGZ, and plink binary formats for easy integration into other existing postprocessing pipelines.\nAlthough PING data are publicly available, new data cannot be contributed into the PING data repository from outside sources.

In contrast to many data sharing tools, the Portal also integrates appropriate statistical modeling capabilities, with structured descriptors for all of the PING measurements and an intuitive user interface to control diverse quality control and analysis workflows.\nThe Portal supports online collaborative exploration of interrelationships among measurements obtained from structural, behavioral, and genetic analyses. Using this web application, a user can select a specific variable of interest (e.g., cortical thickness) from the data dictionary and, with a single click of a button fit a statistical model (e.g., generalized additive model; GAM) with one or more independent variables and covariates (e.g., age, sex, scanner, genetic ancestry factor), and plot the resulting model fits along with the individual data points. For example, using the Portal one can interactively produce a scatter plot of each participant's total cortical surface area as a function of age, color-coded by sex, and controlling for other factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and genetically derived ethnic ancestry. This statistical model can then be applied to every cortical vertex to produce a map of this relationship between age and surface area with covariates of interest. Main effects and interactions can be modeled for summary variables, averages, or by vertex, and displayed interactively, in real-time, using a WebGL-based application with control over color mapping, orientation of brain hemispheres, and corrections for multiple comparisons by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) (Genovese et al., 2002) . The same modeling functions can be applied to region of interest analyses either specified by the user or using built-in cortical parcellations from Freesurfer.\nThe model, or query, can then be stored by the user and shared with other users. The ease of interaction permits deeper understanding of the complex relationships within the dataset and facilitates the discovery of hidden structure in the data. In PING, for example, the Portal has been an effective way to visualize scanner effects and the results of different methods for modeling them. The Portal supports an online chat feature that is used to send model descriptions to other people visiting the page, as well as a user feedback forum monitored by the developer. Users can construct and download datasets, statistical reports, results tables, model specifications, and figures for off-line analysis, archiving, or publication."}]
