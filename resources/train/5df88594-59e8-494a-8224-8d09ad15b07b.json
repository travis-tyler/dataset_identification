[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report provides nationally representative data on public school safety and discipline for the 2013-14 school year. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) previously collected data on this topic in the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), which was last conducted in the 2009-10 school year (Neiman 2011). This report presents results from the survey, School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14, which collected information on specific safety and discipline plans and practices, training for classroom teachers and aides related to school safety and discipline issues, security personnel, frequency of specific discipline problems, and number of incidents of various offenses. NCES, in the Institute of Education Sciences, conducted this survey in spring 2014 using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). FRSS is a survey system designed to collect small amounts of issue-oriented data from a nationally representative sample of districts, schools, or teachers with minimal burden on respondents and within a relatively short period of time. The survey on school safety and discipline was mailed to approximately 1,600 regular public schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The cover letter indicated that the survey was designed to be completed by the person most knowledgeable about safety and discipline at the school. Respondents were asked to provide information for the 2013-14 school year to date, and were offered options of completing the survey on paper or online. The unweighted survey response rate was 86 percent and the weighted response rate using the initial base weights was 85 percent. The survey weights were adjusted for questionnaire nonresponse and the data were then weighted to yield national estimates that represent all eligible regular public schools in the United States. Tables of standard error estimates are provided in appendix A. See the technical notes (appendix B) for detailed information about the survey methodology. Appendix B also includes definitions of the analysis variables (i.e., school characteristics) and terms used in the report. The questionnaire is located in appendix C. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data from the survey through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only selected findings are presented. These findings have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available from the FRSS study rather than to discuss all of the data collected; they are not meant to emphasize any particular issue. Readers are cautioned not to make causal inferences about the data presented here. The findings are based on self-reported data from public schools. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. \u2022 Eighty-eight percent of public schools had a written plan of procedures in case of shootings or active shooters in the school (table 3), and 70 percent of all public schools had drilled students on the use of this plan during the 2013-14 school year (table 4). Seventy-two percent of public schools had a written plan of procedures for suicide threats or incidents (table 3). \u2022 Forty-three percent of public schools had some type of security personnel present at the school at least once a week 2 (table 5). By instructional level, 29 percent of elementary, 63 percent of middle, and 64 percent of high school/combined schools had such personnel. 3 Across all levels, schools had 46,290 of these personnel working full time at the school and 36,110 working part time at the school (table 6). Including students in all schools, the number of students per security personnel was 580 (table 7). 4 \u2022 Within the 43 percent of public schools with security personnel present at the school at least once a week, these personnel participated in various activities at the school, including security enforcement and patrol (at 90 percent of schools), coordinating with local police and emergency teams (at 88 percent of schools), and mentoring students (at 66 percent of schools; table 8). \u2022 Student bullying was reported to occur at least once a month 5 at 37 percent of public schools and on occasion at 61 percent of public schools (table 9). By instructional level, student bullying was reported to occur at least once a month at 29 percent of elementary, 56 percent of middle, and 42 percent of high school/combined schools. Student verbal abuse of teachers was reported to occur at least once a month at 10 percent of public schools and on occasion at 55 percent of public schools. \u2022 Overall, 65 percent of public schools reported that at least one violent incident 6 occurred at school during the 2013-14 school year (table 10). 7 Violent incidents were reported at 53 percent of elementary schools, 88 percent of middle schools, and 78 percent of high school/combined schools. The rate of violent incidents per 1,000 students was 13.5 in elementary schools, 23.6 in middle schools, and 14.3 in high school/combined schools. 8 \u2022 Overall, 13 percent of public schools reported that at least one serious violent incident 9 had occurred at school (table 10). The rate of serious violent incidents per 1,000 students was 0.5. \u2022 Two percent of public schools reported at least one physical attack or fight with a weapon and 58 percent reported this type of incident without a weapon (table 11). Public schools also reported threats of physical attack with a weapon (9 percent) and without a weapon (47 percent). \u2022 The percentage distribution of public schools by the number of serious violent incidents was 87 percent with none, 7 percent with 1 incident, 3 percent with 2 incidents, 3 percent with 3-5 incidents, and 1 percent with 6 or more incidents (table 12).

This includes penetration from a foreign object. Both male and female students can be victims of rape. 4 Sexual battery was defined as an incident that includes threatened rape, fondling, indecent liberties, child molestation, or sodomy. Both male and female students can be victims of sexual battery. Classification of these incidents should take into consideration the age and developmentally appropriate behavior of the offender(s). 5 Robbery was defined as the taking or attempting to take anything of value that is owned by another person or organization, under confrontational circumstances by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear. A key difference between robbery and theft/larceny is that robbery involves a threat or battery. Respondents were asked to report robbery but not theft/larceny (theft/larceny was defined as the unlawful taking of another person's property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm). 6 Physical attack or fight was defined as an actual and intentional touching or striking of another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of bodily harm to an individual.

FRSS is designed to collect issue-oriented data within a relatively short time frame. FRSS collects data from state education agencies, local education agencies, public and private elementary and secondary schools, public school teachers, and public libraries. To ensure minimal burden on respondents, the surveys are generally limited to three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. Sample sizes are relatively small (usually about 1,200 to 1,800 respondents per survey) so that data collection can be completed quickly. Data are weighted to produce national estimates of the sampled education sector. The sample size permits limited breakouts by analysis variables. However, as the number of categories within any single analysis variable increases, the sample size within categories decreases, which results in larger sampling errors for the breakouts by analysis variables."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "The sample for the FRSS survey of School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14 consisted of approximately 1,600 regular public elementary, middle, and high school/combined schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nationally representative sample was selected from the 2011-12 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe file, which was the most current file available at the time of selection. The sampling frame included 50,807 regular elementary schools, 16,536 regular middle schools, and 19,247 regular high school/combined schools. For purposes of this study, \"regular\" schools included charter schools. Excluded from the sampling frame were schools with a high grade of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or ungraded, schools with zero, missing, or \"not applicable\" enrollment, along with special education, vocational, and alternative/other schools, and schools outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia. A school was defined as an elementary school if the lowest grade was less than or equal to grade 3 and the highest grade was less than or equal to grade 8. A middle school was defined as having a lowest grade greater than or equal to grade 4 and a highest grade less than or equal to grade 9. All other eligible schools were defined as high school/combined. The public school sampling frame was stratified by instructional level (elementary, middle, and high school/ combined), community type (city, suburban, town, and rural), and enrollment size (less than 300, 300 to 499, 500 to 999, and 1,000 or more) to create 45 primary strata. Within each stratum, schools were sorted by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) and percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment in the school (missing, 96 percent or more, 81 to 95 percent, 51 to 80 percent, and 50 percent or less) prior to selection to induce additional implicit stratification. These variables are defined in more detail in the \"Definitions of Analysis Variables\" section of these technical notes.

Therefore, if violent incidents occurred in the school between the time that the survey was completed and the end of the school year, information about these incidents is not included in the survey data. This approach is consistent with the approach used on NCES's School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), which was last conducted in the 2009-10 school year. One of the goals of the current survey is to allow comparisons to SSOCS data. Of the approximately 1,600 public schools in the sample, approximately 25 were found to be ineligible because the school was closed or did not meet some other criterion for inclusion in the sample (e.g., was an alternative school). For the eligible schools, an unweighted response rate of 86 percent was obtained for this survey (about 1,350 responding schools divided by the approximately 1,575 eligible schools in the sample). The corresponding weighted response rate using the initial base weights was 85 percent (table B-1). Among the respondents who completed the survey, 62 percent completed it via the Web, 37 percent completed it by paper (sent by mail, fax, or e-mail), and 2 percent completed it by telephone.

The missing items included both numerical data such as the number of violent incidents that occurred at school, as well as categorical data, such as whether the school had a particular safety practice. The missing data were imputed using a \"hot-deck\" approach to obtain a \"donor\" school from which the imputed values were derived. Under the hot-deck approach, a donor school that matched selected characteristics of the school with missing data (the recipient school) was identified (Kalton 1983, pp. 65-104). The matching characteristics included instructional level, enrollment size, community type, region, and percent White, non-Hispanic enrollment in the school. In addition, other relevant questionnaire items were used to form appropriate imputation groupings. Once a donor was found, the imputed value was simply the corresponding value from the donor school."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Although the survey on school safety and discipline was designed to account for sampling error and to minimize nonsampling error, estimates produced from the data collected are subject to both types of error. Sampling error occurs because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population, and nonsampling errors are errors made during the collection and processing of the data."}, {"section_title": "Weighting and Sampling Errors", "text": "The responses were weighted to produce national estimates (table B-1). The weights were designed to reflect the probabilities of selection of the sampled schools and were adjusted for differential unit (questionnaire) nonresponse. The nonresponse weighting adjustments were made within classes defined by instructional level, community type, and enrollment size. Within the final weighting classes, the base weights (i.e., the reciprocal of schools' probabilities of selection) of the responding schools were inflated by the inverse of the weighted response rate for the class. The findings in this report are estimates based on the sample selected and, consequently, are subject to sampling variability. Because the survey data were collected using a complex sampling design, the variances of the estimates from the survey (e.g., estimates of proportions) are typically different from what would be expected from data collected with a simple random sample. Not taking the complex sample design into account can lead to an under-or overestimation of the standard errors associated with such estimates. To generate accurate standard errors for the estimates in this report, standard errors were computed using a technique known as jackknife replication (Levy and Lemeshow 1991). A form of jackknife replication referred to as the JK1 method was used to construct the replicates. As with any replication method, jackknife replication involves constructing a number of subsamples (replicates) from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for each replicate. The mean square error of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic. To construct the replications, 100 stratified subsamples of the full sample were created and then dropped one at a time to define 100 jackknife replicates. Estimates of standard errors can be computed using statistical packages such as SAS or WesVar. The standard error is a measure of the variability of an estimate due to sampling. It indicates the variability of a sample estimate that would be obtained from all possible samples of a given design and size. Standard errors are used as a measure of the precision expected from a particular sample. If all possible samples were surveyed under similar conditions, intervals of 1.96 standard errors below to 1.96 standard errors above a particular statistic would include the true population parameter being estimated in about 95 percent of the samples. This B-4 is a 95 percent confidence interval. For example, the estimated percent of public schools that control access to school grounds during school hours is 43 percent, and the standard error is 1.5 percent (tables 1 and 1a). The 95 percent confidence interval for the statistic extends from [43 -(1.5 x 1.96)] to [43 + (1.5 x 1.96)], or from 40.1 to 45.9 percent. The 1.96 is the appropriate percentile from a standard normal distribution corresponding to a two-sided statistical test at the p < .05 significance level (where .05 indicates the 5 percent of all possible samples that would be outside the range of the confidence interval). Comparisons can be tested for statistical significance at the p < .05 level using Student's t-statistic to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. 2 Student's t values are computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors."}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Errors", "text": "Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations and data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems such as unit and item nonresponse, differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of questions, response differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted, and mistakes made during data preparation. It is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. To minimize the potential for nonsampling error, this study used a variety of procedures, including a pretest of the questionnaire with school-level personnel considered to be the most knowledgeable about safety and discipline at the school. The pretest provided the opportunity to check for consistency of interpretation of questions and definitions and to eliminate ambiguous items. The questionnaire and instructions were also extensively reviewed by NCES. In addition, extensive editing of the questionnaire responses was conducted to check the data for accuracy and consistency.
