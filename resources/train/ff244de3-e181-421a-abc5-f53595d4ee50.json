Conversely, not investing in or cutting programs that produce school readiness results in increased spending and lost benefits for: \uf06e Schools -through higher special education costs, higher costs of grade repetition, and lost aid as unprepared students become unsuccessful students and eventually some become dropouts. \uf06e Taxpayers -through higher costs of dealing with juvenile and adult criminals; through higher welfare, Medicaid and unemployment costs; and through lower tax revenues as unsuccessful students become unproductive adults. \uf06e The public -not only through higher school costs and higher taxes, but also through injuries and property losses, as some juveniles and adults turn to criminal activity. \uf06e The economy -through an inability to compete nationally and internationally due to a higher tax burden and a less educated and skilled workforce. Beginning in the 1980s, Michigan began making investments in fully preparing young children for school -cognitively, physically, socially and emotionally. Currently Michigan's Great Start system encompasses both early childhood services and a strategic plan for the state's early childhood system of programs, services, and supports for children from birth to age five and their families. One element of that system, the Great Start Readiness Program (GSRP), in concert with federally-funded Head Start programs, serves over 47,000 low-income 4-year-olds annually through either a half-day or full-day program of educational preparation. Economists and economic development officials agree that any strategies to enhance the long-term growth of Michigan must include maintaining and upgrading the quality of its workforce. Yet some recent Michigan data raise the discomfiting prospect that the educational attainment of the state's workforce may decline as retiring workers are replaced by the young people who are currently finishing or (in too many cases) not finishing school. This study estimates the current cost savings and revenues to Michigan generated from the investments in school readiness over the past 25 years, the cost burden to Michigan when children are not fully-prepared at kindergarten entry, and the additional benefits that could be realized if Michigan were to expand its investment in school readiness to all educationally disadvantaged children."}, {"section_title": "Current cost savings and revenues", "text": "The cost savings and revenues realized in 2009 due to the investments in school readiness over the past 25 years is an estimated $1.15 billion. This study provides estimates of the dollar value of benefits to Michigan in 2009 generated by current school children who received early education services and by young adults who have been more successful because of school readiness programs. Schools \uf06e $221 million in k-12 savings: \uf8e7 $136 million in reduced spending because fewer K-12 students repeated a grade \uf8e7 $69 million in reduced special education spending for disabilities that have been prevented or ameliorated through early intervention such as mild or moderate speech or language problems, cognitive impairment, specific learning disabilities, emotional impairment, and other health problems \uf8e7 $16 million in reduced costs of replacing teachers who leave their jobs due to dissatisfaction with working conditions related to student behavior or performance that are influenced by improved school readiness Moreover, school budgets are higher by an estimated $125 million, funding they would have lost if more current students prepared by early education had dropped out. This amount isn't counted with the other benefits to Michigan because, technically, the schools get more money but it is merely a transfer from the taxpayers, thus netting to zero for the state as a whole. Taxpayers \uf06e $584 million in reduced government spending and increased tax revenues: \uf8e7 $214 million in juvenile corrections, which includes reduced costs to arrest, adjudicate, and detain juvenile offenders \uf8e7 $106 million in reduced substantiated child abuse and neglect, including the costs of out-of-home placement \uf8e7 $94 million in adult criminal justice, which includes reduced costs to arrest, process, and incarcerate adult offenders \uf8e7 $66 million in reduced spending by the state on welfare (TANF) and Medicaid due to the improved employment outcomes for disadvantaged children who have reached adulthood \uf8e7 $40 million in reduced unemployment benefits due to improved employment outcomes for disadvantaged children who have reached adulthood \uf8e7 $31 million in reduced child care subsidies for families who are eligible for child care subsidy payments but do not use the subsidy while their children are enrolled in the early education program \uf8e7 $33 million in increased income tax and sales tax revenue due to both higher wages for disadvantaged children who have reached adulthood and higher productivity of parents while their children are enrolled in early education programs The public \uf06e $347 million in reduced social costs to the public: \uf8e7 $162 million in reduced tangible losses to victims of violent crimes and property offenses committed by juveniles \uf8e7 $97 million in reduced tangible losses to victims of violent crimes and property offenses committed by adults \uf8e7 $74 million in increased productivity and incomes of employed parents while their children are enrolled in early education programs \uf8e7 $14 million in health savings due to reduced alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers and adults who benefited from school readiness programs when they were children The economy Based on past participation and success rates of early education programs in Michigan, an estimated 80,000 adults, age 18 to 29, in the Michigan labor force today are high school graduates who likely would have dropped out of school if not for Michigan's past investment in their school readiness. These people contribute more to state government than they use in government services, but had they not graduated they would have been a net fiscal drain on the state. The estimated economic impact of these adults is about $1.3 billion annually, including the $584 million described above in reduced government spending and increased tax revenues and at least $700 million in additional wages they have generated."}, {"section_title": "Ongoing costs when children are not fully-prepared at kindergarten entry", "text": "The ongoing cost burden of not investing in school readiness for all disadvantaged children is an estimated $598 million per year.

Mott Foundation on the multiple impacts of high school dropouts on the Michigan economy. We used both current and historical expenditure and enrollment data for Michigan schools from the Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI) and the Michigan Department of Education, as well as data from early education programs in the state. In some cases, we made conservative assumptions using Minnesota or national data when current Michigan data was limited or unavailable. The estimates presented here, based heavily on studies of early childhood education, represent conservative estimates of the value conveyed by the school readiness produced by the total array of early childhood investments in Michigan.

Conversely, those benefits will rise if the state sustains its current level of investment and will increase exponentially as a result of increased investment in the Great Start Readiness Program, Great Start system, and other high-quality and comprehensive programs that promote early educational preparation."}, {"section_title": "The estimated annual cost of expanding the Great Start School Readiness Program to all eligible children IS AT MOST $236 MILLION, BASED ON A COST OF $6,800 FOR A FULL-DAY PROGRAM PER NEW STUDENT.

These calculations represent savings that would be lost and costs that would be added, if the state's current investment in early education were discontinued. \uf06e Second, it estimates the cost burden to Michigan when all children do not arrive at the kindergarten door ready for school. This analysis examines additional savings that could be realized and costs avoided in coming years if Michigan were to expand its investment in early education to all eligible low-income children. \uf06e Third, the study estimates the current and potential impact of school readiness on economic activity and the overall vitality of the state's economy. Beyond costing Michigan money by not investing in school readiness, without greater school readiness, Michigan will lack a more educated and skilled workforce, and the state's economic competitiveness, and ultimately, its economic growth will suffer. In particular, the range of costs saved by the state from increased school readiness and the potential costs to Michigan of not investing in school readiness include: \uf06e The estimated portion of the actual costs to K-12, government programs, and the private sector that can be attributed to children entering kindergarten not fully prepared; \uf06e Avoidable potential costs to K-12 and other state department spending related to an increase in school readiness; and \uf06e The estimated lost earnings and tax revenues that can be attributed to children entering kindergarten not fully prepared. This study replicates models and methods used in a recent study in Minnesota that translates the best research on the returns associated with comprehensive early childhood education (ECE) into usable estimates of the actual cost burdens to be expected from reducing or not expanding such investments that support school readiness. The Minnesota study, commissioned by the Bush Foundation, focused solely on the K-12 school system as a whole. This study, using Michigan data, expands the focus to include estimated costs and savings to additional state departments, state-funded programs, and an estimation of the implied future gains in economic activity in Michigan. The study design and source of data were modified based on review and discussion with stakeholders identified by the Early Childhood Investment Corporation (ECIC), see Acknowledgements."}, {"section_title": "Overview of early childhood education cost/benefit literature", "text": "Many studies show that high-quality early learning experiences pay off in the long run (Ehrlich, E. and Kornblatt, T., 2004;Karoly, L.A., Kilburn, M.R., & Cannon, J.S., 2005;Friedman, D.E., 2004;Lynch, R.G., 2007;Temple, J.A. & Reynolds, A.J., 2005;Reynolds, A.J., 2007;Rolnick and Grunewald, 2003). Most of the return on investment is in reduced public costs associated with child welfare, public assistance, crime and incarceration, and benefits related to increased education and earnings. Several studies focus specifically on measuring the effects of early childhood interventions and quality early care and education on school systems and time spent in K-12 special education and special education spending (Barnett, S.W., 1995;Belfield, C.R., 2004;Conyers, L.M., Reynolds, A.J., and Ou, S., 2003;Harvey, J., 2006;Reynolds, 2007). Other studies focus on the impact of early childhood education programs on other areas of government spending, including criminal justice, welfare, public assistance, Medicaid, unemployment, child welfare, health care, and child care (Aos et al., 2004;Mann and Reynolds, 2006;Nores et al., 2005;Oppenheim and MacGregor, 2002;Reynolds et al. 2002). Finally, some studies have illustrated the effect of early childhood education on increased tax revenues from higher earnings of mothers of children who participate, and more commonly, from increased earnings of participants themselves, and future generations due to higher educational attainment that can be attributed to early childhood interventions (Campbell et al., 2002;Nores et al., 2005;Oppenheim and MacGregor, 2002;Sum et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Assumptions in the analyses", "text": "The analyses in this study estimate benefits and cost savings for various Michigan government systems, including K-12 education, criminal justice, welfare/public assistance, Medicaid, unemployment, child welfare, health care, and child care. \uf06e Estimates of saved costs are based on actual data from Michigan whenever possible, with occasional proxies either from Minnesota or national averages only when considered appropriate. \uf06e Proposed expansion of early childhood education programs is targeted to the lowest income children (at or below 300% of poverty) for optimal return. The number of eligible children is estimated accordingly. \uf06e Estimated benefits are predicated on the early childhood education being of high enough quality to achieve levels of benefits similar to those found within the research literature. As a proxy for quality, we use spending of $6,800 or more per child for 30 or more weeks."}, {"section_title": "Research on potential cost savings", "text": "The research literature on school readiness investments documents potential savings in K-12 spending; crime-related cost; and government health, welfare, and child care programs. Cost-benefit studies of comprehensive early education programs have also documented potential benefits to society in increased personal earnings and tax revenues."}, {"section_title": "K-12 cost savings", "text": "According to the research literature, the largest potential savings to K-12 systems due to improved school readiness is in special education spending. A portion of these costs could be reduced or prevented if more low-income 4-year-olds participated in early education and were fully prepared for kindergarten. Nationally, approximately 20 percent of children are identified as having special educational needs (High, 2008). Two percent have normative disabilities -blindness, deafness, autism, moderate/profound mental retardation, or significant language impairment. Eighteen percent have non-normative disabilities such as learning disabilities, speech and language delays, mild hearing loss, mild mental retardation, and social/emotional/ behavioral maladjustments that are preventable or ameliorated with early intervention. Of those with non-normative disabilities (90% of the students in special education), research shows that anticipatory guidance, such as parenting education provides, can reduce social and emotional risks and build protective factors in young children (Edwall, 2008) and quality early care and education can reduce the amount of time spent in K-12 special education (Reynolds, 2007). In addition, research on children with mild hearing loss shows they have more academic difficulties and are more likely to repeat a grade than their peers with normal hearing, which could be prevented with earlier detection and treatment (Tharpe, 2006). Figures A1 and A2 in the Appendix summarize the estimated effects and net benefits of early childhood education with regard to special education and grade repetition. Based on the outcomes of three major early childhood education studies (High/Scope Perry Preschool, The Abecedarian Project, and Chicago Child-Parent Centers) and a metaanalysis of 48 other studies, the return to each K-12 dollar invested in early childhood education range from 4 cents to 73 cents. This study also looks at other possible benefits within the K-12 system in addition to the actual costs of non-normative special education and grade repetition. Using data from the Early Education Longitudinal Study,   Belfield further finds that a .3 standard deviation increase in student achievement leads to a 19 percent reduction in physical attacks on teachers. The 32 point improvement in student behavior raises the probability that the kindergarten teacher will report \"really enjoys current job\" or \"would choose teaching again.\" This point is made even more clearly in Michigan by the results of a 2009 survey of kindergarten teachers: 68 percent of those surveyed agreed that they had \"experienced significant frustration as a direct result of needing to address the physical, social-emotional, language, cultural, cognitive, and/or special needs of a kindergarten student or students;\" and 18 percent said they had \"experienced a desire to change professions\" based on the same factors. These findings suggest that there are additional teacher, school, and school system related benefits, beyond the scope of this Michigan analysis, that can be produced by improving school readiness through early childhood education.  identifies five areas that could potentially be affected by increases in early childhood education enrollment: \uf06e Teacher turnover due to behavior problems, low achievement, or lack of preparation for K-12 education among students; \uf06e Teacher absenteeism due to behavior problems, \uf06e Low achievement, or lack of preparation for K-12 education among students; and \uf06e School safety programs (child or adolescent delinquent or criminal behavior increasing the need for spending on school safety programs). Other potentially avoidable costs to K-12 systems include costs associated with English Language Learner programs. Research indicates that quality early education may improve the English abilities of English language learners, which could reduce the need for future spending in this area (Barnett, 2007;Gormley, 2007;and Magnuson, Lahaie, and Waldfogel, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Crime-related cost savings", "text": "The relationship between early childhood education (ECE) program participation and reduction in crime appears to be direct (i.e., children in ECE programs learn to control their behavior better than their peers who do not receive this early education opportunity) and indirect (i.e., ECE contributes to better academic achievement, reduced special education placements, and reduced child maltreatment, which are all associated with a reduction in crime) (Mann and Reynolds, 2006). Criminal history can also be considered as an intervening variable in terms of the relationship between ECE and employment and earnings outcomes, since a criminal background may affect employability and/or career mobility (Nores et al., 2005). Crime-related cost savings attributable to ECE interventions are due to juvenile justice system savings, adult criminal justice savings, and savings for crime victims. In fact, some believe that \"[t]he greatest economic benefit of providing high-quality preschool education to disadvantaged children is a dramatic reduction in crime\" (Oppenheim and MacGregor, 2002). Of the studies included in this analysis, only the Abecedarian program in North Carolina has not produced any statistically significant cost savings due to reduced crime. This lack of evidence of cost savings in the area of crime reduction has been attributed to the fact that the area in which the Abecedarian program was located has relatively low crime rates compared with the communities served by other wellstudied ECE programs, and could also be due to the small sample sizes which reduce statistical power (Campbell et al., 2002). It appears that the largest cost savings due to crime reduction that can be attributed to ECE programs is in the area of crime victims' savings. Oppenheim and MacGregor (2002) reported the national average savings to crime victims is $5.86 for every dollar invested in ECE whereas Reynolds et al. (2002) reported 90 cents saved by crime victims for every dollar invested in the Chicago Child-Parent Centers ECE program. Juvenile justice system cost savings are between 68 cents and 90 cents for every dollar invested. One study using the Chicago Child-Parent Centers data found that preschool participation is associated with a reduction in any instance of juvenile arrest, number of juvenile arrests, and incidence of violent arrests (Mann and Reynolds, 2006). This study did not find a statistically significant relationship between participation in preschool and incidence of juvenile drug arrests. Adult criminal justice system cost savings are about 40 cents for every dollar invested. When including all types of cost savings from crime reduction, a meta-analysis of 58 ECE programs found an average cost savings of nearly 69 cents for every dollar invested (Aos et al., 2004). The Chicago Child-Parent Centers program results indicated a savings of $1.98 due to reduced crime for every dollar invested (Reynolds et al., 2002). Even more significant, the Perry Preschool program produced $11.30 of savings for every dollar invested at a 3 percent discount rate, or $4.85 savings for every dollar invested using a 7 percent discount rate. For this program, there was a much more significant effect for male program participants than females (Nores et al., 2005). As previously mentioned, the Abecedarian program did not produce savings in the area of crime. Therefore, the total benefit-to-cost ratio with regard to crime reduction outcomes of ECE programs is between $0 and $11.30 for every dollar invested."}, {"section_title": "Cost savings for public assistance programs", "text": "Unemployment is reduced by ECE program participation indirectly via the impact participation has on educational attainment. Individuals with high school degrees have an overall unemployment rate of 3.8 percent compared to 7.9 percent for high school drop outs (according to 2000 U.S. Census data cited in Oppenheim and MacGregor 2002). Nores et al. (2005) found that the cost of administering welfare is nearly 30 percent of total disbursements in Michigan. In addition, overpayment and payment to ineligible families is 6 percent of total disbursements. Therefore, for every dollar disbursed in welfare there is a cost to society of 38 cents (i.e., from the general public's viewpoint expenditures on welfare are 1.38 times higher than the actual transfer value to private individuals). Overall, cost savings for public assistance programs (TANF/AFDC) are not large compared with the benefits to other systems (K-12 education and criminal justice system). Most studies found only 1 to 2 cents per dollar invested in terms of cost savings to these programs."}, {"section_title": "Cost savings for the child welfare system", "text": "The literature reviewed here does not explicitly state the causal mechanisms by which ECE programs contribute to a reduction in child maltreatment (also called child abuse and neglect). The national review by Oppenheim and MacGregor (2002) found that 15 cents in cost savings accrue for every dollar invested in ECE. The Chicago Child-Parent Centers produced 12 cents of cost savings for every dollar invested (Reynolds et al., 2002). These cost savings benefit the child welfare system and also the individuals who do not suffer from abuse and neglect."}, {"section_title": "Cost savings for health care", "text": "Cost savings in the area of health care can be attributed to reduced incidence of tobacco use and reduced need for treatment for alcohol or other drug abuse. Citing a 2001 U.S. Department of Education report, Oppenheim and MacGregor (2002) assert that highquality ECE programs contribute to lower public (i.e., Medicaid) and private health care costs via improving educational attainment, which leads to better health directly and indirectly via higher earnings. Specifically, 38.7 percent of individuals without high school degrees are in excellent or very good health, compared with 57.8 percent of individuals who completed high school. Masse and Barnett (no year) attribute all differences in health behavior for ECE program participants vs. non-participants to the increased educational attainment among participants and to the better job opportunities that arise when one has more education. \"Education increases the ability to be an effective consumer of health care services and producer of personal health. Education also increases earning power, the ability to command wages, fringe benefits, vacation time, and the ability to avoid working conditions that may be detrimental to personal health. Education also increases income that allows one to purchase higher quality and quantity of health services and to establish living conditions that are conducive to good health\" (p. 22). These researchers also describe how the tendency to have concern for the future is represented both by people who are willing to invest in more education and engage in behavior that promote future good health. In their meta-analysis of benefit-cost research for 58 ECE programs, Aos et al. (2004) reported a cost savings of 4 cents for every dollar invested in terms of a reduction in alcohol and drug abuse. The Abecedarian program participants were 16 percent less likely than control group individuals to be tobacco users, which increased the lifespan of program participants an average of 6.5 years at an estimated value of $161,000 per year, so the return on investment is huge: $3.91 for every dollar invested."}, {"section_title": "Cost savings for child care", "text": "Child care cost savings, which mainly accrue to the parents of participants but can also accrue to the general public in cases where the participant is eligible for child care subsidy, can be attributed to a reduced need for child care services during the hours in which the child is participating in the ECE program. Oppenheim and MacGregor (2002) reported cost savings related to child care expenses of 19 cents for every dollar invested. Reynolds et al. (2002) found the Chicago Child-Parent Centers program saved 25 cents on child care expenses for every dollar invested."}, {"section_title": "Increased earnings resulting in increased income tax revenue", "text": "Increased income tax revenue due to increased earnings is derived from three sources: increased income for mothers of children who participate in ECE, due to their ability to work more hours while their child is participating in early education; increased income for participants, due to increased educational attainment that can be attributed to ECE enrollment; and increased income for future generations (children and grandchildren of participants), due to the increased educational attainment of participants that is associated with higher educational attainment for their offspring. Therefore, the primary way in which ECE intervention results in increased earnings and tax revenue is via increased educational attainment among ECE participants. Increased earnings by participants are a benefit of ECE programs that accrue to individual participants and also generate increased income tax revenue, which is a benefit that accrues to the general public (taxpayers). In 2006, 43 percent of individuals 19 to 64 years old without high school diploma in Michigan were employed, compared to 62 percent of high school graduates and 70 percent with bachelor degrees. In addition, the difference in mean annual earnings for this age group between non-high school graduates and graduates was $8,853 a reduction of approximately 40 percent. This gap is almost 60 percent when compared to college graduates in Michigan. In terms of lifetime earnings, obtaining a high school diploma increases income by $352,000 and improvement of 36 percent over non high school graduates. College graduates see their lifetime earnings increased by more than $1.3 million dollars compared to individuals without high school diplomas (Sum et al. 2008). Benefit-cost studies of the Abecedarian program are the only research reviewed here that included increased maternal earnings and earnings of future generations in calculations of benefits of ECE programs. Campbell et al. (2002) reported that 44 cents in increased income tax revenue for mothers of participating children was obtained for every dollar invested in the program. The same authors reported 13 cents in increased earnings of future generations (children through great-grandchildren, projected) for every dollar invested. In terms of participant lifetime earnings, the return on investment ranges from $1.23 for every dollar invested (Oppenheim and MacGregor, 2002) to $3.32 for every dollar invested (Nores et al., 2005). In terms of income taxes paid by participants, the return on investment ranges from 17 cents for every dollar invested (Oppenheim and MacGregor, 2002) to $1.08 for every dollar invested (Nores et al., 2005). Results from the Perry Preschool benefit-cost analyses show that increased participant earnings and increased participant income taxes are more significant for female participants than for male participants (Nores et al., 2005). Overall, increased earnings and taxes that can be attributed to ECE program participation produce a benefit that exceeds program cost from $1.40 to $4.38 for every dollar invested."}, {"section_title": "Estimates of potential cost savings from reviewed studies", "text": "The following table summarizes the cost savings in different categories generated per dollar of investment in school readiness through ECE estimated in different studies.

Through the state-funded Great Start School Readiness Program (GSRP) and federally-funded Head Start programs, over 47,000 4-year-olds are served in comprehensive early childhood education programs. Additional investments are also made in school readiness supports and services for younger children. We form these following cost savings estimates associated with such school readiness investments by calculating the estimated total cost savings to the Michigan K-12 education system; criminal justice systems and crime victims; child welfare system and child abuse victims; public assistance systems including welfare, unemployment, and Medicaid; and health care in Michigan as a result of improved school readiness. All of these savings would be lost and additional costs would be added over upcoming years if the state's current investment in early education were reduced or discontinued. These estimates are based on actual expenditure and enrollment data from Michigan and program effect sizes and parameters from the existing research on effects of early childhood education."}, {"section_title": "Estimated current cost savings for K-12 education", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Special education", "text": "Michigan K-12 spending in 2009 totaled over $2 billion on special education. Currently, approximately 11.6 percent of students in Michigan K-12 are enrolled in special education. Figure 2 shows the special education enrollment by type of primary disability for Michigan during the 2008-09 academic year. For this analysis, we assume that while special education can assist in some non-normative areas of special education, such as emotional or behavioral disorder, it cannot assist in normative areas, such as deafness or blindness. Therefore, researchers expect school readiness efforts to impact six primary disabilities areas: speech or language impaired (2.7% of all students), mild to moderate cognitive impairment (0.8%), specific learning disability (4.7%), emotional impairment (0.9%), other health impairment (1.0%), and early childhood delay (0.1%). A literature review performed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a reduction in the incidence of special education due to early education ranging from 6 to 48 percent with an average impact of 12 percent (Anderson, 2002). For this analysis, we used the average effect size, and reduced the special education rates in the disabilities that can be reduced or prevented by 12 percent. These costs of special education are considered to be in addition to regular track costs. Accordingly, benefits include the reduction in special education costs but do not net out potential added costs of returning the students to regular classrooms."}, {"section_title": "Michigan Special Education enrollment, 2008-2009", "text": "Primary disability The estimated savings for K-12 are calculated using student numbers from the Michigan Department of Education.

To estimate the number of students who would have repeated a grade in the latest school year in Michigan, we used different methods for different grades. For grades K through 8, we used the change in grade repetition reported in two evaluations of the GSRP by High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, Xiang and Schweinhart, (2002) and Malofeeva, Daniel-Echols, and Xiang, (2007). For grades 9 through 12, a different strategy was employed using cohort graduation reports. In the four-year graduation report for the school cohort that should have graduated in 2008, 9.3 percent of the students were listed as \"off-track continuing,\" meaning they were still enrolled in (at least) a fifth year of high school, but the reports do not list which year (or years) would have been repeated. Similarly, the four-year report for the 2007 cohort showed that 8.6 percent of students were repeating a year of high school, and the five-year report showed that 2.8 percent were still enrolled in what must have been (at least) their sixth year of high school. We used these data to infer grade repetition rates for grades 9 through 12 that added to the appropriate sum. To account for the effect of existing school readiness programs, we assumed that early education had lowered the repeat rate for these four grades by 21 percent. For this analysis, we also assumed that each student who repeats a grade is retained only a single year. Based on this modeling we estimate that school readiness programs in prior years prevented 14,213 Michigan children from repeating a grade. The cost of each grade repetition was assumed to be the cost of an additional year of regular track education for those students who are held back during their K-12 career. In 2007-08, the average per pupil cost of regular track enrollment was $9,380. Using that figure, previous participation of Michigan children in school readiness programs yields an estimated annual savings of $136.2 million in costs associated with grade repetition."}, {"section_title": "Estimated annual grade repetition savings: $136.2 million", "text": "Teacher turnover Michigan had 110,344 public school teachers for school year 2008-09. A recent report by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found that the teacher turnover rate nationally is about 16 percent, with half moving to different schools and half leaving the teaching profession (Marvel et al., 2006). Based on the reasons teachers expressed for leaving their jobs, about 60 percent are potentially related to dissatisfaction with working conditions due to student behavior or performance that could be influenced by improved school readiness. As quoted earlier, a recent survey of Michigan kindergarten teachers indicated that 68 percent experienced significant frustration and 18 percent had considered changing professions based on similar issues. To represent the potential improvement in turnover, we used an estimated turnover rate of 9.6 percent in this study. For this analysis, we assume the turnover rate for teachers in Michigan is lower because they encounter better-prepared students who were enrolled in the existing Michigan ECE programs. We use the estimates developed by Belfield that this level of ECE graduates in the student population reduces the net turnover of teachers by 24 percent. This yields an assumption that turnover is lower in Michigan by 859 teachers per year as a result of existing school readiness. To calculate the turnover costs, we use a model developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which assumes that the cost of turnover is 33 percent of the teacher's salary plus benefits at a rate of 30 percent of salary. The average salary plus benefits for a Michigan public school teacher is $57,072. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics model, we estimate the average cost per teacher turnover in Michigan is about $18,833.

Finally, from the point of view of K-12 school finances, there is another substantial savings -per pupil aid received by the schools because school readiness reduces the dropout rate for students. In the HighScope/Perry Preschool study, the rate of high school graduation was increased from 54 percent for non-participants to 71 percent for children who participated in a comprehensive early education program, a decrease of 17 percent in the dropout rate. Using the estimate from the Chicago Parent Child Study that participants attend school .35 more years on average than non-participants and the fact that roughly 38,000 4-year-olds were enrolled in early education in the 1994-95 school year, we estimate that roughly 13,300 more students are currently enrolled in Michigan schools because of their previous participation in early education programs. When multiplied by average per student spending of $9,380 from the most recent school year, that translates into roughly $125 million dollars of additional financial aid to schools. However, since this analysis is being done from the point of view of the State of Michigan as a whole, the loss of per-pupil aid that is prevented due to school readiness is not included in the savings from school readiness since the dollars are transferred from taxpayers to school districts, thus netting to zero."}, {"section_title": "Estimated K-12 annual savings due to increased school readiness", "text": "While increased dropouts do not, in technical financial sense, cost the taxpayers money in the near term through increased education costs, their ultimate cost to the state is far greater than the cost of another year of schooling.

Based on the American Community Survey data for 2006, these include: From the point of view of their net fiscal impact on the State of Michigan, adult dropouts are the only group that costs the state in services more than they pay in taxes. The Sum (2008) study estimates that each dropout costs the state on average $3,269 per year, compared to high school graduates who contribute over $4,000 more in taxes than they use in services.

Nevertheless, we believe these cost savings estimates to be conservative for three reasons: First, where we had a choice of a given effect from among several studies which showed a range of effects, we chose the average effect or from the lower part of the range. Second, there is an additional list of potential cost savings to the K-12 system that could be lost due to inadequate school readiness that was not included in this analysis. These include reduction in the use of achievement enhancement and remedial education programs, reduced non-instructional and health costs related to special education and preventable health problems, reduced costs for alternative schools, recapture of lost revenues from parents choosing private or charter schools, and reduced costs of having to provide education to students in juvenile detention. While there is reason to believe that improved school readiness through early childhood education would affect these categories of expenditures, these saving could not be included because there has been no research to measure or monetize the impact of improved school readiness in these areas. To the extent that savings might be realized in all or some of these areas, the estimates presented here understate the total savings -and the potential lost savings -to the K-12 system.

In addition, other children and parents participate in programs and benefit from supports and services that enhance school readiness, including many that have not yet been studied from a cost-benefit basis. Accordingly, the estimates presented here, and based most heavily on studies of ECE, represent conservative estimates of the value conveyed by the school readiness produced by the total array of early childhood investments in Michigan. To estimate the annual savings being realized in Michigan as a result of comprehensive school readiness programs, some additional assumptions need to be made. In particular, some of the benefits of school readiness are received throughout the adult life of children who succeed in school. Of necessity, we have used conservative estimates of the numbers of adults who would have been receiving TANF or committing adult crimes and combined these with effect sizes and costs from existing research to estimate the current impact of comprehensive school readiness efforts in Michigan.

The total potential savings from this enhanced school readiness, because they have not been activated and are not being accrued, represent the additional annual costs attributable to the lack of sufficient school readiness in Michigan. We estimate the total potential annual savings from enhancing school readiness through expanded early education -or the cost burden attributable to inadequate school readinessto be $598 million. As shown in Figure 9, the largest portions of the public costs are to juvenile justice ($111 million), child welfare ($55 million), adult corrections ($49 million), Special Education ($36 million), and public assistance ($34 million).

The recent restructuring of the automobile industry reinforces the view that, when the national economy rebounds, Michigan may be slow to follow. That means that Michigan's economic policies must deal with both the shortterm problem of weakness and also focus on creating long-term momentum for the state's economy whenever possible. Economists and economic development officials both stress the importance of the skill and quality of a state's workforce as one important element affecting a state's economic growth and prospects. So any strategies to enhance the long-term growth of Michigan need to include maintaining and upgrading the quality of its workforce. Yet some recent data on educational attainment of different age groups in Michigan raise the discomfiting prospect that the educational attainment of the state's workforce may decline as retiring workers are replaced by the young people who are currently finishing or (in too may cases) not finishing school. As Figure 11 makes clear, the percentage of working-age people in Michigan without a high school diploma is likely to rise over the next years as older workers are replaced by younger grads and non-grads. Moreover, the most recent statistics show even higher dropout numbers.

We offer an approximate answer based on conservative assumptions using the best relevant data available to us. Based on historical participation in early education programs and the success rate of those programs, 80,000 is a conservative estimate of the number of adults in the Michigan labor force who finished high school, but who would have dropped out without the increased school readiness they developed through participation in such programs. These people contribute more to state government than they use in government services, but had they not graduated they would have been a net fiscal drain on the state. Sum (2008) has estimated that dropouts have net annual fiscal contribution to the state of minus $3,269; while those who have simply a high school diploma contribute a plus $4,201 to the state's coffers as measured by their taxes paid less the transfer payments they receive. Moreover, workers who have from one to three years of college are estimated to contribute $8,966, and those who earn bachelor's degrees a full $17,695 per year. If we assume that none of those 80,000 dropouts continued to higher education of any kind, we estimate the current impact on the state budget from past school readiness through participation in early childhood education as roughly $594 million per year. If we assume that a quarter of those graduates went to college but that none of them earned bachelor's degrees, our estimate jumps to $690 million annually. In addition to their impact on state government expenditures, these graduates earn higher incomes and spend the majority of that added income on goods and services in Michigan. We use an estimate of their earnings as the contribution to Michigan economy through their increased productivity at work. Sum (2008) estimates the average annual earnings of high school dropouts in 2006 at roughly $13,000, compared to $21,800 for high school graduates and $30,600 for workers with some college but no four-year degree. Using these values, we estimate that the additional after tax income spent by this group of graduates in Michigan is roughly $700 million if none of them pursued additional training. As in the previous calculation, if 25 percent attended college without finishing a four-year degree, the estimate rises to $875 million. 2 Using this alternative method of estimating economic impact and totaling these two estimates, we arrive at an estimated increase of from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion in economic activity in Michigan courtesy of previous and existing school readiness investments. (While it is common in economic development studies to scale direct spending figures up by a multiplier to account for the additional induced spending in the economy, we have chosen to be conservative and not use such a multiplier for these estimates.)"}, {"section_title": "Estimated annual economic impact: $1.29 billion to $1.56 billion", "text": "This range of $1.29 billion to $1.56 billion represents between 0.4 and 0.5 percent of Michigan Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The study estimated the effect on national GDP of 17 percent of U.S. children growing up below the Federal Poverty Line rather than getting the opportunities and the life outcomes of children from average income families. They estimated the cost to the U. S. economy at almost 4 percent of GDP, with the main element being lost productivity and output, increased costs of crime, and increased health expenditures. Though the Holzer study did not identify specific channels of impact, it seems quite plausible that lack of school readiness is one of the ways in which family poverty affects individual life prospects and aggregate economic activity. Therefore, the estimate that school readiness programs in Michigan undo about one-tenth of the effect of child poverty in Michigan seems to be reasonable."}, {"section_title": "Future impact on economic activity in Michigan", "text": "The future of the Michigan economy, like the future of the U.S. economy, is impossible to predict with confidence. However, the contribution that school readiness will make to that future is likely to rise rather than remain constant as the jobs of the future demand more education and more training. The current impact on Michigan's economy today is generated by early education programs of 15 or more years ago. In like manner, changes in the level of early education and school readiness spending today will have impacts in the future. If investment is decreased, losses will accumulate over time. Conversely, if investment is increased, economic benefits will accrue over time. Additional savings in school expenditures will be felt in the near term, but most of the impact will be felt in later years in terms of the added productivity of the workforce, reduced crime, and reduced social spending. Increased and sustained school readiness investments today at the rate described earlier in this paper would produce additional economic benefits of about $600 million per year when all of those benefits are realized. Put differently, the cost burden of NOT investing the additional resources in early education and school readiness will mount up in the future until it reaches the equivalent of roughly $600 million of today's dollars per year.
