Introduction", "text": "As technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and robotics advance, the workforce faces the prospect of being completely revolutionized. In 1942, Economist Joseph Schumpeter introduced the term \"creative destruction,\" articulating that disruptive transformation resulting from technological innovations might stall economic growth. Since then, an extensive literature has been dedicated to the potential impact of technological innovations, which were often developed with the intention of cost-saving, through reducing waste, developing by-products, and increasing the capacity of equipment relative to its price (Gold 1964). Some economists raise concerns about the labor impact of technological innovations, which include massive human labor job displacement, and a resulting rise in unemployment (Ricardo 1951). Clark (2007) famously argues that the advancement of technology will \"leave behind some people,\" just as the horses were replaced due to \"the arrival of the internal combustion engine\" in the early twentieth century. Others argue that technological innovations will lead to more middle-skill jobs that combine routine technical tasks and nonroutine tasks that require interpersonal interaction, problem solving, and adaptability, as they replace the traditional labor-intensive, solely routine tasks (D. H. Autor 2015). While previous researchers have mostly investigated the relationship between unemployment and technological innovations on the microeconomic-level (i.e. firm and industry level), there is a need for macroeconomic analysis yet to be fulfilled by existing literature. Macroeconomic research can help government agencies and policy makers better understand the aggregate employment effect of technological innovations, and provide insights on how to best respond to technological changes without unnecessarily disrupting the labor market. This paper contributes to the discussion by conducting a novel state-level macroeconomic analysis on the employment effect of technological innovations. Using commercially supplied Research & Development expenditures as a proxy for technological innovations, and data on 51 U.S. states (including District of Columbia) over the period of 19 years and a large number of controls, I hypothesize that technological innovations have a labor-friendly nature on the overall state-level. Moreover, I investigate how different presidential administrations, as well as certain state characteristics such as urbanization level, and major industry of employment, impact the extent to which state labor markets are affected by technological changes. I find that although technological innovations have a non-significant effect on employment at the aggregate state level, there are a few factors that determine how well each state's labor market responds to technological changes. I find that non-urbanized, non-techsavvy, or states with a large number of workers employed in Manufacturing or Accommodation and Food Services industry experience a more severe unemployment effect than the other states. In addition, the results suggest that unemployment rate is more negatively affected by technological innovations during the Obama Administration, compared with the Clinton and Bush Administration. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section summarizes relevant past literature on both the theoretical background and empirical findings. Section III describes the methodology used and three main hypotheses behind my research, and explains the control variables employed in the model. Section IV describes data sources. Section V presents and interprets the regression results. Finally, Section VI concludes and discusses the limitations of my research."}, {"section_title": "II. Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Theoretical Background", "text": "Unemployment has always been a focus area in labor economics research. Researchers in the past have attempted to find the determinants of unemployment through various methodologies. For example, Maqbool et al. (2017) find that population, foreign direct investment, and inflation have significant effect on unemployment in the long run. In addition, they find an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation, suggesting the existence of Phillips curve at play both in the short-and long-run. Maki and Spindler (2017) look at the post-1966 increase in measured unemployment rates in the United States and find that a large part of unemployment changes is due to the changes in unemployment benefits. Political factors come into play as well. Wood et al. (2005) find that certain chactertistics of U.S. presidents, such as the sentiment with which they deliver their presidential remarks, significantly affect people's perception of the economy, and the overall economic performance, which includes employment. One significant area of research on the determinants of unemployment has revolved around technological progress and development. More specifically, economists have examined the effect of technological progress on the labor market, particularly the efficiency of the existing labor force, and the demand for labor. Two of the most prominent economists who have studied this topic are Joseph Schumpeter and David Ricardo. Schumpeter (1911) famously argues that technological innovation, as reflected by productivity growth, will spur a temporary increase in demand for primary factors to produce new goods. This will be followed by a reduction in labor demand as process innovation provides 'a saving effect,' and competes with the primary factors, leading to higher unemployment. This issue is also addressed by Ricardo in his book \"On Machinery,\" where he proposes \"...the opinion, entertained by the laboring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy\" (Ricardo, 1951). Following Schumpeter and Ricardo, many others have contributed to the discussion on the relationship between productivity growth and unemployment. Under a theoretical model, there have mainly been two employment effects of technology-incurred productivity growth in tension. First, technological progress leads to job creation through the 'capitalization effect.' Pissarides (1990) suggests that since the costs of job creation are paid initially, faster technological progress \"means a lower effective discount rate on future profits and hence higher present value for profits.\" If variations in the rate of job destruction are assumed to be constant across various business cycles, the effect of faster growth is to increase jobs and reduce unemployment. The second employment effect, coined by Schumpeter as 'creative destruction effect,' captures a positive relationship between technological progress and unemployment (Aghion and Howitt 1994). It highlights that the new capital will only be employed by newly created jobs, and therefore suggests that technological progress requires a transition of workers to new firms, creating lower job creation and higher job destruction flows resulted from labor reallocation (Boianovsky and Trautwein 2007). Which one of the abovementioned theoretical effects will dominate is unclear, and will be explored further in later sections through empirical research. With the inconclusive effects presented by theoretical models aside, however, the media has frequently reported and portrayed the direct, often destructive effect of technological advancement on workers ever since the first Industrial Revolution, during which spinning machines became a competitive force to human labor. As a prominent example, the Luddite movement in the 19th century was centered around a group of English textile artisans and weavers, who feared being replaced in the industry, and protested the automation of textile production by destroying weaving machines (Skidelsky 2014). More recently, scholars have been concerned with the popularity of computers and their potential ability to replace a significant portion of existing jobs. For example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2016) predict that rapid digitization brings economic disruption by eliminating companies' needs for some kinds of workers. Acemoglu and Restrpo (2016) propose the relationship to be a \"stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go handin-hand; an increase in automation reduced the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the faster creation of new complex tasks.\" A more quantitative study is brought about by Frey and Osborne (2013), who estimate the probability of computerization for 702 detailed occupations, and find 47% of total U. S. employment to be at risk of being computerized. But to what extent are technological advancement and innovations taking away human jobs? How concerned should one be about the future of employment? Extensive empirical research has attempted to shed light on these questions by looking at employment data from different industries and countries, and its relationship with workforce characteristics."}, {"section_title": "B. Empirical Research", "text": "Most of the existing research examines the employment effect of technological innovations at the firm level, and suggests a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, Bogliacino et al. (2012) apply the dynamic LSDVC estimator to a longitudinal dataset that covers 677 European companies over the period of 1990 to 2008, and find that business R&D has a significant, although small in magnitude, job creation effect. Based on data on 20,000 firms chosen as random samples of manufacturing and services from 4 European countries covering from 1998 to 2000, Harrison et al. (2014) find that the growth of demand, spurred by product innovation, is a strong contributing force to employment creation. They also observe a weak effect of process innovation on the number of workers hired, or the demand for labor. This conclusion is supported by other research such as Hall et al. (2008). They find a lack of evidence that links employment displacement to process innovation, based on microdata of over 9000 Italian manufacturing firms. However, they do recognize a significant contribution of product innovation to employment growth. Lachenmaier and Rottman (2007) find positive effects of both product and process innovation on employment. Interestingly, they find the effect of process innovation to be higher than that of product innovation. Using data from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay, Crespi and Tacsir (2012) further test the Harrison et al. (1998) model, and find a strong compensation effect of introduction of new products. Using a sample of 15,186 French manufacturing firms over the 1986-1990 period, Greenan and Guellec (2000) find that process innovation has a stronger job creating effect than product innovation at the firm level, but the contrary is true at the sector level. They also find that innovative firms, firms that have high level of innovative activity according to the French Innovative Survey (EAE), tend to create more jobs. This finding is consistent with other research such as Smolny (1998), which uses microeconomic data from West German manufacturing firms, and finds that innovative firms are more successful, and show higher employment growth than non-innovative firms. Similar patterns are observed with British firm-level panel data. Controlling for fixed effects, endogeneity, and dynamics, Reenen (1997) utilizes data on headcounts of innovation in 598 British firms, and finds that higher technological innovation activity was associated with higher number of employees hired at the firm-level. Coad and Rao (2011) focus on the patenting and R&D expenditure histories of four manufacturing industries, and use Weighted Least Square analysis to find that firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior. Looking at the effect of computerization on a firm's output growth and labor productivity, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003) use computer stock data from 527 large US firms over 8 years, and find a positive short-term effect of computerization on measured productivity. In addition, they find that over longer periods of time, the productivity contribution made by computerization might even be greater, reaching up to five times. Pellegrino et al. 2017 [1983][1984][1985][1986][1987][1988], and find that the growth of firm's R&D intensity has in fact a negative impact on employment. In addition, they observe no significant impact of R&D cooperation on employment growth. A lot of researchers have also studied the employment effect of technological innovation at the industry level. In contrary to the generally consistent results from firm-level research, industry-level literature has recorded very mixed results. For example, Evangelista and Savona (2010) utilize data from the Italian Innovation Survey from 1993 to 1995, and find an overall negative impact of innovation on employment across service industries. More specifically, they find that firm size and service sector play significant roles: small firms tend to experience positive employment effect with higher level of innovation activity, whereas larger firms and capital-intensive industries observe negative employment impact of innovation. Piva and Vivarelli (2017) utilize longitudinal data from manufacturing and service sectors for 11 European countries over a period of 14 years and conclude that the positive employment effect seems to be entirely from the medium-and high-tech sectors. They also find a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment. Their result is complemented by other research, such as Moretti 2010, who highlights the multiplier effect of jobs, and finds that with each additional skilled job in high tech industries, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector in the same city. Technologies (ICT) data from 11 countries, and conclude that industries with faster ICT growth have observed a shift in demand from middle-educated workers to highly-educated workers. Despite the benefits of using microeconomic data to study the employment effect of technological progress, as it allows for precise capture of product innovation, and overall mapping of innovation variables, there are considerable limitations associated with firm-level or industry-level analysis. For example, the microeconomic approach may not fully account for the indirect compensation effect, which operates largely through aggregate dynamics. In addition, as suggested by Vivarelli (2012), firm-level research often exhibits a \"positive bias\" and suggests job creation by technological innovations, failing to acknowledge the potential crowd-out by innovative firms or industries in the broader labor market. To date, there has been limited macroeconomic research on the employment effect of technological innovations. Vivarelli (1995) uses aggregate time-series data from Italy and the United States, and finds mixed results: the labor saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively whereas product innovation has benefited the U.S. labor market with employment growth. Based on data from 9 OECD countries over the period 1960, Pini (1995 finds no evidence to support a job creation effect of technological innovations. Instead, he observes a negative effect on employment, and some equally significant compensation effects such as export dynamics and the process of production of new physical capital, both of which linked to the innovation process. with employment in the short term (3 years). However, he finds no long-term effect, suggesting that the adverse effect on unemployment is more transitory than permanent. Notably, Feldmann employs a wide range of macroeconomic control variables, which are selectively adopted in this paper."}, {"section_title": "C. Proxy for Technological Innovations", "text": "There have been four main approaches in existing literature that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Gali (1999) and further developed by Francis and Ramey (2005), is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR), assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity. The second approach is from Basu et al. (2006). This paper adopts the third approach and utilizes company-supplied R&D expenditure as a proxy for technological innovation. The reasons are as follows: First, R&D activity accurately measures the input invested in innovative activity. As Shea (1999) (Conte and Vivarelli, 2005;Parisi et al., 2006). Despite the benefits of using direct measures, I acknowledge the limitations of using R&D expenditures as a proxy. In particular, since R&D only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, it takes time to develop a product or service and bring it to market, resulting in an indeterminate lag between the input and output (Alexopoulos  1993,1995,[1997][1998][1999][2000][2001][2002][2003][2004][2005][2006][2007][2008][2009][2010][2011][2012][2013] Clinton: 1993Clinton: , 1995Clinton: , 1997Clinton: -2000Bush: 2001Bush: -2008Obama: 2009Obama: -2013 Table [2]."}, {"section_title": "Country-Level Control Variables", "text": "Drawing upon Feldmann 2013 Wage bargaining characteristics, as captured by CBC and TradeUD have been studied extensively and proved to determine unemployment. According to Aidt and Tzannatos (2008), collective bargaining power has a significant impact on macroeconomic performances such as unemployment. Many past empirical studies find that union density has a negative employment effect (e.g., Scarpetta 1996, Nickell and Layard 1999, Nickell 1997. Foreign direct investment (FI_O and FI_I) can have different employment effects depending on whether the host country is developing or developed, according to Blomstom et al. (1997). In addition, foreign direct investment can also serve as channels for technological diffusion (Feldmann 2013), and thus ought to be controlled for. Variables like Imports (Impt) and Trade openness (Trade) are included to control for the effect of import or trade openness has on unemployment over the years. Empirical research suggests that higher level of trade openness, or globalization, correlates with lower structural unemployment rate (Felbermayr et al. 2009). Similarly, real effective exchange rate is controlled for due to its potential impact on employment through affecting domestic production price competitiveness (Feldmann 2013). Inflation rate (Infl) needs to be controlled for in this study due to its empirically proven impact on unemployment. Akerlof et al. (2000) shows the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the United States: inflation rate increasing slightly over zero leads to lower unemployment, yet as soon as inflation rate rises above a certain level, sustainable unemployment starts to rise. Based on existing literature, I theorize that a country's adoption of technological innovations is positively correlated with a country's economic development. Thus, Output gap (Out_gap) is included to control for different levels of macroeconomic performance. Real interest rate (RIR) is controlled for because of existing evidence that shows a positive relationship between real interest rate and unemployment (Blanchard and Wolfers 2000)."}, {"section_title": "State-Level Replacements of Country-level Control Variables", "text": "Country-level 'GDP per Capita' in Feldmann (2013) is replaced by state-level 'GDP per Capita' (GDP_pC) in this study. GDP_pC is included to control for the state of business cycle, the effect of a state's economic development on its ability to adopt and develop technological innovations. Country-level 'Unemployment benefits replacement rate' in Feldmann (2013), denoting gross unemployment benefits as a decimal fraction of previous gross wage earnings, is replaced by state-level unemployment benefits in my research. Unemployment benefits need to be controlled for since they could have various effects on employment during different states of economy (Moffitt 2014, Maki andSpindler 2017)."}, {"section_title": "State-Level Control Variables", "text": "I include a few other state-level control variables in addition to the control variables in Feldmann (2013): I control for the impact of union coverage (Union_Cov), since high level of unionization is often found to have adverse effect on employment (Montgomery 1986, Layard et al. 2005. I also control for the impact of violent crime and property crime rates (VioCri and PropCri). Various studies have explored the link between unemployment and crime. Although most research has shown an inconclusive result (e.g., Entorf and Sieger 2014), some present a significant relationship (Melick 2003). I control for them in my model to eliminate any potential explaining power they have on unemployment rate. Extensive previous studies have found that increase in minimum wage tends to have a negative effect on employment (Kaitz 1970, Wachter and Kim 1979, Brown et al. 1982. In this study, the impact of minimum wage is controlled for with control variable Min_wage."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Effects", "text": "To control for state and year fixed effects, I have included dummy variables for each state, as well as linear and quadratic time trends. due to lack of statistical significance. Although previous empirical research has shown that both bargaining centralization and coordination seem to lead to lower unemployment (Soskice 1990, Feldmann 2011, both country-level variables are not significant for the purpose of this research as the values exhibit little variation throughout the 19-year period of interest. The same reasoning applies to the omission of the indicator of Employment protection legislation for both regular contracts and temporary contracts, as the country level data remains consistent across the 19 years of research interest.

Regression results from Table [ "}, {"section_title": "B. Implications", "text": "The results have meaningful implications with regard to the determinants of how strongly state labor markets are affected by technological shocks. Although I do not find a statistically significant relationship between R&D expenditure and unemployment rate for all states, the results suggest insights that policy makers and state governments should reference when making economic decisions in response to the imminent waves of technology. On the national level, economic prosperity (high GDP per capita) offers a cushioning effect on the labor market when it is hit by technological innovations. However, if technological innovations were to affect the labor market, states that are less urbanized, less technologically informed, or more Manufacturing/Accommodation and Food Services-focused are going to be more negatively affected than other states. Therefore, these states potentially require more compensative labor protection programs and funding from the federal government. In addition, in light of the rapidly growing technological innovations in the past decade, especially on automation, the abovementioned state governments should take action to buffer severe unemployment effect, such as taking precautions against heavy R&D investment, and implementing more job-creating public initiatives. States that receive low ranks for tech-savviness could promote public education that improves the citizens' competitiveness in the labor market, and better prepare them for future technological shocks to employment."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusions and Limitations", "text": "The past few years has been rich with new technological breakthroughs. One of the most prominent examples is the development of autonomous vehicles. A stream of companies including Uber and Google has attained their permits to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. It is projected that by 2020, there will be 10 million self-driving cars on the road, replacing the traditional human-driving cars to be the new norm (Garret 2017). Although selfdriving cars will bring tremendous benefits such as accident avoidance, their maturity also suggests a bleak career outlook for workers in the transportation industry, such as truck drivers. Despite the buzz and glamor around new technological innovations, some people are inevitably hurt by these new technologies, like the Luddites in the 19 th century, or tens of thousands of truck drivers in a few years. The main motivation behind this paper is to closely examine the relationship between technological innovations and unemployment, and provide some implications as to how state governments can help prepare workers to adapt to the new technological era. Although my research does not find a significant relationship between technological innovations and unemployment on an aggregate level, the results do show that some states are affected by technological changes more so than others. More specifically, states that are less urbanized, less tech-savvy, or have most Manufacturing, or Accommodation Services jobs, are going to suffer more by the job displacement effect, and benefit less from the job creation effect of technological innovations. It is important for us to recognize these determining state characteristics, as they provide insight to which states will be the most vulnerable and thereby require the most legislative protection in facing technological breakthroughs. Although I control for many factors that might bias the results, I do acknowledge the limitations of this research: One significant factor that state-level analysis is not able to account for is the spillover employment effect of R&D expenditures across states. For example, many corporations have offices in different states. Increased R&D expenditure in one state might result in lay-off of employees residing in other states. The potential spillover is not captured in my study, and thus could result in biased estimates. I collect data on the main independent variable of interest, Commercial R&D Expenditure, from Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), which is a replacement to the old Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD) since 2008. Although the entry of survey that my study focuses on, 'Domestic R&D paid for by company and others, and performed by company' is a consistent entry of interest before and after the adoption of the new survey. If there were a slight change in data collection or categorization method after implementing the new survey, my results in this paper would be affected. Another limitation of my study is the use of country-level control variables. Although those variables are relevant, and are empirically proven to affect unemployment, they are only able to capture changes across years, since they are the same across states in a certain year. Some of their statistical significance and explaining power might be lost when translated to state-level analysis. Although I attempt to counter this limitation by replacing some of the country-level control variables with state-level equivalents, I was not able to do so for all country-level variables. One direction for future research would be to find more state-level control variables, such as state-level employment protection legislation strictness, and state-level imports. Another avenue for future research is to distinguish product and process innovation at the state level. Although this paper finds no relationship between high education expenditure and the extent to which state unemployment rate is affected by technological innovations, more research could be done to explore the impact of different types of education expenditure, the results of which will point local governments and policy makers toward the right direction with regard to training workers to be competitive in the labor market in the new technological era.
