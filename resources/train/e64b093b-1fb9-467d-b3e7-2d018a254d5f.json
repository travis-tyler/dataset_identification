[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus, first reported on 31 st December 2019, in Wuhan, China that has since spread to 215 countries and regions globally. As of 23 rd June 2020, there were more than nine million confirmed cases (n=8,985,016) and 472,216 deaths 1 . According to World Health Organization, preliminary R o estimate of COVID-19 is reported as 1.4-2.5 (WHO, 2020) indicating its larger infectiousness. However, while it has walloped many countries, a great number of countries has got spared. In addition, there has been significant variations in deaths across countries.\nData from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran suggest that the case fatality rate (CFR) increases drastically with age and is higher in people with COVID-19 and underlying comorbidities (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020). Targeted social distancing for these groups could be the most effective way to reduce morbidity and concurrent mortality. Advanced in age and having chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been linked with more severe COVID-19 symptoms, often leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and progression from ARDS to death (ChaominWu, et al., 2020) Another study finds that person's occupation may expose them to risk by the nature of their job. Work involving constant human contact, interaction with others or caring for people means that risk of infection spread through droplets is higher (Rule, et al., 2018) . In response to COVID-19, occupation is likely to be a direct determinant of infection and an indirect determinant of disease severity and mortality through the relationship between occupational social class and comorbidities (Koh, 2020) . Low income and lower education level are indirectly associated with a number of factors that may increase the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19, such as increased prevalence of smoking, poor nutrition, and housing conditions which could suppress the immune system.\nA recent systematic review of five retrospective or prospective studies reported that smoking is most likely associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 (Vardavas & Nikitara, 2020) .\nIn order to define the grounds which are most likely to be associated with COVID-19 outbreaks, high-quality data on socioeconomic factors are urgently needed, which will have important implications in the development of health system measures.

While the spread ballooned in some countries, some countries got relatively spared.\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions have played a significant role. Still, a lot of unknowns are there as well. Even though from the various sources, it was seen that ageing population are vulnerable, health system's capacity can also dramatically reduce that vulnerably. While a lot of micro or patient level data and study are emerging, and can better answer the underlying factors of case fatality rates and infection rates once COVID-19 reaches in its ending phase, a cross-country comparison can elicit some demographic and health system covariates of the death and infection rates. A few such effort, till to date, however, has been observed. In this study, we attempt to evaluate the extent of underlying factors with the latest available data using various empirical estimation methods."}, {"section_title": "Related Literature", "text": "We identify published studies through a rapid review and observe that myriads of social and economic requisites have been attributed as potential determinants for the empirical variety in the coronavirus outcome. Hardly any of determinants, however, are able to robustly unravel the extent of the coronavirus pandemic. Stojkoski, Utkovski, Jolakoski, Tevdovski, & Kocarev (2020) recommend that population size and government health expenditure are the two determinants strongly related to the coronavirus cases. Their study finds out that more populated economies show greater resistance to being infected by the virus, whereas countries with larger government expenditure display greater susceptibility to the virus infection. Rodrigues, Prata, & Camargo (2020) investigate the regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazil and its relationship with climatic and demographic factors by using a polynomial regression model in terms of the number of days of transmission, demographic density, city population and climatic factors. Their results show that temperature variation maintains a relationship with the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases. Depending on the contagion process in progress, the expected reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19 is -3.4% for each increase of 1\u00b0C. Qiu, Chen, & Shi (2020) examines the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus 2019, considering both within-and between-city transmissions in China. Using a machine learning method (Lasso), their estimates show that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions, and there is evidence that people's responses can break .

Changes in weather conditions also induce exogenous variations in past infection rates, which allows to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases.\nA systematic review conducted by Khalatbari-Soltani, Cumming, & Delpierre (2020) shows that the impact of socioeconomic determinants on the COVID-19 outbreak fluctuate in highincome-countries over low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to this study, the community spread of disease COVID-19 appearing initially from abroad, will depend upon the particular local infrastructures and social inequalities in each context. For instance, the usual public health practices of social distancing including lockdowns, quarantine and self-isolation are hardly performed in LMICs. Additionally, such income settings where absolute poverty is a pivotal concern, access to basic needs like food, housing, water and sanitation will have an immense distinction on how easily people can practice any social distancing measures to isolate older adults or vulnerable people. What is more, in many parts of the world, health is not free on the verge of need and health care systems, which are outstretched at the best of times, will become quickly inundated.\nContaining contact rates is a vital strategy for outbreak control which also hinges on population densities. Keeping to more than 1 meter distance between people coughing and sneezing, as recommended by the WHO becomes more intricate with higher population densities (WHO, 2020).\nHenceforth, avoiding circumstances with higher population densities will be a necessary requirement to limit the spread of COVID-19 (Rockl\u00f6v & Sj\u00f6din, 2020) .\nA study reveals that social distancing measures reduce the epidemic value of the effective reproduction number \u0734 by about 60% or less, if the intrinsic transmission potential declines in the warm summer months (Anderson, Heesterbeek, & Klinkenberg, 2020) . For good measure, broader-scale social distancing provides time for the health systems to treat cases and increase capacity for treatments to be developed in the longer term. In the same manner, experts agree that there is no determinant strongly related to the coronavirus deaths per million population.\nA major contribution of the present paper is a stepping stone towards more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between infections as well as deaths of COVID-19 with socio-economic or macro-economic determinants.\n.

Regression analysis can solve this problem of omission of control variables. To understand the effects of demographic, health system and other correlates of death rates and infection, we use the following regression function:\nHere, d is death rates, I is the infection rate per million population and in the right hand side we have all relevant determinants.\nFirst, we applied Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to understand the determinants of both infection and death rates. However, it is extremely likely that right hand co-variates are correlated. And if the determining variables are correlated, we might not be able to precisely estimates the coefficients resulting non-rejection of null-hypothesis, i.e. inference will be plagued. Another issue, since COVID-19 is still unknown to us, and so a clear modeling framework is not possible. LASSO have been extremely popular among the data scientists for prediction and model selection. We also applied LASSO-a machine learning tool that accept some level of bias to minimize the variance and select an appropriate model from the data. Though traditional LASSO measures are not meant for inference rather they are better suited for predictions, with some medication in the process we can apply LASSO for inference. We applied double-selection lasso linear regression model for inference. In this process, instead of running a single regression, the following process is followed:\nStep 1: running LASSO of key variables on other controls\nStep 2: running LASSO of left-hand side variable on other controls\nStep 3: finding the union of the selected variables from both step 1 and step 2 and estimate predicated value\nStep 3: regressing left hand side variable on key variables and predicated value from step 3\nStep 5: making inference For details of this methods see (Belloni, 2016 ) & (StataCorp., 2019)\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted November 4, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.20183236 doi: medRxiv preprint .

Probabilities [Pr (T < t)] are reported here. Notably, we do not find a statistically significant difference in the means of aging population (70 years and above), hospital bed per 1,000 population, smoking prevalence. Meanwhile, we notice that Urban population (p=0.0000), tropical country (p=0.0053), CVD death rate (p=0.0478), and immunization (p=0.0078) have a significant difference in their means. .

However, t-test and correlation cannot take other controls/confounding variables in account; and therefore, a meaningful association cannot be observed. The regression can help better understand the association. It is worth mentioning, even though regression is mostly used for understanding causation, regression cannot show the causation with a clear identification strategy such as randomized experiment. Otherwise, regression will show most the correlation. Table 4 presents the regression estimates. First two column shows the OLS and LASSO estimates for case fatality rate and the third column shows OLS estimates for total cases per million.

CFR increases by 0.586 with aging population increased by 1% of the total population. It also reveals that one unit increase in hospital bed per 1,000 population results in 0.435 unit reduction in CFR. For the LASSO estimates, consistent results are detected for both of the estimates (p<0.01). Coefficients are 0.705 and -0.500 for aging population and hospital bed per 1,000 population.\nOn another note, total cases per million is determined by total tests per thousand. Apparently, it features that one unit increment in total tests per thousand results in an increase of 19.26 units in total cases per million (p<0.01). In particular, it symbolizes the more a country tests COVID-19, the more cases found. At the same time, 1% increase in urban population significantly (p<0.10) results in an increase of 34.32 cases per million. Most other covariates are found to be less relevant (insignificant) in explaining infection and death rates.\nBased the cross-sectional analysis of COVID-19 cases, we observed that demographic characteristics and country's health systems capacity have strong correlation with COVID-19 deaths. On the other hand, a very few predictors of infection can be obtained. However, some key findings have been observed from this analysis.\nFirst, the country with larger number of ageing population had to face higher death rates. It is not surprising, Various studies found that ageing population is most vulnerable, and so countries with higher proportion of aging population has higher death rates.\nSecond, a proxy of health system variable-hospital beds per capita-appears to be highly important in COVID-19. It is not surprising since more hospital beds means the patients will not overwhelm the health systems, and thus treatment can be ensured for many and therefore, people will not die just due to lack of basic treatment say oxygen. In addition, more hospitals are also likely come with more ICU beds which again can save more lives.\nThird, whenever it comes to infection, story seems to be still unknown; the puzzle still remains. However, we find the urbanization has a strong correlation with infection. It is surprising since urban areas are highly densed and the individuals may have higher interactions and transmissions. Most of worst affected countries also had worst affected cities such as New York, London.\n.

The study finds that countries health systems and demographic structures play a significant role in determining death rates. The countries with higher aging population will have higher death rates, and country with good health system will have lower death rates. In addition, countries with higher urbanization would experience more severe outbreak. Other variables such as weather, vaccination coverage, etc. do not have association with neither death rates nor level of infections. The study suggests to improve the system at a maximum capacity to reduce the death rates, while special attention in social distancing should be enforced for the entire country, for that matter, highly-dense urban areas. Since pandemic is still on rise in many countries in this conclusion may change in the long run. Future research especially when pandemic will be almost over, can address those issues.\n.
