[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Currently, no treatment exists to slow down or stop the progression of AD. There is converging belief that disease-modifying treatments should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical stages. Making a diagnosis of AD and offering a prognosis (likelihood of converting to AD) at these early stages are challenging tasks but possible with the help of multimodality imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission topography (PET), amyloid-PET, and recently introduced tau-PET, which provides different but complementary information. This article is a focused review of existing research in the recent decade that used statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data for diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the MCI or preclinical stages. We review the existing work in 3 subareas: diagnosis, prognosis, and methods for handling modality-wise missing data-a commonly encountered problem when using multimodality imaging for prediction or classification. Factors contributing to missing data include lack of imaging equipment, cost, difficulty of obtaining patient consent, and patient drop-off (in longitudinal studies). "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the main cause of death for people over 65 years old. Over 5.4 million Americans presently suffer from AD. By 2050, a growing number of people, estimated up to 13.8 million, will have AD.\n1 AD has incurred significant health care costs. In 2016, care for patients with AD over 65 years old was estimated to be about $236 million. The Medicare payment for service to patients with AD and other dementia was, on average, twice the payment for patients with other diseases. The impact of AD on patients and their families, the health care system, and society is enormous and growing, which makes finding effective treatments to reduce the emotional, physical, and financial burdens of this disease an extremely important priority in the US and worldwide.\nAlthough significant attention has been paid to the treatment of AD, there has been little success so far. Within the decade of 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested in clinical trials registered with the National Institutes of Health, but only 1 trial completed and received Food and Drug Administration approval. Presently, there are only 5 Food and Drug Administration-approved AD-related drugs. 2 However, these drugs only temporally relieve symptoms. No treatment is available thus far to slow down or stop the pathologic damage of AD on the brain, so the disease is fatal. 1 According to recommendations from the working groups convened by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) in 2011, the staging of AD includes AD dementia, the symptomatic predementia stage called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and the preclinical or presymptomatic stage of AD. [3] [4] [5] [6] The term \"MCI due to AD\" was used to denote a subgroup of patients with MCI with a high likelihood of underlying AD pathology, because MCI, as a syndrome or clinical or research construct, can have other underlying causes in addition to AD. Today, there is converging belief that effective treatment slowing down or stopping the progression of AD should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, MCI or even the preclinical stage.\nIn both the recommendations by NIA-AA (known as the NIA-AA criteria) and by the International Working Group (known as the IWG criteria), the use of imaging for diagnosis and prognosis at all stages of AD has been significantly highlighted. It has been recognized that different modalities of imaging, including, but not limited to, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission topography (PET), and amyloid-PET, play different but complementary roles.\nAlthough the use of multimodality imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of AD in memory clinics is primarily based on dementia specialists' trained eyes, researchers have developed and are developing various statistical models and machine learning (ML) algorithms for quantitative imaging data analysis to produce diagnostic and prognostic results. This research area is currently pacing at an unprecedented speed. We envision that, in the foreseeable future, memory and aging centers will be empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), employing these automatic, computerized algorithms to assist clinicians' decision-making.\nThis article focuses on reviewing existing works that perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data using statistical, ML, and AI methods for diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the MCI or preclinical stages. There are numerous articles using a single imaging modality, which does not fall within the scope of this review. There are also many articles focusing on classification between AD, MCI, and normal controls (NCs), which are also not within our scope because they do not have an \"early\"-stage focus. We focused on articles published in the recent 10 years and used PubMed as the search engine.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows: the section \"Use of Multimodality Imaging for Diagnosis of AD at Early Stages\" reviews the existing work focusing on diagnosis; the section \"Use of Multimodality Imaging for Prognosis of AD at Early Stages\" reviews the existing works focusing on prognosis; the section \"Multimodality Models with Modality-wise Missing Data\" discusses approaches for handling multimodality imaging data in which not all the study subjects have all the modalities available, which is a common problem encountered in this type of study and is referred to as the problem of \"modality-wise missing data\" in this article. The section \"Overall Workflow-From Image Processing to Decision Support\" provides an overall workflow from image processing to generation of a diagnostic or prognostic result. The \"Conclusion\" concludes the article and proposes some future research directions."}, {"section_title": "USE OF MULTIMODALITY IMAGING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF AD AT EARLY STAGES", "text": "AD pathology consists of brain amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles, generally associated with significant loss of neurons and deficits in neurotransmitter systems. Diagnosis of AD at early stages requires pathologic confirmation according to well-known criteria, such as the NIA-AA criteria, which are briefly reviewed as follows, with a focus on the role of multimodality imaging.\nIn the NIA-AA terminology, \"MCI due to AD\" and \"preclinical AD\" are used to describe stages before the development of AD dementia. MCI due to AD is the symptomatic predementia phase of AD. The NIA-AA criteria for diagnosing MCI due to AD highlight the incorporation of biomarkers, as shown in Table I . Preclinical AD describes a phase that individuals have evidence of early AD pathologic changes but do not meet clinical criteria for MCI or dementia. NIA-AA proposed 3-stage criteria to characterize preclinical AD, as shown in Table II . These criteria are intended purely for research purposes and have no clinical utility at the present time.\nClearly, the NIA-AA criteria for diagnosing MCI due to AD (Table I ) and for characterizing preclinical AD (Table II) involve the use of multimodality imaging, such as amyloid-PET, FDG-PET, MRI, and, possibly, the recently introduced tau-PET. These imaging modalities can be generally classified into 2 types: imaging for identifying amyloid positivity and imaging for identifying neuronal injury. Existing research focuses on investigating the relationship between the 2 types of imaging. Some studies interrogated the relationship between amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism by FDG-PET in cognitively normal individuals. Several groups found hypometabolism in cognitively normal individuals with significant amyloid deposition. 7, 8 In the study by Yi et al, 9 hypermetabolism was demonstrated in frontal and anterior temporal regions in cognitive normal apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers but hypometabolism in temporoparietal regions. After adjusting for amyloid deposition, most of the hypometabolic regions disappear, whereas the hypermetabolic regions still exist. This finding implied that, although hypometabolism may be amyloid dependent in this patient cohort, hypermetabolism was not. Knopman et al showed that cognitively normal individuals with significant amyloid deposition at baseline demonstrate significant FDG hypometabolism at follow-up. 7, 10 Several studies also found that individuals with both markers of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration were more likely to develop cognitive impairments at follow-up. 10, 11 On the other hand, several studies found that there were cognitively normal, elderly individuals who had at least 1 significant neurodegeneration marker, including FDG hypometabolism, but did not have detectable amyloid deposition. [11] [12] [13] This group of individuals was considered to be more likely to have other preclinical pathophysiologic processes than AD, such as cerebrovascular disease, tauopathies, or synucleinopathies, 12 and therefore falls into a special category called suspected non-Alzheimer pathology.\nWhile A\u03b2 can be measured by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and PET imaging, the latter allows for cerebral spatial patterns (ie, topographies) of amyloid deposition to be examined. Brier et al studied the relationship between A\u03b2 topography and tau topography measured by amyloid and tau PET imaging, respectively, in a cohort of 36 cognitively normal elderly and 10 with mild AD.\n14 Singular-vector decompositions were performed on the tau and A\u03b2 burdens of originally extracted 42 regions of interest (ROIs), respectively. Each singular-vector decomposition produced 2 significant components representing 2 important topographies contained in the imaging data. For both tau and amyloid imaging, the first topography corresponded to the mean of the image. The second PET tau topography was most strongly localized in the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus. In contrast, the second PET A\u03b2 topography was most strongly localized in frontal and parietal regions. This analysis demonstrated that PET imaging data for tau and A\u03b2 exhibited strong autocorrelation across ROIs but that each had distinct topographies. Furthermore, the present study showed that tau deposition in the temporal lobe more closely tracked dementia status and was a better predictor of cognitive performance than A\u03b2 deposition in any region of the brain. "}, {"section_title": "USE OF MULTIMODALITY IMAGING FOR PROGNOSIS OF AD AT EARLY STAGES", "text": "Equally important to diagnosis is prognosis, which concerns quantification of disease progression such as estimation of the time to dementia onset or prediction of conversion within an interested time frame. A significant amount of existing work focuses on predicting MCI conversion to AD. In what follows, we will provide a detailed review of the existing studies. A brief summary can be found in Table III . Comparison of the pros and cons between the studies is provided in Table IV .\nSome studies focused on understanding the roles that different imaging modalities play in predicting MCI conversion. For example, Jack et al 15 studies the correlation of A\u03b2 load and hippocampal volume with MCI time-toconversion to AD. To measure A\u03b2 load, Jack et al computed a global Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET retention score formed by combining the standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate and precuneus regions using a weighted average. For patients who did not have PiB-PET, the global scores were imputed using CSF A\u03b242 and APOE \u03b54. Amyloid positivity was defined using a cutoff of 1.5. Then, Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate the effect of A\u03b2 load and hippocampal volume on the relative hazard of progression. The major findings from the present study include the following: (1) patients with MCI with amyloid positivity were more likely to progress to AD than MCI with amyloid negativity (50% vs 19% by 2 years); (2) among amyloid-positive patients with MCI, hippocampal atrophy predicted shorter time to conversion, whereas amyloid load did not; (3) in contrast, in the combined amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative MCI cohort, hippocampal atrophy and brain A\u03b2 load predicted time to conversion with comparable power; (4) however, the effects of these 2 biomarkers differ. The risk profile is linear throughout the range of hippocampal atrophy values, whereas the profile reaches a ceiling at higher values of brain A\u03b2 load.\nA typical approach adopted by relatively earlier studies for predicting MCI conversion was to concatenate features from multiple modalities into a combined feature set, which was then used to build a classifier. Because of the high dimensionality of the combined feature set, feature selection algorithms were commonly used before building a classifier. For example, Ritter et al 16 composed a feature set that consisted of features from multiple imaging and nonimaging modalities, including MRI, FDG-PET, CSF, neuropsychological testing, medical history, medical symptoms at baseline, neurologic and physical examinations, and demographic information. Feature selection was followed by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict MCI converters and nonconverters with 3 years from the ADNI datasets. Several algorithms were used to impute missing data, such as mean imputation and expectation-maximization. Ritter et al's approach achieved 73% accuracy in classifying 86 MCI converters and 151 nonconverters based on 10-fold cross validation. Shaffer et al 17 considered MRI, FDG-PET, CSF measurements, neuropsychological testing, APOE \u03b54, age, and education. Independent component analysis was performed to extract 4 and 9 components from MRI and FDG-PET voxel-based measurements, respectively. These components, together with other nonimaging features, were then used to build a logistic regression model, which achieved 71.6% accuracy in classifying 97 MCI converters and nonconverters within 4 years from ADNI based on a 10-fold cross validation.\nDifferent from the above-reviewed research that concatenated features from multiple modalities into a combined feature set, another line of research chose to \"encapsulate\" the features of each modality by themselves to better preserve intramodality integrity and reveal intermodality difference. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a commonly used approach to achieve this, in which features from the same modality were encapsulated into a kernel. The modality-wise kernels were then combined to make a classifier. Zhang et al 18 used MKL to build a classifier for MCI and NC, which was further used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters within 18 months. Two imaging modalities, MRI and FDG-PET, were used together with 1 nonimaging modality, CSF measurements. MRI volumetric features were extracted from 93 manually labeled ROIs. Regional FDGs of these ROIs were computed and used as PET features. Using 10-fold cross validation, the MKL classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 76.4% (with a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 66%) on the ADNI datasets, whereas the best single-modality classifier achieved 72% accuracy.\nLiu et al 19 acknowledged that existing studies had shown evidence that combining multimodality information improved the accuracy of AD-related classification. On the other hand, Liu et al pointed out that feature selection-an important step that warrants a good classifier-had typically been performed separately for each modality, which ignored the potential intermodality relationship. Therefore, Liu et al proposed a multitask learning method to jointly select features from different modalities. The basic idea was to pose an additional constraint to the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso)-based feature selection algorithm, which demanded the predictions using the features in modalities A and B,y A andy B , to be similar if the features, xA and xB, are similar. Liu et al applied the proposed feature selection method together with MKL to classify 43 MCI converters and 56 nonconverters within 18 months from the ADNI datasets, using gray matter (GM) volume from MRI and regional FDG of 93 manually labeled ROIs. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 0.6783 based on 10-fold cross validation, which is better than methods using single modalities alone. A classic approach for predicting MCI conversion, such as the afore-reviewed articles, is to train a classification model using the data of MCI converters and nonconverters and then to use the trained classifier to classify new patients with MCI. Alternatively, researchers have tried different ways to incorporate \"auxiliary data\" to improve MCI classification accuracy. Zhang and Shen 20 developed a multimodal multitask learning method (M3T) to jointly predict MCI conversion and 2-year changes of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores, which were treated as 3 tasks. Here, 2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores were considered auxiliary data. Zhang and Shen used baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data as 3 modalities. GM volume and regional FDG of 93 manually labeled ROIs and 3 CSF measurements were extracted from each modality and used as features. M3T includes a multitask feature selection as its first step to select common features relevant to all the tasks, followed by building multimodal SVM classification and regression models using the selected features for each task. M3T was applied to 167 subjects, including 40 ADs, 80 MCIs (38 and 42 converters and nonconverters), and 47 NCs from ADNI datasets. Using 10-fold cross validation, M3T achieved 0.739 accuracy (0.686 sensitivity and 0.736 specificity) in classifying MCI converters and nonconverters, which outperformed individual modality-based methods and a simple concatenation method (CONCAT) that concatenated all MRI, FDG, and CSF features into a single feature vector and applied LASSO for feature selection and SVM regression and classification.\nCheng et al 21 pointed out that most existing studies classifying MCI converters and nonconverters used data from patients with MCI alone (called the target domain), but ignored data in other related domains such as classification of AD and NC (called the auxiliary domain). Cheng et al believed that leveraging information from the auxiliary domain can improve MCI conversion prediction accuracy. Therefore, Cheng et al proposed a domain transfer learning method that included 3 steps: first, a domain transfer feature selection algorithm was used to select features that are informative to both the target and auxiliary domains. This joint feature selection was achieved by imposing a group-LASSO penalty on the weights of features in the 2 domains. Second, an instance transfer approach was used to select AD and NC subjects who are more separable than MCI converter vs nonconverter separation to include in the target domain. Finally, a classifier was built using the features selected in the first step and the samples selected in the second step to predict MCI conversion. The proposed method was applied to 202 subjects from ADNI, including 51 patients with AD, 99 patients with MCI (43 converters and 56 nonconverters with 24 months), and 52 NCs, using GM volume from MRI and regional FDG of 93 manually labeled ROIs, as well as CSF measurements. Using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy (83.5% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity), which was higher than those of methods not using information from the auxiliary domain. Young et al 22 proposed to build an AD vs NC classifier using a Gaussian process, which was then used to classify MCI converters and nonconverters. Note that the difference between the work of Young et al and the previously reviewed work by Cheng et al is that the former did not use any MCI data to build the classifier. The proposed method was used to classify 96 MCI nonconverters and 47 converters within 3 years from the ADNI datasets, using GM volume from MRI and regional FDG of 27 preselected ROIs, as well as CSF measurements and APOE. Using leave-one-out cross validation, Young et al's model achieved an accuracy of 74%.\nMost existing work as reviewed previously focused on using baseline multimodality imaging to predict MCI conversion. A few researchers explored the use of longitudinal multimodality image data. Hinrichs et al 23 used multikernel learning (MKL) to build an AD vs NC classifier, which was then used to compute a multimodality disease marker (MMDM) for each patient with MCI. The MMDM was used to classify patients with MCI as converters, stablers, and reverters within 3 years. Hinrichs et al used MRI and FDG-PET at baseline and at roughly 24 months as, well as nonimaging data, including CSF assays of AB1-42, total tau, and P-tau 18, NeuroPshychological Status Exam Score (NPSEs), and APOE genotype. For MRI processing, voxel-based morphometry was used to process the scans at baseline and 24 months, and voxel intensities were used as features. Also, longitudinal MRI processing was performed using the tensor-based morphometry approach in SPM5 to obtain the amount of volume change by taking the determinant of the gradient of deformation at a single-voxel level. For FDG-PET processing, voxels of the scan at each time point were scaled to each individual's Pons average FDG uptake value. Also, longitudinal features were calculated as voxel-wise difference and ratio between scans at the 2 time points. MKL was applied to build a classifier of 46 AD and 66 NC subjects from ADNI using a number of modalities. The MRI modality includes voxel-based morphometry features at baseline and at 24 months and tensor-based morphometrybased longitudinal features. The FDG modality includes normalized voxel-level measurements at baseline and at 24 months, as well as longitudinal features of voxelwise difference and ratio. Three nonimaging modalities include CSF, NPSE2, and APOE. This AD vs NC classifier was applied to 119 patients with MCI, giving an MMDM for each patient, which was used to predict each patient as a converter, a stabler, or a reverter within 3 years. The proposed method was demonstrated using 10-fold cross validation. Results showed that using all the imaging and nonimaging modalities as mentioned previously achieved 81.40% accuracy, 79.69% sensitivity, and 83.08 specificity, which outperforms separately using imaging data at baseline, longitudinal image data, NPSEs at baseline, longitudinal NPSEs, and biological measures.\nZhang and Shen 24 used MRI, PET, MMSE, and ADASCog at multiple time points to predict MCI conversion. The proposed method included 2 major steps: first, longitudinal feature selection was performed to select common brain regions across the multiple time points for MRI and PET, respectively. This method was carried out by imposing a group-LASSO penalty on a regression that predicted cognitive test scores using imaging data. Then, an MKL classifier was built using imaging features at each time point, longitudinal imaging features that reflected the rates of change over time, together with cognitive test scores at each time point. The proposed method was applied to 88 MCI subjects (35 converters and 50 nonconverters) who had MRI, PET, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog data at 5 different time points (baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). MRI images were processed to produce GM, white matter (WM), and CSF volumes of 93 ROIs, and PET images were processed to produce regional FDG of the 93 ROIs. Using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 78.4%, a sensitivity of 79.0%, a specificity of 78.0%, and an area under the curve of 0.768, which outperformed methods using baseline data alone and using single modality alone.\nIn terms of imaging modalities, a vast majority of existing research, including all reviewed previously, used MRI and FDG-PET. The accuracy of classifying MCI converters and nonconverters, even with combining CSF, cognitive scores, demographics, and longitudinal data, is below 80%. We were able to find only 1 article that used florbetapir-PET, together with MRI and FDG-PET, which achieved significantly improved classification accuracy. This article is reviewed in more detail as follows: Wang et al 25 proposed 2 partial least square (PLS)-based approaches to classify MCI converters and nonconverters using MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir-PET. The first approach, called informed PLS, worked by concatenating features from 3 modalities into a combined feature set and then using the combined set to train a PLS classifier. The second approach, called agnostic PLS, used PLS as a feature extractor, not a classifier. Specifically, the second approach used PLS to extract latent variables between 2 sets of imaging modalities. PLS is separately performed on MRI and FDG, MRI and florbetapir, FDG and florbetapir, MRI and FDG and florbetapir together, FDG and MRI and FDG and florbetapir together, and florbetapir and MRI and FDG together, respectively. The extracted latent variables were used to train a Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. Both approaches were applied to 64 MCI converters and 65 nonconverters from ADNI based on voxelwise GM measurements of MRI, voxel-wise FDG normalized to the average FDG of the cerebrum (as the reference region), and voxel-wise SUVR normalized to the cerebellum (as the reference region for florbetapir-PET). Using leave-one-out cross validation, results showed that the informed PLS approach achieved 81.40% classification accuracy (79.69% and 83.08% sensitivity and specificity); agnostic PLS achieved 82.17% classification accuracy (81.25% and 83.03% sensitivity and specificity), both outperforming single-modality models. Moreover, by adding ADAS-cog scores, agnostic PLS achieve a better accuracy of 86.05% classification accuracy (81.25% and 90.77% sensitivity and specificity)."}, {"section_title": "MULTIMODALITY MODELS WITH MODALITY-WISE MISSING DATA", "text": "In using multimodality data to build a prediction or classification model, a commonly encountered challenge is that not all the subjects in a study cohort have all the modalities available. This is due to various reasons such as cost, availability of imaging equipment, lack of patient consent, and patient drop-off (in longitudinal studies). For example, although MRI is used in almost every medical institute or clinic for AD-related diagnosis and prognosis, not many places have FDG-PET. The availability of amyloid-PET imaging is even more limited, especially that Medicare currently does not reimburse the cost of amyloid-PET imaging. Also, because of patient drop-off, some patients may only have baseline MRI (or other imaging modalities) but not at later time points. Note that we call this problem \"modality-wise missing data,\" which is different from conventional missing data problems. The latter can typically be handled by imputation algorithms, whereas the former cannot be handled by imputation algorithms because (1) there can be a substantial portion of patients who miss at least 1 modality; (2) it is possible that few patients have all the modalities available; and (3) the mechanism of missing data is clearly not \"missing at random,\" which is a fundamental assumption that most imputation algorithms assume.\nAll the studies reviewed in the previous sections used datasets containing subjects with all modalities available, or with a small portion of missing data that can be imputed. No article has been found that handled modalitywise missing data for diagnosis or prognosis at early stages of AD. However, there are a few articles developing methods to handle modality-wise missing data in classifying AD, MCI, and NC. Although this type of classification is outside the scope of this review, we would like to discuss these articles for the purpose of raising awareness of the problem of modality-wise missing data and encouraging future research to apply the methods in these articles to the study of early stages of AD. In what follows, we discuss each article in detail. A comparison of the pros and cons between these articles is provided in Table V. Yuan et al 26 proposed an incomplete multisource feature (iMSF) learning method to classify AD, MCI, and NC using baseline MRI, FDG-PET, CSF, and proteomics as 4 modalities. Data of 780 subjects were downloaded from ADNI with 172 ADs, 397 MCIs, and 211 NCs. Each subject had at least 1 modality. FreeSurfer was used to extract 305 features of MRI falling into 5 categories: Table V .

A total of 116 FDG-PET features were extracted using automated anatomical labeling corresponding to 116 ROIs. iMSF worked by first separating study subjects into multiple blocks, with each block having the same available modality or modalities. Then, 1 classifier was built for each block. Instead of building the classifiers separately, iMSF adopted an L21 penalty to force blocks sharing the same modality to use a common subset of features in that modality when building blockwise classifiers. iMSF was combined with 4 other methods to construct a classifier ensemble, which outperformed commonly used imputation methods, methods using single modalities, and the method that threw out missing data. This comparison was based on a trainingtest split of the dataset with the training set containing 50%-75% of the data. Xiang et al. 27 proposed an incomplete source-feature selection (ISFS) model, which was applied to the same datasets as Yuan et al. 26 The advantages of ISFS over iMSF included that the former could select modalities that were most relevant to the classification and could be used to classify new subjects whose modality availability was different from the training set (called \"out-of-sample\" classification), whereas iMSF did not have these 2 capabilities. The basic idea of ISFS was to estimate the weights \u03b2 that combined features to produce a classification result, as well as the weights \u03b1 that combined the modalities. By penalizing \u03b2 and \u03b1, both feature and modality selections could be achieved. Although such a bilevel learning model has been studied in the ML literature, Xiang et al. innovated it by further considering modality-wise missing data and allowing \u03b1 to vary across different blocks. This article showed that ISFS outperformed iMSF and other competing methods especially when the training sample size was small. This comparison was based on a training-test split of the dataset with the training set containing 10% or 50% of the data.\nThung et al 28 developed a matrix completion method for classification of AD, MCI, and NC, and prediction of three cognitive test scores (CDR global, CDR-SB 2 and MMSE). The basic idea of the proposed method is to apply multitask learning twice, one on features and the other on samples, to reduce the original matrix composed of samples and features into a much smaller size. The reduced matrix was more \"imputation-friendly\" as it contained a smaller number of missing values and therefore can be imputed using existing imputation algorithms. Specifically, in applying multitask learning on features, the original matrix was partitioned into small overlapping submatrices, each containing samples having at least 1 complete modality. Within each submatrix, a group-LASSO-based multitask learning algorithm was used to select a common subset of features across 4 tasks (one AD-MCI-NC classification task and 3 prediction tasks for the 3 cognitive scores). In combining results from the sub-matrix-wise multitask learnings, features selected for at least 1 submatrix were kept for subsequent analysis. Next, multitask learning was applied to samples similar to the way that it was applied to features, but with samples in the test set treated as multiple output targets. The proposed method was applied to baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data of 807 subjects from ADNI (186 ADs, 395 MCIs, and 226 NCs). All subjects underwent MRIs, 397 underwent FDG-PETs, and 406 had CSF. GM volumes and regional FDGs of 93 ROIs were used as MRI and FDG-PET features, respectively. Compared with conventional imputation algorithms and 2 state-of-the-art methods (iMSF and Ingalhaiikar algorithm), the proposed method achieved higher classification accuracy based on 10-fold cross validation.\nLiu et al 29 proposed a view-aligned hypergraph learning (VAHL) method, which worked by first dividing the dataset into several views based on the availability of different modalities. Then, Liu et al computed the distances between subjects using a sparse representation model and constructed one hypergraph for each view. Coherence among different views was captured by a proposed viewaligned regularizer, which considered that if 1 subject is represented by 2 feature vectors in 2 views, the estimated class labels for such 2 feature vectors should be similar because they correspond to the same subject. Furthermore, Liu et al integrated the view-aligned regularizer into a classification framework. The proposed method was applied to baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data of 807 subjects from ADNI (186 ADs, 169 progressive MCIs (pMCIs), 226 stable MCIs (sMCI), and 226 NCs). A baseline MRI patient was called pMCI if converting to AD within 24 months and sMCI if not. GM volumes and regional FDG of 90 ROIs were used as MRI and FDG-PET features, respectively. By comparing VAHL with 4 conventional imputation algorithms, as well as a number of state-of-the-art methods (2 ensemble-based methods and the previously reviewed iMSF, ISFS, and matrix shrinkage completion methods), VAHL outperformed all the other methods in the classification of MCI vs NC and pMCI vs sMCI based on 10-fold cross validation.\nLi et al 30 proposed a deep learning (DL) framework where the input and output are 2 imaging modalities, MRI and FDG-PET. A 3-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) was built using a training set of patients for whom both MRI and PET were available. The trained 3-D CNN was then used to predict missing FDG-PET using MRI for patients who only have MRI. Furthermore, a classifier was built using MRI and predicted or real FDG-PET, whichever is available. In image preprocessing, GM density maps from MRI and FDG-PET images rigidly aligned to the respective MRI images were smoothed using Gaussian kernels. Note that different from classic ML approaches, the 3-D CNN did not need feature extraction from the MRI and FDG-PET images but can directly use the 3-D images. The proposed method was applied to baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data of 830 subjects from ADNI (198 ADs, 167 pMCIs, 236 sMCIs, and 229 NCs). A baseline MRI patient was called pMCI if converting to AD within 18 months and sMCI if not. All the subjects had MRI, but more than half did not have PET. Using a half-half training-test split, the proposed method achieved better accuracy in MCI vs NC, AD vs NC, and sMCI vs pMCI classifications compared with conventional imputation algorithms.\nFinally, we would like to stress that all the aforementioned methods have strengths and limitations, as summarized in Table V . Despite their respective unique strength, the common advantage of using these methods is to maximally utilize the available data. On the other hand, because each method is based on some assumption that may or may not be true for a real-world dataset, there also exist risks that there may be a mismatch between the assumption of a method and the characteristics of the dataset. Nevertheless, one could always opt for not using any of these methods but eliminating samples with missing modalities and including only samples with all modalities available for training a predictive model. This could be a viable approach if the amounts of samples with missing modalities are not considerably large."}, {"section_title": "OVERALL WORKFLOW-FROM IMAGE PROCESSING TO DECISION SUPPORT", "text": "The previous sections focus on reviewing statistical models and ML algorithms for building a diagnostic or prognostic model with imaging features available. This is only part of the workflow. Another important part of the workflow, upstream to diagnostic or prognostic model building, is image processing and feature computation. In this section, we summarize the major steps of this upstream building block and provide the entire workflow so that interested researchers and practitioners could follow through with their specific data.\nThe major steps included in MRI processing include (1) anterior commissure-posterior commissure correction; (2) skull stripping followed by intensity inhomogeneity correction; (3) segmentation into GM, WM, and CSF; (4) registration to a common anatomical space; and (5) parcellation of GM into ROIs using an anatomically defined template. After these steps, volumetric measurement of each ROI is taken and used as features for subsequent ML models. PET processing primarily includes rigid transformation with respect to the corresponding MRI from the same subject. Then, the average intensity (eg, FDG or SUVR depending on the type of PET imaging) within each ROI is computed. Normalization using the whole brain or a reference region is typically done for each PET ROI measurement. The normalized scores are used as features for the subsequent ML algorithms . Fig 1 provides a schematic diagram of the overall workflow."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this article, we reviewed research in the past decade focusing on using multimodality imaging data for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD at early stages. Based on the review, we have the following major findings:\n\u2022 All the works we have found and reviewed focused on MCI, whereas there is little research on the preclinical stage. It would be of great interest to perform and review studies focusing on the progression from normal aging to MCI, which would provide even earlier alarming and effective preventative strategies.\n\u2022 In the study of MCI, most existing research focuses on building classifiers that used multimodality imaging and nonimaging data to predict MCI conversion to AD. The accuracy is generally below or barely above 80% with MRI and FDG-PET, even with inclusion of longitudinal imaging data. There is only 1 article that additionally included florbetapir-PET and obtained over 80% classification accuracy. This finding provides evidence that including pathologic imaging helps the prognosis.\n\u2022 Almost all the existing research on prognosis formulates the problem into a binary classification problem of MCI conversion by a certain time of interest. Disease progression is indeed on a continuous spectrum. Even for 2 patients who convert to AD within 2 years, their paths of progression could be much different. Prognostic models that predict the path of progression would provide great clinical value for properly intervening or managing the disease. This would need new model development that goes beyond binary classification to, for example, multiclass that represents different progression trajectories.\n\u2022 Modality-wise missing data is a common problem when multimodality imaging is used to make a prediction. However, little research has been found to address the problem of modality-wise missing data in developing a diagnostic or prognostic model at early stages of AD, although there are several recent studies focusing on the classification of AD, MCI, and NC. \u2022 Classic ML algorithms are still the mainstream methodologies used in the existing studies. DL-based algorithms have only been limitedly applied to early AD diagnosis and prognosis using multimodality imaging, despite their popularity in other areas of computer vision.\nDriven by these findings, we provide some recommendations on future research directions.\nFirst, future research can gear more toward using multimodality imaging for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the preclinical stage. It has been found that more than one-third of cognitively healthy individuals over 65 have moderate to high levels of brain \u03b2-amyloidosis and have a higher risk of developing AD. 4 Optimally, treatment trials should target the presymptomatic or preclinical stage, that is, before significant cognitive impairment, to lower A\u03b2 burden or decrease neurofibrillary tangle to prevent subsequent neurodegeneration and eventual cognitive decline.\nSecond, imaging that provides pathologic biomarkers of AD, such as amyloid PET, should be combined with imaging modalities providing neuronal injury biomarkers, such as MRI and FDG-PET, to achieve a better prognosis at the early stages. An immediate, related challenge to obtaining amyloid imaging is that the modality is not presently widely available in clinics, which makes it very important to develop prognostic models that can make use of multimodality images with modality-wise missing data. These models have greater, broader clinical utility than models that have to assume the availability of complete data or that are based on conventional missing data assumptions.\nLast but not least, with the rapid growth of DL research in the AI societies and the proven effectiveness of DL applications in a variety of areas of computer vision, including medical imaging, early-stage diagnosis, and prognosis of AD, using multimodality imaging can benefit from DL development. More research is expected along this line."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Conflicts of Interest: All authors have read the journal's policy on disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and have none to declare.
