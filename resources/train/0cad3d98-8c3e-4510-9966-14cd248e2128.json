[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The rise in agricultural productivity has long been recognized as the single most important source of economic growth in the U.S. farm sector. Though their methods differ in important ways, the major sectoral productivity studies by Kendrick and Grossman (1980) and Jorgenson, GoIlop, and Fraumeni (1987, table 6.7, pp. 198-200) share this common conclusion. In a recent study, Jorgenson and GoIlop (1992, pp. 746 and 750) found that productivity growth in the 1947-85 period accounted for 82 percent of the economic growth in agriculture compared with only 13 percent in the private nonfarm economy. Moreover, the 'rate of productivity growth over this period in agriculture (1.58 percent) was nearly four times the corresponding rate in the nonfarm economy (0.44 percent). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been monitoring the industry's productivity performance for decades. In fact, USDA in 1960 was the first to introduce multifactor productivity measurement into the Federal statistical program. Today, the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) routinely produces total factor productivity measures for the aggregate farm sector from production accounts that distinguish multiple outputs and inputs, adjust for quality change in each input category, and recognize that some farm production is both an investment good (i.e., breeding livestock) as well as agricultural output (see Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) for discussion of input quality). A properly constructed measure of aggregate productivity growth for the farm sector is certainly important. It provides a useful summary statistic indicating how economic welfare is being advanced through productivity gains in agriculture, but it may mask important statespecific trends. The purpose of this paper is to contrast patterns of economic growth among States and to decompose economic growth into its source components. This decomposition requires a consistent set of State accounts that conform to the economic theory of production. The underlying economic principles guiding the development of the State and aggregate farm sector accounts are perfectly symmetrical, but their application leads to One important difference: disagOegated State 'production accounts must explicitly recognize interstate interfarm transactions in farm goods while aggregate accounts must ignore these transfers. In the context of the aggregate accounts, these intermediate goods transfers are internal and self-canceling transactions. The USDA has recently developed a set of aggregate and State production accounts consistent with economic principles linking disaggregated and aggregate production accounts. These accounts are described in the next section. The resulting analysis of State productivity trends is presented in the following section. This analysis reveals that the smooth and continuous 1 trend observed for productivity growth in the aggregate farm sector masks considerable variation in productivity growth across States. Product Accounts ERS has constructed State and aggregate accounts consistent with a gross output model of production. Output is defined as gross production leaving the farm, as opposed to real value added. Inputs are not limited to labor and capital but include intermediate inputs as well. Both State and aggregate models view all of agriculture within their respective geographic boundaries as if it were a single farm. Output includes all off-farm deliveries but excludes intermediate goods produced and consumed within the farm. The difference is that output in the aggregate accounts is defined as deliveries to final demand and to intermediate demands in the non-farm sector. State output accounts include these deliveries plus interstate shipments to intermediate farm demand. The text in this section describes the sources and methods used to build annual production accounts over the 1960-93 period for each of the 48 contiguous States and the aggregate farm sector defined over these States.'"}, {"section_title": "Output", "text": "The development of a measure of output begins with disaggregated state-specific data for physical quantities and market prices of crops and livestock. These data were compiled by ERS's Resource Economics Division, For purposes of productivity measurement, output includes the quantities of commodities sold off the farm (including unredeemed Commodity Credit Corporation loans), net additions to inventory, and quantities consumed as part of final demand in farm households during the calendar year. As discussed above, off-farm sales for the aggregate farm sector are defined only in terms of output leaving the aggregate farm sector. Off-farm sales in the State accounts include sales to the farm sector in other States as well. Prices corresponding to each disaggregated output reflect the value of that output to the producer; that is, subsidies are added and indirect taxes are subtracted from market values. Prices received by farmers, as reported in USDA's Agricultural Prices, include an allowance for net Commodity Credit Corporation loans and purchases by the Government valued at the average loan rate. However, direct payments under Federal commodity programs are not reflected in the data. To prices for wool, mohair and program crops, we add payments per unit of production; dairy assessments are subtracted from receipts for milk.2 We construct Tomqvist indexes of farm output over the 1960-93 period for each State and the aggregate farm sector defined over these States. Note that the arithmetic sum of current dollar output across States will exceed the current dollar value of aggregate output by the value of interstate transfers of intermediate farm output."}, {"section_title": "Intermediate Inputs", "text": "Feed, Seed, and Livestock Purchases. Intermediate inputs consist of goods used in production during the calendar year, whether purchased from outside the farm sector or (in the case of the State production accounts) from farms in other States or withdrawn from beginning inventories. The inclusion and treatment of open-market purchases of feed, seed, and livestock inputs requires little discussion. These inputs should enter both State and aggregate farm sector intermediate goods accounts. However, the treatment of withdrawals from producers' stocks requires elaboration. Inventories enter the measurement of output, intermediate inputs, and capital input. Beginning inventories of crops and livestock represent capital inputs and are treated as such in the discussion of capital below. Additions to these inventories are the result of production and, \u2022 therefore, are treated as part of output. Consumption of goods withdrawn from inventory symmetrically are defined as intermediate goods and, therefore, must enter the farm input accounts. Ideally, on-farm consumption of feed and seed crops taken from current period production should not be considered intermediate input, while on-farm consumption taken from beginning stocks should be considered intermediate input. The former represent wholly internal transfers both in time and space while the latter represent intertemporal transfers. Unfortunately, the available data make it impossible to distinguish the source of on-farm consumption. Consequently, this study assumes that on-farm consumption of feed and seed crops are made possible through withdrawals from beginning inventories. Accordingly, feed and seed crops consumed on farms where produced are included in intermediate input. Agricultural Chemicals. Pesticides and fertilizers have undergone significant changes in input characteristics or quality over the 1960-93 study period. The price and quantity series used in the study of productivity must be denominated in constant-efficiency units. To account for changes in quality, price indexes for fertilizers and pesticides are constructed using the hedonic regression technique. The basic premise underlying this approach is that price differences across goods are due mainly to quality differences that can be measured in terms of common attributes. Let Pit denote the price of chemical i (a specific grade of fertilizer or type of pesticide) in year t and let x, denote the J th characteristic of the i th chemical. Pooling the data over products and over time, the hedonic model can be written as: where Dt is a dummy variable taking on the unit value for year t and zero otherwise and Eit is a stochastic disturbance term. When equation ( 1) is estimated in linear form, the parameter f3 i can be interpreted as the shadow price of the j th characteristic, and 81 captures the residual period-to-period price change between periods that is not accounted for by changes in the characteristics xij. Thus 81 can be interpreted as a constant-quality price index. To obtain a price index of fertilizers, we regress the prices of single nutrient and multigrade fertilizer materials on the proportion of nutrients contained in the materials. Price differences across pesticides are assumed due to differences in physical characteristics such as toxicity, persistence in the environment, leaching potential, etc. The corresponding quantity indexes are formed implicitly as the ratio of the value of each aggregate to its price index. The observations on P.1 in equation ( 1) consist of average prices for each of the chemicals. When averaged data are used rather than actual observations on prices, the variance of the disturbance term \u20ac, is no longer 02 but instead equals 021S1 where Si =Qil E Qi, the share of chemical i in total consumption. This implies a heteroskedastic disturbance term; chemicals with large-volume sales have smaller disturbance variances than materials with low-volume sales. Ordinary least squares estimation is inefficient when the errors have non-constant variance. To obtain efficient parameter estimates, it is necessary to use weighted least squares. We note, however, that given the particular error variance, if one first transforms each of the variables (including the vector of ones for the intercept) by multiplying by Siu2 and then applies ordinary least squares to the transformed data, the results obtained will be numerically equivalent to the weighted least squares estimator. A second concern is constancy of the estimated parameters. The prices of the characteristics (e.g., plant nutrients) may have changed over time, and this would imply a change in the .:.regression coefficients. We test the constancy of the parameters by employing a sequence of Chow tests. The observations are successively pooled into longer periods until the hypothesis of no structural change is rejected. Finally, the pesticides model was estimated in double-log form. It is well known that the antilog of the OLS estimate of 81 is not an unbiased estimate of antilog 61, which means that price indexes estimated by the dummy variable method are biased. A standard bias correction is to add one-half of the coefficient's squared standard error to the estimated coefficient (Teekens and Koerts [1972]). Petroleum Fuels, Natural Gas, and Electricity. Data on consumption of petroleum fuels, natural gas, and electricity in agriculture are available by State from the Farm Business Economics Report. Prices of individual petroleum fuels were taken from annual issues of Agricultural Prices. The Energy Information Administration was the source for natural gas and electricity prices. An index of energy consumption was formed as the ratio of total expenditures (less State and Federal excise tax refunds) to the index of fuel prices. Other Purchased Inputs. There remain several purchased inputs that collectively account for some 15 percent of the input service flow. We compute implicit quantity indexes of purchased services such as contract labor services, custom machine services (less income from machine hire), machine and building maintenance and repairs, irrigation from public sellers of water, and miscellaneous farm production items such as small hand tools and binding materials. A Tomqvist index of intermediate inputs is calculated for each State and the aggregate farm sector by weighting the growth rates of each category of intermediate inputs described above by their value share in the overall value of intermediate inputs. 'Labor Input The USDA labor accounts for the aggregate farm sector have for some time been based on the demographic cross-classification of the agricultural labor force developed by Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987).3 Matrices of hours worked and compensation per hour are developed for laborers cross-classified by sex, age, education, and employment class-employee versus self-employed and unpaid family workers. The task for this paper was to develop a set of similarly formatted but otherwise demographically distinct matrices of labor input and labor compensation by State. This was accomplished by using the RAS procedure popularized by Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987) by combining the aggregate farm sector matrices initially produced in that study but updated through 1990 with state-specific demographic information available from the decennial Census of Population.4 The decennial censuses for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 provide information by State on .employed farm laborers cross-classified by sex and employment class, sex and age, and sex and education. In addition, USDA collects employment data by State distinguishing laborers by employment class. These four marginal matrices are input into state-specific RAS models initialized by the final employment matrices for the aggregate farm sector. Employment totals in each marginal are controlled to total employment by class of worker. The process yields a set of 48 State demographically cross-classified employment matrices for the four decennial census years. Similar marginal data are not available for years intermediate to the 'censuses. For these years, the final Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987)  Each State-specific employment matrix is then multiplied by the matrix of annual hours worked per laborer constructed for the aggregate farm. Summing over all cells of the matrix and controlling to USDA's total hours worked by employment class leads to final demographically classified matrices of annual hours worked by State and year. Compensation matrices for hired workers are constructed similarly. The final annual hours matrices for hired farm workers are multiplied by the matrices of average hourly compensation. For each State and year, summing over all cells, controlling to compensation totals for employed persons available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Regional Economic Information System, and then dividing by the corresponding matrices of annual 'hours yields state-and year-specific matrices of average hourly compensation cross-classified by sex, age, education, and employment class. Labor compensation (opportunity cost) data for self-employed and unpaid family workers, each self-employed worker in each State is imputed the mean wage earned by hired workers with the same demographic characteristics. Tornqvist indexes of labor input are constructed for each State and the aggregate farm sector over the 1960-93 period using the demographically cross-classified hours and compensation data. Labor hours having higher marginal productivity (wages) are given higher weights in forming the index than are hours having lower marginal productivities. Doing so explicitly adjusts each aggregate time series of labor input for quality change in hours as originally defined by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967). As a result, the aggregate and state-specific price and quantity series for labor input measure labor in constant efficiency units.5"}, {"section_title": "Capital Input", "text": "The first step in developing measures of capital input is to construct estimates of capital stock for each asset type. For depreciable assets, we employ the perpetual inventory method to estimate capital stocks from data on investment. Our estimates of capital stocks of land and inventories are implicit quantities derived from balance sheet data. Next, we construct estimates of rental prices for each type of asset. We derive implicit rental prices based on the correspondence between the purchase price of an asset and the discounted value of future service flows derived from that asset. For this study, depreciable capital assets include nonresidential structures, motor vehicles, farm tractors, and other equipment. Data on investment were provided by the Rural Economy Division. The Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price indexes for passenger autos, motor trucks, wheel-type farm tractors, and agricultural machinery excluding tractors are einployed as investment deflators. For nonresidential structures, we use the implicit price deflator from the U.S. national income and product accounts. Capital Stock of Equipment and Structures. The perpetual inventory method is employed to cumulate annual investment into a measure of capital stock. In this method, we represent capital stock at the end of each period, say Kt, as the sum of all past investments, each weighted by its relative efficiency: 00 Kt = E (2) T=0 Investment goods decline in efficiency at each point of time generating the need for replacement of productive capacity. The proportion of investment to be replaced at age , say mt, is equal to the decline in efficiency from age T-1 to age : These proportions represent mortality rates for capital goods of different ages. Replacement requirements in period t, say Rt, can be expressed as a weighted sum of past investments: where the weights are the mortality rates. Taking the first difference of expression (2), we can write: The change in capital stock in any period is equal to the acquisition of investment goods less replacement requirements. To estimate replacement requirements, we must introduce an explicit description of the decline in efficiency. The function relating efficiency to age of the asset is approximated by the rectangular hyperbola. The family of hyperbolic efficiency functions is given by: = (L --01(L -pt.), 0 cl\" = 0, T>L; \u2022 where L is the service life of the asset and p is a curvature or decay parameter. (6) The above expression incorporates many of the commonly used forms of capacity depreciation as special cases. The upper limit of p is unity. This corresponds to the one-hoss shay form of depreciation. As the value of 13 approaches zero, decay occurs at an increasing rate over time. If p is zero, the function corresponds to the formula for straight line depreciation. Finally, if 13 is negative, decay occurs most rapidly in the early years of service, corresponding to accelerated forms of depreciation such as geometric decay. The problem now arises as to what value should be chosen for f3 in order to accurately reflect efficiency loss. Little empirical evidence is available to suggest a precise value. However, two studies provide evidence to suggest that efficiency decay occurs more rapidly in the later years of service. Using data on expenditures for maintenance and repairs of 745 farm tractors covering the period 1958-74, Penson, Hughes, andNelson (1977) found that efficiency loss was, in fact, very small in the early years of service and rapidly increased as the end of the asset's service life approached. More recently, Romain, Penson and Lambert (1987) compared the explanatory power of alternative capacity depreciation patterns for farm tractors in a model of investment behavior that also included the price of capital services. They observed that the concave depreciation pattern better reflected actual investment decisions. Taken together, these studies suggest that possible values of p should be restricted to the zeroone interval. Ultimately, the 13 values chosen for this study were 0.50 for durable equipment and 0.75 for structures. It was assumed that the efficiency of a structure declines slowly over most of the service life until a point is reached where the cost of repairs exceeds the increased service flows derived from the repairs, at which point the structure is allowed to depreciate rapidly. The decay parameter for durable equipment was chosen assuming that the decline in efficiency was more uniformly distributed over the asset's service life. Investment as used in this study is composed of bundles of different types of capital goods. Each type of capital good is a homogeneous group of assets for which the actual service life L is a random variable reflecting quality differences, maintenance schedules, etc. For each asset type, there exists some mean service life 1: around which there exists some distribution,of actual service lives. In order to determine the amount of capital available for production, the different service lives and their frequency of occurrence must be determined. It was assumed that this distribution could accurately be depicted by the normal distribution. One problem in using the normal distribution to calculate the frequency of occurrence is that the distribution extends infinitely in either direction from the mean. To eliminate these extremes, the distribution was truncated at a point two standard deviations before and after the mean. The area under the truncated normal curve was then adjusted upward within the allowed range of asset lives. Mean service lives correspond to 85 percent of the U.S. Treasury Department's Bulletin F lives. Once the frequency of occurrence of a particular service life was determined, the efficiency function for that service life was calculated using the assumed value of 3. This process was repeated for all possible service lives. An aggregate efficiency function was then constructed as a weighted sum of the individual efficiency functions using as weights the frequency of occurrence. This function not only reflects changes in efficiency, but also the discard \u2022 distribution around the mean service life of the asset. Land. To obtain a constant-quality land stock, we compiled data on land area and average value (excluding buildings) per acre in each Agricultural Statistics District in each State. We further disaggregated land input into irrigated and dry cropland, grazing land and other land in 11 Western States. The land area in each district and use category is reported in the Census of Agriculture. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) updates annually State estimates of total land in farms. Percentages in each district and use category were interpolated between the censuses. Land values per acre used to aggregate across the different land categories were taken from the annual Agricultural Land Values Survey. The land area diverted from current production under Federal commodity programs and the Conservation Reserve was excluded from the stock of land. Finally, service flows from public lands were estimated by means of grazing fees paid, using data from the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management and the USDA's Forest Service. Inventories. Beginning inventories of crops and livestock are treated as capital inputs, while net additions to inventory during the calendar year are considered a component of output. The number of animals on farms are available from annual surveys, as are the stocks of grains and oilseeds. However, in the case of grains and oilseeds, no distinction is made between producer-owned and commercially held stocks. Producer-owned stocks at yearend 1978 were estimated as quantities stored on farms plus producer stocks stored off the farm. Data on offfarm storage were obtained from Producer-Owned Grain Stocks (USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service). Quantities of commodities used as collateral for outstanding Commodity Credit Corporation loans (including commodities in the farmer-owned grain reserve) were subtracted. Stocks were then moved forward to yearend 1993 by adding, and back to yearend 1947 by subtracting, estimated annual changes in quantities. December average prices were used to aggregate across commodities held in inventory."}, {"section_title": "Prices of Capital Services", "text": "Firms will add to the capital stock so long as the present value of the net revenue generated by an additional unit of capital exceeds the purchase price of the asset. Following Coen (1975), this can be stated algebraically as: \u2022 where p is the price of output, q is the price of an additional unit of capital and r is the real discount rate. To maximize net present value, firms will add to the capital stock until this equation holds as an equality. This requires that: The expression for c is the implicit rental price of capital corresponding to the mortality distribution m. The rental price consists of two components. The first term, rq , represents the opportunity cost of invested funds. The second term, aR, r E q --( 1, is the present value of all future replacements required to maintain the 1=1 aK productive capacity of the capital stock. Let us define F as the present value of the stream of capacity depreciation on one unit of capital according to the mortality distribution m: = E m1(1 +r)-'."}, {"section_title": "1=1", "text": "Since replacement at time t is equal to capacity depreciation at time t: (8) ( aR _co E ---` +r = 2_, F t.i aK t., \u2022 and The real rate of return r in the above expression was calculated as the nominal yield on investment grade corporate bonds6 less the rate of inflation as measured by the implicit deflator for gross domestic product.

We then calculated F holding r constant for that particular vintage of capital good. Tomqvist quantity indexes for capital input in each State and the aggregate farm sector are formed by aggregating over the different capital assets using cost share weights based on assetspecific rental prices. Service prices for capital inputs are formed implicitly as the ratio of the total current dollar value of capital service flows to the Tornqvist quantity index. As is the case for labor input, the resulting measure of capital input for each State and the aggregate farm sector is adjusted for changes in asset quality."}, {"section_title": "State and Aggregate Farm Productivity", "text": "Input growth typically has been the dominant source of economic growth for the aggregate economy and for each of its producing sectors. Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987, table 9.5, p. 315) find this to be the case for the aggregate economy in every subperiod over the 1948-79 period. Denison (1979, table 8-1, p. 104) draws a similar conclusion for all but one subperiod covering the longer interval 1929-76. In their sectoral analysis, Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987, table 6.4, pp.192-94) find that output growth relies most heavily on input growth in 42 of 47 private business sectors in the 1947-79 period and, in a more aggregated study through 1985, in eight of nine sectors (Jorgenson and Gollop [1992], table 3, p. 749). Agriculture turns out to be one of the few exceptions. Productivity growth dominates input growth. This is confirmed in table 1. The source decomposition of output growth in agriculture is reported for the 1948-94 period and nine subperiods. Output growth equals the sum of contributions of labor, capital, and materials inputs and total factor productivity growth. The contributions of each input equals the product of the input's growth rate and its share in total cost.  1948-53 1953-57 1957-60 1960-66 1966-69 1969-73 1973-79 1979-89 1989- The singularly important role of productivity growth in agriculture is made all the more remarkable by the dramatic contraction in labor input in the sector, a pattern that persists through every subperiod. Over the full 1948-94 period, labor input declined at an average 2.7 percent annual rate, .a rate of reduction unmatched by any of the 50 nonfarm sectors evaluated by Jorgenson, GoIlop, and Fraumeni (1987).7 When weighted by its share in production costs, the contraction in labor input contributes a negative 0.89 percentage points per year to output growth. Capital input in the sector exhibits a different history. Its contribution to output growth has alternated between positive and negative over the 1948-94 period. On average, however, capital input increased 0.64 percent per year. The growth in capital input contributed an annual 0.12 percentage points to output growth. Materials input's contribution to growth in output also alternated between positive and negative over this period but averaged a positive 0.68 percentage points per year. Though large, this positive contribution was not sufficient to outweigh the negative contribution of labor and modest contribution of capital. The net contributions of all three inputs was a negative 0.09 percentage points per year, leaving responsibility for positive growth in farm sector output entirely to productivity growth. Productivity gains were positive in every subperiod spanning 1948 to 1994. By the late 1970's, however, the capacity of the sector to sustain historical rates of productivity growth came increasingly into question. The subsidized retirement of land in 1972 totaled 60 million acres. In 1973, the figure was less than 20 million acres, and declined to zero in 1974. In the aftermath of a rapid expansion in land use and aggregate agricultural output, such indicators as crop output per acre of land lent some credence to the popular hypothesis of slower productivity growth and pending economic scarcity. Between 1973 and 1979, the average rate of growth in output exceeded 2.5 percent per year. But nearly half of the growth in output over this period was accounted for by growth in inputs. In contrast, input growth accounted for only 0.54 percentage points of the 2.7 percent annual growth rate achieved during the 1969-73 period. The reduction in labor input persisted, but capital and materials inputs increased. Growth in materials input exceeded 3 percent per year (3.4 percent) over the 1973-79 period. The average annual rate of growth in total factor productivity over this period was well below the long-term trend. The economic scarcities in the 1970's gave way expectations of chronic surpluses in the 1980's. In 1982, the land area set aside totaled some 10 million acres. This total reached 80 million acres in 1983. Economic growth averaged less than 1 percent per year (0.86 percent) over the 1979-89 period, but total factor input decreased at a 1.7 percent average annual rate. Negative growth rates were observed in all major input categories. The rate of growih in total factor productivity returned to the long-term trend in the 1980's, and indeed appears to have accelerated from the growth rate of the 1969-73 period. In spite of the anomalous 1973-79 period, productivity growth was truly extraordinary over the 1948-94 period averaging almost 2 percent per year. Cumulated over the full 47-year period, this annual rate implies that farm sector productivity in 1994 was 249% of its 1948 level. Stated alternatively, in spite of the 3.1 percent decline in total input use from 1948 to 1994, productivity growth permitted agricultural output to grow significantly in every subperiod spanning 1948 to 1994 so that farm output was 137 percent above its 1948 level. The discussion has focused on the aggregate farm sector. While providing a summary measure of productivity growth in agriculture, it does not identify the gains in the individual states. An examination of productivity growth within and among States is the theme of the remainder of this paper. The appendix contains annual time series of output, capital, labor, \u2022 and materials inputs and total factor productivity for the period 1960-93 for each of the 48 contiguous States. Growth rates of total factor productivity for the entire 1960-93 period and subperiods compiled from the data in the Appendix are presented in table 2. One remarkable similarity exists across States. For the full 1960-93 period, every State exhibits a positive and generally substantial average annual rate of productivity growth. There is considerable variance, however. The median rate of productivity growth was 1.88 percent annually. Nearly one-half of the States (20 of 48) have productivity growth rates averaging more than 2 percent per year. Only one State (Iowa) has an average rate of growth less than 1 percent per year. The reported rates of growth range from 0.87% for Iowa to 2.95 percent for Michigan. Cumulated over the 34-year period, productivity growth in Iowa was responsible for a 34-percent increase in production between 1960 and 1993. Over the same period, productivity growth in Michigan contributed to a 272-percent increase in output over the 1960 level. Some regional homogeneity surfaces over the 1960-93 period. Two of the four States in the Southeast region (Florida and Georgia) exhibit productivity growth rates in excess of 2 percent per year. Of the remaining States, South Carolina registered a 1.87 percent annual growth rate. Productivity growth averaged 1.81 percent per year in Alabama. In the Northeast, seven States achieved growth rates of productivity in excess of 2 percent per year. In contrast, only two of the Mountain States (Idaho and Utah) achieved a productivity growth rate in excess of 2 percent. Productivity growth in six of eight States was less than the 1.88 percent median rate of growth. It is evident even before intertemporal differences are examined that the aggregate farm sector growth rates mask important regional and State differences in productivity performance. \u2022 The productivity growth rates reported in table 1 for the aggregate farm sector for the three subperiods 1960-66, 1966-69, and 1969-73 suggest rather stable productivity performance over the 1960-73 period. Yet table 2 reveals substantial regional and State variation over this 14-year period. For example, aggregate farm sector productivity growth increased 0.87 In the final subperiod, growth rates among States were more varied. Productivity growth was negative in a number of Corn Belt and Lake States during the 1989-93 period, the result of extensive flooding in the upper Mississippi and Missouri River basins. Drought affected the Southeast region. However, six of 11 States in the Northeast region and five of eight States in the Mountain region achieved productivity growth rates in excess of 3 percent. This result makes clear that the level of aggregate farm sector productivity growth within any subperiod and its changing pattern over time masks important interstate and interregional differences."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The results presented in this paper make clear that productivity growth is the single, dominant source of economic growth in the farm sector. However, the consistently high rates of productivity growth reported from subperiod to subperiod in many sectoral studies including Kendrick andGrossman (1980), Jorgenson, Gollop, andFraumeni (1987), Jorgenson and Gollop (1992), and Ball et al. (1997) conceal significant variation in regional and State trends. Productivity growth within States and regions deviates significantly from the sector average within subperiods. Moreover, intertemporal shifts in State productivity growth rates express far more volatility than is revealed by examining average nationwide patterns. 2.
