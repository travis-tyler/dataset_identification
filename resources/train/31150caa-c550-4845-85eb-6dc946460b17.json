Methods: A total of 835 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were involved.

Results: Participants were further divided into \u03b2 amyloid-positive (A\u03b2+) versus \u03b2 amyloid-negative (A\u03b2\u2212), resulting in five biomarker group combinations, which are CN A\u03b2\u2212, CN A\u03b2+, MCI A\u03b2\u2212, MCI A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+. Plasma NFL concentration markedly increased in the five groups longitudinally ( p < 0.001) with the greatest rate of change in AD A\u03b2+ group. The rate of change in plasma NFL was associated with cognitive deficits and neuroimaging hallmarks of AD over time (p < 0.005). Compared with the bottom quartile, the top quartile of change rate was associated with a 5.41-fold increased risk of AD (95% CI = 1.83\u221216.01) in the multivariate model.

The application of these biomarkers is hampered by a high degree of invasiveness, high cost, or limited availability [7] . Therefore, there is a strong need to develop blood-based biomarkers that, when applied in a proper context of use, could serve as relative noninvasive screening tests.\nNeurofilament light (NFL), a neuronal injury marker, is one of the potential blood-based biomarkers for AD [8, 9] . NFLs are neuron-specific heteropolymers that act as key structural components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and are mostly expressed in large-caliber myelinated axons [10] . Axonal damage leads to the release of NFL molecules into the extracellular space and consequently into body fluids, including CSF and plasma [11] . In line with this, increased blood NFL concentrations were reported in neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory disorders [12, 13] , including AD [1, 14] . Previous studies have validated that baseline plasma NFL concentration is increased in AD patients [11, 15] and it correlates with impaired cognition, neuroimaging abnormalities, and CSF biomarkers of AD pathologic features [16] . These evidences suggest that plasma NFL might be a promising peripheral biomarker for AD. However, this analysis was based on the baseline concentration of plasma NFL. A recent study analyzed the longitudinal change in serum NFL and found that it predicted neurodegeneration and clinical progression in presymptomatic familial AD [17] . However, studies using NFL in plasma as a longitudinal noninvasive proxy for neurodegeneration in sporadic AD are rare.\nHerein, based on the longitudinal data gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) prospective cohort, we calculated the rate of change in plasma NFL and tested the hypothesis that it correlates with cognitive, biochemical, and imaging hallmarks of AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation for this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http:// adniloni.usc.edu) [18, 19] , which was led by Principal Investigator Michael W.

We also corroborated that higher rates of change in plasma NFL (1) were correlated with cognitive deficits and neuroimaging hallmarks of AD over time, (2) were strongly associated with the risk of MCI-to-AD conversion, and (3) had diagnostic accuracy for AD dementia in the same range as established CSF biomarkers. Plasma NFL markedly increased in all of the five groups with the highest rate of change in the AD A\u03b2+ group, which implied that plasma NFL increment was a cumulative effect of neurodegeneration and it occurs throughout the process. Our study also discovered that both of the baseline concentration and rate of change in plasma NFL correlated with several cognitive and imaging AD hallmarks at baseline and over time. In detail, plasma NFL was associated with general cognition (MMSE, ADAS-cog and CDRSB scores) at baseline as well as with decline over time. For imaging measures, associations of NFL were identified with EC thickness and hippocampal volume. The rate of change in NFL had more significant correlations with all the measures except hippocampal volume, compared with baseline level of NFL, suggesting that longitudinal change might be a better predictor of cognitive decline and brain atrophy related with AD. More significant correlations were detected in the MCI A\u03b2+ and AD A\u03b2+ groups, especially for the cognitive scales. This result was in line with the recently published opinion that plasma NFL correlated with cognitive decline and brain atrophy, which was independent of A\u03b2 pathology [21] . The baseline associations with CSF biomarkers (CSF A\u03b2, P-tau, and T-tau levels) replicated previous findings, which showed that baseline plasma NFL correlated with lower CSF A\u03b2, elevated CSF P-tau and higher CSF T-tau levels in the whole cohort [16] . However, we failed to observe significant correlations of plasma NFL with CSF biomarkers for AD pathology longitudinally. No positive relationship between NFL rate of change and the rate of change in CSF core biomarkers for AD were investigated in our study. This finding probably reflects the notion that several different pathologic conditions are present in AD (e.g., A\u03b2, tau, and degeneration of different types of axons) and drive different biomarker responses, which will be weakly 60(1.94,16.21) 0.001 5.41(1.83,16 .01) 0.002\nThe second quartile 5. 81(1.97,17.15) 0.001 6.08(2.03,18.17) 0.001  3.65(1.28,10.42) correlated overall. As we all know, the pathological processes in AD begin more than two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. The correlations might be confounded by clinical diagnosis owing to that each single clinical stage has special pathological changes. This result may also indicate that NFL changes in the blood most closely reflect clinical phenotypes rather than pathological phenotypes of AD. Moreover, future longitudinal studies with longer follow-up duration are in command to clarify the true underlying associations. Previous studies showed that higher CSF NFL levels were associated with higher risk of MCI among cognitively intact individuals [22] and a shorter survival among patients with AD dementia [23] , suggesting that CSF NFL is a marker of clinical progression. We are the first to find that NFL in plasma could also predict disease progression by showing that both higher baseline plasma NFL level and elevated change rate are also strongly associated with risk of MCI-to-AD conversion and higher baseline plasma NFL level could also predict CN-to-prodromal AD conversion. The result showed that both CSF and peripheral NFL were predictors of disease progression. However, the predicting efficacy of the two biomarkers needs to be compared based on high-quality sample with long follow-up duration.\nIn agreement with recently published studies on sporadic AD [11, 16, 24] and familial AD [25] we found increased plasma NFL concentrations in AD+ patients as well as in MCI subjects compared with non-demented controls. The results of the current study confirm those reported by Mattsson et al. in terms of the NFL performance as a potential plasma diagnostic test [16] . In both studies, almost identical areas under the ROC curves, contrasting AD patients versus nondemented controls, were obtained (0.84 and 0.87, respectively). Furthermore, we also detected the potential diagnostic accuracy of the rate of change in plasma NFL, which was shown to have an AUROC of 0.806. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a peripheral, noninvasive biomarker for neurodegeneration showed diagnostic accuracy for AD dementia compared with established CSF biomarkers.\nTaken together, these findings support that plasma NFL is a promising biomarker for neurodegeneration in AD, which may have potential for prognosis and monitoring of disease progression. However, increased plasma NFL concentration has also been found in several other neurodegenerative disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy [26] , frontotemporal dementia [13] , Huntington's disease [12] , Parkinson's disease [27] , and human immunodeficiency virus with brain engagement [28] , implying that it lacks disease specificity for AD. Therefore, we do not envision that plasma NFL can be used as a tool to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. Rather, it may be valuable as a general biomarker for neurodegeneration.\nOur analysis is a longitudinal analysis of plasma NFL data, including the calculation of the change rate of NFL, the correlation of the rate of change in NFL with cognition and brain structure, the effect of the rate of change in NFL in the diagnosis of AD from controls, and the predictive value in disease progression, all of which makes the value of plasma NFL more comprehensive in the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. However, it still requires high-quality research with large samples to replicate the results. Perhaps the most important limitation of our study is the relatively small, age-unmatched groups, which we tried to counterbalance by controlling for age in all statistical analyses. Secondly, when divided into five groups, the small sample may limit statistical power to detect longitudinal changes, especially in the preclinical and early symptomatic AD groups."}, {"section_title": "102", "text": "A larger age span should also be included in future work because it is possible that vascular comorbidities may change with age and alter the diagnostic accuracy of plasma NFL for patients with AD vs. controls."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Taken together, our findings suggest that plasma NFL is a valuable biomarker of neurodegeneration but not specific for AD pathobiology. We speculate that plasma NFL will not be able to replace the CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration within a given diagnostic group, but it could perhaps be considered as a potential convenient longitudinal screening tool."}]
