[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of pneumonia. In the course of a few months, a total of 8422 probable cases of this highly infectious disease had been reported to the WHO by August 2003 [1] including 916 deaths. The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] . Genome sequences of SARS-CoV isolates obtained from a number of index patients have been published and have provided important information on the phylogeny and variability [3, 4] . The viral genome has the characteristics of a linear and positive singlestranded RNA virus about 29.7 kb in length, containing 14 identifiable open reading frames (ORFs) and short untranslated regions at both termini [5] .\nThere are currently no approved antiviral drugs that are highly effective against coronaviruses. Strategies exemplified by the use of antisense RNA or deoxyoligonucleotides [6] were reported to inhibit gene expression by interfering with RNA transcription or translation. Unfortunately, the administration of large amounts of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides has led to a toxicity problem [7] .\nRecently, several RNA-cleaving DNAzymes have been shown to be active in cleaving their substrate RNA under simulated physiological conditions. Two representative catalytic motifs, 10-23 and 8-17 (Figure 1) , were reported by Santoro and Joyce through in vitro selection from a combinatorial library of DNA sequences [8] . The most efficient DNAzyme, termed '10-23', consists of a conserved catalytic core of 15 nucleotides, flanked by two variable hybridizing arms that can theoretically be designed to be complementary to any target RNA. It can cleave between any unpaired purine and a paired pyrimidine residue, which endow them with tremendous potential for applications in down-regulation of targeted genes. To date, a number of groups have explored the potential of the 10-23 DNAzyme in biological systems. Banerjea and co-workers have attempted to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression by DNAzymes targeted at the HIV-1 tar, gag, tat/rev RNA, and coreceptor CCR5 [9] [10] [11] [12] . Sun and co-workers targeted the viral sequences from the HPV16 E6 and E7 genes [13] and the c-myc gene in smooth muscle cells [14] by DNAzymes. The biological activity of DNAzymes that cleave RNA derived from the bcr-abl, Egr-1, huntingtin, the env gene of HIV and PB2 mRNA of influenza virus A have also been examined [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . All the reported work demonstrated that DNAzymes can be used as a potential tool to specifically inhibit the disease-related genes.\nIn this study, we explored the potential use of DNAzymes targeting the SARS 5 UTR fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The DNAzyme designed for this purpose was found to be effective both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the DNAzymes could be as a new class of anti-SARS agent."}, {"section_title": "Cells and virus", "text": "The African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation) at 37 \u2022 C.

The virus features a discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, regulated by the pre-transcribed leader sequence and the specific TRSs in the 5 UTR of the genome. The 5 UTR sequence contributes to the regulation of the virus gene expression. Most strikingly, there is a high degree of sequence conservation in the 5 UTR region among all the SARS-CoV strains identified thus far, which suggests the functional importance of the region. Targeting the 5 UTR would therefore not only present a feasible strategy, but also potentially avoid the possible emergency of escape mutant viruses.\nA 10-23 DNAzyme was designed (Dz-104) with a cleavage site at nucleotide 104. The arm length was chosen as a 9 + 9 format as previously reported, which gave rise to a much more efficient catalytic activity based on a balance of the hybridization strength (\u2212 G) and kinetic turnover [14] . The cleavage site was selected at an AU dinucleotide since a hierarchy of RY reactivity (where R is a purine and Y is a pyrimidine) to the 10-23 DNAzyme follows the general scheme AU = GU \u2265 GC AC [15] ."}, {"section_title": "Dz-104 cleavage of SARS-CoV 5 UTR RNA", "text": "To test the cleavage activity of Dz-104, we conducted in vitro cleavage analyses using a 1 kb RNA transcript that was transcribed from a T7-containing primer-based PCR fragment of the 5 UTR. The cleavage point was in the middle of the transcript; thus the two bands of the cleavage product would appear at the same position in a gel. In a single turnover assay where 10-fold access of Dz-104 was used, the substrate RNA was efficiently cleaved with the expected size of the cleavage products ( Figure 3A ) and the observed rate was 0.064 min \u22121 ( Figure 3B ). Under a multiple turnover condition, the substrate was cleaved with an initial velocity at 0.4 nM min \u22121 ( Figure 3C ). When the mutant DNAzyme (Dz-104 (mt)) was subjected to the cleavage assay under the same conditions, it did not show any cleavage ( Figure 3A, lower panel) . These results demonstrated that the designed DNAzyme was chemically active in cleaving its substrate RNA with a capacity to turnover under the in vitro conditions. It also suggested that the local RNA structures where the Dz-104 targeted are accessible under the simulated physiological conditions."}, {"section_title": "Establishment of a model system for DNAzyme targeting in cells", "text": "To examine the efficacy of the designed DNAzymes, it is crucial to have a sensitive and meaningful system to perform the assay. We chose to use a fusion transcript of the 5 UTR and GFP gene as a model system. In this system, the DNAzyme target was linked to the 5 end of the GFP gene, which provided a versatile assay to monitor DNAzyme activity in cells (Figure 4 ). When the DNAzyme cleavage occurred, it was anticipated that the truncated fusion RNA would be subjected to the nuclease degradation; therefore, the level of the GFP expression would be reduced, which could be monitored by fluorescence microscopy. When the p5 UTR-eGFP construct was transfected into Vero E6 cells, the expression of the eGFP gene could be easily observed, but appeared to be a slightly weaker than the parental vector peGFP-N1 ( Figure 5 ). This minor change could be due to the effect of the extra 5 UTR sequences on the promoter activity or transcription efficiency of the GFP gene. However, the system should be sensitive enough to be used for assays of the DNAzyme activity.\nEffect of Dz-104-mediated cleavage of 5 UTR-eGFP fusion RNA on eGFP expression in Vero E6 cells\nThe advantage of using GFP is that it facilities the direct observation of the target gene expression by fluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate that the designed DNAzyme could target the mRNA with the SARS 5 UTR and suppress the eGFP expression, we co-transfected Vero E6 cells with p5 UTR-eGFP and Dz-104 at different ratios. The data showed that co-transfection of p5 UTR-EGFP/Dz-104, compared to the Dz-104 (mt) control, significantly decreased the fluorescent level, while it had no effect on the GFP in the cells co-transfected with pEGFP-N1 that contained no 5 UTR sequence ( Figure 5 ). The effect of Dz-104 on eGFP expression was shown to be dosedependent and the transfection procedure had no effect on cell growth (data not shown).\nTo confirm the DNAzyme effect on GFP expression, the percentage of the GFP-expressing cells was measured using flow cytometry. The results showed that there was a dose-dependent reduction in the number of GFP+ cells that were transfected with the p5 UTR-eGFP and Dz-104 (Table 1) . This reduction was not seen in the cells transfected with either the parental vector pEGFP-N1 or mutant DNAzyme Dz-104 (mut).\nTo determine if the effect of Dz-104 on the GFP expression was due to a cleavage of the 5 UTR-GFP mRNA, real-time PCR was performed to measure the level of the target RNA. It was shown that Dz-104 treatment of the p5 UTR-eGFP-transfected cells led to a marked reduction in the target mRNA level, as evidenced in Table 2 . This demonstrates that DNAzyme elicits the degradation of the 5 UTR-EGFP mRNA sequence in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in suppression of the eGFP gene expression.\nIn the present study, the DNAzyme was co-transfected with the target vector into Vero cells. Although this cotransfection did not fully mimic the cells infected with the virus, it did show that the DNAzyme could enter the cells and find the target RNA. A previous study showed that the DNAzyme transfected into mammalian cells remained stable and biologically active up to 24 h [22] , which supports our results, that sufficient DNAzymes had been transfected into the cells and functioned as a targetspecific gene suppressor.\nTaken together, our study shows that the DNAzyme can efficiently cleave the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV both in vitro and in cells, implying that the 5 UTR may well be a good target for molecular targeting. The study also presents a convenient system for screening other nucleic-acid-based agents for inhibition of SARS replication. Since DNAzymes have inherent physicochemical advantages over other nucleic-acid-based agents, such as higher target flexibility, minimal chemical modification, relative resistance to nuclease degradation and low cost of synthesis, they may be a clinically appealing new class of anti-SARS agent."}]
