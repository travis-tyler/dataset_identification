This is because improving child outcomes has the potential to benefit society through increased economic growth and decreased dependence on government-funded social insurance programs. Educational interventions can be classified as taking one of two forms, those that improve the quality of the inputs and those that increase their quantity. Much of the work to date has focused on measuring the effects of interventions aimed at increased quality, such as teacher quality, class size or classroom climate (Hanushek 1998 (Hanushek , 2003 Krueger 2003) or on estimating the effects of all school inputs, including those on both the quantity and quality margins (Card and Krueger 1992; Loeb and Bound 1996) . However, investments in resources are likely to happen concurrently -historically, school districts with the longest term lengths were those with the highest paid teachers -making it difficult to disentangle the effects of changes in quality from those in quantity. This work joins a more recent strand of the literature focused on determining the returns to increasing the quantity of inputs, namely time in school, separately from changing their quality (Hansen 2008; Marcotte and Hemelt 2008; Marcotte 2007; Pishke 2007; Simms 2008; Leuven et al. forthcoming) .\nWe estimate the effect of additional time in school on children's math and reading scores early in their schooling careers. Because the natural experiment we employ involves quasi-randomization of the time between tests, we are not plagued by the correlation between our measure of term length and changes in measures of quality.\nFurther, because we use variation in the time between tests that occurs over several months, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the effects of schooling on achievement than previously seen. By investigating the effects of extra time in school on children's academic achievement, we hope to help answer the question of how efficient public funds spent on schooling are. If the daily rate of learning is constant over the course of the year (a fact for which we provide evidence below), the extent to which there are increases in academic achievement resulting from another day of school at the margin may also help to inform policy debates about the returns to lengthening the school-year.\nTo measure how much children learn per day of schooling we exploit variation in the timing of test taking in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Class of 1998 (ECLS-K). Because children in the study were not all assessed on the same day, there is variation in the number of days elapsing between tests. The timing of tests appears to be essentially random (henceforth it will be referred to as quasi-random), allowing us to use the variation in the number of days between tests to measure the average effect of an additional day between tests. Children's math and reading scores increase by about 1.5 standard deviations with the passage of a school year.\nWe then isolate the effect of an additional school day in spring or fall separately from an additional day of development without the expense of school resources by first comparing the patterns of gains across the school-year and over the summer and then by using the within-school variation in ages at test taking time that is driven by date of birth.\nThe results suggest that about two-thirds of the gain over the school-year-period (or one standard deviation) is due to time spent in school. Finally, we examine the effects of an extra day of school between assessments across different subgroups of the population based on gender, race, parental education and family income and find surprisingly little variation.\nThe remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 summarizes recent studies of the relationship between time spent in school and academic achievement and describes the ECLS-K data used in our analysis. In section 3, we discuss estimation and our identification strategy. We then present results robust to specification choice that suggest there are gains associated with additional time in school. Section 4 discusses heterogeneous effects and Section 5 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Background on the Effects of Time in School and the Data 2a. Effects of Time in School", "text": "Previous studies examining the effect of time spent in school focus on the impact of variation in term length on academic performance and find somewhat mixed results. Pischke (2007) exploits variation in instructional time created by the German \"short school years\" of 1966 and 1967 and finds that the shorter school years were associated with a small increase in grade repetition in primary school and a decrease in enrollment in more advanced secondary school tracks. Lee and Barro (2001) use international data and find that the length of a school term is positive and significantly associated with math and science test scores and negative and significantly associated with reading test scores.\nTerm length is negatively related to grade repetition rates and drop-out rates but the latter finding is not statistically significant. Simms (2008) looks at variation in class time prior to a standardized test while the overall length of the school year was unchanged. Variation in time prior to testing was generated by the implementation of a law in Wisconsin restricting school districts to start dates after September 1 st . He finds that additional class time is associated with small increases in math scores among fourth grade students but is not associated with reading score gains. Extra classroom days are also associated with improved reading scores among third grade students in the upper end of the ability distribution.\nIn work similar in spirit to Simms (2008) , Marcotte and Hemelt (2008), Marcotte (2007) and Hansen (2008) exploit changes in the number of school days missed due to inclement weather. Hansen (2008) supplements the analysis of weather-related closings with an investigation of the effects of state-mandated test date changes in Minnesota. All find that more time in school before tests improves student performance on state-wide exams.\nFinally, there is a strand of literature using the variation in age and amount of schooling based on eligibility cutoff dates (e.g. Cahan and Davis, 1987; Cahan and Cohen, 1989; Luyten, 2006, Neal and Johnson, 1996; Gormley and Gayer, 2005; Cascio and Lewis, 2006) . These studies generally find that time in school improves academic outcomes of children, particularly minorities. For example, Leuven et al. (forthcoming) exploit variation in the amount of schooling young children receive in Holland to estimate the effect of time in school on test scores. The variation in the amount of schooling is driven by policies that allow children to start school immediately after they turn four and place children born around summer in the same class. These age-related rules create variation in the amount of schooling by up to 11 weeks and the study suggests this increases language and math scores of disadvantaged students by about 0.05 standard deviations.\nOur main contributions to the literature on the effects of time spent in school are twofold. First, as we show in evidence below, our identification strategy is both novel and credible. Second, but somewhat related, the differential exposure to school is continuous over a large range of days between tests: some students had as few as 60 days between tests while others had over 200. This allows us to estimate the returns to time in school over a longer time between tests and investigate whether rates of learning vary over the course of the year. By measuring the effect of time in school over the course of the \"normal\" school year, we complement the existing literature which has largely only been able to use small variations in class time due to weather shocks or changes in school start dates."}, {"section_title": "2b. Data: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999", "text": "We use data from the ECLS-K. The study began collecting data on kindergarteners in the 1998-1999 school-year. Because the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) designed the study in part to determine what effects kindergarten experiences had on children, students were tested in the fall and spring of their kindergarten year. The same test materials were used for both assessments. These assessments consisted of questions in three subject areas: language and literacy (reading), mathematical thinking (math) and \"knowledge of the social and physical world\" (general knowledge (urban, suburban, rural) . 4 This sample size is in line with the size of the sample used by most researchers employing the ECLS-K data (e.g. Elder and Lubotsky 2006, Fryer and Levitt 2004) . Students for whom at least some data is missing are, on average, poorer and score lower on the tests they do take than those for whom all information is available. We replicated our analysis using several methods of correcting for missing data, including multiple imputation methods (see Royston 2006) , limiting the sample to just those students with valid information and using information about other teachers and students in the school as proxies for the child's/teacher's information. Regardless of our choice of methods, the results were remarkably similar to those presented here. 5 Not many children lose points over the school year and the great majority of children with negative gains between tests lose less than five points. Regression to the mean may explain part of these negative gains.\nWe also make use of a sub-sample of children tested in the fall of first grade. The NCES chose 30 percent of the original sample of schools for data collection in the fall of first grade. This sub-sample includes nearly 5,300 children and represents 27 percent of the children in the base year sample. The NCES also attempted to re-test the entire original sample in the spring of 2000, when most students were in their first grade year.\nThe fall and spring first grade testing focused on the same three areas of competence as kindergarten testing. The same two-stage testing procedures were used, but the reading assessment administered in the fall of first grade was an augmented version of the kindergarten assessment. 6 Descriptive statistics for our first grade sub-samples, which mirror the kindergarten samples in terms of sample selection procedures, are reported in the second set of columns of Table 1 . This subsample is quite similar in its characteristics to the entire ECLS-K sample."}, {"section_title": "Quasi-Random Variation in Test Dates and Estimation of Effects of School Days on Achievement 3a. Assignment of Test Dates", "text": "The assignment of test dates is critical to our estimation strategy. The interpretation of our estimates as the average effect of extra time in school between tests hinges upon our argument that the test dates were randomly determined, or at least were not correlated with any observable or unobservable characteristics that also affect gains in 6 An NCES analysis of reading scores from kindergarten indicated that more students than expected scored near the test ceiling. The number of items on the reading assessment was therefore increased to include more difficult vocabulary and text to minimize the potential for ceiling effects. We have done our analysis using both the original scores and the scores as recalculated by NCES to account for the possible ceiling effects on the original assessments of kindergarteners. We present results using the original scores because our tests for ceiling effects (discussed in detail later) suggested there were none and the estimates using the original score are more conservative. Results using the recalculated scores are available from the authors upon request.\ntest scores. Ideally, children would have been randomly assigned to test dates in the fall and spring of kindergarten and first grade. Random assignment was not employed, but the process used to determine test dates produced what looks like a random distribution of test dates. However, the lack of strictly random assignment means that we will be unable to eliminate the possibility that test date assignment is correlated with unobservable characteristics determining test scores. The strongest argument in favor of our use of the natural experiment is that these were low stakes tests."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "This section examines the assignment process and its outcomes to provide significant evidence congruent with our argument that test dates have the characteristics of a random sample. A similar process was followed in all testing periods, so we focus our analysis on the kindergarten administrations. Panels A and B of Figure 1 show the wide distribution of test dates in the fall and spring, respectively.\nThe sequential pattern of test dates largely stemmed from the nature of the assessment used, which required one-on-one interaction between test administrators and the students in the more than 1,000 schools sampled. With such assessments, reliability is increased by limiting the number of test administrators. Hence the design of the ECLS-K was to have fewer administrators and spread the testing period more widely across the fall and spring schooling periods. The NCES preferred to survey students at the same point in time relative to their school start date, but the final decision about when to schedule the assessments was made by school administrators (in consultation with the affected teachers). Each administrator made an essentially independent decision.\nThe role of school administrators in scheduling assessments could be problematic for our identification strategy. Estimates of the effects of an extra day of kindergarten might be biased if teachers or administrators were scheduling children's assessments to maximize the gain between tests by attempting to put the most distance possible between the two tests. If so, Figure 1 would show the largest densities of observations clustering near the earliest possible test dates in the fall and the latest test dates in the spring; Figure   1 shows little indication of this type of pattern.\nAnother potential concern is that only the administrators and teachers who expect their children to benefit most from extra time between tests manage to \"game\" the test scheduling. Then, the administrators and teachers with the most to gain might schedule their tests with as much distance as possible between them, leaving the relatively narrow testing periods to other administrators and teachers (those with less to gain). If this type of behavior occurs when schedules are set, a regression estimating the spring test date as a function of the fall test date would return a negative coefficient. This could bias our estimates of the effect of a day between tests upward. However, this is not the case; the coefficient estimate is 0.161 with a standard deviation of 0.007. In fact, an NCES protocol stated a preference that students that were tested earlier (later) in the fall should be also tested earlier (later) in the spring. If this protocol had been followed to the letter, the aforementioned coefficient estimate would be one and there would be little variation in the number of days between tests, which is not the case.\nThough the protocol does not seem to have been well-followed, to the extent that school starting dates are related to test dates, our estimates may be biased. To address the concern that factors affecting achievement are also associated with test dates, we regress days between tests on a rich set of covariates including individual demographics and teacher characteristics (Table 2 ). Though some coefficients are statistically significant, only the relationship between being Hispanic and the number of days between tests is statistically significant across all three columns. What is more, only a very small portion of variance is explained (the R-squared statistics are all less than 0.07).\nIn order to get a sense for how close to random the assessment timing was, we conducted permutation tests which involved assigning each child a randomly drawn value of days between tests from a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the observed distribution of days reported in Table 1 . We then regressed the randomly assigned number of days between tests on the observable characteristics in Table 2 . We repeated the process 1,000 times and found that 12.7 percent of the coefficient estimates were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. This is less than the proportion of statistically significant estimates in Table 2 using the actual data (15 percent). This indicates that the number of days between assessments may be weakly correlated with observable characteristics, though the estimates in Table 2 any obvious patterns that this would bias our results.\n9 To be sure, we conduct several robustness checks, incorporating variables corresponding to the observable characteristics in Table 2 , along with state and school-start-week fixed effects in our equations, to check the sensitivity of results to their inclusion."}, {"section_title": "3b. Effect of an Additional Day between Tests in Kindergarten", "text": "We exploit the natural experiment by employing the variation in the number of days included in the period between which children are assessed. If test date assignment is essentially random with respect to test scores, our analysis allows us to measure the average marginal effect of extra time between tests. Adding a \"typical\" extra day between tests in our sample during the kindergarten year can be thought of as a weighted combination of adding a weekday/school-day (in which there are school and home inputs) and a weekend/nonschool-day (in which there are most likely only home inputs).\nIn this combination, the weights on each type of day are the probability of the specific type of day occurring. 10 In this section, the question we attempt to answer is: on average,"}, {"section_title": "what is the effect of extra time between tests (including both home and school inputs) on children's reading and math skills?", "text": "9 It is not the case, for example, that female students, who tend to score higher on reading tests, have more time between tests, on average, than their male counterparts. If this had been the case, we would have been concerned that the faster learning girls were driving the correlations between time elapsed between assessments and test scores. Further, the only coefficient that is statistically significant across the three separate estimations is that on the dummy variable for Hispanic ethnicity. The estimates suggest Hispanic students have less time between their assessments. If associated with the rate of learning at all (a conjecture we provide evidence refuting below), we hypothesize that Hispanic students do not learn as quickly as their Caucasian counterparts. Therefore the negative relationship between being Hispanic and the time between assessments biases our estimates of the effect of time on learning downward. 10 If students went to school on every weekday and did not go to school on the weekends, the weights would be 5/7ths and 2/7ths, respectively. Because school schedules vary due to holidays, teacher workdays and other days on which school is not held (e.g. snow-days), the weight on school-days will actually be less than 5/7ths.\nIn our first attempt to measure the effect of time on skill accumulation, we use the variation in the number of days between the two tests to measure how much children are learning in a \"typical\" school year. Specifically, we estimate the equation\nGains is the difference between the spring and fall test scores in a particular subject for child i. represents the fraction of a school-year (180 school-days plus corresponding weekends, for 250 days) between the child's fall and spring assessments.\nWe can therefore think of the specification as being related to a value added specification, where the change in test scores is related to the time that passes between tests; hence there is no constant term. The implicit assumption is that the relationship between an extra day between tests and the gains on those tests is linear. Todd and Wolpin (2003) describe the assumptions implicit with various specifications of the education production function. In this specification, it is assumed that previous inputs only enter the production function through their effects on lagged test scores. "}, {"section_title": "3c. Natural Development versus School Inputs", "text": "Our estimates suggest that the academic achievement of children improves with additional time between tests. However, without knowing more about children's experiences over the course of a \"typical\" additional school-year-period it is impossible to determine whether these gains are attributable to time spent at school or whether they reflect development that would have occurred without the expense of school resources.\nWe now perform additional analyses to attempt to separate the effects of time spent in school from gains that would occur even in the absence of schooling."}, {"section_title": "3.c.i. Using the School-year versus the Summer", "text": "The NCES followed the ECLS-K sample for several years. The vast majority of children tested in kindergarten were tested again in the spring of their first grade year (2000) . As detailed previously, a subsample was also tested in the fall of 1999, the first grade year. We can use this subsample to estimate the average daily gains in academic achievement over three periods. Consider our regression of the gains in reading scores on the fraction of a school year that elapses between the fall and spring kindergarten tests.\nThe coefficient estimate represents the average marginal gain over the school-year period. This included schooldays and weekends and school holidays. The period between the fall assessment in first grade and the spring assessment in first grade includes a similar mix of schooldays and non-schooldays that is governed by the school schedule.\nThe summer period, on the other hand, includes a much larger proportion of nonschooldays relative to the number of schooldays. We can therefore compare the estimates of gains over the school-year to those over the summer to help differentiate between developmental growth and time spent in school.\nThe results of regressions making use of the extra information from the first grade subsample are in Table 4 . In the table, each set of rows represents a separate set of regressions where the dependent variable is gains in test scores in the subject indicated by the column header over the period indicated by the row header. All periods have been normalized to include 250 days, so that the coefficients of interest can be easily compared. The first thing to notice is that the gains in reading and math scores over the school-year-period of first grade are even larger than those over the kindergarten schoolyear-period. In reading, children gain an average of 2.436 standard deviations in test scores and, in math, children gain 1.716 standard deviations. Secondly, the coefficient estimates for the rate of learning over a 250 day period from the spring of kindergarten to the fall of first grade are much smaller than the school year estimates. For reading and math, the estimates imply that the rate of learning over the summer is at most about threefourths of the rate of learning during the year.\nThe statistically significantly smaller coefficient estimates for the summer imply that the average rate of learning per day for both math and reading is slower in the \"summer\" period between tests than it is over the \"school-year\" periods. The majority of children likely experience little schooling over the summer period. In fact, in the average school-year-period there are two school-days per non-school-day, while in the average summer period the ratio is reversed. 14 The slower rate of learning over the summer period suggests that our estimates of the positive effects of time between tests are largely due to children's school participation in the fall and spring. This is consistent with the findings that children learn more and learn more efficiently during the part of the year when they are in school relative to the summer months when little schooling occurs (Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson 2001, Cooper et al. 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "3.c.ii. Using Within School Variation in Age", "text": "The second way we distinguish the effects of natural development from those of school resources is to use the within-school variation in age at testing for all children taking the test on the same day. More specifically, because all children within a school start school on the same day, those that also are assessed on the same day will have had the same number of school-days prior to assessment. Because there is variation in when children are allowed to start school (due to eligibility cutoffs) and when parents decide to send their children to school, children assessed on the same day will differ in age. We can use the difference between the effect of an extra 250 days during the schooling period and the effects of an extra 250 days in age at the time of testing to determine the effects of time in school itself.\nTo be clear, we estimate (2) 14 A back of the hand calculation equating the sum of the number of school-days and non-school-days in each period to the coefficient estimates for each period suggests that the rate of learning per non-school-day is less than 10 percent of the rate of learning per school-day. Because we do not have school schedules, we cannot precisely measure the amount of school-days versus non-school-days and so report this exercise as only suggestive evidence of the underlying relationship. Results are available from the authors upon request.\nto determine the effects of a school year, including natural development and time in The results of this exercise are presented in Table 5 . Columns (1) and (4) present the results of estimating equation (2) with reading and math scores of kindergarteners in the spring as the dependent variables, respectively. The estimates suggest average gains of 1.543 and 1.412 standard deviations in reading and math, respectively, over the course of the school-year-period. The estimates of from equation 3 are in columns (2) and (5). These estimates suggest that an additional 250 days in age contributes 0.34 and 0.51 standard deviations to reading and math scores, respectively. The difference between the estimates for each subject ( ) can be used to approximate the gains attributable to schooling (under the assumption that the gains to development and to schooling are additively separable). Therefore, the results in Table 5 suggest that the gains in test scores attributable to schooling are 1.2 and 0.9 standard deviations in reading and math, respectively.\nAs mentioned earlier, a child's age at the time of the test is partly determined by age at school entry laws and partly by parental choice about when to enroll a child in kindergarten (e.g. red-shirting). Therefore, the results just discussed may confound the actual effects of age with other things related to the choice of when to enroll a child (e.g.\nfamily resources that can be devoted to keeping a child out of school until he is older may also improve test scores). In order to determine the effects of age alone, we follow Bedard and Dhuey (2006) by using birth date relative to the eligibility cutoff date for school entry. These results are in columns (3) and (6) of Table 5 . Though the estimates are too noisy to be statistically significant, they are about the same size or smaller than the estimated effects of age obtained when not instrumenting. This supports our conclusion that much of the gain over the school-year-period is attributable to time in school itself."}, {"section_title": "Differential Treatment Effects 4a. Race, Gender, Poverty Status and Maternal Education", "text": "While we find evidence that an additional school-day between tests is associated with statistically significant gains in reading and math, the effect may vary across different student subgroups of the population. To test for heterogeneous effects, we use the parsimonious specification and include dummy variables for race and maternal education categories, poverty status, and interaction terms between these variables with each other and with our SchoolYear measure. None of the coefficient estimates on these characteristics were statistically significant, leaving us to conclude that the marginal gain to a typical day of schooling is not different for children in different population subgroups."}, {"section_title": "4b. Half-versus Full-Day Kindergarten", "text": "Though most states do not mandate the length of the school day for kindergarteners, many child advocates and policymakers call for full-day kindergarten to become the norm (for example, see the Education Commission of the States). The impact of an additional day between tests may depend on how many hours per day a child is in school. To explore this possibility, Table 6 presents results of regressions for children in half-day and full-day kindergarten separately. The estimated effects for a year of halfday kindergarten are slightly smaller than those for a year of full-day kindergartener. This may reflect the fact that although full-day kindergarten days are usually about twice as long as half-days, they do not devote twice as much time to instructional activity."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "That the estimates are not that different across full-and half-day kindergarteners might also suggest that the test score gains are attributable largely to development that occurs with age and not to differences in the amount of time spent in school. However,\nwe are cautious about placing much emphasis on comparing differences in the estimates across the length of the kindergarten day as whether a child attends half-day or full-day kindergarten is likely correlated with unobservable characteristics that might also affect gains to schooling. This is not to say that our estimates do not accurately measure the effect of extra time in school on the population of full-or half-day kindergarteners separately. On the contrary, the same arguments for quasi-randomness in test days on the whole sample works for these subsamples, too. What is problematic, however, is comparison of the effects between the two subsamples because full-or part-day "}, {"section_title": "4.c. Nonlinearities in Effects", "text": "Underlying our estimation strategy has been the assumption that the rate of learning per day was constant over each period for which we estimate it. It is possible, however, that nonlinearities exist in the rate of learning across these periods. To investigate whether this is the case, we re-estimated equation (1) adding in higher order polynomials (quadratic and cubic) in the time between tests. We then conducted F-tests of the joint significance of these higher order terms and found we could not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are zero. Additionally, we also estimated models where where we divided the assessment periods into subgoups and estimated the effect of time between tests by subgroup (e.g. interacting the time between tests term with a set of dummies dividing the testing period into quintiles). These, too, failed to show any pattern of statistical significance suggesting nonlinearities. It appears that a constant rate of learning is an appropriate assumption over the periods we study. 16 African American children and those living below poverty are more likely to be in full-day kindergarten while those living in suburbs or whose mothers have some college attendance but no degree are less likely to be in full-day kindergarten. We attempted to use state rules mandating full-day provision and policies determining state-funding levels for half-day classes as compared to full-day classes as instruments for the length of the kindergarten day a child attended. These attempts were unsuccessful because there was not enough cross-state variation in the rules and policies to also include state fixed effects."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This work adds to a growing body of literature examining the impact of instructional time on student performance. Consistent with previous work, our estimates suggest that there are test score gains for additional time spent in school. Conservative results show robust statistically significant estimates of gains to schooling over the course of the school-year of 1.2 standard deviations on reading tests and 0.9 standard deviations on math tests. If we convert these to gains per day of school, these estimates are smaller than those of Hansen (2008) and Marcotte and Hemelt (2008) . One possible explanation for the difference in magnitude is that the aforementioned papers exploit variation in instructional time generated by unscheduled school closures due to inclement weather.
