Northwest Oregon's coastal salmon runs have been historically strong, and a recent assessment by the North American Salmon Stronghold Partnership identified the Tillamook and Nehalem basins as producers of some of the strongest and most diverse wild runs in Oregon. Wild Salmon Center thus undertook this project to complete a more detailed analysis of areas with the strongest runs and best ecosystem condition, and to examine the degree to which the forested areas with salmon habitat are protected by land management that puts a high emphasis on natural resource conservation. 1) Only 8% of the forest of the North Coast is managed with a high emphasis on natural resource conservation, mostly on federally-owned late successional reserve areas in the Nestucca watershed. Approximately 40% of the forest area is in moderate conservation areas, including state forests. Over 50% of the forest area is dominated by industrial forestry. 2) Few watersheds (3%) on the north coast received high scores for watershed condition. The main reasons for low scores were the lack of mature conifers and hardwoods in riparian areas, high floodplain road density, the lack of large wood in streams, and excessive fine sediment. 3) Areas in state and federal ownership are generally in better condition than catchments in private ownership. Areas on private agricultural land and industrial forestland in the Tillamook lowlands and upper Nehalem scored particularly low. 4) Areas currently designated as Salmon Anchor Habitat on State forestlands are providing protection for some of the best areas for fish in the region. Several areas are indentified as excellent candidates for the increased protections through Salmon Anchor Habitat designation. These were identified based upon watershed condition, recent fish survey data, intrinsic potential, and expert opinion. 5) Four emphasis zones are described that deserve the highest conservation focus for salmon at the catchment level: the Miami and Kilchis Rivers, the Little North Fork of the Wilson River, and the Salmonberry River. Key recommendations of this study are: 1. Protect watersheds that are currently in the best condition. 2. Maintain and enhance the current Salmon Anchor Habitats to provide good watershed condition for salmon across the North Coast. 3. Provide a high conservation/low-risk approach to areas with the strongest, most diverse and/or unique salmon runs in the region. In particular, the Miami, Kilchis, Little North Fork of the Wilson, and the Salmonberry Rivers."}, {"section_title": "Oregon North Coast Salmon Conservation", "text": "Wild Salmon Center"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The North Coast of Oregon represents an important landscape for anadramous salmon and trout species. The five rivers of the Tillamook Bay (Miami, Kilchis, Wilson, Trask, and Tillamook) and the Nehalem River produce relatively healthy runs of fish. However, these runs are significantly below their historic and potential productivity. Wild Salmon Center (WSC) seeks the maintenance and enhancement of aquatic ecosystems that support anadramous salmon and trout in the Oregon North Coast. WSC undertook this assessment to contribute to ongoing policy discussions about watershed management in the region. The purpose of this study is to \"take the pulse\" of the condition of salmonids and watersheds. The findings are then integrated into conservation recommendations for salmon. Specifically, the questions that guided this study are: 1. Where are key areas for salmon and what is the condition of these areas? 2. How do current protections, particularly Salmon Anchor Habitats, relate to key areas for salmonids? 3. What is a conservation design that is beneficial for salmon? Because there is a key policy decision before the Oregon Board of Forestry related to salmon protection on state forestlands, this study provides a special emphasis on state forests and the Oregon Department of Forestry's Salmon Anchor Habitat (SAH) strategy. This study looks at watershed condition across the landscape, but pays particular attention to where empirical data supports the location of salmon \"hotspots\" on state forestlands. This study also assesses the current conservation status across the landscape. Finally, this study integrates the results within core concepts of landscape -scale conservation planning for salmon. There is a historical framework that is important in structuring these questions. Since the mid-1800s the Oregon North Coast has been subject to extensive anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Floodplains have been cleared, diked, and drained for farms and homes. Forests have been subject to extensive clearing and regeneration for timber. Additionally, catastrophic forest fires in the 1930s and 1940s burned a large area of what is now the Tillamook State Forest. This history is of primary importance as we try to understand \"current conditions\". The result is a landscape that is dominated by farms, timber plantations and regenerating forest. The whole region is likely outside the range of natural variability as it concerns wetlands, forest structure and aquatic systems. SAHs are a spatially distributed collection of watersheds with greater than 20% ownership of the Tillamook or Clatsop State Forests. A consortium of Oregon Trout, Ecotrust, and the Wild Salmon Center developed an initial selection of SAHs. A separate selection was developed by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (Talabere and Jones, 2002). The former method was based primarily on snorkel survey counts from 1999. The ODFW method was based on summarizing spawning surveys and stream habitat surveys (Talabere and Jones, 2002). A final selection of SAHs was implemented in 2003 as a mix of uniform and varying management prescriptions that last for ten years (ODF, 2003). SAH riparian strategies are more protective than non-SAH state land. Clearcutting and harvest levels are also capped at levels that vary across the SAH basins. This study is a mid-course assessment five years after SAH implementation. It is within the scope of adaptive ecosystem management to reassess conservation plans based upon newer data and scientific findings. Significant new data sets (Bio-Surveys, 2008;ODFW surveys) and concepts  have emerged such as intrinsic potential, decision support models, and whole basin surveys. In addition, the Oregon Board of Forestry is considering changes to the Salmon Anchor Habitat strategy. This study and report is to provide dialogue to consider salmon on public lands in the North Coast."}, {"section_title": "Background on the North Coast Area", "text": "To answer the three key questions, salmon status was considered at the regional scale, along with ownership, and conservation status. The North Coast area, covering 2,224 square miles, is defined in this project as comprising of four major watershed systems: the Tillamook Bay systems and its five rivers (Wilson, Kilchis, Miami, Trask, and Tillamook), the Nehalem River, the Lower Columbia River, and the Nestucca River. See Figure 1 for a depiction of the area. Climatically, this region belongs to the North Pacific Maritime system with abundant rainfall in the winter. The topography is varied with areas of steep terrain mixed with more moderate slopes and lowland floodplains."}, {"section_title": "Salmon in the Region", "text": "The North Coast has some of the most diverse, unique and productive salmon runs in North America. A recent database (2008) produced by the North American Salmon Stronghold Partnership (NASSP) has ranked this region highly with regards to the presence of salmon populations that currently are in good condition ( Figure 2). The Tillamook and Nehalem watersheds stand out in particular. The North Coast includes six different species/run-timings: coho, chum, fall Chinook, spring Chinook, steelhead, and cutthroat trout. The Tillamook Bay chum population is the southernmost significant population of chum in North America (NASSP Expert Opinion Database, 2008). Both the Tillamook Bay and Nehalem watersheds have independent populations of coho (Wainwright, et al, 2008). Independent populations are critical for the long-term persistence of coho salmon on the Oregon Coast. However, salmon and trout populations in the North Coast, as well as other parts of the Pacific Northwest have declined dramatically in recent years. Widespread, chronic anthropogenic disturbances (Waples, et al, 2008) and lack of protected areas (Pinsky et al, in press) tend to influence salmon populations adversely. Current abundances of fish are far below historic and potential numbers. For example, estimates of coho are around 10% of historic abundance. For coho in the Nehalem system, historical estimates are 236,000 (Meengs and Lackey, 2005) and currently (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004) average around 21,500, or <10% of historic. For coho in the Tillamook drainage, the historic estimate was 234,000 (Meengs and Lackey, 2005) and currently is around 7,000 or 3% of historic abundance (ODFW, 2005). It has been suggested that marine influences may play a role in the decline. However, on the Oregon Coast, salmon are \"relatively more dependant on freshwater habitat\" than marine (Salmon Anchor Habitat Work Group, 2004). Modeling has shown that better freshwater habitat conditions lower extinction probabilities for Oregon coastal coho (Nickelson, 1998).

"}, {"section_title": "Background on Conservation Design for Salmon/Freshwater Systems", "text": "A brief discussion of key concepts in salmon ecology and conservation planning can help frame the assessment, results and conservation design that this study presents. This report focuses on the landscape scale. At the landscape scale, it is useful to view salmon as \"meta-populations\" (NRC, 1996;Reiman and Dunham, 2000;Salmon Anchor Habitat Working Group, 2004;Schtickzelle and Quinn, 2007). Metapopulations are groups of local populations that are distributed across a heterogeneous landscape and are connected by migration (Independent Multidisciplinary Science Team, 1999;Hanski, 1998). This means that salmon populations tend to spatially arrange themselves into relatively persistent core areas of abundance; \"satellite areas\" of less suitable habitat; and areas of relatively unused habitat used for migration. Indeed, the conservation strategy of the ODF Salmon Anchor Habitats is to \"expand the core populations into the adjacent drainages\" (Talabere and Jones, 2002) ( Figure 5). Within this spatial context, conservation of salmon in the North Coast must have a temporal component. First, any conservation strategy must include a short-term plan to protect the watershed processes that maintain current core areas or anchor habitats (Reeves et al, 1995). Second, for longer term conservation it is useful to consider the concept of the \"intrinsic potential\" (IP) of a stream to provide high quality habitat . The focus of IP models is to map attributes of the stream that do not change over time, such as valley width, flow, and gradient. Together, these attributes can point to areas in the watershed that are more likely to develop high quality habitat. In metapopulation theory all available potential habitat may not be used by a population. Instead, habitat might be created and/or destroyed by disturbance processes (Reeves et al, 1995). However, habitat for a particular species is more likely to be created in certain parts of the watershed based upon their intrinsic potential. In the long term, maintaining a distribution of watersheds in \"good\" condition in areas of high intrinsic potential for multiple species would be a sound conservation strategy. For example, Figure 6 provides a graphic of how IP, current condition, and conservation strategy are related. A conservation strategy over time and space would bring as many watersheds as necessary into the upper right corner of high IP and good current condition. The purpose of this study is to use the latest science and data to indentify those areas in good condition and medium-high intrinsic potential. "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The methods that were developed for this study attempt to provide an open framework for assessing: 1) Watershed condition 2) Spatial and temporal patterns that recent fish surveys express 3) Habitat intrinsic potential For (1) and (2), a Decision Support Model (DSM) was used for assessing diverse data sets. A knowledge-based system was chosen since it is commonly used for assessing watershed condition in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere (Reynolds et al, 1999). The software system is the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) extension for ArcMap, coupled with the NetWeaver knowledge base development system (Miller and Saunders, 2006). For (3), existing intrinsic potential models were used. The purpose of using this approach is to provide an objective and transparent framework for capturing expert knowledge of how watersheds function in relation to salmon habitat. These are not mathematical ecological process models. Rather, they model expert knowledge of key ecological processes. These models are meant to be adaptive to reflect new knowledge, data or expert opinion. It was determined that the appropriate grain of analysis for this project was at the scale of Hydrologic Unit Code 7 (HUC 7), which is referred to as \"catchments\". A full treatment of the methods is provided in Appendices A and B. The outputs of the decision support models are termed \"scores\". Scores reflect the amount of support for a given analysis. Analyses are referred to as \"propositions\", since the analysis is evaluating a proposition. For example, the proposition was evaluated that a watershed is in good condition, or that a watershed has high intrinsic potential for coho.

Relative scores are depicted in Figure 8, providing a picture of relative watershed health. Watershed condition scores, by HUC6 watershed, are presented in Appendix D for all key ecological processes. Figure 7 shows how watershed condition scores relate to the type and amount of land ownership. Privately owned watersheds on average have lower watershed condition scores than state land. This is due to a number of factors including roads, forest patterns, sedimentation, and lack of woody debris. In agricultural bottomlands, this is due to land use patterns.

Decision support model for salmon ecosystem viability Appendix A: Methods detail Determining the appropriate components, attributes, and data sources The first step was to determine what aspects of the ecosystem were important to capture in the model. Based upon early group discussions, a number of different characteristics were important, including forest condition, riparian, floodplain, and stream condition. Wang et al (2006) identify three spatial scales that influence river conditions: 1) contact with the river channel, which was expanded to include aquatic components, 2) floodplain and riparian areas, and 3) catchment areas beyond the floodplain and riparian zone. The first attribute level in the model is classified into Stream, Floodplain and Riparian, and Upslope to reflect this ( Figure A1). The next step was to determine the key ecological attributes that are critical to salmon. For the stream component it was determined that sedimentation, water quality, in-stream habitat, water quantity, and connectivity between habitats for different life stages were critical. For floodplain and riparian attributes, shade, wood recruitment, land use conversion, and channel confinement were identified. For the upslope component, hydrologic response, management influence on landslides, and land use conversion were identified as key ecological attributes. For each of the key ecological attributes, a quantitative indicator of the condition of the attribute was identified. The criteria for identifying an indicator was its ability to provide meaningful information and the availability of data. Table A1 lists all key ecological attributes, their indicators and measures and data source. For a full explanation of assumptions and limitations for each of the attributes and their respective indicators, please refer to Appendix A. The data were then compiled by catchment."}, {"section_title": "Developing evaluation curves for each Attribute", "text": "The next step was to develop evaluation criteria for each of the key ecological attributes.

An attribute that meets the criteria of \"degraded\" receives a score of -1. Between \"degraded\" and \"functioning\" are a series of states. A linear \"fuzzy\" score is given for areas in between. In Figure A2, decision rules for large woody debris frequency were developed. A value of 20 key pieces of wood per 100 meters was determined as \"good condition\" based upon US Forest Service decision rules (Aquatic-Riparian Effectiveness Monitoring Program, AREMP). Less than 10 key pieces of wood was determined as \"poor\". These decision rules were agreed upon by the group and incorporated into the model. If a data value for this attribute for a given catchment had a value between 10 and 20, it would be give a fuzzy value in between.

Only watershed condition and intrinsic potential were used for these species): For all models, the following thresholds were used for Full Support (+1) and No Support (-1): Watershed Condition: \u2022 A watershed condition score of 0.5 receives a score of +1. \u2022 A watershed condition score of -0.5 receives a score of -1. Intrinsic Potential: \u2022 An IP score of 0.5 receives a score of +1. \u2022 An IP score of 0 receives a -1."}, {"section_title": "Fish Species Condition:", "text": "\u2022 A Fish score of 0.5 receives a score of +1 \u2022 A Fish score of -0.5 receives a score of -1.

We will need to check on these. The Tillamook Estuary Project (TEP) has developed culvert prioritizations for the Nestucca/Neskowin areas (Hoffman, 2006  Purpose (EMDS Explanation): Riparian condition is critical for temperature, wood delivery to streams, nutrients, and buffering against excess runoff/sedimentation. Riparian conifer size is indicative of the potential for providing these areas to fish bearing streams. Measure (EMDS Comment): % of riparian zone, 164 ft., which is greater than 20 inch DBH. We used the same measure as the NWFP. This measure is meant to capture the both the cover and the size of the trees. The buffer of 164 feet is based upon research in the Pacific Northwest. It corresponds to the average tree height of a mature conifer forest. In other words, the rule of thumb of one tree height riparian distance. Data Description (Domain Source): Forest size data was collected from the Interagency Vegetation Mapping Project (IVMP) data at 30m based upon 1996 Landsat imagery. The data has been continually developed and verified. Since the data was based upon 1996, we updated the data to 2007, accounting for major forest clearings. The streams layer used for this analysis was the High Resolution NHD data. This data set was used in favor of the ODF streams layer or the NetTrace model due to: 1) it provides a more consistent distribution than ODF, and 2) it is based off of actual streams rather than modeled. The modeled streams from NetTrace could potentially case error. Assumptions and Caveats (EMDS Assumptions): Tree size (DBH) data from landsat data on the \"per-pixel\" level can have scale dependant errors in classification. However, as an analysis shifts towards averages over an area, as this study does, the data tends to become more representative of the landscape. We expect there to be errors with the IVMP data. Data Description: A floodplain model was developed across the whole region using a DEM and a raster processing program. This program was developed at Utah State University and has been systematically tested by University of Montana Flathead Lake Biological Station for using in delineating floodplains for salmon applications. Land use/land cover data was derived from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) project based upon imagery from 2001. While the data is 8 years old, the amount of urban or agriculture to change in the floodplain in this region is not expected to be drastic. C-CAP data is quantified to be around 80% accurate for the land cover classes used. Assumptions and Caveats: The floodplain and land cover data are good regional depictions of the landscape. When aggregated to the HUC 7 level, several of the potential errors will become minimal. However, it is important to note that Measure (EMDS Comment): Miles per road/miles per stream within a 164 ft buffer on slopes less than or equal to 3%."}, {"section_title": "Data Description (Domain Source):", "text": "The data source for the roads is the BLM data set.
