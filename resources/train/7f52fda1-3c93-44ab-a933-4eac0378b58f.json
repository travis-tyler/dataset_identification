[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This paper studies the location of rst jobs after receiving a doctorate from a U.S. university since 1957. This critical transition in the complex international ow of human capital has received limited attention. Rates of return of foreign graduates are known (see Finn 2007), but basic questions remain unaddressed. Is the decision of international graduates to stay related to the background of the student? Is the relative economic situ ations of the home country important? Is the countervailing ow of American graduates taking jobs in other countries affected by similar issues? Are noneconomic policies and attitudes important? New PhDs are usually minted at a point in the lifecycle with a high degree of mobility, both geographic and economic. The credential is universally recognized and reects skills at the leading edge of knowledge and technology. By understanding better the nature of this key transition, a clearer picture can emerge of who benets from the human capital imparted by specialized training. How much of the underwriting of foreign graduate ed ucation (through fellowships and research funds) does the U.S. capture through retaining foreign graduates? How much do other countries recoup from support given to students abroad? ( Kuhn and McAusland 2006 develop a theoretical model of when movement of knowledge workers is benecial to the source country.) Our story begins at the point of earning a PhD from a U.S. university because data are limited on who decides to study abroad and why. The proportion of the population that is both highly skilled and liable to international mobility is small, making it difcult to collect data on international moves ex ante. However, U.S.based postgraduate education collects and concentrates a large fraction of the worldwide population of the highly able. Fortunately the unique role of American postgraduate education is captured by an equally unique survey, the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). Despite its name, the SED is a census of all PhDs earned in the US since 1957. 1 Some papers such as Freeman et al. (2004) have used the SED to describe the composition of U.S. doctoral graduate students. As far as we know, this is the rst paper to use the SED to study an endogenous postgraduation choice. The SED instrument is provided to graduates by their university while completing the nal requirement for their doctorate (as some readers of this paper may recall). The coverage and response rate is excellent and comes late in the matriculation process. Thus, most respondents have denite, in many cases executed, plans for their rst postdoctorate job. This wealth of information still suffers from the problem that only a small fraction of American graduates take their rst position outside the U.S. And international recipients are coming from widely varying situations that are difcult to measure and compare. We focus attention on the choice of rst job location in ways that limit these issues. First, our primary results concern the location of rst jobs between the U.S. and Canada conditional on reporting one of the two countries as the destination. Although only a small fraction of all U.S.educated doctorates report Canada as their destination, the census aspect of the SED makes the sample size large enough that signicant effects are still easily obtained. Tightening the focus to U.S. versus Canada choice then makes it straightforward to include the difference between unemployment rates as a measure of prevailing relative labor market conditions. We also consider whether national spending on research and development is important. Comparing the destinations of American and U.S.educated Canadian PhDs reveals a bias for home that works in opposite directions. Thus several interesting comparisons emerge between Americans, Canadians and other nationalities, because for each group moving to Canada is either an international, neutral or home destination. Second, in a separate analysis we study choices made by citizens of EU15 countries. For this group we relax the conditions to include choosing not only the U.S. and Canada but also going home\" to the EU. We address this choice using a nested uses the Survey of Doctorate Recipients to study career transitions for scientists and engineers. The SDR is not useful for the question studied here because it only follows scientists while they remain in the U.S. logit model. Besides controlling for many standard demographic factors entering the location de cision of graduates, there are two other revealing variations to study inside the SED. First, both economic and noneconomic policies have been important over the sample period. The sample for the basic set of variables extends from 1957 to 2005, which means we can detect the inuence of the Vietnam War military draft on mobility to Canada. Second, A second set of determinants come from the SED survey. During long periods the SED asked recipients whether they had debt (except for 2001) and whether there studies received foreign funding. As the next section describes these factors have straightforward implications for the U.S.Canada choice that depend on whether the person is Canadian or not. Our analysis complements work on other transitions involved in the international movements related to high skill workers Huang (1988) and Bratsberg (1995) study conversion of student visas to permanent residency using U.S. Immigration and Natu ralization Service data. Using information on home countries, they nd that variables such as U.S. immigration law changes, GDP, and funding of international students are relative to the return decision. Both studies implicitly assume that student visas that do not convert to permanent residence imply a return to the home country, but temporary work visas are valid for up to six years. In that sense our study of rst postdoctoral location lls a gap between student visa and permanent residency. A related literature considers brain drains,\" usually from the perspective of developing countries. Com mander, Kangasniemi, and Winter (2004) reviews the literature and provides some facts on brain drain using OECD data. Many studies mention lack of data on the issue or collect their own data with small sample sizes and low response rates. Freeman (2005) suggests that recent changes in the global market for scientists and engineers is changing the role of the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Framework", "text": "Consider a general model for new graduate i planning to move to destination country id . The number of destinations is large and the number of non native graduates observed moving to most destinations is very small. Further, including destinationspecic controls such as the current unemployment rate is difcult to imple ment at a global level. We start by restricting the sample and the model to the case where d is either Canada or the U.S. We hypothesize that movement from the U.S. to Canada after completing the degree depends on individual preferences, relative demand for spe cialized training between the two countries, and policies that encourage or discourage the individual to move. Our rst set of simple probits therefore takes the form: That is, we set plans to remain in the U.S. as the default choice. Obviously there are both demand and supply factors determining the values of v \u22c6 io . For example, when looking across elds indicated by the PGM vector, we only observe the net effect of the two sides of the market on the location decision. In other cases some supply and some demand concerns affect individuals differently by their country of origin. Even in cases when demand and supply are not separately identied by crosscomparisons of origins, our results on the net effects are novel and interesting in themselves. They demonstrate the degree to which that international location of high skill workers is related to economic and noneconomic factors that are tied to public policy. Three questions relate to plans that are used to create the endogenous variable in this paper: 1) postdoctoral plans; 2) status of plans, and 3) planned location. The rst question offers the respondent the following choices: postdoctoral fellowship, postdoc toral research associateship, traineeship, residency or internship, employment, military service, other plans (writing a book, homemaking). Blank answers are coded as plans unknown. The second question distinguishes plans by deniteness. For persons who provided a response to the rst question the choices are: returning to a predoctoral ap pointment; has signed an employment contract; still negotiating with one or more employers; seeking appointment but no specic employers; other (writing a book, homemaking). We classify the rst two italicized options as having denite plans. Finally, the same set of individuals who report plans of some sort were asked to provide a location of their future. (provided an answer to question 1 above). This fraction is almost identical for Americans and 3CNs and somewhat higher for Canadians. Our main set of results concern the six shaded cells in Table 1 conditional on plans to stay in North America (as provided in question 3 above). The value of the large sample size is evident here. Americans and 3CNs do not choose Canada at a high rate, but still over 6,000 doctorates in each group have plans to locate there after graduation. Of course, Canadians are much more likely to locate there, but given the sizes of the other groups their share of the total ow of U.S.trained doctorates into Canada is about the same size as the other sources. Table 2 summarizes variables in the four individualspecic vectors DEMO, PGM, UNIV and FIN. The richness of the data and the restricted choice allows us to isolate several forces that would affect individuals differently depending on origin. For example, the SED asked for parental education since 1962. We give this the traditional interpretation as an indicator of ability (controlling for eld and university). We posit that mobility is positively correlated with talent. The higher skill for a graduate would interact with demand side preference for a higher skilled person, extending their market and increasing their chances for mobility. However, mobility must account for a bias for home. Thus, parental education would tend to have a negative effect of returning to Canada for Canadians. A highly talented Canadian would reap greater returns by exploiting their skills and search broadly, making them more likely to overcome a home bias. More parent education should have a positive effect for Americans and 3CNs because in either case moving to Canada represents greater mobility. Meanwhile, graduates with dependents are hypothesized to be less mobile, and the signs for this variable would be the opposite of those for parental education. We can also consider that language is an important determinant of location."}, {"section_title": "The Data", "text": "Canada's status as a bilingual country gives us some leverage on the issue, even though the SED does not ask about uency directly. We categorized a person as Francophone if she attended high school in a Francophone country. A person is categorized as nonEnglish speaking if she attended high school in a country where English was not among the ofcial languages. (See Table A.4 for country lists.) Francophone graduates are hypothesized to be more likely to move to Canada, all else constant. While this is a straightforward prediction, the ability to check it and similar predictions against the results increases condence in the interpretation of other factors within the mobility model. The demographic composition of graduates of different origin is consistent with his toric, political, and cultural differences. For example, mean graduation year for 3CNs is much higher than for both U.S. and Canadian citizens, reecting increased participation of foreign students in US graduate programs. These graduates are primarily nonEnglish and most come from Asia. Among Canadians, 13% attended school in a nonEnglish and nonFrancophone country, reecting the larger fraction of naturalized citizens. For the US this number is much smaller, 0.48%. 3CNs are also more likely to be male than Americans or Canadians (76%, 67%, and 74% respectively). The same is true for the proportion of married men, while there are slightly fewer married men with children among American graduates compared to the other two groups. The fraction of graduates with children is similar among the three groups of graduates. The three most popular elds among 3CNs are Engineering, Life Sciences, and Phys ical Sciences. For Canadians and Americans the rst two most popular elds are Hu manities/Law and Life Sciences. The third preferred eld for Americans was shared by Physical and Social Sciences, while for Canadians it was Psychology. This difference may be explained by variety of reasons, e.g. differences in language requirements in different elds and others. Canadians were more likely to graduate from top universities than the other two groups, which is consistent with Canadian graduate programs serving as a close substitute for American ones except at the topend of the quality distribution. (All reported models include eld indicators so these differences are not driving any of the results across nationality.) Graduates of different origin also differed substantially in their nancial situation. More than half of American and almost a half of Canadian respondents report having debts, while less than a third of the 3CNs have debts. This may reect differences in funding of undergraduate education in the countries outside North America or limits on borrowing for foreign education. As for the funding of doctorate education, Canadians are more likely to have nonUS funding (of any sort and amount) than the other two groups. Unfortunately, the data does not distinguish the source as private (e.g. savings or loans from parents) or public (government scholarships, grants, etc.)."}, {"section_title": "The Best Laid Plans", "text": "Perhaps intentions are not a good signal of ultimate outcomes, and results based on  Table 1 also reports locations for those with denite\" plans, i.e. a contractual commitment. And Table 3 is the same as Table 2 except it describes patterns for only denite plans. ( Table A1 and Table A2 summarize the ERA variables and the key market indicators \u2206U and \u2206R&D.) As seen from Table 1, most plans are very concrete. Three quarters of those with plans have actually signed contracts, formally accepted a postdoctoral fellowship or are returning to their previous employment. For thirdcountry nationals (3CNs) the fraction is only threefths. We see that the locations for those with denite plans (as classied from question 2 above) are nearly identical to the overall group with plans of some kind. Canadians with denite plans are more likely to report returning to Canada, which may indicate that Canadians with indenite plans are still in the U.S. engaging in job search. If that fails, their denite plans will include more returns to Canada. Even among those that are still seeking jobs, the number that would ultimately end up in a different country than the planned one would likely be quite small. Thus, the signal on planned location asked several months after completing a doctorate is likely to be very close to ultimate outcomes. Thus plans as reported in the SED are not subject to the same concerns about plans stated when, say, entering a program. Including only denite plans would avoid some bias but lose information from those observations whose loose plans are accurate. Given these concerns all our estimates are based on reported plans of any kind, but results using only denite plans are also available. The limited spans for some of the variables explain our reporting of different speci cations. For example, we have already suggested that including parents' education is a useful (and conventional) control for ability. However, including it in the specication precludes a study of post9/11 outcomes since the data is not available to us after 2002. Similarly, the short and late coverage of the nancing questions preclude inclusion of the Vietnam Draft and NAFTA eras. Thus we report restricted models to take advantage of the complete 49 year span of data along with other specications that exploit the richer information from shorter spans. To relax the restriction to locating in the U.S. or Canada, section 5 considers a subset of the 3CN group, citizens of fteen EU countries (listed in Table A). These countries provide a large sample and data on \u2206U and \u2206R&D are available. (The disadvantage is that consistent denitions and data are available for a shorter time period.) For the EU15 we expand the choices to include locating in the EU15. We consider some specications that are directly comparable to the previous specication, but we focus on a nested logit model in which EU15 citizens choose the continent (North America or Europe) and within North American either Canada or the U.S."}, {"section_title": "North American Options", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Estimates: Shared Coefcients", "text": "Before discussing our preferred specication of the baseline model (whether planning to locate in Canada conditional on plans for Canada or the U.S.) we report ve versions of a restricted model in Table 4. These models are based on the pooled sample so It can be seen from the table that many of the predictions from a simple mobility model are consistent with the data. For example, temporary visa students are more likely to move to Canada as are American and international students who went to high school in Francophone countries. Married graduates and female graduates have a home bias. Conditional on staying in the North America, both male and married 3CNs are more likely to move to Canada, as are older graduates. The graduates were found in general to be sensitive to the labor market conditions: whenever the unemployment rate difference increases, graduates were more likely to go to Canada. During the preNAFTA period, individuals were less likely to go to Canada. After NAFTA was introduced only the graduates on temporary visas were less likely to choose Canada. During the Vietnam War graduates were more likely to locate in Canada, especially if they were in a temporary visa in the U.S. During the post9/11 years, the citizens of Muslim MidEastern countries were more likely to locate in Canada. Table 4. Specication 5 adds \u2206R&D which reduces the span of years and requires eliminating several of the ERA variables. The coefcient is positive, the opposite of the expected sign. And the coefcient on \u2206U changes sign and becomes much smaller in magnitude. However, both coefcients are insignicant. Since the macro variables are correlated it appears that the range available with both is not sufcient to distinguish their effects. We return to R&D later with the EU15 and a different type of model."}, {"section_title": "Later estimates build on Specication 4 in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "OriginSpecic Coefcients", "text": "Next, the baseline model was reestimated separately for Americans, Canadians, and 3CNs. In Table 5a and Table 5b we report two specications of originspecic probits. The rst specication is the same as specication 4 in Table 4 (  Specication 2 adds parental education variables which are available in the years 1962 to 2002. The coefcients are only signicant for the much larger American sample. The signs and relative values are such that more educated parents result in doctorates that are more likely to leave the U.S. This is consistent with higher ability graduates being more mobile. It also may reect preferences for mobility since more educated parents may themselves traveled. For our purposes it is also important that including parental education controls does not alter the sign or signicance of other included variables in Table 5a. That is because the limited span for parental education reduces the secular variation available to estimate variables in Table 5b. Relative unemployment rate \u2206U has a positive coefcient for Americans and 3CNs. A relatively worse U.S. labor market is associated with Americans and 3CNs being more likely to move to Canada. This is consistent with a simple story that local demand for doctorates is correlated (negatively) with the overall unemployment rate. However, for Canadians the sign is reversed. The positive coefcients in Table 4 are not robust to allowing all effects to depend on origin. Along with these cyclical patterns is a secular trend for more international mobility. Over time American graduates are more likely to locate in Canada (a small but signicant effect) which goes against the pooled effect in Table 1. The trend for Canadians is to stay south of the border. As with the demographic controls in the previous table we see that 3CNs fall in between but the same sign as Canadians. During the NAFTA period Americans are less likely to move to Canada. The loosening of visa requirements across the border did not result in a greater likelihood to locate in Canada after accounting for other factor. The result for Canadian visa students is negative, in this case the same sign as Americans. Thus NAFTA appears to be associated with Canadians being more likely to remain in the U.S. to start their postdoctoral careers but not for Americans to move north to pursue a greater variety in opportunities. For Canadians, NAFTA lowered barriers to employment in an economy roughly ten times the size of their domestic market. For Americans, NAFTA lowered barriers to a market of about the size of California and typically with no prior connection. Thus, the mobility effect of NAFTA should be much larger on Canadians than Americans. Indeed the estimated propensity is larger for them in absolute value. For 3CNs visa students the effect is the opposite sign but relatively small. During the Vietnam War era, Americans were much more likely to locate in Canada regardless of gender. Canadian visa students were also more likely to move home although the net coefcient is relatively small. For 3CNs the effect is very large, particularly compared to, say, the NAFTA era. Thus, the Vietnam War effect survives even when controlling for many other background variables. Returning to the post9/11 world we see that, as a control, the international ow of Americans is not signicantly different in those four years of data (after controlling for the time trend and unemployment). However, Canadians are now much more likely to return home. For 3CNs it is striking that the effect is concentrated among Muslim Mid Eastern countries who are much more likely to move to Canada conditional on staying in North America. The 9/11 coefcient is only a fraction of the size of the temporary visa and nonEnglish coefcients, but it is over 10 times the size of the oneyear time trend by origin. The Canadian and MidEast effects may simply capture rationing of visas rather than a supplyside preference. However note that the net effect for all other countries is essentially zero. This suggest that visa rationing is not the only effect here. Highly trained workers appear to respond to macro conditions that are not necessarily economic. If we look at specication 2 in Table 5b we see that many of these effects remain in terms of sign but not signicance. As mentioned earlier the difference is the addition of parental controls which reduces the number of observations substantially. The post9/11 effects are now essentially identied off one year (2002) so it is not surprisingly that the effects are less precisely estimated. Also included are variables in Table 5b and indicators for race, field of study, and university Estimates of equation of two specifications of (1). Additional variables listed in the following table. "}, {"section_title": "Additional Factors", "text": "Americans from top schools tend to choose Canada (all else constant) relative to other research university, while Canadians from the top tier schools are more likely to stay in the US. For 3CNs from top schools they are like their American counterparts, more likely to locate in Canada than 3CNs in lowertiered schools. This indicates greater mobility relative to home country for top programs. Questions on dependents were dropped in 2003 and as seen from Table 2 were subject to a lower response rate than other demographic questions. Thus we ran separate (unreported) specications with dependents and some interactions. Our key results are not altered. Having dependents increases the home bias for Americans and Canadians and is not related to plans of 3CNs conditional on their staying in North America. Married Canadian men with children had higher chances of staying in the US during the Vietnam war, while married 3CNs with children were more likely to go to Canada during the same period. No such differential effect is found for Americans. We also ran (unreported) models that included controls for debt and foreign funding of the doctorate. The effect of leaving school with debts was insignicant for all origins for the location decision. Foreign funding of the PhD was positive for all origins but signicant only for Americans and 3CNs. Somewhat surprisingly, Canadians with foreign funding were not more likely to return to Canada than those without such funding."}, {"section_title": "Safe European Home", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The EU15 Sample", "text": "The EU15 sample is summarized in Table 6. Recall this is a subset of 3CNs included in the previous section. We checked whether the EU15 differs in some qualitative way from the overall Other/3CN sample. We estimated a basic specication of a probit (U.S./Canada) on all 3CNs including the EU15. Next to it we report the corresponding coefcients from a multinomial logit for the EU15 for the Canada\" equation. Since the U.S. is the default choice in both the coefcients in both equations have the same interpretation as the effect on the difference in value between Canada and U.S. As reported in Table A.5 only four of the coefcients differ in sign. In three of these four cases the coefcients are not estimated precisely in the sense that neither coefcient is signicantly different from zero. The one case in which the sign changed and the estimate is precise is for the malemarried interaction term."}, {"section_title": "Nested Estimates", "text": "The comparison across columns in Table A.5 suggests that conditioning on staying in North America and not attempting to model the home choice for 3CN may not have a major effect on the coefcients. In this case of the EU15 adding their home choice and eliminating the conditioning on North America does not have a qualitative effect on the estimates. However, a multinomial logit framework is problematic when some options are strongly correlated. For Europeans putting the U.S. and Canada choice on the same level as returning to Europe may be akin to the distinguishing between red buses and blue buses in a transportation mode model. So we consider a nested logit framework in which North America (NA) versus Europe is consider the top level. This level then captures the bias for returning to Europe (home). Then within North America there is a choice between U.S. and Canada. Formally, the estimated model can be written: The term z EU is normalized to 1 whereas the included value z N A captures the value of locating in that continent inherited by both choices. Home bias for the EU15 citizens is determined by z EU \u2212 z N A . Then the choice between countries is restricted to country specic values, where we do not distinguish between countries within Europe. The two specic series we have is share of GDP devoted to research and development (R&D) and the unemployment rate (U). Because of the nested framework, these variables enter in levels not differences. The results of estimating (2) are reported in Table 7. First, a test that the nesting by continent is irrelevant amounts to a test of the coefcients on z equaling 1, which is strong rejected (a chisquared likelihood ratio test statistics of 56.61 with two degrees of freedom). This indicates a home bias. The coefcients have reasonable values when interpreting them as affecting home bias. Older EU15 citizens on temporary visas with foreign funding from nonEnglish and nonFrench countries strongly favor a return to Europe. On net students from francophone countries still favor Europe but much less than those from nonEnglish countries, perhaps reecting the value of Quebec in North America to them. Demographic variables are not signicant, however. Having controlled for preferences for Europe versus North America we consider the countryspecic variables in (2), where`country' means the EU15 collectively. Here we see that unemployment rates and per capital R&D expenditures help explain locations and the signs are as expected. A lower unemployment rate and greater R&D are both associated with ows of Europeans to that region."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Research and graduate education take place at the international level. In developing high skilled human capital, the large U.S. system of higher education tends to concentrat\u00e8 raw' product which is rened into PhDs that are then allocated back throughout the world. The products of the system (the new doctorates) have complex motives, including the pursuit of comparative advantage and a bias for returning home independent of career concerns. In pursuing goals based on these motives new graduates face demand for their skills that is sensitive to local public policies related to education, research and immigration. The joint effect of these factors has not been considered in previous research, mainly due to the limited access to data rich enough to disentangle the effects. This paper has taken a rst step in weighing supply and demand factors in determining international mobility of highly trained workers in order to conrm or call into question some common perceptions. By and large we nd location decisions that involve more movement across inter national borders are more likely over time, even after controlling for many factors not usually available with other data sources. But this trend exists within a complex context. We conrm that at least two major periods related to U.S. immigration, the Vietnam War and post9/11 eras, had expected effects on international location of new U.S.trained doctorates. In particular, the notion of Canada as a haven during the Vietnam War is consistent with conditional choices during that period. And Canada also appears to have taken on a similar role for doctorates from MidEastern countries after 9/11. The effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement are less clear. Also less clear is the extent to which current labor market conditions and overall expenditure on R&D play a role in attracting new doctorates. Higher relative unemploy ment in the U.S. appears to push American and thirdcountry nationals towards Canada, but does not increase the pull for Canadians to return home. In fact, the effect is the opposite for them. However, both unemployment and R&D have signicant effects of the expected sign for Europeans within a nested logit framework. On the other hand, to a large extent factors that should increase a graduate's ties to their home country have the expected effect. Foreign funding of the graduate's education has the expected effect of making the U.S. a less likely location. Age, language, sex, and marital status all have the expected effects on international mobility.   "}]
