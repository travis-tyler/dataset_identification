We determined arterial function at rest and during exercise in anthracycline-treated adult survivors of childhood cancers. Methods: Ninety-six adult survivors (54 males) aged 25.0 \u00b1 5.9 years and 60 (30 males) healthy controls were studied. Central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and radial augmentation index (rAI) was determined by applanation tonometry.

At submaximal supine exercise testing, survivors had significantly greater percentage increase in carotid stiffness than controls (p < 0.001). Among survivors, 32 and 53% had respectively carotid IMT and exercise stiffness index exceeding normal (> + 2SD of controls).

Optimal performance of the left ventricle depends not only on its intrinsic properties but also on normal functioning of the systemic arterial system, which constitutes the LV afterload and influences ventriculo-arterial interaction [4, 5] . Recent large epidemiologic studies reaffirmed the increased risk of cardiovascular [6] [7] [8] and cerebrovascular [9] events in long-term survivors of childhood cancers. Importantly, these findings implicate the possibility of an early onset of arterial dysfunction, which may predispose to development of major vascular events, in these long-term survivors.\nEmerging evidence suggests potential arterial damage with the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Kaushal et al. has demonstrated in-vitro toxicity of anthracyclines on endothelial cells [10] . Adults undergoing treatment for breast cancer, lymphoma or leukaemia were found to have increase in aortic stiffness early after anthracycline treatment [11] . There is, however, a paucity of data on long-term alterations of arterial structure and function in adult survivors of childhood cancers. Furthermore, studies on arterial function in cancer survivors reported to date were limited by the assessment of only the resting arterial function.\nThe potential clinical relevance of arterial mechanics during exercise is increasingly recognized. In patients with coronary artery disease, isometric handgrip exercise has helped to unmask the increase in arterial stiffness [12] . In patients after arterial switch operation for complete transposition of the great arteries, we have found associations between reduced aortic distensibility and strain at submaximal exercise and dilation of the neoaortic sinus [13] . In cancer survivors, dynamic changes of arterial stiffness during exercise have not been studied.\nIn the present study, we aimed to assess the resting and exercise arterial function in anthracycline-treated adult survivors of childhood cancers and to determine factors associated with alterations in arterial structure and function in this at-risk population."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Ninety-six anthracycline-treated adult survivors of childhood cancers who had been off treatment for at least 5 years were recruited from three public hospitals in Hong Kong.

Compared to survivors having normal carotid IMT, survivors with increased IMT were significantly older (27.8 \u00b1 6.8 years vs 23.7 \u00b1 5.0 years, p = 0.004), had a longer follow-up interval (17.5 \u00b1 6.2 years vs 14.5 \u00b1 5.6 years, p = 0.026), and had significantly greater rAI (70.68 \u00b1 15.73% vs 60.97 \u00b1 13.76%, p = 0.003) and rAI adjusted for a heart rate of 75/min (69.10 \u00b1 16.11% vs 60.94 \u00b1 12.34%, p = 0.007). There were, however, no differences between gender distribution, systemic blood pressures, and cumulative dose of anthracyclines between the two groups (all p > 0.05). Table 2 summarizes the univariate and multivariate analyses of the entire cohort for identification of significant correlates of carotid IMT. Univariate analysis showed that carotid IMT correlated positively with age (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), rAI (r = 0.41, p = 0 < 0.001), and adjusted rAI (r = 0.38, p < 0.001), but not with SBP, DBP, and cSBP (p > 0.05).

Significant interactions between group and exercise factors for carotid stiffness index suggested differences in magnitude of changes with exercise between the two groups (Table 3) , which suggested a significantly greater change in arterial stiffness during exercise in survivors compared with controls. The percentage change in carotid stiffness index from baseline to submaximal exercise was significantly higher in survivors than controls (39.9 \u00b1 32.5% vs 7.5 \u00b1 5.5%, p < 0.001).

On the other hand, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed carotid IMT (\u03b2 = 0.32, p < 0.001) as the only significant independent determinant. In cancer survivors, there were no correlations between baseline stiffness index and age at diagnosis, years after completion of anthracycline therapy, and the cumulative anthracycline dose received (all p > 0.05). The exercise stiffness index correlated with age (r = 0.27, p = 0.008) and years after completion of anthracycline therapy (r = 0.26, p = 0.013), but not the age at diagnosis or the cumulative anthracycline dose received (both p > 0.05). Similarly, the dynamic percentage increase in stiffness index correlated with age at study (r = 0.29, p = 0.005), and tended to correlated with years after completion of anthracycline therapy (r = 0.21, p = 0.053)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study shows an increase in carotid arterial stiffness, central SBP, radial augmentation index, and carotid IMT in anthracycline-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancers. Furthermore, worsening of arterial stiffness was evident during submaximal exercise, with about half of the survivors having an arterial stiffness index exceeding the upper limit of normal. Age amongst other factors is independently associated with baseline and exercise stiffness index in survivors. The important novel finding of this study is the steeper slope of increase in both carotid IMT and exercise-induced changes in carotid arterial stiffness with age in survivors compared with that in controls, implicating the possibility of accelerated vascular ageing in adult survivors of childhood cancers.\nStudies on arterial mechanics in cancer survivors are limited to non-stressed, short-to intermediate-term assessment after completion of chemotherapy. Chaosuwannakit et al. reported an increase in aortic stiffness in adults receiving anthracycline for the treatment of breast cancer, lymphoma, or leukaemia within 4 months of chemotherapy exposure [11] . Mizia-Stec et al. similarly found decreased compliance and increased stiffness of the aortic and carotid arteries in breast cancer patients assessed at 6 months after the last dose of anthracycline [20] . However, longer term studies in adults are not available. In children and adolescent cancer survivors, previous studies have shown increased aortic stiffness, as assessed by echocardiography [21] and measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity [22, 23] , and increased carotid arterial stiffness [24] . Whether the change in arterial mechanics in childhood cancer survivors would persist in adulthood has been unclear. Our data provide additional evidence to suggest that adult survivors of childhood cancers indeed continue to have altered arterial mechanics as characterized by increased carotid arterial stiffness, increased radial augmentation index, and increased central SBP.\nIn this study, we have further defined the exercise arterial mechanics in long-term survivors. Assessment of arterial mechanics during exercise stress has recently gained increasing interest. Moon et al. recently showed the unmasking of increase in arterial stiffness by isometric handgrip exercise in patients with coronary artery disease [12] . High-intensity acute exercise has further been shown to increase carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a robust marker of central arterial stiffness, in patients with untreated recently diagnosed grade I essential hypertension but not in healthy subjects [25] . Our group has further reported on potential deleterious effect of augmented arterial stiffness during exercise on dilation of the neoaorta after arterial switch operation [13] . The findings in the present study of an augmented increase in carotid arterial stiffness with levels exceeding normal in about half of the survivors may hence have important haemodynamic and clinical implications as discussed later.\nApart from functional alteration of the arteries at rest and during exercise, structural changes with an increase in carotid IMT, the surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, was found in about one-third of the survivors. Most of the previous adult [26, 27] and paediatric [28] studies have primarily documented an increase in carotid IMT in patients with head and neck irradiation. An acute increase in carotid IMT has also been reported to occur within 10 weeks after completion of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer [29] . Our findings are of clinical significance given the extended duration of follow-up and that 95% (89/94) of our survivors had no history of irradiation. Additionally, the novel finding of a steeper slope of increase in carotid IMT with age in survivors compared with that in healthy controls implies accelerated vascular ageing with perhaps an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis. While this undoubtedly remains speculative, the excess cardiac mortality [6] [7] [8] and excess risk of cerebrovascular events survivors [9] with cancers diagnosed during childhood and young adulthood may be clues to an underlying vasculopathy related to cancer treatments.\nWhile the exact mechanisms that underlie the functional and structural alterations of the arteries in adult survivors of childhood cancers remains to be confirmed, several lines of evidence suggest that endothelial dysfunction might be the culprit. In vitro studies have demonstrated that doxorubicin [30, 31] induces apoptosis of Abbreviations as in Table 1 and Table 2 Fig . 3 Stiffness index at baseline and during submaximal exercise in survivors and controls. The dashed lines represent the cutoff of 2 standard deviations above the mean stiffness index at submaximal exercise of controls endothelial cells in vitro, which may impair endothelialdependent relaxation [31] . The generation of oxygen free radicals [32, 33] and induction of inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] by anthracyclines may mediate the endothelial damage. In paediatric cancer patients, Chow et al. have shown significant reduction of endotheliumdependent brachial arterial dilation during reactive hyperaemia [36] . The role of endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis [37] and increasing the vasomotor tone, and hence arterial stiffness [38] , are well documented. The augmented increase in arterial stiffness with exercise in survivors further reflects structural changes within the vascular matrix, which may be caused by nuclear actions of anthracyclines [39] , oxidative stress [33] , and senescence of the vascular smooth muscle cells [40] . Data on the relationship between arterial stiffness and cumulative dose of anthracycline are, however, conflicting [41] . In the present study, we did not find significant correlations between the anthracycline dose and the structural and function vascular parameters, implicating that anthracycline-induced vascular changes may not be a dose-dependent phenomenon. Our findings have several clinical implications. Firstly, stiffening of the arteries, as reflected by the cross-sectional carotid stiffness index and radial augmentation index, and its augmentation during exercise stress increase ventricular afterload and potentiate the development of ventricular dysfunction. Using speckle tracking echocardiography, we have previously shown subclinical impairment of systolic [2] and diastolic [42] ventricular deformation even in survivors with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Roche et al. further found blunting of left ventricular force-frequency relationship indicating impairment of systolic contractile reserve during exercise in childhood cancer survivors [43] . Indeed, abnormal ventricular-arterial coupling has recently been shown to be strongly predictive of cancer therapeuticsrelated cardiac dysfunction in breast cancer patients, and that this abnormality appeared to be driven primarily by an increased arterial elastance [44] . Secondly, arterial stiffening is possibly a harbinger of increased risk of hypertension. Data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging suggest that arterial stiffness is independent predictors of longitudinal increase in systolic hypertension in normotensive individuals [45] . Our findings of systolic blood pressure being an independent correlate of arterial stiffness at rest and during submaximal Abbreviations as in Table 1 and Table 2 All of the parameters were entered into the multivariate analysis. The correlation coefficient r for univariate analysis and \u03b2 coefficient for multivariate analysis are presented exercise, and that radial arterial waveform-derived central SBP is increased in our survivors lend support to this proposition. Of concern is that the occurrence of hypertension in childhood cancer survivors has been shown to significantly increase the risk of major cardiac events [46] . Thirdly, amplification of vascular dysfunction with age is reflected the steeper slope of increase in carotid IMT with age in survivors and that age being an independent correlate of the absolute and the percentage increase in exercise stiffness index. The inherent risks associated with vascular dysfunction are expected to increase similarly with ageing. Increased vigilance in monitoring for development premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is hence warranted. Several limitations to this study warrant comments. Firstly, this is a cross-sectional study that evaluated a single time point long-term after completion of chemotherapy during childhood. It would have been ideal to track the changes of vascular parameters and to determine the longitudinal trajectory in each of the subjects. Secondly, the superimposed influence of irradiation therapy on vascular mechanics was not ascertained in this study as only 5% of our survivors had irradiation therapy. Thirdly, we did not formally assess ventricular-arterial interaction in our subjects. As alluded to earlier, abnormal ventricular-arterial coupling may help to predict the development of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of cancers [44] . Further studies to assess the coupling during exercise stress may perhaps even be more revealing.\nIn conclusion, arterial dysfunction is evident in adult survivors of childhood cancer and appears to worsen with age. Their carotid arterial stiffness is increased at rest and worsened during submaximal exercise About one-third of the long-term survivors have structural alteration of the arteries with increased carotid IMT and about half have an arterial stiffness index exceeding the upper limit of normal during submaximal exercise. Further studies to explore the consequences of premature vascular ageing and adverse ventricular-vascular interaction in this at risk population are warranted."}]
