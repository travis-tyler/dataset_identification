[{"section_title": "", "text": "infected over 40 million people worldwide and caused over 1.1 million deaths as of October 53 2020, resulting in a high fatality rate (4). The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore 54 throat, dry cough, breathlessness, malaise, and fatigue. In rare cases, patients develop acute 55 respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis followed by respiratory and heart failure (5). One of the 56 challenges to control this virus is unavailability of effective therapeutics. The problem is further 57 compounded by the lack of our understanding regarding molecular mechanisms involved in the 58 pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 including the host-pathogen interactions. 59 MiRNAs are 18-22 nucleotides long noncoding RNAs that are found in animals, plants, and 60 some viruses. They regulate genetic network pathways by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) 61 to translational repression or degradation. The biogenesis of miRNAs begins by RNA 62 polymerase II mediated transcription of genome into long primary-miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). The 63 4 nuclear Ribonuclease type III enzyme, Drosha cleaves pri-miRNA into small hairpin precursor-64 miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) which are then exported to the cytoplasm by nuclear membrane protein, 65 Exportin5. In the cytoplasm, another Ribonuclease III enzyme-Dicer processes the pre-miRNA 66 to generate a miRNA duplex intermediate (miRNA: miRNA*). One strand of this intermediate, 67 mature miRNA binds to protein Argonaute-1 generating the miRNA inducing silencing complex 68 (RISC) which guides the binding of mature miRNA to target mRNAs (6). Besides eukaryotes, 69 viruses also encode miRNAs to target host genes involved in important biological processes like 70 cell growth, cell differentiation, and cellular defense mechanisms as well as to regulate viral gene 71 expressions to modulate the viral replication cycle (7). Therefore, viral miRNAs aid virus 72 particles in their continuous proliferation and evasion of the host immune system (8, 9) . 73 Various studies have demonstrated a strong association between viral miRNAs and infection 74 (8, 9) . However, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of miRNA sequences in SARS- 75 CoV-2 genome. To address this problem, we applied computational approaches to analyze the 76 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence for possible miRNAs. This was of high interest and therefore 77 the secondary goal of the study was to investigate the potential targets of these miRNAs along 78 with their associated Gene Ontologies (GO) and signalling pathways. Our data provides a list of 79 potential viral miRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 and predicts their roles in COVID-19 80 pathophysiology, thus facilitating further works on the potential biological roles of these 81 miRNAs.

The analysis 88 demonstrated that the direct and reverse genomic strands consist of twenty-four and twenty-two 89 hair-pin loop sequences, respectively. The length of these sequences ranged between 70 and 148 90 nucleotides, and they had VMir score \u2265115, hairpin size \u2265 70, and window count \u2265 35 ( Figure   91 1A, Supplementary Material -Sheet 1). 92 Next, using MFold web server the Minimal Folding Free Energy (MFE) of each sequence was 93 calculated because MFE of the pre-miRNA folding is inversely proportional to the 94 thermodynamic stability of the molecule (11). The secondary structure of these sequences was 95 also predicted using MFold. In total, forty-two potential pre-miRNAs (direct strand-23; reverse 96 strand-18), with MFE \u2264 -18 kcal/mol, were recognized to be thermodynamically stable 97 (Supplementary Material -Sheet 2). 98 The Minimal Folding Free Energy Index (MFEI) distinguishes miRNAs from other coding and 99 non-coding RNAs as pre-miRNAs display higher MFEI value than mRNAs (0.66), tRNAs (0.64) 100 and rRNAs (0.59) (12). Therefore, the MFEI for the forty-one potential pre-miRNAs was (Table   106   6 1). As both the strands can serve as mature miRNA depending on the assembly of RISC 107 complex, mature miRNAs on both the arms of stem-loop were used for further analysis."}, {"section_title": "108", "text": "This work is the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 genome may encode miRNAs and therefore 109 careful validation of these findings was carried out against previously published data.
