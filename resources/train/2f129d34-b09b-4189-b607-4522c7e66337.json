Researchers have found that airborne lidar can have a vertical error as high as 60 cm in densely vegetated intertidal areas. The uncertainty of digital elevation models is often left unaddressed; however, in low-relief environments, such as barrier islands, centimeter differences in elevation can affect exposure to physically demanding abiotic conditions, which greatly influence ecosystem structure and function. In this study, we used airborne lidar elevation data, in situ elevation observations, lidar metadata, and tide gauge information to delineate low-lying lands and the intertidal wetlands on Dauphin Island, a barrier island along the coast of Alabama, USA. We compared three different elevation error treatments, which included leaving error untreated and treatments that used Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate elevation vertical uncertainty using general information from lidar metadata and site-specific Real-Time Kinematic Global Position System data, respectively. To aid researchers in instances where limited information is available for error propagation, we conducted a sensitivity test to assess the effect of minor changes to error and bias. Treatment of error with site-specific observations produced the fewest omission errors, although the treatment using the lidar metadata had the most well-balanced results. The percent coverage of intertidal wetlands was increased by up to 80% when treating the vertical error of the digital elevation models. Based on the results from the sensitivity analysis, it could be reasonable to use error and positive bias values from literature for similar environments, conditions, and lidar acquisition characteristics in the event that collection of site-specific data is not feasible and information in the lidar metadata is insufficient. The methodology presented in this study should increase efficiency and enhance results for habitat mapping and analyses in dynamic, low-relief coastal environments."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Barrier islands are subaerial expressions consisting of wave-, wind-, and/or tide-deposited sediments found along portions of coasts on every continent except Antarctica [1, 2] .

Figure 4 shows a general overview of the Monte Carlo simulation process used in this study. The first step in the error propagation was the development of a random field. In our case, we used a raster with a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. We forced the bias to be either positive or negative for each random field, collectively based on the proportional positive bias identified in the relative elevation analyses (Table 1) . Next, a local filter (a 3-by-3-pixel neighborhood) was used to incorporate spatial autocorrelation into the simulated random fields [26] .

The use of the 95 th percentile error is recommended by the ASPRS when dealing with vertical error for areas that include vegetated areas [30] . The result of adding the product of the 95th percentile error and the random field to the DEM is the simulation of the propagation of error into the DEM.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we applied a simple probabilistic approach to more accurately use lidar data in coastal settings for delineation of the landward intertidal boundary. Our results confirm findings of others, which suggest that lidar DEMs can have a substantial level of vertical uncertainty in intertidal areas [17] [18] [19] , and this uncertainty should be accounted for if data are directly used in classification algorithms for habitat mapping or for use in sea-level rise modeling efforts [42, 43] . Our findings highlighted that optimal results with regards to the maximum identification of actual intertidal areas (i.e., highest producer's accuracy) are likely produced when site-specific RTK GPS data are used. Due to the overall importance and the dynamic nature of intertidal ecosystems, a natural resource manager may prefer an approach that better ensures all intertidal areas are captured even if the methodology used may include some level of reasonable overestimation rather than underestimation. In the absence of site-specific data, using information from the lidar metadata to parameterize error and bias should provide better results than maps produced with error left untreated. With a lower vertical error estimate, the Monte Carlo analyses with information from the lidar metadata provided relatively balanced results with regards to producer's accuracy and user's accuracy. This was likely due to the moderate error and lower bias compared to the site-specific error and bias. Ultimately, the decision on how a researcher balances omission error (producer's accuracy) or commission error (user's accuracy) should be based on their research questions and mapping objectives.\nBy using connectivity constraints, we extended the Monte Carlo analyses to map areas likely to be intertidal wetlands. The impact of error treatments was explored for the entire island and for three different AOIs (Figures 6-8) . While the untreated DEM was more suitable for the intertidal marsh application near Graveline Bay (Figure 8 ), the differences were more magnified for other back-barrier marshes (Figures 6 and 7) . The similarity of the treatments for the marsh near Graveline Bay is likely the result of a lower overall elevation of the marsh platform in that area, but differences in vegetation community can also be a factor that affects localized lidar error, for example [18] (pp. 617-620). Clearly, a map of intertidal areas developed from untreated DEM would result in a gross underestimation of intertidal wetlands similar to results from other researchers [18, 44] . However, both maps with treatment of error could provide reasonable intertidal wetland estimates based on lidar data alone or as an initial step that could be refined via minor manual photointerpretation. In other words, these maps can serve as a stand-alone inventory of area falling within the intertidal zone similar to the work of Liu et al. [29] or be used to as a foundation to develop a detailed habitat map [31] .\nThe decision regarding use of site-specific RTK GPS data or information from the lidar metadata should be driven by project budget and research questions. In some cases, the lidar metadata may not provide sufficient information to assess the 95th percentile error for vegetated areas and estimate the bias. Under these circumstances, error treatment may only be feasible using error and bias values identified from literature that include analyses of lidar datasets with similar acquisition characteristics (e.g., point spacing) and vegetation community. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to provide insights on how results produced with minor adjustments to either error or bias compare to the results produced with site-specific RTK GPS data. Our results suggest selection of an appropriate error value may be more critical than bias; however, it seems important to have a bias value that is higher than 50% for study areas with vegetated areas. If it is necessary to rely on literature for error and bias values, then a thorough visual inspection of the results may be warranted to ensure parameters are producing reasonable results for the particular study area.\nDue to the local scale of our study, we were able to transform vertical datum of the DEM from an orthometric datum to a locally relevant tidal datum using a tide gauge on the island. However, studies that cover a larger spatial extent may need to use a vertical datum transformation software, such as NOAA VDATUM [45] to transform orthometric datums to locally relevant tidal datums. This step can lead to additional vertical uncertainty, and if quantified for the transformation model, this uncertainty can be combined with the source data uncertainty and incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulations [27] .\nA byproduct of delineating the upper intertidal boundary is information on the extent and areal coverage of supratidal habitat. On barrier islands, supratidal areas include habitats such as beach, dune, and barrier flat (meadow, nonvegetated barrier flat, and forest). Monitoring these supratidal areas is equally important to resource managers [4] because these areas provide important habitat for resident and migratory shorebirds [46] , neotropical migrants [47] , and sea turtles [48] . Besides providing habitat for wildlife, dunes deliver erosion control for shorelines [49] . Dune crest elevation plays a critical role in the level of this protective capacity, and thus, in determining coastal vulnerability [49] [50] [51] . A Monte Carlo process similar to the one used in this study can be applied to determine areas with elevation that is greater than a typical extreme water level associated with storms using site-specific RTK GPS data collected in dune environments [31] .\nThe objective of this study was to develop a straightforward approach for treating vertical uncertainty in lidar-based DEMs. This study leveraged RTK GPS data collected with a cluster sampling design that was obtained to serve as validation data for a habitat classification mapping effort [31] . For this reason, we chose to use a simple method of introducing spatial autocorrelation into the Monte Carlo processing by using a low-pass filter rather than a more complex approach, such as the weighted spatial dependence approach [26] . A more systematic sampling of lidar error in intertidal areas similar to the approaches applied by Medeiros et al. [17] or Buffington et al. [18] would allow for a more complex treatment of spatial autocorrelation. As stated earlier, analyses in this effort were restricted to intertidal areas above MSL due to the use of topographic lidar. The methodology used in this study could be modified to more accurately delineate the full intertidal zone (i.e., boundary between subtidal and intertidal habitats and boundary between supratidal and intertidal habitats) if used with topobathymetric lidar. Lidar intensity data has been shown to enhance habitat classifications in coastal environments [11, 52] . Future efforts could explore the application of spatially variable error and bias based on a simple vegetation presence-absence classification based on lidar intensity. Additionally, the use of intensity information would allow researchers to extend this work to examine the habitat-specific impacts of not treating lidar error when delineating the intertidal zone. One potential issue related to this enhancement could be that high-quality intensity information may not be available for all lidar acquisitions. Finally, technological advancements like next-generation lidar sensors and on-demand lidar via UAS should greatly enhance how dynamic habitats like barrier islands are monitored. As data availability increases, this approach could be calibrated with next-generation lidar sensors such as single photon and Geiger-mode lidar platforms which enable data collection with much higher nominal point spacing (e.g., greater than 20 points per m 2 ) as compared to conventional linear lidar (i.e., lidar used in this study was about 6 points per m 2 ) [22] or data collected via on-demand lidar via an UAS [23, 24] . Another potential improvement of using these methods with UAS data would be the ability to collect elevation data and optical imagery concurrently."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In intertidal areas, the elevation estimated from conventional aerial linear lidar can be much higher than the actual elevation due to dense vegetation cover. The uncertainty of DEMs is often not addressed for habitat mapping efforts, yet the level of uncertainty becomes critical when studying these low-relief and intertidal environments where centimeters can greatly influence the exposure to physically demanding abiotic conditions. In this study, we applied tide gauge information, RTK GPS data, and information from a detailed relative accuracy report that followed the ASPRS standards to simulate the propagation of elevation uncertainty into a DEM using Monte Carlo simulations. The primary objective of this study was to apply a simple approach to enhance results of automated intertidal area mapping using lidar data. We analyzed three different elevation error treatments which included leaving error untreated and treatments that used Monte Carlo simulations to incorporate elevation vertical uncertainty using lidar metadata and site-specific RTK GPS data, respectively.\nOur work shows that the untreated DEM underestimated coverage of low-lying areas and intertidal areas. We found that the DEMs with treatment of error had higher producer's accuracy and user's accuracy for identifying low-lying areas below the EHWS. For the entire island, the percent intertidal lands increased by up to 80% when using Monte Carlo analyses to treat vertical uncertainty. Results from the sensitivity analysis suggest that it could be reasonable to use error and positive bias values from literature for similar environments, conditions, and lidar acquisition characteristics in the event that collection of site-specific data is not feasible and information in the lidar metadata is insufficient. In this event, we found that bias values may be less sensitive than error, although it is critical to select a bias value greater than 50% if the study area has abundant vegetation cover.\nResults from this study should interest researchers that use lidar data in coastal morphology and habitat mapping studies, but especially those studying elevation-dependent ecological patterns and processes in coastal areas. The methodology outlined in this study could be used to develop stand-alone products with the simple aim of providing land managers with an accurate areal coverage of intertidal and supratidal habitats or to serve as a foundation for identification of tidal regimes for detailed habitat mapping efforts. The approach outlined in this study should be applicable to future technological advancements, such as next-generation lidar sensors and on-demand lidar via unmanned aerial systems."}]
