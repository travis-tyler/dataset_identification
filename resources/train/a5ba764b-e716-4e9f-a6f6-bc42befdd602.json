[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Aging is a complex process that is accompanied with changes in both muscle mass and muscle function (strength and performance). Therefore, the current longitudinal study aimed to provide a better insight in 10-year aging-related changes in whole-body muscle mass and strength performance of the leg extensors during the adult life span. Data were gathered within the framework of the first- (2002-2004: baseline) and third-generation Flemish Policy Research Center Sport (2012-2014: follow-up). Results are based on muscle characteristics data of 591 Flemish Caucasian adults (19-73 years, 381 men). Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was determined with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Biodex Medical System 3\u00ae dynamometer was used to measure isometric (PT static120\u00b0) and isokinetic (PT dynamic60\u00b0a nd PT dynamic240\u00b0) strength, ballistic movement speed (S 20 % ), and muscular endurance (work) of the knee extensors. Overall strength performance was higher at both evaluation moments in men compared to women (p < 0.01). But only S 20 % declined significantly faster in men compared to women (p < 0.01). Age and baseline strength performance were negatively related with the change in strength performance, even when corrected for SMM, protein intake, and energy expenditure during sports (E sport ). In conclusion, strength performance was not associated with E sport in this study, but protein intake was associated with isometric strength in men, and with ballistic and isokinetic strength in women. Changes in S 20 % were significantly greater in men compared to women. Baseline values of strength performance and age were associated with changes in strength performance parameters, even after correction for SMM, protein intake, and E sport ."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In Western countries, the population of people aged 60 years or more is increasing at a fast pace, with an expected increase of 45 % by 2050 (rising from 287 million in 2013 to 417 million in 2050). This underlines the importance for public health-care systems to better understand age-related syndromes and diseases, such as sarcopenia. This condition is characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and its action generating capacity-also termed muscle function-and implies a risk of adverse outcomes such as fall-related injuries and impaired quality of life (Campbell et al. 1989; Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2010; Rizzoli et al. 2013 ). In addition, it is estimated that the prevalence of sarcopenia is approximately 1-33 % in the community (both genders combined) and that this prevalence increases in older populations (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2014) . However, the onset of sarcopenia occurs at an earlier phase, so it is important to understand how muscle characteristics change over the adult life span. A cross-sectional study by (Charlier et al. 2015) described changes in muscle function over the adult life span (18-78 years) in Flemish Caucasians; nonetheless, a longitudinal design is more appropriate to examine aging-related changes. In this kind of design, data are collected in a time sequence that allows for documentation of the direction as well as the magnitude of change over time. This allows one to study the individual development of a certain outcome variable over time, and the individual development of a certain outcome variable can be related to the individual development of other variables (Twisk 2013) . The present study is, therefore, a further continuation of the previous observations by Charlier et al. (2015) .\nThere are currently a number of studies that have examined the longitudinal changes in muscle mass and muscle function (e.g., Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the InCHIANTI study, Health ABC Study), but only a limited number examined study populations with a large age range (Metter et al. 1997; Delmonico et al. 2009; Hicks et al. 2012) . Most of them have found significant age-related declines in both muscle mass and muscle function. However, the majority of these studies examined either small sample sizes (n < 50) or Frontera et al. 2008 (<5 years.) (Goodpaster et al. 2006; Frontera et al. 2008; Dey et al. 2009; Marcell et al. 2014; Reid et al. 2014) . It should also be noted that study populations often consisted of a homogenous group, mostly older adults, and although in most cases this is a strength, it allows for a limited interpretation of lifelong changes in these parameters (Goodpaster et al. 2006; Frontera et al. 2008; Delmonico et al. 2009; Dey et al. 2009; Reid et al. 2014) . Nevertheless, results between studies are similar, pointing out losses in muscle mass of up to 12.9 and 5.3 % after a 9.7-year followup period in men and women, respectively, aged 45-75 years (Hughes et al. 2001 ). In addition, isometric strength decreased with~0.87 % per year in men aged between 45 and 49 years, whereas declines in isokinetic strength were up to 2.56 % per year at 60\u00b0/s and 4.20 % per year at 240\u00b0/s in 62-81-year-old men and women (Frontera et al. 2008; Kennis et al. 2014) .\nIn reporting age-related changes in muscle mass or muscle function, these previous studies did not account for lifestyle (e.g., dietary habits, physical activity). In 2012, Stenholm et al. reported that lifestyle (e.g., education, leisure time and work-related physical activity, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption), and physical health (e.g., chronic conditions such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus) earlier in life determine the rate of muscle strength decline (measured as handgrip strength) in old age (Stenholm et al. 2012) . Furthermore, various studies have evidenced that nutritional supplementation-such as vitamin D or protein intake-and exercise interventions can have a beneficial effect on muscle strength and physical performance, even in older populations (Bonnefoy et al. 2003; Binder et al. 2005; Chale-Rush et al. 2010; Pahor et al. 2014; Cesari et al. 2015) . In 2015, Sahni et al. found a significantly higher leg lean mass in both males (n = 1166, age 60.2 \u00b1 9.3 years) and females (n = 1509, age 59.0 \u00b1 9.3 years) in the highest quartile of total protein and animal protein intake compared with those in the lowest quartiles (Sahni et al. 2015) . In addition, quadriceps strength was higher in participants in the highest quartile of plant protein intake, although this association was no longer significant after adjustment for fruit and vegetable intake (Sahni et al. 2015) . Regular physical activity has also been shown to prevent both the age-associated loss in muscle strength and the increase in muscle fat infiltration in older adults (5 men and 17 women, 76.7 \u00b1 1.0 year) (Goodpaster et al. 2008) .\nConsequently, the current study aims to provide a better insight in the comprehension of 10-year aging-related changes in muscle mass and muscle function of the leg extensors during the adult life span. Specifically, a longitudinal study in Flemish, Caucasian adults was performed to examine interindividual differences in 10-year aging and predict age-related changes in muscle mass and muscle function, accounting for protein intake and energy expenditure during sports. Because there are large differences between subjects in aging, it is our hypothesis that both muscle mass and muscle function will show a moderate tracking over a 10-year follow-up period in both genders. Also, since there is a decrease in firing rate and motor unit recruitment with aging, it is assumed that the age-related loss in ballistic strength is higher compared to (slow) isokinetic and endurance strength, and isometric strength is expected to show the smallest decreases. Furthermore, based on previous longitudinal findings, it is suggested that these declines will be more precipitous in men compared to women."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data were collected in the framework of the first (2002) (2003) (2004) and third generations (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) of the Flemish Policy Research Center on Sport.

Three standardized tests were performed, including isometric, speed of movement, and isokinetic tests. Each test was performed twice, and the best performance was used for further analysis.\nIsometric tests The static strength of the knee extensors was examined at knee joint angles of 120\u00b0and 90\u00b0. The subjects performed two maximal static knee extensions in each knee joint angle. Peak torque (Nm) was recorded. The highest score of the extension test at 120\u00b0( PT static120\u00b0) was retained for further analysis to assess maximal isometric knee extension strength.\nIsotonic tests Three maximal ballistic knee extensions were performed against a constant load of 20 % of the maximal isometric strength in a knee joint angle of 90\u00b0.

A significant decline in S 20 % was found in both genders, but it proved to be significantly larger in men compared to women. Work did not significantly decline between both measuring moments in the entire group, but it did decline when age categories were considered. In the older age category, the decline in work was larger compared to younger age categories in both genders. Also, age-corrected tracking was moderate for all muscle function parameters, but tracking of skeletal muscle mass was high in both genders (r = 0.79). This implies a large inter-individual variation in the changes in muscle function in both men and women. Furthermore, age and baseline muscle function were negatively related with the change in muscle function, even when corrected for SMM, protein intake, and E sport . Finally, higher skeletal muscle mass was found to be related with smaller decreases in muscle function. Data are partial correlations between baseline and follow-up measurements with age as controlling variable n number of subjects *Significant at p < 0.01 In this study, muscle mass characteristics (FFM and SMM) were higher in men compared to women. There were significant gains in weight, BMI, and FM in both genders from baseline to follow-up. However, there was no significant increase in FFM, where FM increased with 1.3 and 2.5 kg on average in men and women, respectively. Regarding muscle function, handgrip was significantly higher in men compared to women, but no significant difference was observed between evaluation moments. Also, men performed significantly better at both time points compared to women for all knee muscle function parameters. Nevertheless, only S 20 % declined more precipitously in men compared to women. Significant main effects of time were observed in the entire group for all parameters, except for work. This might reflect a similar fatigue resistance between younger and older subjects due to a shift toward slower contractile properties in the older population (Mcphee et al. 2014 ). However, this was not confirmed when comparisons were made by age category (Table 4) . Aging-related declines were greater in the oldest age category compared to the younger age categories. Also, the finding of an aging-related decrease in strength performance, but not in handgrip strength, is consistent with the findings of a differential aging of upper and lower extremities as noted by Lynch et al. (1999) and Newman et al. (2003) .\nA study by Frontera et al. (2008) has shown different percent changes per year compared to our results. They found percent changes per year of \u22122.56 \u00b1 1.1 % in isokinetic strength of the knee extensors at 60\u00b0/s and \u22124.2 \u00b1 1.2 % at 240\u00b0/s, but this study only considered 12 subjects (five men) (Frontera et al. 2008) . Hughes et al. (2001) found declines in isokinetic speed at 60\u00b0/s of \u22121.18 \u00b1 1.55 % in women and \u22121.45 \u00b1 1.56 % in men, which is more in line with our results (Hughes et al. 2001) . Their reported percent change per year is still larger, but it is probably explained by the older age range of their sample (46 to 78 years), whereas we considered subjects between 19 and 73 years old (baseline) (Hughes et al. 2001 ). However, if we only considered subjects above 46 years of age, \u0394 percentage/year was \u22120.96 \u00b1 2.16 % in women and \u22120.77 \u00b1 2.28 % in men. This is in agreement with the findings of Kennis et al. (2014) : they observed a decrease of 0.71 \u00b1 0.24 % per year in isokinetic strength at 60\u00b0/s in a subsample of this study (n = 105 men, age = 46.93 \u00b1 0.06 years.). If we considered the oldest age category (+60 years), \u0394 percentage/year was \u22121.53 \u00b1 2.67 % in women and \u22121.06 \u00b1 2.27 % in men (Table 4) . Data are beta-coefficients (standard errors). Regression models are significant at p < 0.001. Furthermore, all beta-coefficients are significant at p < 0.001\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are currently no longitudinal studies reporting percent changes in ballistic contraction speeds or resistance to fatigue measures over the entire age span. A cross-sectional study by Mcphee et al. (2014) reported a superior fatigue resistance during sustained isometric contractions in older adults. In our study, we observed no significant difference between baseline and follow-up in the amount of work delivered during 25 repeated maximal contractions (\u0394 percentage/year women \u22120.024 \u00b1 2.41 %; \u0394 percentage/year men \u22120.24 \u00b1 3.37 %). However, the endurance protocol used in the study by Mcphee et al. (2014) is different from the protocol used in the current study. The largest decreases were observed for the knee extension contraction velocity (S 20 % ) (women \u22121.02 \u00b1 1.36 % per year; men \u22121.43 \u00b1 1.35 % per year) (Table 3) . When age categories were considered, a main effect of the age category was found in work. The percent change per year in S 20 % was significantly higher in men, indicating a gender difference in the rate of decline in contraction velocity. This is in line with the cross-sectional findings of Edwen et al. (2014) . They found that velocity at peak power declined at a higher rate in men compared to women (p < 0.002) (Edwen et al. 2014) . Also, a significant interaction effect of gender by evaluation moment was found in S 20 % , pointing out a larger decrease in men compared to women after a 10-year follow-up period (Table 4) .\nThese differences between men and women are proposed to be the consequence of a difference in the proportional area of Bslow^type I fibers. There is some evidence that the proportional area of type I fibers is significantly greater in women compared to men and that men have larger fibers across most of the fiber types (Simoneau and Bouchard 1989; Staron et al. 2000; Hunter 2014 ). Moreover, a decline in fiber size, of type Data are beta-coefficients. Regression models are significant at p < 0.001. Standard errors are given in supplementary Table S3 *Significant beta-coefficient at p < 0.05; **significant beta-coefficient at p < 0.01 a Trend for a significant beta-coefficient II fibers in particular, has been suggested to be the cause of age-related muscle atrophy (Lexell et al. 1988) . A shift in fiber type from type II to type I with aging has also been stated, resulting in a larger proportion of type I fibers in the contractile mass (Russ et al. 2012) . These findings might give a possible explanation of the results found in the current study since speed of contraction is largely determined by type II fibers, whereas type I fibers are more important for resistance to fatigue. Declines in lower extremity muscle function were negatively associated with baseline muscle function and age for all muscle parameters. Higher age and higher baseline muscle function resulted in larger decreases in muscle function parameters. In 2006, Goodpaster et al. also found that baseline strength and age were negatively related with changes in strength after a 3-year follow-up period in 1880 older adults (Goodpaster et al. 2006 ). In addition, baseline muscle function was a stronger determinant in both genders of all the age-associated changes (both absolute and percentage) as compared to age in our study, which was also the case in the study by (Goodpaster et al. 2008) . This is further underlined by the moderate-to-high (0.38 -0.79) tracking that was found between the baseline and follow-up values of muscle function (Table 4) , pointing out that higher baseline values were associated with higher follow-up values. It should be noted that, with the exception of SMM, correlations were not higher than 0.63, suggesting a considerably large interindividual difference in the age-related declines.\nIt is likely that strength performance is influenced by both genetics and environmental factors, such as nutrition and exercise. As regard to lifestyle, there is currently much uncertainty on what the combined effects of diet and exercise are for muscle characteristics, especially in the long term (Paddon-Jones and Rasmussen 2009). Stenholm et al. (2012) found that strenuous work-related physical activity was significantly associated with a faster decline in handgrip strength compared to light work-related physical activity. They therefore concluded that lifestyle earlier in life was associated with the rate of muscle strength decline in old age. In the current study, no gender differences were observed in protein intake (g/kg body weight), but a higher energy expenditure during sports was observed in men. This is in accordance with previous reports (Baker et al. 2013 ). In addition, a trend (p < 0.06) was observed for a decrease in E sport after a 10-year follow-up in both men and women. Furthermore, mean protein intake was higher in both genders than the recommended amounts of 0.8 g kg bodyweight \u22121 day \u22121 . Age and baseline muscle function remained significant predictors when skeletal muscle mass, protein intake, and E sport were included in the regression models. Skeletal muscle mass showed a positive relationship with changes in muscle function and had comparable beta-coefficients to age. However, it was not related to changes in S 20 % in both genders. This is probably due to the fact that movement speed is determined to a large extent by a neural firing rate and a fiber length rather than by skeletal muscle mass or fiber diameter alone. In the adjusted regression model, mixed results were observed for lifestyle factors. Energy expenditure during sports was not found to be a significant predictor of the age-related declines in muscle function parameters for either of the parameters, whereas protein intake did show some notable results. In men, it was a significant predictor of the percent changes per year in isometric strength. A negative relationship was found between protein intake and percent change per year in S 20 % and change in PT dynamic60\u00b0, and a negative trend could also be observed for change in S 20 % and percent change per year in PT dynamic60\u00b0i n women (Table 6 ). This is not in line with previous findings of intervention studies, showing a positive relationship between muscle function, protein intake, and physical activity, even in older adults (Bonnefoy et al. 2003; Goodpaster et al. 2008) . It should be noted that the current study did not account for the type of sport although previous studies have shown that resistance exercise is most effective in improving muscle function and that sports practice is also age-related. Finally, protein intake was not monitored during the entire follow-up period, which might account for the lack of a-or even negative-relationship.\nIt should be acknowledged that the current study has some limitations. At first, a considerable number of subjects (60.7 %) did not complete the follow-up measurements. Although there was only a small age difference (44.5 \u00b1 13.2 years vs. 46.8 \u00b1 10.3 years) in men, a fitter group (lower weight, BMI, and FM) returned for the follow-up measurements in women, which might have led to an underestimation of the true age-related changes in muscle mass and muscle function in this group. It is therefore advised to take some caution when interpreting and generalizing the results to other populations. Second, only two time points were considered in this study. Therefore, data on additional time points could have helped to better interpret the results. The study of two-wave changes has some limitations. It cannot tell something about the shape of a person's individual growth trajectory, since two-wave analyses assume linear change. Furthermore, it cannot distinguish true change from measurement error (Singer and Willett 2003) . Test-retest reliability for Biodex measurements has been previously reported to be high (Lund et al. 2005) . Also, no learning effects were observed for the Biodex measurements. Measurement error was 11.75 Nm for the isokinetic strength at 60\u00b0/s based on the reported findings in Lund et al. (2005) . Interpretation of the change in PT dynamic60\u00b0s hould therefore be made taking these results into account, as should the changes in other strength performance parameters. Regression to the mean effects was explored by visual inspection of Galton squeeze plots and was interpreted to be minimal. Since the RTM effect at the lower end of the baseline distribution will decrease time-induced losses, while those at the upper end of the baseline distribution will rather increase time-induced losses, it can be argued that both RTM effects will counteract each other. Finally, lifestyle was determined based on a diet record and a physical activity questionnaire, which are subjective methods. Although a diet record is considered a gold standard to measure dietary habits, it has limitations mainly due to the tendency of subjects to report food consumption that is socially desirable. Furthermore, the FPACQ only addressed a subject's physical activity of the past year and is also subject to reporting errors.\nIn the future, studies should aim to examine the interrelationship between muscle function and lifestyle in more controlled settings, although further longitudinal study is also recommended to better understand long-term effects of both protein intake and physical activity. In addition, it has already been shown that genetic sequence variation has a larger influence on both muscle mass and muscle function (~65 %) than lifestyle (Garatachea and Lucia 2013) . Therefore, genetic effects on changes in muscle characteristics should also be further examined to fully understand this process. Nonetheless, only when the combined influence of both lifestyle and genetics is fully understood can researchers start to develop strategies to detect subjects at risk for sarcopenia in early stages and adapt training interventions in an appropriate manner to achieve optimal results.\nIn the current study, age-related declines in muscle function parameters were examined after a 10-year follow-up period in Flemish Caucasians aged between 19 and 73 years old. Based on the findings, the present study could not provide evidence for an association between muscle function and energy expenditure during sports, although protein intake was associated with isometric strength in men and with ballistic and isokinetic strength in women. Percent change per year in S 20 % was significantly greater in men compared to women, possibly due to gender differences in sensitivity to aginginduced type II fiber atrophy. Furthermore, baseline values of muscle function and age were associated with changes in muscle function parameters, even after correction for skeletal muscle mass, protein intake, and energy expenditure during sports."}]
