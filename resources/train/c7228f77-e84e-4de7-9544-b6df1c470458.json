Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in nearly all DS adults examined of age .40 years [1, 2] . Because of this, DS adults may provide a naturally enriched population in which to evaluate the potential of pharmacological candidates to prevent AD progression. Ideally, trials would initiate treatment at a common, well-defined point before AD dementia [2] . This would require individual characterization of the degree of AD-related pathology and neurodegeneration distinct from DS effects. Detection of diseasemodifying treatment effects would require distinguishing impact on AD-related pathology from that on underlying DS.\nThe primary objectives of our work were to: (a) dissociate within DS subjects the effects attributable to DS versus those associated with AD, and (b) to quantify the degree of AD progression. To pursue this, we applied multivariate analysis advances to baseline 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and examined relationships with amyloid and clinical endpoints. We hypothesized that nondemented DS subjects with emerging AD would exhibit a pattern of neurodegeneration characteristic of prodromal AD. We postulated that standard image analysis methods might not be able to fully dissociate effects attributable to DS vs AD within subjects, and that multivariate analysis software capable of identifying different contributing networks or patterns to overall effect could isolate DS and AD components.\nThe source of DS data for our work was a 3-year DS Biomarker Initiative (DSBI) study was initiated by Janssen Research and Development in collaboration with the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS). This study was designed to demonstrate methodology feasibility for a larger natural history trial. Endpoints include neuropsychological testing, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cerebral amyloid and glucose metabolism, MRI, and blood biomarkers [2, 3] .\nIn AD, a characteristic pattern of glucose hypometabolism emerges in hippocampus and posterior cingulate, expands to temporo-parietal regions, and gradually affects most cortical tissue, whereas pons, cerebellum, and motor and visual cortices are relatively preserved [4] [5] [6] . Changes are found in genetically at-risk individuals [7, 8] , begin years before symptom onset [9] , and correlate with clinical decline [4, 10] . In DS, results of FDG PET studies have been mixed [11] . Some studies in young adults (,25 years) have found no differences or only hypermetabolism compared to normals [12] [13] [14] . Other studies in DS adults have found hypometabolism in AD-relevant regions, more pronounced in demented than nondemented subjects [15] [16] [17] . Findings have not dissociated DS from AD effects within-subject nor quantified degree of AD progression.\nAD also causes structural atrophy that initiates in entorhinal cortex, spreads to hippocampus, and expands to parietal and most cortical and subcortical structures [18] [19] [20] , correlating with clinical progression [21, 22] . In young DS persons (ages 5 to 23 years), MRI studies have shown reduced brain volume, shortened frontal lobes, reductions in cerebellum and brainstem, hippocampus, amygdala, and white matter but preservation of parietal and subcortical regions [23] [24] [25] . Studies in DS adults have found lower volumes overall and in cerebellum, cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, superior temporal lobes, and hippocampi and associations between dementia, regional atrophy typical of AD, and ventricular enlargement [17, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, structural effects of DS have not been dissociated within subject from those attributable to AD.\nConsistent with postmortem findings, amyloid imaging studies in DS adults have found a high prevalence of ADlike amyloid associated with age and dementia [17, [31] [32] [33] [34] .\nOur work builds on these findings by differentiating, at the subject level, the effects attributable to DS independent of amyloid burden from those associated with emerging AD, and furthermore, provides a quantitative measure of the degree of AD progression. We demonstrate that these measures correlate with amyloid and clinical endpoints at baseline."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject selection", "text": "Twelve nondemented adult individuals diagnosed with DS, age 32-61 years, were enrolled. Exclusion of a diagnosis of dementia was based on absence of evidence of recent deterioration in cognitive function not secondary to medical illness (e.g., hypothyroidism, sleep apnea) or mental illness (e.g., depression), with absence of a significant decline in function over a period of 6 months or more. The diagnosing neurologist was experienced with premorbid deficits in DS and incorporated dementia diagnosis recommendations from the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices [35] . Ten subjects were female; six were APOE \u03b54 carriers. Assessments were conducted by UCSD in collaboration with the ADCS under IRB-approved protocols with patient informed consent [3] ."}, {"section_title": "Image data acquisition, processing, and analysis", "text": "All subjects received FDG PET, florbetapir (amyloid) PET, and structural MRI (sMRI) scans, acquired and processed as described in the Supplementary Material and [3] . FDG PET and MRI analyses were performed while blinded to amyloid, APOE \u03b54, and clinical status. Image analysis consisted of three parallel, complementary approaches."}, {"section_title": "Analyses with NPAIRS", "text": "The NPAIRS [36, 37] multivariate analysis software framework was applied to detect patterns in FDG PET and T1-weighted sMRI characterizing similarities and differences between the DS group and pre-defined comparator groups. In brief, NPAIRS uses canonical variates analysis (a form of linear discriminant analysis) to identify uncorrelated spatial patterns that when mathematically combined account for overall variance across groups of image data. Importantly, NPAIRS uses an iterative resampling process using split halves in which metrics of reproducibility (correlation between the model generated by each split half) and prediction (correct classification of the test half using the training half model) are used to optimize the model. This process addresses the issue of over-fitting that can arise in machine learning, particularly when data sets are small. A canonical variate (CV) score quantifies the degree to which each subject expresses each pattern. The test (rather than training) scores were used to report results.\nFor comparison to DS subjects in the NPAIRS analysis, four sets of 12 subjects (balancing N) were identified a priori from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database based on ADNI clinical diagnosis, amyloid status, and age: amyloid negative (Am2) normal (NL), amyloid positive (Am1) AD, Am1 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and Am1 late MCI (LMCI). The ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu) was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael Weiner MD, with the goal to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD (see www.adni-info. org). As DS FDG and MRI scans were acquired using ADNI protocols and processed in the same manner, comparison was feasible. Subjects were considered Am2 if their amyloid PET cortical average standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was below a threshold of 1.47 for 11C-PiB [38] or ,1.11 for florbetapir [39] or their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 was .209 (allowing for threshold variability) and were considered Am1 if their amyloid PET SUVR exceeded threshold or their CSF Abeta42 level was ,192 [40] . Given the relatively young DS subject ages, the youngest ADNI subjects meeting diagnostic and amyloid criteria were selected.\nThree models using different combinations of classes were explored in NPAIRS using FDG PET, and the first was also explored using MRI: (1) DS, NL, AD; (2) DS, NL, AD, EMCI, LMCI; and (3) DS, NL. For each model of N classes, NPAIRS produced N-1 patterns and CV scores for each subject that quantified expression of each pattern.\nIn addition, because ADNI subjects were still somewhat older than most DS subjects, twelve age-matched, Am2, cognitively normal subjects (AE-NL) with FDG PET scans acquired at New York University [41] were selected for additional comparison in a four-class model of DS, NL, AD, and AE-NL. The purpose was to determine whether differences between DS and NL were consistent with that between DS and AE-NL. Acquisition parameters for these subjects were consistent with ADNI, and their processing parameters were sufficiently similar to enable confirmatory comparison as described in Results and shown in the Supplementary Material, but owing to other processing differences, they were not used as primary comparators. These differences included increased smoothing and the extent of superior slices in some scans, which were reconciled with additional smoothing and masking for analysis. The use of NYU subjects also helped to test for site differences.\nFurthermore, because all DS scans but none of the comparator subjects came from a single site and scanner, an additional set of twelve ADNI subjects ranging in status from Am2 NL to Am1 AD and having FDG PET scans acquired from the same site and scanner as the DS subjects were selected for comparison (SITE1 class). These subjects had not been selected as primary comparators because younger ADNI subjects were available. A model consisting of DS, NL, AD, and SITE1 was evaluated using NPAIRS to assess potential site differences, and ROI values of the SITE1 NL subjects were also compared to NL and DS."}, {"section_title": "AD progression classifier scoring", "text": "Each DS FDG PET scan was scored using our AD progression classifier. This algorithm, previously developed using machine learning and 166 subjects from ADNI characterized by clinical diagnosis, amyloid status, and longitudinal outcome, assigns a numeric score reflecting the degree to which the subject's scan expresses a pattern of hypometabolism and hypermetabolism relative to whole brain associated with AD progression [42] (See Supplementary Material and Supplementary Fig. 1 for further description.)

Whole brain without ventricles was used as the primary reference region, and SUVRs were compared using pons as an alternate reference region to further understand regional differences.\nOnce unblinded to amyloid data, each DS subject's amyloid cortical average SUVR was measured by averaging anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, frontal, and inferior parietal regions, referenced to whole cerebellum.

Results referenced to whole cerebellum were consistent with those referenced to pons and subcortical white matter ( Supplementary Fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "FDG NPAIRS comparisons", "text": "Results of the NPAIRS 3-class comparison of DS, NL, and AD are shown in Fig. 1 . Two distinct glucose metabolism patterns with partial overlap were identified, each having reproducibility and prediction metrics indicating generalizability to a broader population (as did all patterns discussed). The first pattern (Fig. 1A , CV1 FDG ) differentiated DS from NL (P , .00001, effect size (ES) 5.94) and AD (P , .00001, ES 6.58). There was no separation between Am2 and Am1 DS subjects (CV1 FDG plot, Fig. 1A ). This pattern did not correlate with age. The second ( Fig. 1B , CV2 FDG ) separated NL from AD (P , .00001, ES 3.48), whereas DS scores were distributed across the range from NL to AD. All Am2 or threshold subjects had CV2 FDG scores in the range of NL. CV2 FDG correlated with age in DS subjects (R 5 0.659, P , .02). (Results were consistent using both parametric and nonparametric tests.)\nIn the DS-associated pattern CV1 FDG , hypometabolism was observed in posterior cingulate, anterior cingulate, precuneus (particularly anterior), paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus/supplementary motor cortex, superior temporal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, insula, and inferior frontal cortex. Relative hypermetabolism was found in frontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and occipital cortex. Pattern features are relative to brain mean; therefore, hypermetabolism or volume increases can also be interpreted as relative preservation.\nThe CV2 FDG pattern ( Fig. 1B) was characterized by hypometabolism in posterior cingulate, posterior precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Relative hypermetabolism was found in cerebellum, pons, paracentral lobule, putamen, thalamus, and occipital subregions. The CV2 FDG and CV1 FDG patterns overlapped in a portion of precuneus and posterior cingulate, but otherwise were largely distinct ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\nThe 5-class NPAIRS analysis of DS, NL, EMCI, LMCI, and AD subjects provided a finer resolution comparison of DS subjects to the AD progression spectrum. The five-class CV1 pattern was similar to the three-class CV1 FDG pattern, differentiating DS from all other groups (P , .00001, ES 6.38) and did not differentiate non-DS groups. An AD-like CV2 pattern showed cascade-like progression from NL to EMCI to LMCI to AD as we have found in our AD Progression classifier. DS subjects scored across the spectrum from NL to AD as in the 3-class comparison ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).\nConfirming that the DS-associated pattern CV1 FDG was not attributable to DS vs. ADNI subject age differences, the 4class NPAIRS analysis of DS, NL, AD, and AE-NL subjects produced a CV1 pattern differentiating DS similarly from both NL and AE-NL, highly similar to the 3-class CV1 FDG pattern. In addition, a CV2 pattern differentiated AD subjects from Normal groups (both ADNI and NYU), with DS subjects expressing a spectrum of scores. Despite lower resolution due to greater smoothing, the absence of superior slices, the CV1 and CV2 eigenimages were very similar to those produced using only ADNI comparators ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). *DS amyloid burden as measured during analysis; negative includes one subject at or just below threshold depending on the reference region applied. Suggesting that the DS differences were not site-related, the 4-class analysis of DS, NL, AD, and SITE1 produced a CV1 pattern resembling the 3-class CV1 FDG pattern and differentiating DS from NL, AD, and SITE1 (all P , .00001, Supplementary Fig. 6 ), which were not distinguished from one another. CV2 and CV3 patterns differentiated NL and AD (P , .00001, P , .0001), with DS and SITE1 subjects distributed in expression.\nThe 2-class analysis comparing DS and NL subjects was constrained to identify only one pattern. This pattern differentiated DS and NL and incorporated elements from both CV1 FDG and CV2 FDG . Similar to published studies, contributions of DS and AD could not be dissociated ( Supplementary Fig. 7 )."}, {"section_title": "FDG AD progression classifier scores", "text": "DS AD Progression scores ( Fig. 2A) ranged from values typical of Am2 NL subjects to those of AD subjects established through previous independent testing of ADNI subjects of known clinical diagnosis and amyloid status. AD Progression scores increased with age (R 5 0.602, P , .04) and with amyloid burden. All Am2 or threshold subjects had scores reflecting less AD-like pattern expression than typical of LMCI or AD.\nShown in Fig. 2B and 2D , the CV2 FDG scores correlate with FDG AD progression scores (R 5 0.993, P , .00001), and the pattern is highly similar to the a priori AD progression pattern, dominated by hypometabolism in posterior cingulate, precuneus, and inferior parietal cortices with preservation in cerebellum, pons, paracentral lobule, thalamus, and striatum. in CV1 FDG and CV2 FDG , regional PCC was lower than NL in both DS Am2 and DS Am1 (both P , .005) subjects and decreased with age. In contrast, DS Am2 subjects did not differ from NL in IPL, whereas DS Am1 showed an ageassociated trajectory toward LMCI and AD levels. Consistent with NPAIRS results, hypometabolism was also measured in Hippocampus. Results were consistent when comparing to AE-NLs and when using pons as a comparative reference region ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Fig. 4 shows example correlation plots between clinical endpoints and CV2 FDG scores (4a) and amyloid SUVR (4b) in DS subjects. CV2 FDG score correlates with several baseline measures including Observer Memory Questionnaire-Parent Form (OMQ-PF [44] , R 5 20.776, P , .003), attention (R 5 20.776, P , .003), daily living skills (R 5 20.690, P , .01), total memory (R 5 20.627, P , .03), and CAMCOG total errors (R 5 0.595, P , .04), and at trend level with CAM-COG total score 2 (composite of orientation, language, remote memory, recent memory, attention, abstraction, perception, R 5 20.524, P , .08; Fig. 4A ). CV1 FDG correlates with baseline Communication score (R 5 20.680, P , .02). In contrast, although Am2 status corresponds to better cognitive and functional scores than Am1 status and reaches significance for OMQ-PF (R 5 20.680, P , .02), there is no correlation between amyloid Fig. 3 .

The first CV (Fig. 5A, CV1 sMRI ) differentiated DS from NL (P , .00001, ES 3.55) and AD (P , .00001, ES 4.87), and also contributed to discrimination between NL and AD (P , .00002, ES 2.09) (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests). This pattern shows DS volume reductions in cerebellum, occipital cortex, hippocampus, mid-cingulate, anterior cingulate, and temporal cortex. Preserved or increased volume was found in DS in caudate, putamen, thalamus, inferior lateral temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex compared to NL and AD. AD scores were lower than NL, to interpret in combination with the second pattern (Fig. 5B, CV2 sMRI ) . CV2 sMRI differentiated NL from AD (P , .003, ES 1.65), whereas DS scores distributed across the range from NL to AD. This pattern showed volume reductions in posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietal cortex, hippocampus, temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and caudate, with preserved or increased volume in putamen, thalamus, and midbrain. Volume reductions were consistent with AD-like atrophy."}, {"section_title": "FDG region of interest analyses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Correlation between PET markers and cognitive/ functional measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Structural MRI results", "text": "As in CV1 FDG , there is no association between CV1 sMRI score and amyloid status or age in DS subjects.

One scan was excluded from analyses in Figs. 4 and 5 due to blur. Three Am1 DS subjects showed notable ventricular enlargement.

Common regions between CV1 FDG and CV1 sMRI include relative hypometabolism and volume reduction in mid-cingulate, anterior cingulate, paracentral lobule, and hippocampus; relative hypermetabolism and volume preservation in prefrontal cortex; and relative hypermetabolism but volume reduction in occipital cortex. Common regions between CV2 FDG and CV2 sMRI include relative hypometabolism and reduced volume in posterior cingulate, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and hippocampus; and relative hypermetabolism and volume preservation in putamen and thalamus.\nThere were some differences between the FDG and sMRI findings.

Results also show that the degree of Alzheimer's-type neurodegeneration, reflected in FDG and MRI biomarkers, can be quantified in nondemented DS subjects. AD pattern expression varies greatly within the Am1 DS subjects as do clinical manifestations, underscoring the importance of characterization. We have also shown that FDG and MRI CV scores correlate with cognitive and functional endpoints, whereas amyloid burden does not within the Am1 DS subgroup.\nThe DS-associated CV1 FDG pattern hypometabolism partially overlapped but was distinct from the AD-like CV2 FDG pattern. Hypometabolism in paracentral lobule and striatum and prominent anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions differed from core AD features. The midand anterior cingulate regions of CV1 FDG have been associated with motor activation, error detection, and emotion [45] . Of interest is the posterior cingulate-precuneus hypometabolism in all DS subjects in NPAIRS and ROI results, significantly lower than NL and also EMCI Am1 subjects even in DS subjects negative for amyloid burden. Decreased posterior cingulate metabolism has been found in asymptomatic APOE \u03b54 carriers [8] and in some subjects with decreasing Abeta CSF but negative amyloid PET. As two of three Am2 subjects and the threshold Am DS subject were not APOE \u03b54 carriers, the hypometabolism could potentially arise from trisomy-driven abnormal amyloid turnover resulting in excess accumulation of Abeta rather than APOE \u03b54 effects or another mechanism. We note that all subjects had positive retinal amyloid measures [3] . Similar hypometabolism was seen in hippocampus in the NPAIRS and region of interest results when referenced to pons. Study of subjects in their 20's could enable investigation of the point at which hypometabolism in these regions begins to appear.\nThe relative frontal hypermetabolism within CV1 FDG was consistent with reports of regional hypermetabolism in young DS subjects. Such studies have hypothesized compensatory activity in response to deficient neural networks [12, 13, 15, 46] and/or a lower effectiveness of glycolysis related to downregulation of phosphoglucose isomerase, elevating glucose-6-phosphate [13] .\nThe AD-like FDG pattern (CV2 FDG ) is consistent with our FDG AD progression pattern and AD literature, supporting AD-relevance, and robustness despite small sample size. As in ADNI subjects, the AD-like pattern in DS subjects correlates with clinical endpoints. The presence of AD-like effects in nondemented DS is consistent with findings of an AD-like pattern in older nondemented DS by Azari [47] . The posterior cingulate hypometabolism in this pattern was consistent with findings by Sabbagh et al in both nondemented and demented DS, correlating with increasing age and dementia [17] .\nDS-specific pattern CV1 sMRI is consistent with reports of reduced cerebellar, cingulate, and hippocampal volume but preserved or increased subcortical volume, whereas CV2 sMRI was consistent with AD-related atrophy. As CV1 sMRI also captured differences between NL and AD, further exploration of the relationship between the two CVs is merited.\nFDG and sMRI findings showed similarities and differences in the patterns differentiating DS from normals. Of note is the cerebellum, involved in motor and postural control, affected in DS [48] . Despite reduced cerebellar volume in DS compared to NL, cerebellar hypometabolism was subtle. Relevant DS murine model work has found that despite reduced volume and cell density, there were no synaptic plasticity deficits to which motor deficits could be attributed [48] . Our findings suggest that structural and functional imaging information may be complementary.\nThere were limitations to this pilot study, particularly in the small sample size. The NPAIRS software aided in addressing this through its segregation of signal from background noise and prevention of model over-fitting through iterative resampling. However, additional subjects will be important for confirmation and further pattern characterization. Although the sourcing of DS subjects from a single site (UCSD) and the primary ADNI comparators from multiple other sites was another potential limitation, analyses specifically comparing ADNI subjects from the DS site showed no site-specific differences. Although age differences were also a limitation, the consistency of NPAIRS results obtained when age-matched NYU subjects were included, and when explicitly comparing ROIs between DS subjects and nearly identically age-matched NL-AE subjects, suggests that patterns were not due to age differences. Related to age, although no age correlation was observed in the DS-specific CV1 patterns, the youngest subject in this study was aged 32 years. Studying adults in their late teens and twenties may help to resolve the contrast between hypometabolism observed in our subjects and the hypermetabolism-only findings of some studies in young subjects, by filling this data gap. The cross-sectional study paradigm was also a limitation, partially offset by inclusion of multiple comparator classes with progressive stages of disease severity and our observation of consistent longitudinal increases in AD progression pattern expression in Am1 ADNI subjects. Longitudinal data anticipated through studies such as DSBI and the Neurodegeneration in Aging Down Syndrome study (NiAD) could help to expand on this work. In particular, findings would be supported if CV2 AD-like patterns are increasingly expressed in Am1 DS subjects over time, whereas the DS related CV1 patterns remain stable. Despite these various constraints, several elements support the validity of our findings, including the reproducibility and prediction metrics generated by NPAIRS, the alignment of AD-like pattern expression with amyloid positivity, the high correlation between AD-like pattern expression and relevant clinical measures, and consistency with published data from other studies.\nThe ability to dissociate functional and structural effects arising from AD vs underlying DS phenomena and to quantify degree of AD progression may enable identification of subjects likely to progress within a trial and detection of disease-specific treatment response. These capabilities could significantly enhance the viability of clinical trials of ADtargeted therapies in DS adults.

Additional work could include the following: the study of a larger number of DS subjects to confirm results; the study of DS subjects from late teens through late twenties to identify potential changes occurring in earliest adulthood; longitudinal evaluation to identify AD-related changes differentiable from DS effects."}]
