This preparation is inextricably linked to the future of P-20 education and intrinsically shaped by the knowledge and skills that doctoral faculty bring from their respective fields and graduate programs. This impact is reminiscent of Green's (1988) belief in the relationship between education and a free, democratic society and asserts \"It is through and by means of education, many of us believe, that individuals can be provoked to reach beyond themselves in their intersubjective space. It is through and by means of education that they may become empowered to think\u2026.\" (p. 12). The doctoral faculty have the privilege and responsibility to challenge and support students to gain the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to successfully propel them to begin or advance their careers in P-20 educational leadership. Recognizing the significant role faculty play in developing these future educational leaders and in turn the education system, we sought to examine faculty at the helm, specifically their academic qualifications and practitioner experiences."}, {"section_title": "FACULTY ACADEMIC AND PRACTITIONER PREPARATION", "text": "It is apparent that the academic and professional attributes of the faculty impact the curricula of leadership preparation programs and in turn shape learning (Hackmann & McCarthy, 2011a) . Disconcertingly, Levine (2005) found that almost 90% of educational administrators felt colleges of education did not adequately prepare future educators for the profession. Furthermore, only 63% of these administrators found educational leadership courses valuable in practice. Levine's (2005) seminal study examined an educational leadership program where faculty members were primarily parttime faculty members who were active practitioners or full-time faculty members with little practitioner experience. Interestingly, the faculty with more practitioner experience were perceived to be the most effective and that corresponded with a more relevant curriculum. This supports the need for further inquiry into the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty in educational leadership programs.\nCARNEGIE CLASSIFICATION OF DOCTORAL PROGRAMS Levine (2005) found that educational leadership faculty members often lacked school administrative experience or that their experience was not recent. As educational leadership programs have changed, so too have the faculty members that guide the programs. As personal attributes of faculty members may affect their performance and ability to positively influence future educational leaders, the type of degree that educational leadership faculty members received may frame their instructional practices and further influence the outcomes of their instruction. When looking at educational leadership faculty characteristics, the Carnegie level of the terminal degree carries weight. The Carnegie classification system is a dichotomy that delineates institutional types into categories to allow comparison and benchmarking. With respect to doctoral education, the Carnegie dichotomous system delineates doctoral institutions into three categories: Research 1 (R1), the highest research activity, Research (R2), higher research activity and Research (R3), moderate research activity. While the impetus for the creation and continuation of the Carnegie classification was and is not to rank institutions, there is a common perception that permeates throughout the academy to the contrary. This results in the fallacy that R1 institutions are the elite universities due to their Carnegie \"ranking\". This flawed application of the Carnegie classification is supported by the assertion that it has \"\u2026become part of the fabric of higher education research and policy in the United States\" (Borden, Coates & Bringle, 2018, p. 195) . So much so, it is influential in how states allocate funding, implications for federal grants, and is even a component used in the U.S. News & World Report for its annual ranking of \"Best Colleges\"."}, {"section_title": "EXAMINATION OF EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP FACULTY", "text": "Examining the state of Georgia in the United States (US), there are currently nine doctoral programs in educational leadership that prepare students to be scholar practitioners and change agents within P-12 and higher education ( Figure 1) . While the majority of these programs only offer one degree type (Ed.D or PhD), two institutions offer both degree types in Educational Leadership. The geography of where these institutions are located is interesting, as the majority are clustered in the northwest part of the state in or near Atlanta. While these doctoral programs are readily known by educators throughout the state, there is not a clear sense of these collective academic qualifications and practitioner experience of faculty. While some departmental websites provide a wealth of easily accessible information, others provided limited information beyond identifying the faculty. In this way, they are much like the Wizard of Oz and hidden behind the curtain. In an effort to pull back the curtain and better understand who these educational leadership doctoral faculty are throughout the state, this descriptive study was an inquiry into just that. We sought to describe the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of the educational leadership doctoral faculty and draw implications for how their experiences may impact the development of future P-20 leadership. To do so, our study was guided by the following research question: What are the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty of educational leadership programs?"}, {"section_title": "Institution", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE", "text": "Our inquiry into the experiences of faculty began by reviewing the literature on Carnegie classifications, the emergence of Ed.D programs, and the impact of practitioner experience. There is a paucity of research in these areas overall with minimal research found in the educational leadership field. However, existing literature informs this descriptive study and reinforces the need for this inquiry.\nCARNEGIE CLASSIFICATION AND ITS IMPACT ON TH E PATH TO ACADEMIA As colleges and universities are commonly compared and ranked by their Carnegie status, this dichotomous system allows institutions to be categorized for comparative and research purposes. The Carnegie Classification system was instituted in 1971 and grouped institutions of higher education into five categories: doctoral universities, comprehensive colleges, liberal arts colleges, two-year colleges, and professional schools (McCormick & Zhou, 2005) . In 2015, the Carnegie Classification was revised to delineate doctoral universities at three levels: R1, the highest research activity, R2, higher research activity and R3, moderate research activity. The next area which was ranked by size is the master's colleges and universities at three levels: M1 with larger programs that awarded at least 200 masters-level degrees, M2 with medium programs that awarded 100-199 masters-level degrees, and M3 with small programs that awarded 50-99 masters-level degrees. The remaining categories are baccalaureate and associate colleges, special focus institutions, and tribal colleges. Each of these areas is then broken into different subsections based on content areas. The Carnegie Classification system will be updated by the end of 2018 indicating a shift to a three-year cycle instead of a five-year cycle. This change is expected to impact the membership within these two categories. The update will consider including professional practice degrees within the basic classification system (The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, 2018).\nWith this being said, it is important to note that the Carnegie Classification is not intended to rank colleges and universities, rather, serve as a grouping of common institutional characteristics. However, R1 institutions are often considered the nations' most prestigious and flagship universities. This prestige drives other institutions to ascribe to gaining R1 status. McCormick (2008) suggested there are certain principles that are shared by both a classification and ranking system and therefore the two systems can appear to be linked. For example, in the field of natural sciences, more weight in hiring is placed on the prestige of the university from which the faculty member received their doctorate rather than on other attributes such as pre-employment research productivity or faculty employment (Thompson & Zumeta, 1985) . In 2016, about 20% of higher education institutions produced about 50% of all PhD placements in the field of sociology. In addition, those who graduated from prestigious universities often earned placement in prestigious jobs. However, graduation from prestigious universities did not guarantee job placement. Not only was job placement associated with university prestige but also those doctoral students from more prestigious universities were more likely to be published in more elite journals. One reason for this difference is that hiring graduates from more prestigious universities bestows prestige among the hiring schools (Headworth & Freese, 2016) .\nRecognizing the influence of R1 institutions in the hiring of tenure-track faculty and their output of doctoral students with emerging research agendas, it would be reasonable to expect to see a higher number of faculty from R1 institutions. If that is the case, this poses the question as to how this doctoral education strengthens and/or limits their ability to effectively hold positions in those institutions that are not of R1 status.\nTHE EMERGENCE OF TH E ED.D AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO TH E PHD The number of institutions offering doctoral degrees in education has increased in the last 40 years (Goldring & Schuermann, 2009 Faculty members have shared a desire to increase the connections between theory and practice in preparation programs (McCarthy, 1999) . Additionally, the educational leadership faculty members expressed the most significant need for the profession to focus on problems of practice. Similarly, Murphy (1999) found that a major theme expressed by faculty members was that instruction in educational leadership programs was becoming more focused on issues related to practice. To this end, educational leadership programs had shifted to include more field-based involvement.\nWhen comparing the two types of doctoral degrees, Ed.D and PhD, there are some similarities, specifically in the expected core coursework of the two programs, however, there are some differences as well. One difference is the theoretical purpose of each degree program. The Ed.D is intended for educational professionals who work towards the doctorate on a part-time basis while working in an educational setting; whereas, the PhD is designed for future university faculty members and researchers (Leist & Scott, 2011) . Other differences include the total number of hours of coursework for each degree, the number of research courses required, and the time spent in the dissertation phase (Leist & Scott, 2011) . However, these theoretical differences are not a hard and fast rule. For example, there are Ed.D programs that are research intensive and designed to offer pathways for newly minted Doctors of Education to transition into the academy in faculty roles. Similarly, there are Ed.D programs that require as many, if not more, credit hours than PhD programs. To this end, the differences between Ed.D and PhD programs is at best blurred.\nWith these similarities and the blurring between the two degrees, there became a need to further differentiate the two doctoral degrees, to terminate the Ed.D program, or shift it to a master's degree (Shulman, Golde, Bueschel, & Garabedian, 2006) . There was a clear need to do so, as both faculty and students found themselves confused as to the differences between these programs, departments questioned if they were replicating academic programs already being offered, and faculty and administrators posed the ethical and responsible question of the benefit to students (and society) to have one degree type over the other. Recognizing this imperative need, the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) was launched in 2007 in an effort to differentiate these terminal degrees (Perry, 2012) . Initially, there were 25 schools of education that began working to differentiate the Ed.D from the PhD The goal was to create a high quality, rigorous degree for those who were school practitioners in a P-20 setting or clinical faculty in a school of education. The idea behind the CPED Ed.D was to connect theoretical and practical knowledge so that it could be applied to educational practice.\nIn 2014, there were 86 schools of education from the US, Canada, and New Zealand that were members. Each individual CPED institution appeared different, based on the needs, the location, and the students of that particular institution, however, each school worked to differentiate the Ed.D from the PhD. The differences can be found in the admission processes, course credits, and capstone projects. In addition, CPED has specific designated components for the Ed.D program such as developing scholarly practitioners or those who use practical research as a change agent in their respective fields, identifying and solving problems of practice focused on real life problems in education and how to address them, and the completion of dissertations of practice which stem from problems of practice (Perry, 2015) . Furthermore, it has been noted that both Ed.D and PhD programs are on the same stature as doctoral degrees (National Opinion Research Center, 2018; National Science Foundation, 2018) . Stemming from the findings of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED; National Opinion Research Center, 2018), which is a federal agency survey for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and five other federal agencies, the NSF and SED recognize and classify 18 research doctorates all in the same category, which includes both the Ed.D and PhD. This reinforces that both terminal degrees carry rigor and develop the research methods of students. In other words, it dispels the myth that Ed.D programs are simply \"PhD light\" programs.\nWithin the field of education, faculty members in a student affairs program who had previously worked in that field desired to maintain a connection with the profession. Maintaining a connection to the practitioner experience allowed the faculty to have a practical knowledge base as well as staying current on information from the field (Kniess, Benjamin & Boettcher, 2017) . In a P-12 setting, it is important for educators to maintain ties to the teaching field as a way to keep perspective and to gain additional knowledge and experience that can be beneficial to future student educators. In addition, going back to a P-12 classroom for practitioner experience can be a reminder of the daily demands of the P-12 setting (Rieg & Helterbran, 2005) .\nWhen looking at fields outside of education, previous practitioner experience is deemed beneficial for faculty members. Finance faculty members generally believe that practical experience benefits student learning and also that students find faculty members with practical experience to be valuable assets to learning (Chan & Shum, 1995) . However, those who teach finance noted that practitioner experience does not hold significant value in hiring, tenure, or promotion decisions. Despite the lack of influence in hiring, promotion, or tenure, 56.2% of the faculty agreed that gaining or refreshing their practical experience should be expected (Chan & Shum, 1995) . In the accounting field, professors indicated that having previous work experience was linked to the ability to teach effectively. Additionally, having work experience in the field of accounting was found to be more important than having previous teaching experience (Marshall, Smith, Dombrowski & Garner, 2012) . In the field of hospitality, of the 175 faculty surveyed over 96% had some form of previous experience in the industry of hospitality from the areas of food and beverage, hotels and lodging, marketing, accounting, human resources, casino operations, and airlines. Conversely, Marshall et al. (2012) found that faculty members entering the field of hospitality have less experience. Of those entering higher education, 25% have less than five years of experience in the industry. However, faculty at all academic levels believed that having previous experience in the field was important and beneficial to teaching hospitality in higher education (Phelan, Mejia & Hertzman, 2013) . Hackmann and McCarty (2011b) found that 67% of faculty members (terminal degree types not defined) in educational leadership programs had previous administrative experience in a school at the building or district level. Before becoming an educational leadership faculty member, 45% held a position in higher education and 42% held a previous leadership position in a P-12 setting. Those at comprehensive and doctoral universities were more likely than those at research universities to have been school administrators. Those individuals who were members of the clinical faculty were more likely to have previous school administrator experience. In terms of clinical faculty, 84% reported previous practitioner experience as compared to 63% of tenure track faculty in educational leadership, who had previous administrator experience (Hackmann & McCarthy, 2011b) . In addition, clinical faculty noted their primary strength to be teaching and advising (Hackmann & McCarthy, 2011a) .\nAccording to Hackmann, Malin and McCarthy (2017) , practitioner experience for educational leadership faculty members was based on the type of higher education institutions. Faculty members who were employed at research institutions were less likely to have worked in an administrative role, such as a building level leader or member of the central office. Those faculty members who were employed at doctoral and comprehensive institutions were more likely to have held an administrative role before becoming a member of the educational leadership faculty."}, {"section_title": "ACADEMIC FOCUS", "text": "The purpose of the PhD is to prepare doctoral students to be researchers and university faculty members (Shulman, et al., 2006) . To this end, dissertations for a PhD should have a more theoretical focus. Furthermore, PhD programs should emphasize research and the creation of effective researchers. According to Aiken and Gerstl-Pepin (2013) , a PhD educational leadership program was created at the University of Vermont to address the needs of those students who were more focused on research and wanted an academic career. As the program was created, the focus of the PhD program was on preparing professional researchers, as well as faculty members. The idea of the PhD program was that students would participate in the creation of new knowledge (Aiken & Gerstl-Pepin, 2013) . Interestingly, as of 2019, the educational leadership program at the University of Vermont now includes both PhD and Ed.D options (The University of Vermont, 2019). Furthermore, they are active members of CPED.\nWhen comparing Ed.D and PhD programs, Leist and Scott (2011) further stressed that the focus of PhD programs are on research, faculty preparation, and the synthesis and creation of new knowledge. This academic focus arguably prepares PhD candidates for a career pathway into academia as faculty in college and university settings (Anderson, 1983) . Supporting this PhD pipeline to academia and research is the study by Golde and Dore (2001) , which surveyed over 4,000 doctoral students. It was found that 63% of respondents were interested in a faculty position at some point in the future. Among the respondents, 74% indicated that they wanted to complete research and 71% felt confident in their ability to conduct research. Conversely, Ed.D programs focus on practice, practitioner development, and addressing practical problems. However, as this research study will demonstrate, this is not a hard and fast rule. There are a significant number of faculty with Ed.Ds and there are Ed.D programs that do focus on research, faculty preparation, and the synthesis of new knowledge. While this is known anecdotally, it is another gap in the literature that should further studied."}, {"section_title": "SCHOLARLY PRACTITIONER FOCUS", "text": "Scholarly practice is grounded in theory and research, includes assessment and evaluation, and is driven by personal values, commitment, and ethical conduct (McClintock, 2003) . As faculty of graduate preparatory programs, we have the responsibility to instill these principles in the educators we teach, supervise, and mentor. Doing so will strengthen our profession and have a rippling impact on P-12 and higher education. Kupo (2014) noted that educational research is typically done locally and can impact that specific community or university. Furthermore, scholarship can inform practice and can be used to shape and justify daily work. Similarly, Schultz (2010) emphasized that the scholar practitioner leadership creates a learning environment that focuses on five key areas of community, democracy, equity, social justice and caring to guide practice. To link theory and practice, the scholar practitioner uses critical inquiry and creates knowledge that is beneficial for practice. In addition, reflection is a key component of determining if the knowledge that was created holds true to the five key areas. To this end, the findings from a recent study (Bettencourt, Malaney, Kidder & Mwangi, 2017) examined graduate students in an educational leadership program (focused in higher education administration) and the findings indicated students see the value in serving as a scholarly practitioner.\nAcknowledging the importance of developing students to view themselves as scholarly practitioners is critical in the future of educational leadership to understand how the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty contribute to this development. Now with all of this being said, we assert that this principle of scholarly practice ought to be a core principle of all Educational Leadership doctoral programs (Ed.D and PhD). While in theory the Ed.D should be the terminal degree for practitioners (Leist & Scott, 2011) , in actuality there are a significant number of practitioners who hold Ph.Ds."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH QUESTION", "text": "While the literature is robust in the description and history of PhD and Ed.D programs, there is a gap in the literature examining the faculty of these programs. Does a faculty member having a background with an academic focus and/or scholarly-practice focus better lend to the development of doctoral students? If so, how should programs with this diversity harness their faculty's academic and practitioner experiences to better develop doctoral students? Conversely, what should a program that lacks this faculty diversity of experience do to address this void? Before these questions can be addressed in future studies, we must first have an understanding of who these doctoral faculty are of educational leadership programs and what their backgrounds entail. Subsequently, this descriptive study seeks to answer the research question, what are the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty of educational leadership programs?\nThe following research question, informed by the theoretical framework of Kolb's (1984) model of experiential learning, guided this research:\n\uf8e7 What are the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty of educational leadership programs?"}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DESIGN", "text": "The design for this descriptive study was quantitative content analysis, which provides a structured way to quantify unstructured and/or qualitative data (Rose, Spinks, & Canhoto, 2014) . In other words, this allowed us to look at a variety of qualitative sources (e.g., websites, curriculum vitae) and quantify the data according to coding themes we developed. The benefit of this methodology and its selection for this study was it allowed the examination and description of the whole population of faculty within the state of Georgia. Employing other quantitative methodology, such as instrument distribution and collection, very likely would have had a lower response rate. Thus, through quantitative content analysis we were able to capture and describe all of the educational leadership doctoral faculty in the state of Georgia."}, {"section_title": "THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "With quantitative methods, the theoretical framework guides the path of the research and informs the research design (Adom, Hussein, & Agyem, 2018; Grant & Osanloo, 2014) . To this end, the theoretical framework should align with answering the research question and ensuring the methodology is appropriate (Lederman & Lederman, 2015) . At the crux of our research question is the faculty experience (academic and practitioner) of doctoral faculty in educational leadership programs. Supporting this inquiry into experience and guiding this research study is the theoretical framework of Kolb's (1984) model of experiential learning, which is built upon the idea of learning through doing. This learning is defined as \"the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience\" (p. 38). It is this very experience that our study on doctoral faculty sought to examine. Our inquiry into understanding the doctoral faculty backgrounds (academic and/or practitioner) sheds light on those responsible for education at the highest level. These faculty will be the gatekeepers to education, as they are responsible for academically mentoring and developing the educators who will ultimately hold the highest-level positions within P-20 education. To this end, supporting John Dewey's (1916) belief that (public) education is the bedrock to democracy, these doctoral students will be directly responsible for shaping society through their future elevated roles in P-20 education. And in doing so, they will be the gatekeepers to the economic and social advancement of our next generation (Sandeen & Barr, 2014) . This reinforces the need to better understand the experiences of those teaching future leaders. As our research study seeks to understand the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty of educational leadership programs, Kolb's (1984) model of experiential learning is the theoretical framework guiding this research."}, {"section_title": "STUDY SITE", "text": "In an effort to understand the composition of educational leadership doctoral faculty in a state system of higher education in the US, the state of Georgia was selected for this study. This state system included four research universities, four comprehensive universities, nine state colleges, and nine state universities. In 2016, there were a total of 62,545 degrees awarded within the state system and of those degrees, 1,645 were doctoral degrees. In addition to the colleges and universities, the system is also made up of the State Archives and the State Public Library System. The public library system has 389 different facilities. In all, a component of the University System is found in each of the 150+ counties. There is a Board of Regents with 19 members each of whom hold a seven-year term that oversees the governance of the system. Within Georgia, nine doctoral programs were identified within the discipline of educational leadership (or closely related) (See Table 1 ). While the majority of these programs only offer one degree type (Ed.D or PhD), two institutions offer both degree types in Educational Leadership. As illustrated previously in Figure 1 , the geographical clustering/spacing of these institutions is notable. Of the nine programs, five are centralized in or near the Atlanta metropolitan area while the other four are spaced throughout the state a sizeable distance away.

Content analysis was deemed appropriate for this study to utilize a \"systematic assignment of communication content to categories according to rules, and the analysis of relationships involving those categories using statistical methods\" (Rife, Lacy, & Fico, 2005, p. 3). In addition, the data collected in this quantitative content analysis were analyzed to identify typical characteristics of the content qualities examined (Rife et al, 2005) and in the case of this study, faculty attributes. To begin, doctoral programs in educational leadership within the state of Georgia were identified for this study (Table 1 ) and were then de-identified by Carnegie classification ( Table 2 ). The institutional search was limited to public and private institutions within the state. In cases of satellite campuses/programs, they were treated as separate institutions. With regards to the identification of faculty, only full-time faculty were included, which meant adjunct faculty were excluded. This led to an examination in April 2018 of departmental information (e.g., websites, brochures, directories) in an effort to identify the 83 faculty members of these nine respective programs. The research team was intentionally composed of members who have practitioner experience in P-12 school administration and higher education administration, as they would be able to assist in the coding of practitioner experience and work to operationally define the intended variables. The coding included operationalizing what constituted as practitioner experience in P-12 versus higher education. For P-12, the parameter for categorizing was faculty who held school leadership roles within the areas of educational leadership, curriculum and instruction, and or other related areas (i.e., assessment and professional learning). For higher education, the parameter was faculty who held administrative roles within colleges and universities (i.e., administrative positions in student affairs and academic affairs). \n11% (1) 67% (6) 22% (2) Total Faculty (n = 83) 59% (49) 39% (32) 2% (2) Following this operationalization, of the programs and practitioner experience, the full research team and additional research assistants spent two full days together collecting the data through an exhaustive online search to determine the following demographics for each faculty member: terminal degree type (Ed.D, PhD, or Ed.S.), Carnegie Classification from where they obtained their terminal degree, Carnegie Classification from where they were employed, and whether or not they have practitioner experience in their respective fields of school administration or higher education. These variables were limited to data that was publicly available, so it excluded demographics such as gender, teaching load, and tenure status. Note that Carnegie classifications utilized for description in this study come from the most recent 2015 data available (The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, n.d.)\nThis online search of publicly available information included but was not limited to collecting CVs, viewing LinkedIn and university profiles, and conducting a Google search. From there, each team member spent the following week seeking out any missing data points. The team reconvened to examine the fully collected data set and agree upon its validity and completeness. Furthermore, we triangulated the data on the faculty through a collection and comparison of their academic and practitioner experience from their publicly available CVs, LinkedIn profiles, university websites, and public Google searches. The compiled data of the nine institutions and 83 faculty members were described through descriptive statistics (means and frequency distribution).

This resulted in calculation of the means and frequency distribution of the academic and practitioner experience of the 83 faculty members and the institutions they currently hold positions at.\nRELIABILITY AND VALIDITY Rife, et al., (2005) stressed the need to establish reliability and coding in quantitative content analysis.\nTo ensure inter-rater reliability, the members of the research team reviewed and agreed upon each coding of the variable for the classification categories. This reliability was tested by beginning the search for the first 10 candidates together and jointly reviewing/discussing their definition according to the coding scheme. This process showed a saturation and consistency in reliability between the research team. Furthermore, the data were triangulated through a collection and comparison of CVs, LinkedIn profiles, university websites, and public Google searches for each faculty member.\nWith regards to validity, it was appropriate in this study to ensure qualitative validity, as that was the mechanism that yielded the data for the quantitative content analysis. Our methodology for qualitative coding of content for data analysis met four out of five of Maxwell's (1992) criteria for establishing validity: descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, and evaluative validity.

To be clear, this descriptive study should be viewed as the initial inquiry that sought to warrant further investigation. The first limitation to the methodology of the study was the reliance upon accurate data being publicly listed for each faculty member. There were instances that CVs listed on departmental websites were found to be outdated, as more recent data were found through triangulation with LinkedIn and Google searches. The second limitation is that the study was limited solely to programs in one state; hence, there is a lower sample size of faculty for comparison (both N=83 and n=83). On this note, this will likely always be a limitation when studying a small population.

As was expected, the bulk of faculty hold positions of Assistant and Associate Professor (37% and 34%, respectively). As it relates to the Carnegie classification of where faculty received their doctorate versus where they have a faculty appointment, unsurprisingly the majority of faculty received their doctorates from R1 research institutions. Of the 83 faculty in the state, 59% have a PhD, 39% have an Ed.D, and 2% have an Ed.S.

Across all programs, faculty with PhDs have the greatest representation ( Figure 2) . It was assumed this would be the case for PhD programs (eight PhDs to three Ed.Ds), but it was also true for Ed.D programs (29 PhDs to 22 Ed.Ds). Recognizing the nature of these doctoral programs, in which they serve as an apprenticeship model to further prepare educational administrators for leadership roles, it is important to examine the practitioner experiences of the faculty (Figure 3 ). Of the educational leadership faculty, 76% of all faculty in the state have substantial practitioner experience in the fields they are teaching. This allows them the opportunity to relate theory-to-practice from their actual practice as an administrator. Based on the nature of Ed.D programs having a focus on developing scholarly practitioners (CPED, 2018) and addressing problems of practice (CPED, 2018), 88% of Ed.D faculty have a practitioner experience and 68% of PhD faculty also share practitioner expertise."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3.

The remaining 36% are distributed through R2, R3, and institutions with a single doctoral program (14%, 17%, and 5%, respectively).

(4) Note: 'Other' is the classification for an institution with a 'single doctoral program'. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH & PRACTICE", "text": "This descriptive study illustrated the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of doctoral faculty in educational leadership programs in the state. As these programs strive to create the next generation of leaders in P-12 school administration and higher education administration, it is important to examine the faculty who orchestrate these programs and guide students through the ap-prenticeship model of doctoral education. It can be argued that doctoral students are a reflection of their faculty. To this end, soon to be doctors of education and scholarly practitioners in this state are then products of faculty who predominantly hold PhDs and earned their terminal degree at R1 institutions.\nWhile the majority of faculty hold PhDs and their terminal degree came from an R1 institution (64% and 59%, respectively), there is a healthy balance of faculty who have Ed.Ds and whose terminal degree came from outside an R1 institution. This balance is promising, as it has the potential to lead to shared knowledge in these doctoral programs that can strengthen the development of doctoral students as researchers and scholarly practitioners. These faculty with PhDs have a strong background and focus on research as aligned with the seminal work of Shulman et al., (2006) , and in turn these faculty can help nurture the scholarship of doctoral students throughout the program (including but not limited to their dissertation). Conversely, built into the core of Ed.D programs aligned with the CPED principles is the focus of addressing problems of practice and identifying as a scholarly practitioner (Perry, 2015) . Scholarly practitioners are those who merge practical knowledge with professional skills to solve problems of practice (CPED, 2018) . The faculty with Ed.Ds are positioned well academically and theoretically to reinforce this epistemology in their doctoral students. Now with all of this being said, it must be noted there are exceptions to the focus of PhD and Ed.D programs, as there are PhD programs that focus more on scholarly practice and problems of practice, while there are Ed.D programs that are research intensive and have significant coursework in research methods.\nThe most affirming finding of this study, which supports the apprenticeship model of doctoral programs in educational leadership, is the overwhelming number of faculty who hold practitioner experience is 76% (PhDs 40%, Ed.Ds 34%, and Ed.S. 2%). The literature illustrates that faculty with practitioner experience are able to incorporate meaning into their teaching practices (Kniess et al., 2017) , which yields greater learning in the classroom and therefore they believe that they can teach more effectively (Marshall, et al., 2012) , providing further support to the findings in this study. These faculty are able to go beyond the textbook and vividly describe their experiences in the schools/institutions in an effort to apply theory-to-practice. Arguably, this experience working in the \"trenches\" not only further informs their pedagogy, but makes their ideas more credible to students. In addition, supporting the work of going back to a P-12 classroom for practitioner experience can be a reminder of the daily demands of the P-12 setting, which also allows for better application of theory-to-practice (Rieg & Helterbran, 2005) . Conversely, the faculty with sole academic experience bring a unique perspective to their doctoral students and colleagues. They are able to examine educational practice through the lens of evidence-based practices grounded in theoretical framework. To this end, they are less likely to get bogged down in their own experiences, which may not be applicable to the current state of P-20 education. This allows them the freedom to engage in inquiry with their students without the boundaries of their own preconceived notions from their time in the \"trenches.\"\nThe description of the doctoral faculty in educational leadership from all the programs within the state of Georgia proved interesting and raised questions in the process. Based on the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of these faculty, three implications have emerged from this descriptive study:"}, {"section_title": "PRACTITIONERS", "text": "The Educational Leadership doctoral faculty in the state of Georgia have strong experiences as practitioners. Of these faculty, 63 out of 83 (76%) have administrative experience related to their field. Recognizing the apprenticeship model again of these doctoral programs that are striving to create scholarly practitioners within education, this high percentage of faculty with practitioner experiences should be noted. This is aligned to Levine's (2005) study, which examined an educational leadership program and noted that faculty with more practitioner experience were perceived to be the most effective and that corresponded with a more relevant curriculum. In the seminal work of Shulman (2005) one distinctive feature of doctoral education noted was that much of the important teaching and learning takes place in a one-to-one relationship between a student and their advisor, and he went so far as to call the apprenticeship model the signature pedagogy of doctoral education. These faculty prepared through the apprenticeship model have the ability to not only scaffold their teaching and mentoring to academic backing but can apply theory-to-practice from their experiences as administrators first-hand. Conversely, it is also a benefit to these doctoral programs that a number of the faculty are pure academics (whether they hold a PhD or Ed.D) as they will be able to provide another lens for the students to examine their studies thoroughly. This balance of faculty who have academic experiences helps to foster a holistic learning environment that supports the academic success and professional development of doctoral students."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE FACULTY", "text": "It could be argued that the findings support educational administrators who want to become fulltime faculty members of doctoral programs, in particular Georgia, should consider pursuing PhDs from R1 research institutions. Of the 83 current faculty, 53 (64%) earned their doctorates from R1 institutions and 49 (59%) hold PhDs. This supports the seminal work of Burris (2004) that noted the prestige of the institution which students receive their terminal degree is one of the most important factors in determining employment opportunities. This classification as an R1, the highest researching university, carries this weight of prestige. It has been found that prestige is a strong predictor of academics into tenure track/tenure positions (Clauset, Arbesman, & Larremore, 2015) . Furthermore, in some disciplines, it has been found that some carry even more weight than others and have resulted in dominating the educating and placement of academics (Oprisko, 2012) . While the field of educational leadership in Georgia has the majority of faculty from R1 institutions, the institutions they earned their degrees from are diverse, thus not supporting the notion of a \"scholar mill\" pipeline.\nHowever, it must be noted that a substantial number of faculty came from outside of R1 institutions (36%) and hold Ed.D degrees (39%). Furthermore, these faculty members hold positions throughout the state at R1, R2, and R3 institutions in both PhD and Ed.D programs. Recognizing the substantial growth in students pursuing Ed.D programs (Goldring & Schuermann, 2009 ), in the future this growth may very well be reflected by an increase in the number of doctoral faculty holding Ed.D degrees throughout all institutions.\nWhile doctoral programs in education are relatively young compared to other disciplines, the field has matured, and the growth of new programs has begun to level off. Subsequently, while there was once a great demand for faculty in this field, we may soon, if we have not already, reached the saturation point that will stall the academic appointments of recent doctoral graduates. It is important for all doctoral programs (R1/R2/R3) to discuss this saturation with prospective students, as doing so may help students to make more informed decisions on their doctoral education and have more realistic expectations post-graduation."}, {"section_title": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "This descriptive study should pave the way for further inquiry into the doctoral faculty of educational leadership programs in the state. While this study is clearly descriptive in nature, it should serve as a catalyst that will enable future empirical studies to springboard off of it. Considerations for future research should include: \uf8e7 What is the impact of the academic and practitioner backgrounds of doctoral faculty on doctoral students' academic and professional success? \uf8e7 What are doctoral students' perceptions of the efficacy of faculty with a PhD versus Ed.D degree and those with academic qualifications and practitioner experiences? \uf8e7 Have we reached the saturation of the job market for tenure-track positions within educational leadership programs and what are the implications for aspiring faculty members graduating from these doctoral programs?\n\uf8e7 How does the academic preparation and teaching philosophy of faculty with a PhD versus Ed.D degree compare and for those in Ed.D programs how do they align with the guiding principles of CPED? \uf8e7 As new Assistant Professors (tenure-track) are hired in this state, what are their academic qualifications and practitioner experiences? How do they contrast/compliment the experiences of current faculty? \uf8e7 What are the demographic backgrounds of faculty beyond academic pedigree and practitioner experience? Is there a need to increase diversity among the applicant pool of doctoral faculty in educational leadership programs?"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this descriptive study, we \"dipped our toe\" into the inquiry of understanding the academic qualifications and practitioner experiences of all doctoral faculty in educational leadership programs within the state of Georgia.\nWe These findings are informative, as they not only describe the faculty of these programs, but they visually illustrate it for us. This should now lead to further inquiry about doctoral faculty, their preparedness to serve in these roles, and their path to academia. Recognizing the impact these doctoral programs have on shaping P-12 and higher education administration, we have the responsibility to systematically evaluate every aspect of these doctoral programs. This descriptive study illuminated the academic and practitioner backgrounds of the doctoral faculty, which will now serve as a calling to empirically study their effectiveness. Of the six considerations for future research we outlined in this paper, we contend the priority should first be placed on examining what the impact of the academic and practitioner backgrounds of doctoral faculty are on doctoral students' academic and professional success.\nTo be clear, this study is a primer that demonstrates there is a need to better understand those leading doctoral programs. In the field of educational leadership, it is arguably one of the most important doctoral programs, as doctorates from these programs will serve as senior leadership in the P-12 and higher education arenas throughout the world. Recognizing that (public) education is the bedrock to democracy (Dewey, 1916) and serves as the gatekeeper to economic and social advancement (Sandeen & Barr, 2014) , we should have a significant investment in the development of educational leadership doctoral programs and the faculty who teach within them. The responsibility of doctoral faculty is to harness their academic qualifications and practitioner experiences to develop future educational leaders to be scholarly practitioners. In doing so, these educators will be empowered to make a difference within their community that is based on educated and scholarly decisions, which we can only hope may be impactful in schools and institutions throughout the country."}]
