[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the new decade of 21 st century, surfaced the first public health emergency of global concern in Wuhan, China from the menace of COVID-19 (nCoV/\u03b2-coronavirus), also known as SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is one of the seven pathogenic members of family coronaviridae, other notable ones are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), identified first in southern China (November, 2002) , and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), from Saudi Arabia (2012). Less severe ones are HKU1, NL63, OC-43 and 229E. 1 The enveloped virus possesses crown-like spikes on their surface (Latin word corona i.e crown) and a RNA genome, single stranded positive-sense strand with 26 to 32 kb length. 2 The microbe can co-infect different vertebrates including humans and affect organs of respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system.\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), 80% COVID infection are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, while 5% are critical. Crude mortality ratio (no. of reported deaths divided by reported cases) is between 3-4%. The infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infection) will be lower than seasonal influenza (0\u00b71%). Globally there are 6,68,690 confirmed cases; 31,065 deaths and so far 1,43,107 people recovered in 199 countries and territories. 3, 4 The most vulnerable group in corona epidemic is elderly, malnourished, hypertensive, diabetic, immune compromised, cancer and cardiovascular patients, as well as pregnant women. Despite wide spread COVID-19 infection, the numbers of fatally infected children cases are less reported so far, possible mechanism might be an unknown protective interaction between immune system and respiratory pathway. 5 COVID-19 spreads through droplet infection and fomites, from infected person during coughing and sneezing. Majority of symptoms are sore throat, breathing difficulty and fever, although GI and musculoskeletal system are also involved. 6,7 Clinical course is somehow showing a predictable pattern. On around day five, flu like symptom starts, common are fever, headache, dry cough, myalgia (and back pain), nausea (without vomiting), abdominal discomfort with some diarrhea, loss of smell, anorexia and fatigue. Around same time symptoms can worsen leading to shortness of breath due to bilateral viral pneumonia from direct viral damage to lung parenchyma. Around day10, cytokine storm kicks in, subsequently acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ failure ensues. This degradation usually happens in matter of hours. Hospitalized patients in moderate to severe cases usually come in hypoxic stage without dyspnea. China reported 15% cardiac involvement and serious final outcome. In most of the chest X-rays, bilateral interstitial pneumonia or ground glass opacities are seen. Hypoxia mostly does not correlate well with the chest x-ray findings. Chest auscultations are not of great help. Blood reports show, in the most cases, WBC is low, i.e. mostly lymphocytopenia, low platelet count whereas pro-calcitonin are mostly normal. Most consistently, CRP and ferritin levels are elevated and similarly CPK, D-dimer, LDH, ALKphos/AST-ALT levels are also high. It has been seen a ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count, greater than 3.5, may be the highest predictor of poor outcome. An elevated level of IL-6 is of grave concern of cytokine storm. 8,9\nAmong the four classified subfamilies, \u03b1 -and \u03b2 -coronaviruses both were found in bats, e.g Leafnose bats like Hipposideros armige harbor \u03b1 -coronavirus and \u03b2 -coronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus; 10 while \u03b3 -and \u03b4 -coronavirus found in pigs and birds respectively. 11 The genesis of \u03b2 coronavirus cluster in afore mentioned bat species, consisting of primeval and genetically independent types might took favour of host/pathogen interaction despite of wide geographical distribution. 10 Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 reveals 96% identity to that of bat coronavirus whole genome; 1 while 79% and 50% to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively. 12 Like other betacoronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5' end, followed by four major structural proteins, including the spike like surface glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein. 11, 13 The spike (S) protein has two distinct functional domains, termed S1 and S2, both of which are necessary for a coronavirus to successfully enter a cell. It has been found that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-20 times more likely to bind to human ACE2 than the S protein of the early 2000s SARS-CoV strain. ACE2 is essentially a carboxypeptidase, which can remove carboxy-terminal of hydrophobic or basic amino acids. The expression of ACE2 is comparatively higher in mouth and tongue and is also normally expressed in human lower lungs on type-I and type-II alveolar epithelial cells. The heightened affinity for a prevalent cellular receptor may be a factor which increases a quick transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. As an RNA virus, 2019-nCoV has the inherent feature of a high mutation rate. Due to mutations and recombination effects, different viral strains are originating with new characteristics; however because of its genome encoded exonuclease, the mutation rate might be somewhat lower than other RNA viruses. 12, 14 In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the whole genome sequence homology from the available patient data uploaded by affected countries in NCBI Virus database, identified the mutations developed by different strains from the ancestor strain and studied the impact of those mutations at functional level. Our endeavour was to categorize all the strains into major groups depending upon their lethal effect and mutations observed."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Whole genomic data retrieval from the database Retrieved the whole genome sequences from \"NCBI Virus\" database, specific input was \"SARS-CoV-2\", during a period from Jan 5 through March 24, 2020.

Thus, 13 complete whole genome sequences submitted by 13 different affected countries were taken into consideration (figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Sequence Alignment and Evolutionary Dynamics", "text": "ClustalW (version 2.1) was employed to align multiple sequences, representative of 13 countries, with the purpose (a) to understand the similarity and variation in all genomic position, (b) to establish the evolutionary relationship among the viral strains affecting the whole world and (c) finally, to distinguish the ancestry of different viral strains using FastTree tool, which is based on Neighbour joining method.\nPair-wise Sequence Alignment EMBOSS-Stretcher was used for whole genomic pair-wise alignment between the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC045512.2; submitted on 5 th Jan, 2020) with all 13 sequences.

Functional implications of each type of nucleotide variations were understood from the LODS ratio and it is calculated by the formulae log e (Obs/Exp), where 'Obs' is the observed frequency of a specific alteration in the genome and 'Exp' is the expected frequency of that specific alteration due to individual proportion of the nucleotides in the genome sequences.\nAll the mutations are screened depending upon their rarity to occur in this viral genome and A>T, G>A and T>A are found to be very rare alterations with LOD score value less than -0\u00b75 where as C>T is the most common alteration with LOD score 1\u00b781.\nVariation analysis at Protein level Different protein sequences are obtained using ORF finder and those sequences were matched with existing Orf1ab polyprotein, spike like surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein etc. to ensure prediction of in silico ORF with corresponding SARS-CoV-2 protein. Next, observed mutations were confirmed at amino acid level and identified a total of 20 Nonsynonymous (NS) and 14 Synonymous (S) mutations ( Table 2) . The analysis with different SNP annotation tools like SIFT, 16 SNAP, 17 Polyphen2, 18 MetaSNP 19 showed the functional impact of NS mutations at different level, predicting either tolerance of the mutation, or disease causing ability, or executing risk or damage, which altogether can infer the fatality rate."}, {"section_title": "Variation analysis at Protein level", "text": "To obtain the different protein sequences of the translated genome, open reading frame was generated using ORF Finder.

In case of Japan, Brazil and China, fatality rate was moderate i.e approximately 4-8% (figure 3). The number of mutations and presence of either of the very rare mutations or functionally important NS mutations or both are found to be strongly linked with the fatality rate (Table 3A-Table 3C )."}, {"section_title": "Origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains", "text": "It is extremely important to understand how the ancestral strain (S) leads to lethal strain (L) and other clusters observed according to phylogeny. Our analysis showed Ancestral strain (S) give rise to an Intermediate strain (I) with single very common mutation, a transition from C to T. From I, three different strains originate, i.e (a) Lethal strain (L), with additional mutations over I, (b) Extremely lethal strain (E) that contains very rare mutations and a (c) Non Lethal strain (N) that contains favourable mutations at surface glycoprotein, which possibly inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and favouring non-lethal outcome ( figure 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current global pandemic of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 created two epicenters first at Hubei Province in People's Republic of China and presently in Europe. SARS-CoV-2, like its close relatives SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is also pathogenic but with a higher infectivity rate. The increasing number of cases and wide spread disease raise grave concerns about the future trajectory of the pandemic and thus, a better understanding regarding the molecular divergence of viral strains and pathogenesis, is utmost important.\nThe present study attempted to categorize COVID affected countries based on molecular pathogenesis. Three important factors were considered, i.e, number of mutations during evolution, rarity of the allelic substitution and functional alteration of the non-synonymous mutations. We screened and compared extent of mutations observed in genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. All reported genome sequences of 13 affected countries have been analyzed. So far, studies indicated that there are only two strains, S, possibly the ancestral one and L, might be the lethal and more aggressive one. The distinct clusters that we observed from our phylogenetic tree construction raise the assumption of existence of many more unknown strains (figure 5). One interesting report substantiating our finding is from Shenzhen which showed possible generation of new strain which neither belongs to 'S' nor to 'L' subtype. 12 We evaluated the extent of molecular divergence by MSA and Pair-wise alignment and subsequently tried to decipher the protein alteration parallel to the mutations.\nAs a RNA virus, it was hypothesized that 2019-nCoV mutate faster than DNA virus. 12 The genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated that 2019-nCoV was closest to SARS-like coronavirus, with 96% sequence similarity. 20,21 When we evaluated the SARS-CoV (2003) and SARS-CoV-2 (2020) from Italy, sequence identity was 79.4%, suggesting new mutations, might be deleterious in later strain.\nOur first approach was to categorize the countries depending on number of mutations and type of mutation they had. It was found that similar number of mutations does not correlate well with similar extent of fatality outcome. Example, patients from Australia, Japan and Italy all show 3 mutations in the viral genome, but Australia has least fatality rate, while Italy has maximum. Again, numbers of mutations are 5 in China, 6 in India and 7 in both Sweden and Spain. The observations mentioned above strongly indicate that not the total number of mutation, but the nature of mutations finally guides the overall fatality outcome. In the case of Italy, we found three deadly mutations in 2020 (i.e. 2269 A>T, very rare allele; 11083 G>A, very rare allele and 26144 G>T) with high disease outcome but the wild counterpart of these found in 2003 did not lead to any fatality, suggesting the significance of newly evolved mutations. Although, 2269 A>T mutation does not alter amino acid (A668A), increasing number of evidences suggest that synonymous mutations could have effects on splicing, transcription, that ultimately alter the phenotype, disrupting their silence. 22 Spain is also carrying a very rare allele transversion T>A, that occurs in orf1ab gene of virus. Orf1ab gene transcribes into a polyprotein and cleaving by protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) produces several non-structural proteins, which are important for replication as well as virulence for coronavirus. Thus, an alteration in this region might alter the virulence, and associated fatality outcome.\nWe assume, while some mutations are pathogenic, some will be favorable and will undergo positive selection pressure. Herein, we tried to elucidate the possible interaction between ACE2 and spike glycoprotein. It is well established that for virus entry, spike glycoprotein (S) present on the CoV can be a neutralization antibody and it binds to its receptor followed by membrane fusion. It has been inferred that some favorable changes in viral glycoprotein may limit the increase of fatality. This kind of favorable mutation was found in some strains of COVID-19 from India, Australia and Sweden. Detailed screening depicted that Australian strain carry a rare allele transversion (T>G) which results into a NS mutation (S256R) on surface glycoprotein S1 domain which may affect the binding of hACE2 molecules, thus these strains become non-lethal to human. In this study, only one tri-nucleotide deletion at S1 domain of surface glycoprotein has been found and that is found in Indian strains along with a NS mutation (R417I) in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S1 subunit that disfavor viral entry by inhibiting hACE2 interaction.\nOn the other hand, Brazilian strain acquires four common allelic transitions, of which only two non-synonymous mutations affect protein alteration. Surprisingly, Swedish strain carry both extreme lethal (2717 G>A, very rare allele leading to G818S at Orf1ab polyprotein) and also favorable mutations (23952 T>G, rare allele leading to F806C at surface glycoprotein) and thus cumulatively lower the severity of the disease.\nIn summary, the present study reveals that the fatality rate increases with not only the number of mutations but also depending on its allelic rarity as well as functional alteration of protein. Surface glycoprotein domain is very important for host-carrier interactions and hence the mutations affecting surface glycoprotein can be one of the important mechanisms which alter the viral entry and pathogenesis. Future studies may uncover more genetic information at the molecular level as well as structural levels of the proteins, because without this knowledge it'll be difficult to identify drug target and prepare vaccine. We hope our work will help in that direction."}, {"section_title": "Author Contribution", "text": "SB, PB designed the study; SB, SD analyzed the data; SB, PB interpreted the data; SB, SD, SBh searched literatures; SD, SBh, PB wrote the manuscript; SD prepared figures; PB supervised overall study."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Interest", "text": "We declare no competing interests.
