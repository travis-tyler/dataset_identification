[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Populations along the coastline of the United States, and associated infrastructure, economic activity, and ecological resources, have long been recognized to be vulnerable to extreme tropical-cyclone events. In particular, hurricanes and storm surge may compromise the structural integrity and service functions of critical above-ground assets such as hazardous handling facilities and water treatment infrastructure. Design values for low-probability meteorological events, such as storms and high winds, are fundamental to the engineering design basis for coastal infrastructure and thus can help prepare coastal communities for extreme climate events, now and in the future. We describe in this paper how wind speed might change in the future and how to derive the engineering design basis from climate models to support risk assessment and adaptation planning. Atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs, also referred to as GCMs) simulate and quantify the response of the climate system to future emission pathways. The most useful time period to examine is approximately 30-50 years into the future to match infrastructure planning and engineering. It is known many infrastructures serve beyond their design life, making long-term climate impact even more relevant. In general, GCMs mathematically describe the atmospheric circulation of the earth system under different assumptions about radiative forcing. Four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, represent a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values. These scenarios provide time-dependent projections of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and the trajectory over time to reach the set global radiative forcing limit. RCP 2.6 assumes that global annual GHG emissions peak between 2010-2020, with emissions declining substantially thereafter, while emissions continue to rise throughout the 21 st century in RCP8.5. These RCPs represent the lower and upper bounds of the four Concentration Pathways. While GCM projections of surface wind speed can be used for risk assessment and planning at large regional scales (e.g., Schweikert et al., 2015;Rosenzweig et al., 2014), their application to specific coastal areas remains challenging because of complex climatological and hydrological variability occurring at this interface. GCM climate experiments may poorly replicate historical local observations. The use of GCM outputs are not straightforward in developing design values of wind speed (also known as design wind) for future climatic conditions. As a temporary fix to climate projection uncertainties, GCM ensembles consisting of many individual experimental runs are used to represent the climate system response to forcing under each RCP scenario; the future GHG level is largely uncertain depending on many economic factors. While this mathematical treatment helps manage projection uncertainties, it may average out or at least makes less accurate to quantify climate extremes targeted by adaptation planning efforts. These issues with GCM projections raise a series of questions such as which models to use, how to manage multi-model results in design basis development, and how to quantify future extreme conditions in model outputs. Furthermore, adaptation and risk preparedness require an accurate and site-specific design basis for wind and other atmospheric variables. The GCMs are structured on grids with a spatial resolution of ~ 1 degree, or ~125km in the midlatitudes, and therefore could miss complex climatological and hydrological variability that occurs at finer resolutions along the U.S. coastline and is necessary for regional and local decision-making. In this manuscript, we show how GCMs projections can be applied in local-scale risk assessment and planning for a coastal area at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Through quantitative analysis of historical wind data and model projections, we investigate 1) the accuracy and uncertainty of each GCM and the ensemble, 2) ways to derive design values from model simulations using weighting factors from historical observations, and 3) possible temporal changes in wind speed in the future."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources 2.1.1.

GCMs Outputs and Design Wind Calculation", "text": "Model validation is critical to assess GCM projection uncertainties relevant to future localscale risk assessments and adaptation planning and design. In this study, we compare GCM outputs against historical observations both with and without GCM data post-processing. Our focus is on the statistics of the projection outputs rather than on agreements in daily wind values. For the latter, significant differences among individual models as well as between the GCM outputs and actual observations are described in section 3.2.1. The nature of model projections makes direct comparisons of daily values (namely, using projections as a weather forecasting tool) meaningless. Therefore, the recurrence interval (RI) of design wind is the response selected for our analysis and validation of the GCM model performance to derive design values of wind speed. Table 1. List of the combinations of GCM and initial conditions investigated in this study and their availability for each scenario. Recurrence interval is a frequency statistic of random or quasi-random events, such as heavy precipitation, flooding, and earthquakes. When considering the structural design to prevent wind damage, a design wind or storm represents the possibility or chance of the occurrence of wind speeds different from speeds that occur under the mean climate state. For example, a flood that has a 100-year RI, also known as the 100-year flood, is often a design threshold for dam safety and flood protection. Wind design value varies among engineering convention and often is specific to the design objective and its risk category. For example, 50-year wind speed is used as the basic wind speed for Rick Category II infrastructure (ASCE, 2014;Simiu, 2011) Our RI calculation follows the method of Mays (2005) for both the historical observation and the GCM simulation data. For a given dataset of a time period (e.g., 30 years), wind values are rearranged in decreasing order and RI is calculated using where RI is the recurrence interval, n is the total number of measurements, and m is the ranking order. Based on the calculated RI, a second-order polynomial correlation is observed for both historical measurements and each individual GCM model output: Eqn. 2In Eq.2, is the design wind speed at a given RI; , b and c are the regression constants.

Table 2 lists the Pearson's r-value of linear correlation between individual model and the historical observation. Pearson's r-value ranges from -1.4% ~ 15.3%, -0.5% ~ 13.3%, and -3.7% ~ 11.1% at the CBBT, SP, and Kiptopeke tide gauge station, respectively. None of the individual GCM model projections are useful in weather forecasting of daily winds for the 10year validation period; however as discussed in later sections, the projections of future climate can be used as a statistical measure. One statistical property is design wind at a given RI, which is the focus of this study, as discussed below.  Figure 2 shows the linear correlation between wind speed and log(RI) for each of the three tide gauge stations. Also marked are the regression equations for each station. At the same log(RI), wind speed decreases toward the shoreline in order from the CBBT station, to the Kiptopeke Station, to the SP station. We attribute this difference to the effect of shoreline topography on wind friction. The CBBT is located in the open ocean representing an ambient condition, while the SP station is within the ports area between Hampton and Norfolk (Figure 1). Land surface apparently decreases wind speed because of the increased friction, the increased roughness of land surface, and cooler and drier land-based air. The Kiptopeke station is close to the peninsula with open ocean to the west of the coastal shoreline. Table 3 lists the parameters of the regression for wind speed at 1%, 2%, and 3% probability for each tide gauge station. The wind speeds at CBBT station are ~4 m/s higher than at the shoreline locations. \"Gust wind\", another engineering parameter, has a strong linear correlation with daily average wind speed. The R-squared value of the linear regression ranges from 92.3% to 97.2% at the three tide gauges (Table 4).

We find that the design winds derived from the GCM projections are strongly correlated with those derived from actual wind measurements. See Figure 3 for an example of the linear correlation for two individual GCM models at the CBBT location. The correlation slope is significantly greater than 1, indicating that the GCM model underestimates the design winds. For example, the linear regression for model 'IPSL-CM5A-LR r4i1p1' has a slope value of 3.5, for which the model is 28.4% of the observed value, or underestimated by 71.6%. This underestimation is prevalent and varies among all 39 GCM models we investigated. Compared with historical observations, the underestimation of individual GCM models varies from 17.7% to 71.6% at the CBBT station. For the SP station and the Kiptopeke station, the maximum underestimation reaches 69.7% and 67.3%, respectively. One model, the MPI-ESM-MR r1i1p1, stands out as the best model projection (Table 5). It slightly overestimates the wind speed trend for both the SP station and Kiptopeke station, and underestimates the trend for the CBBT station. In contrast, the IPSL-CM5A models by Institute Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) yield the largest underestimation for all three locations. These GCM experiments incorporate the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Persechino et al., 2013) and generally yield favorable model projections of climate mean state and variability in the Atlantic (Hourdin et al., 2013), which includes the Chesapeake Bay area of this study. Despite performing well at the regional scale for the entire Atlantic region, these IPSL-CM5A models did not do well for our individual tide gauge locations. Therefore, we infer from the validation results that location-specific model evaluation is critical for developing local design values in adaptation planning and implementation. This is shown in the subsequent sections. To support adaptation planning, we estimate future variation in wind speed trends under the different RCPs using the GCM projection outputs. Each individual participating model of a GCM ensemble is validated as aforementioned based on its correlation with the historical wind data. Although varying degrees of underestimations are found among individual models (Table  5), each model experiment captures the trend of wind speed changing and is highly correlated to historical observation (as seen in figures 3 and 4). To account for the difference in model performance, the weighting factor is determined using Eq.6-7 in calculating the model ensemble. The resulting weighting factors are listed in Table 6. The differences among all 39 climate experiments are made clear by comparing the weighting factors that reflect differences in model fidelity for each of the three locations. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that these weighing factors will remain unchanged for the future climate. This modeling assumption is necessary to calculate the model ensemble at each tide gauge location for each of the three future emission pathways. Worth noting is that the three tide gauge stations are located in one single GCM grid having one single climate projection dataset. Because of different wind speeds in the historical observations among these locations, the validation relationship in Eqn.4 is different. This is illustrated in Figure4 by the model MPI-ESM-EM r1i1p1. The design wind values based on historical measurements are strongly correlated with those based on the GCM model output. However, the model underestimates the wind speed for the CBBT station, and overestimates the values at the SP station. For the Kiptopeke station, the projections change from underestimation to overestimation when wind speed exceeds ~12.5 m/s. Figure 5 illustrates changes in the design value of maximum wind load with time under three RCPs using the CBBT station as an example. The design value for daily average wind speed at 1%-, 2%-, and 3%/year probability is approximately 22.7, 21.5, and 20.8 m/s respectively. These design winds also refer to 100-year, 50-year, and 30-year wind at 1%-annual-chance, 2%-annualchance, and 3%-annual-chance wind, respectively. These design values are calculated by using a"}, {"section_title": "Table 5.

Notably, these design winds show no significant temporal change in the next 60 years (Figure5). Neither is there a significant temporal change in the design wind under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, nor RCP8.5 emission pathway. The largest increase in the design value is less than 1 m/s in comparison with those based on historical observation. Nevertheless, a slight increase in the design wind of less than 1 m/s is apparent under RCP2.6. The weak trend is well within the uncertainty range (or error bar) associated with model outputs (See Figure 6 later). Although small in magnitude, the temporal change patterns across the RCPs are different. They do not strictly follow their emission trajectories. For example, RCP 2.6 assumes that global annual GHG emissions peak between 2010-2020, and then decline substantially thereafter. However, in Figure 5, the wind pattern shows the wind speed declining slightly by <1 m/s around 2050, and then increasing through the remaining period. Similarly, emission in RCP4.5 peaks around 2040, then declines, and emissions rise throughout the 21 st century in RCP8.5. These same patterns are not observed in the wind variations (Figure5).  It is important to note that these design values are bias-corrected from the raw GCM wind projections according to model performance in the 10-year validation period. However, because the weighing factors used are constant with time, the lack of temporal variation must have inherited from the GCM models themselves. While the individual GCM models differ among themselves, each one, and the ensemble average, show future wind projections that do not change much with time.."}, {"section_title": "Variation of design values of wind speed", "text": "Both baseline wind design values and how those values change over time are important to adaptation planning and design. In terms of adaptation and planning, the design basis relies not only on the future design wind at the design timeframe, but also on the trajectories of change that will take place over time. In practice, adaptation strategies and planning should consider the tradeoff among benefits, costs and risks when using a design basis. For this reason, it is important to know wind load design values, their variability, and how that variability changes over time for different emission pathways. Based on GCM projections for three RCPs, we examine how design wind speed varies with RI in the future, every 10 years up to 2100, with a 10-year, 30-year and a 50-year sliding time window, respectively. Figure 6 illustrates design value trends for RCP2.6 based on a 10-year and a 30-year sliding time window. Two observations can be made with respect to the variations of the design values. First, the largest difference in values occurs across the three locations, although the design wind speed values change little over time at each location. As discussed in section 3.1.1, the difference among stations is fairly consistent up to 4 m/s (Figure 2). This discrepancy is persistent and remains largely unchanged through the year 2070. Second, the design wind using the method of May (2005) in Eqns.1-3 is a function of data length (e.g., the time window used for analysis). The design values calculated using the 10-year and 30-year sliding time window produce similar overall patterns in design wind. However, more detailed temporal variations are revealed in the 10-year time window method. Statistically, the longer the time period of the data sample, the less the design value variations are observable through time. This data-length dependence is well known for the statistical method using Eqns.1-3."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Through the Chesapeake Bay case study, we show the possibility of deriving future design wind values through rigorous climate model validation and data application. We find that climate model outputs cannot be directly used for adaptation planning and design. All examined 39 climate experiments in CMIP5 do not replicate daily variations as a weather forecasting. They also significantly underestimate the design winds in statistical analysis. However, we have observed that the bias can be corrected using a common procedure developed in this case study. The procedure relies on GCM model validation for bias-correction and then re-calculate the wind at a given RI using a model ensemble weighting factor. We have not examined the causes for model bias for wind design value, neither the internal dynamics of GCM climate experiments. There can be multiple factors, none of which are investigated in detail during this study. One potential factor is the grid size of GCMs, for example a horizontal resolution of 1.0 o (or 125km) is large for deriving local scale design values. In the case study locations, all three gauge stations are within one GCM grid cell. However, historical measurements show significant wind variations among them. Because risk assessment and adaptation design are location-specific, the model uncertainties due to grid size should be considered. Additionally, each RCP emission pathway contains 20 to 30 GCM model runs because of the combinations of GCM models and initial conditions. Resulting complexities in model outputs are a challenge to decision makers, planners, and engineers with questions, such as which model run(s) to choose, how suitable the model simulations are for local-scale planning and risk assessment. Through this case study, we demonstrate the technique of post-processing model outputs by using a weighting factor to distinguish differences in fidelity and reliability across models."}]
