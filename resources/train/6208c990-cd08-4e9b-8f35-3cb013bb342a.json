Sample surveys-cross-sectional or longitudinal surveys of a subpopulation of individuals-on precollege experiences and preparation, postsecondary enrollment and persistence, and workforce transitions are relevant to across federal agencies, many of which rely on these data to inform policy and planning decisions. The National Postsecondary Education Cooperative -Sample Surveys (NPEC-S) commissioned this paper to provide a holistic view of the policy questions guiding existing federally funded sample surveys on postsecondary activity, assess where their survey components align and vary, and determine whether they overlook some aspects and outcomes of the postsecondary education experience. Although the research and policy literatures include a wide range of publications examining the breadth and depth of postsecondary data available at the federal and state levels, there is very little research specifically focusing on the purposes and uses of federal sample surveys, particularly those housed with agencies other than the U.S. Department of Education. For example, the National Academy of Education (NAEd) has released several papers on National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) longitudinal surveys that examine how student data can be obtained and how these existing surveys could be augmented to include additional subgroups and research goals (e.g., Dynarski 2014; Espelege 2014; Gamoran 2016). 1 In addition to NAEd's research, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Interagency Working Group (WHIAAPI) has examined best practices for conducting federal surveys, including surveys on educational attainment, but this research is not specific to federal sample survey practices (WHIAAPI 2016). Similarly, the Institute for Higher Education Policy's (IHEP) Postsecondary Data Collaborative has produced reports examining ways to use and improve the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and Federal Student Aid collections (Rorison and Voight 2016;Soldner and Campbell 2016), as well as strengthening statewide student unit record systems (Armstrong and Zaback 2016;Miller 2016) and employment data (Zinn 2016). None of the existing literature has addressed how federal sample surveys outside of the U.S. Department of Education contribute to our understanding of the postsecondary landscape."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH QUESTIONS", "text": "This report adds to the existing postsecondary data literature by examining efforts of existing federal sample surveys with education components, the policy questions they address or overlook, and in what ways they overlap or vary in purpose and data collected.

Are there important gaps in federal sample survey data with regard to addressing the key policy areas?"}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "The authors began by identifying all of the federally funded sample surveys that target students enrolled at postsecondary institutions or included postsecondary education-related items, such as sample surveys that follow cohorts of secondary school students over time (e.g., the Education Longitudinal Survey of 2002 [ELS:2002] and High School and Beyond Longitudinal Study [HS&B]) or surveys of individuals living in the United States (e.g., the American Community Survey [ACS] and the American Time Use Survey [ATUS]). This selection process resulted in 18 sample surveys spanning four federal entities: the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census). Following a more detailed review of each survey, four sample surveys were excluded from further analysis because they were no longer in active collection: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), 2 the National Longitudinal Surveys of Mature and Young Women, the National Longitudinal Surveys of Older and Young Men, and NSF's National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG). NCES' Postsecondary Education Transcript Studies (PETS) collection was also excluded because it provides supplementary transcript data to five sample surveys (B&B, BPS, ELS:2002, HS&B, andthe National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 [NELS:88]). Though not treated as a separate survey, information from the PETS collection are discussed throughout the report. However, sample surveys that follow several cohorts of students over time (e.g., the Baccalaureate & Beyond Longitudinal Survey [B&B] and Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Survey [BPS]) were included because they provide a rich source of comparison data, even if data were no longer being collected for one or more cohorts. 3 The final set of 15 sample surveys were each reviewed for purpose, population, periodicity, and content (figure 1). For surveys that had multiple components (see appendix A, figure A1), the initial student questionnaire was reviewed and coded, as well as all subsequent follow-up student questionnaires (where applicable). As expected, half of these surveys are administered by NCES (n=7). Five surveys targeted individuals who had enrolled in, or had recently completed, undergraduate or graduate postsecondary education, while the remaining surveys focused primarily on elementary or secondary school students (n=6) or the general resident population of the United States (n=4), including postsecondary students or those who had participated in postsecondary education. Given that this study focused specifically on sample surveys, federal postsecondary surveys that collect data on a universe of students, such as the student enrollment and completion data collected at the institution-level as part of IPEDS 4 and the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), were excluded from this analysis. Likewise, this study did not include non-federal postsecondary sample or Census surveys, such as the Community College Survey of Student Engagement, the National Survey of Student Engagement, the College Board's Admitted Student Questionnaire (ASQ) and ASQ PLUS, and the University of California, Los Angeles' Cooperative Institutional Research Program Freshman Survey, among others-many of which are fee-for-service."}, {"section_title": "POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION SURVEY LANDSCAPE", "text": "4 IPEDS is a series of interrelated repeating cross-sectional surveys that collect data on student enrollment, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid from all postsecondary institutions that participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs, as required by the Higher Education Act of 1965.

SOURCE: Survey purpose, periodicity, and base population were identified through a review of survey websites and documentation. Complete citations listed in \"Survey Sources\" section. All of the postsecondary-related sample surveys include items on demographics, college enrollment, and employment (table 4). 6 Moreover, almost all of these surveys include items on precollege experiences, college experiences, and financial aid, although some are more extensive than others. This finding is not unexpected, as the NCES postsecondary-related sample surveys follow students as they move into and through higher education institutions, as do BLS' NLSY surveys.  From a historical perspective, the key policy questions guiding these sample surveys reflect the political realities of their times. However, these realities often are not explicitly stated and must be inferred from their articulated purposes and with consideration to their historical contexts. In the post-World War II years, concerns about the U.S. contribution to scientific advancement led to the passage of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, which created the NSF as the federal agency dedicated to support research and education in all science-related disciplines. To fulfill this mandate, the NSF began administering a census of all individuals receiving research doctoral degrees in 1957 from postsecondary institutions in the United States (the SED). Five years after the first SED administration, and at the height of Cold War tensions over technological and military power, the NSF implemented its longitudinal biennial sample survey of the nation's college graduates, with a special focus on science and engineering degree holders (the NSCG). 7 The NSCG targets individuals who have at least a bachelor's degree and tracks their educational and employment outcomes until they age out at 76 years old. With scientific and technological advancement still a pressing concern throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the NSF began administering a second longitudinal biennial sample survey of individuals with research doctoral degrees in an SEH-related field in 1973 (the SDR). 8 The four postsecondary NCES sample surveys also reflect the concerns and values of their times. NPSAS, the first of NCES' postsecondary sample surveys, was first administered in 1986 as a way to understand the rapid expansion of student financial aid and college costs. Between the 1980-81 and 1985-86 academic years, college costs increased 26 percent at public 4-and 2-year colleges and 30 percent at private, not-for-profit institutions (The College Board 2015). NPSAS' nationally representative cross-sectional sample of all students enrolled at Title IV institutions was designed to inform public policy on federal financial aid programs and understand how students and families were financing higher education. The BPS and B&B sample surveys, which both began in the early 1990s, reflect a rising interest in postsecondary persistence and completion (BPS) over access alone, and a shift toward documenting the \"value\" of a college education by examining the relationship between degree completion and employment outcomes (B&B). The PETS collection, while not a sample survey in itself, has augmented the analytical capacity of NCES' sample surveys since 1984 and has allowed researchers to understand the relationship between students' coursetaking patterns and, depending on the survey, choice of major, persistence, completion, occupation, and income. Like the postsecondary sample surveys, the postsecondary-related sample surveys were each developed with a specific purpose in mind. The sample surveys administered by BLS and Census speak to the ongoing need to document the social, educational, and occupational well-being of United States residents and communities primarily for policymaking purposes. CPS is the oldest survey on the characteristics of households in the United States. Developed by Census toward the end of the Great Depression, when unemployment was at an all-time high, CPS is the nation's primary source of labor force statistics and is used by local, state, and federal policymakers and planners, as well as researchers. 9 SIPP was developed in the early 1980s to complement CPS and collect more focused, longitudinal data on income, benefits, and federal program participation. ACS, the annual sample survey \"long form\" version of the decennial Census and now the largest household survey, has provided data on communities, households, and individuals since 2000 based on collections that start with sampling households and then collecting information about all household members. These data are used by policymakers to allocate and distribute federal funding, as well as by researchers, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and journalists, among others. Similarly, the NLSY sample surveys, first developed by BLS in the late 1970s, also document labor market and life activities. Like SIPP, each NSLY survey follows a continuous panel of participants over time. While SIPP participants can be any individual 15 years of age or older, the NLSY:79 survey consists of a cohort of individuals aged 14 to 22 at the start of the survey in order to capture the generational and social changes occurring across the United States during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as well as changes in individuals' educational and employment activities over time. The four remaining postsecondary-related sample surveys are part of the Secondary Longitudinal Studies Program (SLSP) administered by NCES that target nationally representative samples of secondary school students. HS&B collected longitudinal data on two cohorts of students (10 th and 12 th graders) between 1980 and 1992. The survey, which focused on understanding how students' social capital (e.g., social relationships and networks, reflected in HS&B items asking about cognitive and noncognitive learning, student and peer aspirations, family support) developed into human capital (e.g., skills and knowledge, reflected in HS&B items as educational attainment, employment, income), was unique in that it captured the experiences of the first post-Civil Rights generation during a time when there were dramatic economic changes and occupational instability. NELS:88 was administered to a nationally representative sample of 8th grade students during a climate of growing concern over school quality brought to the forefront by the release of A Nation at Risk (1983). This survey also collected data on student learning and educational/occupational aspirations, as well as predictors of dropping out. In the years leading up to the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, concern over school quality had expanded to address achievement gaps through increased accountability and school choice. Consistent with this focus on outcomes, the ELS data collection, which began in 2002 with a nationally representative sample of 10th graders, sought to understand students' pathways through high school, into and through higher education, and into the labor market. HSLS:09, the most recent NELS sample survey, collects data about a nationally representative sample of 9th graders about their educational pathways on high school students' pathways and persistence, and their math and science participation and experiences, which reflects the current political emphasis on math and science education to support the STEM/SEH occupational pipeline. As expected, survey items reflect the purpose of each survey (figure 3). For example, HS&B, which was developed specifically to explore students' social capital, includes items on volunteer activities, parents' highest level of education and occupation, and social networks and peer group perceptions.   \u2022Financial Aid: Through the end of the 2011-2012 school year, how much will you have borrowed in student loans for your entire college or vocational education? \u2022College Costs: Please indicate whether the following were reasons why you did not apply for financial aid.

Survey items were grouped into six major themes: major life transitions (high school to college and college to the workforce); postsecondary access and persistence; coursetaking patterns; educational attainment; participation in government programs; and, educational return on investment, occupation, and labor market participation. As expected, the Census and BLS surveys are more likely to focus on issues of employment and income, while the NCES surveys focus on issues of access, persistence, and outcomes. The majority of surveys address issues of educational return on investment, employment, and income. The second most common policy areas are major life transitionsfrom high school to college and/or college into the workforce-and postsecondary access and attainment. Five surveys focus on documenting participation in government programs, such as NPSAS (financial aid programs) and SIPP (social programs). Three surveys, all sponsored by NCES, identify documenting coursetaking patterns as a key area of concentration using transcript data collected by PETS. "}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SURVEY CONTENT", "text": "The sample survey questionnaires and documentation were reviewed for their components, or types of survey items included. As discussed above, the survey items were organized into the following thematic categories: Demographics, Pre-college Experiences, College Enrollment, College Experiences, Financial Aid, Employment, and Other Post-Graduate Experiences. These categories served as the basis for analyzing the survey components and identifying areas of alignment and variation. It should be noted that B&B and BPS both draw their cohorts from NPSAS, and as such some survey components are not included in the B&B and BPS survey documentation but are included in the B&B and BPS datasets. For example, the B&B survey instrument does not collect age, gender, or race/ethnicity; these items are pulled from the NPSAS dataset. The analysis below accounts for the components collected by the surveys themselves as well as components available through NPSAS and available in the final survey dataset (as reported on the NCES DataLab website)."}, {"section_title": "DEMOGRAPHICS", "text": "The demographic information collected across the surveys provides data on the characteristics of individuals, their spouses, and their parents and families. In terms of individual demographic characteristics, all of the sample surveys collected some form of demographic data (appendix A, table A1). Interestingly, the most common individual demographics item asked by all of the sample surveys was age and number of dependents. As expected, other common individual demographic items include gender, marital status, military status, and race/ethnicity. Twelve surveys also collect name and address from survey respondents, and 11 collect information on language spoken at home (other than English). In addition to these more standard demographic items, eight surveys ask about receipt of public assistance (ELS:2002, HS&B, HSLS:09, NELS:88, NLSY79, NLSY97, ACS, SIPP), four ask about (self-reported) voter participation/registration (B&B, ELS:2002, HS&B, NELS:88, NLSY:97), and two ask for a self-rating on physical and mental health (BPS, NPSAS). Almost all of the sample surveys include items about the demographic characteristics of spouses and parents/families, such as spouse's income, parent's occupation, and spouse's and parents' highest level of education. Of the seven surveys that ask about spouse's income, almost all are NCES surveys (B&B, BPS, ELS:2002, HS&B, HSLS:09, NPSAS, NLSY:97). All of the NCES surveys ask about parents' highest level of education, with NPSAS collecting the most information about parent demographics. In terms of the breadth of demographic data collected, the NCES sample surveys collected the most demographic items, followed by NLSY79 and NLSY97 surveys, and Census surveys. Given that many of the NCES surveys were developed to understand students' pathways into and through higher education, with several designed specifically to unpack the connections between students' schooling and family experiences on outcomes (e.g., ELS:2002, HS&B, NELS:88, NPSAS), and that the BLS and Census surveys are designed to provide insight into employment and life conditions, it is not surprising that these surveys ask the widest range of demographic questions."}, {"section_title": "PRE-COLLEGE EXPERIENCES", "text": "Pre-college components fell into two groups -items about high school experiences (e.g., coursework, use of resources, attitude) and items about college entrance (e.g., ACT/SAT participation, college enrollment plans). In terms of high school experiences, almost all of the sample surveys collected information on high school diploma type and date earned (appendix A, table A2). The next most common components, collected by less than one-third of the surveys, were high school grade point average, high school course of study (e.g., Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, highest math class taken), and attitudes towards school. College entrance items were collected by more than half of the sample surveys, with the most common item being self-reported college test scores (ACT, SAT, placement exams). Almost all of the NCES sample surveys collected these items (B&B, BPS Of all the sample surveys reviewed -ELS:2002, NELS:88, and NCES' newest sample survey HSLS:09 -collect the widest selection of precollege components. NELS:88, for example, asks students about their plans for the first year after high school and the likelihood of attending college after high school. ELS:2002's pre-college items include questions about academic recognition, the importance of grades, and students' use of high school computer and library resources, while HSLS:09 asks students about their math and science self-image and experience while in high school, anticipated college entry requirements and costs, and whether they sought information about college options. These items reflect these surveys' focus on understanding students' high school-to-college and college-to-career transitions, and the high school students' math and science experiences and outcomes."}, {"section_title": "COLLEGE ENROLLMENT", "text": "Again, as expected, the majority of college enrollment survey components are collected by NCES sample surveys (appendix A, table A3). These components fell into four different categories: college planning activities, college enrollment activities, degree information, and vocational/technical/business/trade education. College planning activities were primarily collected in NCES' high school longitudinal studies, with ELS:2002, HS&B, HSLS:09, and NELS:88 collecting the most college planning items. The most common item across the surveys, collected by all NCES surveys and half of all sample surveys included in this review, is highest level of education expected to complete. NLSY was the only BLS survey to include pre-enrollment items (ever attended college, number of schools accepted, and number of schools applied to). The Census surveys included no pre-enrollment items. In terms of college enrollment experiences, all of the sample surveys collect information on current enrollment status (enrolled/not enrolled), and almost all collect information on enrollment intensity (full-/part-time), followed by field of study, type of degree sought, and institution information. Unlike college planning activities, almost all of the surveys collected at least several items on enrollment experiences (except B&B). Again, the NCES surveys collected the most items in this area, augmented by the PETS collection of student transcript data. Degree completion information was also widely collected by almost all of the surveys, except ATUS, with the NCES sample surveys acquiring most of their data through the PETS collection. The NSCG survey also collected a number of degree components, such as institution from which the degree was received and number of degrees received, as well as the SDR. Like college enrollment activities, the NLSY79 and NLSY97 surveys included a several survey items on degree completion, degree type, highest degree received, and date of receipt. This is perhaps expected given their focus on tracking the relationship between higher educational attainment and the labor market."}, {"section_title": "COLLEGE EXPERIENCES", "text": "Students' college experiences were again addressed primarily in the NCES sample surveys, with some components collected by NLSY97 (although these items are self-reported; appendix A, table A4). College experience components grouped into two categories: items on students' college coursework and items on their general college experience. The majority of coursework items were collected by the NCES surveys and provide information on number of courses taken (remedial and college-level, subject area), number of repeated courses, number of withdrawn courses, and average number of credits earned per year, among others. Survey items asking about general college experiences were fairly diverse, with little redundancy across sample surveys. That said, the most commonly collected items were related to GPA and stopout periods. Five surveys (BPS, ELS:2002, HSLS:09, NELS:88, and NPSAS) also ask whether the student receives family support for postsecondary education. NPSAS collects the broadest range of college experience data, such as use and importance of college services, social and academic integration, the importance of nonmonetary benefits of education, and commute time. In terms of unique items collected, B&B is the only survey that asks about satisfaction with undergraduate major and quality of education received, and ELS:2002 asked about the value of undergraduate education in preparation for the future."}, {"section_title": "FINANCIAL AID", "text": "Given concerns over higher education affordability and student debt, it is perhaps not surprising that almost all of the sample surveys collect some data on student financial aid (appendix A, table A5). Financial aid items were grouped into the following categories: college cost and financial aid application, paying for college, and educational debt. Most of the items focused on understanding how students pay for college. Again, almost all of the college cost components were collected by the NCES surveys, with several components also collected by the NLSY surveys. The most common component were items on tuition, fees, and cost of attendance, whether students applied for and received financial aid, and if they were paying instate or out-of-state tuition. The majority of financial aid items sought to understand how students were paying for college, including federal loans/amount, scholarships/grants, and work study. The rest of the items in this category were focused on documenting the aid applied for and received from various sources, and aid amounts. In terms of the breadth of financial aid data collected, HS&B, BPS, NLSY97, ELS:2002, and NSCG collect the most items in this category. Interestingly, NSCG and SIPP collect a substantial amount of information on student loans, financial aid award, work study, employer aid, and other sources of financial support. As with college cost data, fewer surveys collected data on educational debt. The most common component asked about was total amount borrowed. NPSAS was the only survey to collect data on debt aversion (ways to avoid taking out additional loans), which is also available on the B&B and BPS surveys, and B&B was the only survey to again collect data on students' level of stress due to education-related debt and private student loan details."}, {"section_title": "EMPLOYMENT", "text": "Employment components were organized into items on current employment, items on expected employment, and items for current and prospective teachers (appendix A, table A6). All of the sample surveys collect data on employment, with one survey (B&B) including additional items on the employment aspirations and experiences of teachers. The most common employment data collected are students' employment status and current earnings, followed by hours worked per week, occupation, sector of employment, job responsibilities, and employment history and industry. Except for benefits, a minority of the surveys collected data on the remaining employment components, with several items collected only by SDR or NSCG, such as whether the position was federally funded, reason not employed, if the job includes participation in conferences and other professional meetings, and whether the position is a postdoctoral fellowship.. Of the NCES surveys, B&B, BPS, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 collected the most employment-related items overall. The B&B and BPS surveys include items such as employment decision-making, hours worked per week while in college, and reasons for working and not working while in college. The ELS:2002 and NELS:88 collections, which were designed to follow students over time and document their postsecondary and workforce transitions, collect information on students' industry of employment, hours worked per week, and job alignment with college major, among others, are consistent with the purpose of these surveys. Likewise, the NSF surveys were designed to collect occupational data on college graduates and SEH doctoral degree recipients, and it makes sense that they would include a substantial number of employment items. As mentioned above, B&B includes supplementary items targeting students who are current or prospective teachers. Understanding school and teacher quality has been a concern of policymakers, researchers, and the public since the 1980s, and these items provide data on the number of prospective and current teachers, certification attainment, their satisfaction with the profession, TEACH grant and other teaching-related loan forgiveness, and, where applicable, their reasons for leaving teaching. While B&B collects the vast majority of teacher-related items, both NSCG and SDR ask respondents whether they are current/prospective teachers."}, {"section_title": "OTHER POST-GRADUATE COMPONENTS", "text": "Six surveys (B&B, BPS, CPS, HS&B, NPSAS, and NSCG) include items related to post-graduate education-that is, subsequent postsecondary education activities, such as preparing for and matriculating into a graduate degree program and financing graduate education (appendix A, table A7). The post-graduate data have been organized into three categories: post-graduate enrollment, post-graduate financial aid, and employment. As expected, the survey with the greatest number of post-graduate components is B&B, as the sample includes baccalaureate recipients only and their post-degree activities. HS&B also collects significantly more data than the remaining surveys, but much of this data is specific to Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. Five of the six surveys collect some type of data on post-baccalaureate enrollment. The most common data collected are graduate school enrollment information (status, intensity, degree type, etc.), completion of graduate-level courses after completing a Bachelor's degree, application for post-graduate education, and completion of graduate entrance exams such as the GRE and MCAT. Four of the six surveys that collect post-graduate information collect graduate education financial aid data. The most common data collected include total amount borrowed, amount of graduate loans still owed, assistantships and fellowships awarded, and tuition waiver receipt.. Three surveys (B&B, BPS, and NPSAS) collect data on employment and the hours worked per week while in graduate school."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SURVEY STAKEHOLDERS", "text": "A review of the sample survey websites and documentation indicates that the primary stakeholders for these surveys, as articulated in these materials, are researchers, governmental agencies, and federal and state policymakers. All of the surveys were designed to collect data that can be used to describe students' and individuals' life experiences, and inform public policy and decision-making (appendix A, table A8). Some sample surveys explicitly referenced their use by educators (B&B, ELS:2002, HS&B, NELS:88, and ACS), and others mention their use by the general public (ELS:2002, NLSY79, NLSY97, ACS, and CPS). The Census surveys-ACS, CPS, and to a lesser extent SIPP-are intended to serve a wider audience including journalists, businesses, and emergency planners. This is reflected in the breadth of non-postsecondary data they collect, such as information on home ownership, labor force status and related occupational items (e.g., income, commute), utilities, and taxes. Beyond the stakeholders cited in the survey documentation and on the survey websites, many of these surveys are likely intended to be used by most -if not all -of the stakeholders listed below. For instance, NCES developed on-line tools to help the public, journalists, and other groups directly access and use the data, and NCES staff regularly field questions from a wide variety of stakeholders for information."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY OF FINDINGS", "text": "The final section of this report summarizes and reflects on key findings in order to identify possible gaps in federal sample survey data collections, and offers suggestions on how these surveys can be better used by federal agencies and researchers. Research Question #4-Are there important gaps in federal sample survey data with regard to addressing the key policy areas? NCES' suite of sample surveys offers the most comprehensive data on postsecondary access, enrollment, financial aid, persistence, and attainment. Sample surveys funded by other federal agencies were developed to primarily provide broader statistics on overall well-being in a variety of areas, with the BLS and Census surveys mostly concerned with workforce development, and the NSF surveys focused with individuals in SEH occupations. That said, taken together, the federally funded sample surveys reviewed in this report cover most aspects of individuals' schooling and occupational experiences-but not in one survey alone. The following sections explore to what extent there are gaps in periodicity, base populations, the breadth and depth of the data collected, and key policy areas addressed."}, {"section_title": "PERIODICITY", "text": "In terms of frequency of data collection, the majority of the sample surveys are collected on an annual or biennial basis (figure 5). The sample surveys administered by BLS, Census, and the NSF are collected more frequently-often on a monthly, annual, or biennial basis. Given the primary purpose of the BLS and Census surveys, to provide statistics that policymakers and businesses can readily act on, it makes sense that they would be conducted at relatively short, regular intervals. Almost all of the NCES surveys, on the other hand, are administered at variable intervals, likely because they are examining educational processes and transitions. The one exception to this is NPSAS, which collects data every four years, and, by implication, B&B and BPS, as the populations for these surveys are derived from alternating NPSAS collections. Annual or biennial collections of educational outcomes are perhaps less crucial than documenting changes in unemployment or shifts in demographics, especially considering that the Census and BPS surveys are consulted before annual distributions of federal funds. Policymakers and researchers who are looking for interim, repeating cross-sectional data on whether individuals are enrolled at a college can use existing surveys, such as IPEDS, or the ATUS and SIPP surveys. However, IPEDS, which offers the most comprehensive enrollment information, only provides institution-level aggregate student information, while ATUS and SIPP report only general enrollment information (i.e., currently enrolled at a college -yes/no). The sample surveys with the richest postsecondary data, however, are those that are cohort-based and collected over multiple years. Figure 5. Periodicity of federally funded postsecondary/postsecondary-related sample surveys 1 CPS is conducted monthly, but supplemental surveys are conducted annually or biennially. 2 ACS is collected monthly but reported annually 3 NSCG has been collected roughly decennially (1993,2003,2010), as well as biennially/triennially between 1990-99 and 2000-09. 4 NPSAS was collected triennially until 1995-96 and quadrennially since 1999-2000.

Complete citations listed in \"Survey Sources\" section."}, {"section_title": "POPULATION", "text": "The sample survey's base populations clearly reflect the aims and missions of their sponsoring agencies (figure 6). Almost all of the Census and BLS surveys sample individuals 15 years or older, 10 and the NCES surveys sample middle, high, undergraduate, and graduate school students. The two NLSY surveys are the only exceptions, as their samples specifically target youth who are between 14 and 22 (NLSY:79) and 12 to 17 (NLSY:97) years of age. The NSF surveys are focused on college graduates and students who have recently completed an SEH doctoral degree. In terms of gaps, NELS:88 and the NLSY collections are the only longitudinal collections that include data about students prior to high school, limiting our ability to study how earlier educational experiences relate to postsecondary access and outcomes. The ACS and CPS collections also include data about younger populations, but because they are crosssectional, early education experiences they collect cannot readily be associated with postsecondary experiences. Figure 6. Base population of federally funded postsecondary/postsecondary-related sample surveys NOTE: PETS is collected as part of seven different NCES cohort-based surveys. SOURCE: Base populations were identified through a review of survey websites and documentation. Complete citations listed in \"Survey Sources\" section. All of the sample surveys have historically presented gender as a binary measure (female/male), which forced students with nonbinary gender identities to choose a gender category or not include a response. The surveys also do not collect information on students' sexual orientation or undocumented status-two student characteristics that, while comprising a small percentage of college-going students, are understudied. Likewise, many of the sample surveys collect disability status (yes/no) and four sample surveys-B&B, BPS, HSLS:09, and NPSAS-include items that ask students to identify type of disability and other disability-related details. The challenge with collecting information on these special student populations is that the samples tend not to be sufficiently large enough to allow for disaggregated analysis of the data. While small adjustments to existing sample surveys could be made to collect additional items pertaining to these populations, conducting special supplementary collections would improve the sample power and allow policymakers and researchers to understand the college-going experiences and outcomes of students with these characteristics. That said, these populations are quite small relative to all postsecondary students and identifying participants will likely pose a significant challenge. "}, {"section_title": "BREADTH AND DEPTH OF DATA COLLECTED", "text": "The number of federally funded sample surveys that collect postsecondary data has increased over time (see figure 2). CPS, as the longest running sample survey, is a good resource for documenting general changes in postsecondary attainment over time, although the breadth and depth of the data available is limited to basic statistics on enrollment status, intensity, and major. NSCG, the second longest running sample survey, offers a wider range of data on college graduates, such as information on financial aid receipt and student loans, and has the advantage of periodically tracking a subset of respondents and their educational attainment and occupational status over time. Consistent with its mission, NCES has developed the richest source of sample survey data on postsecondary access and attainment over the past three decades. While these surveys offer insight into high school coursework and enrollment, college access and enrollment, financial aid receipt and student loans, they do not unpack students' occupational choices and decisionmaking processes, job responsibilities and satisfaction, civic engagement, and other elements that contribute to an individual's overall well-being. The NLSY79 and NLSY97 collections, which are designed to collect statistical information on significant life events over time, do collect these kinds of data, such as perceptions of autonomy and parental authority, physical and mental health, and community and political participation. They also collect data on postsecondary enrollment and attainment, but have limited financial aid data. The SDR, which is limited to SEH doctoral recipients, also collects some occupational measures for NSFmeasures that are not currently collected by NCES surveys (e.g., employment satisfaction) or other federally funded sample surveys."}, {"section_title": "POLICY AREAS ADDRESSED", "text": "The sample surveys reviewed in this report were each designed to respond to the needs of their sponsoring agency and were developed to collect information relevant to the policy contexts that inspired their first administration. The postsecondary sample surveys focus primarily on understanding college access, outcomes, and transition to the workforce, while the postsecondary-related sample surveys emphasize high school experiences and outcomes or broader demographic, social, and economic trends. Key policy areas that are still relevant to our current postsecondary context are concerns over equitable access to higher education, rising college costs and student borrowing, the value of a college education in the labor market, and STEM education. All of the surveys, to varying extents, collect data that documents students as they move through undergraduate education and into graduate education or employment. Figure 7 illustrates which federally funded sample surveys may be most useful to respond to these key policy questions. While many of the key postsecondary policy questions can be addressed using the postsecondary and postsecondary-related sample surveys reviewed in this report, there are several other key policy areas that are underexplored: \u2022 COLLEGE CHOICE AND SATISFACTION: Being able to exercise educational choice is an increasingly valued part of the schooling experience. Four of the surveys reviewed ask students to identify their reason for postsecondary enrollment. Although ELS:2002 and NELS:88 ask students about their college decision-making factors, only NCES' newest sample survey effort-HSLS:09-examines how students make decisions about which college to attend and who among their support networks helps them through the decision-making process (e.g., school counselor, peers, family). Likewise, only one survey, B&B, asks students about their satisfaction with their undergraduate major/program of study. Additional items that address course, program, and college satisfaction could be used to better understand the college student experience. \u2022 ALTERNATIVE CREDENTIALS AND CREDENTIAL PATHWAYS: The number of individuals receiving a higher education certificate of completion has increased dramatically over the past several decades (Carnevale, Rose, and Hanson 2012;Miller, Erwin, Richardson and Arntz, 2016). With the pressure to increase college attainment rates, national reports have increasingly called on U.S. institutions to focus on certificates as a way to quickly accomplish this goal while also meeting workforce demands for job-specific skill sets (Complete College America 2010, Lumina Foundation 2016). To better understand the  (GEMEnA), which works to develop and validate national measures of education and training participation, certification, and licensure related to employment to be used in federal data collections. 11 Since its first meeting in 2009, GEMEnA has validated four survey items addressing whether the individual has attained a certification or license, the organization or institution that provided it, the certification/license subject area, and whether it is related to the individual's current employment. These items have been integrated into the B&B, BPS, CPS, ELS:2002, and HSLS:09, among several others. While these items expand what is known about certification and licensing, additional data could be collected on more non-traditional, but increasingly popular, alternative credential pathways, such as competency-based education, microdegrees, and badges. \u2022 COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS: Students at all educational levels are increasingly expected to be able to successfully transition into higher learning and the workforce in order to have the skills needed to complete in the global marketplace. While there is no set definition for \"college and career readiness,\" states and the federal government have invested in preparing students of all races, ethnicities, genders, disabilities, and socioeconomic statuses for postsecondary education and gainful employment through the development and improvement of state standards (EdTrust, 2014; National Forum on Education Statistics, 2015; U.S. Department of Education, n.d.). While many of the postsecondary sample surveys reviewed collect information on dual enrollment, college entrance exams (e.g., ACT, SAT), developmental education referral and/or coursetaking, few collect data on industry-recognized credentials or certifications, career pathway program participation, professional mentorship, or the \"soft skills\" that are also important to college and career success (e.g., social and emotional disposition, employment attendance, disciplinary actions). In addition to adding survey items that capture students' workplace experiences, current survey collections could be supplemented with data from the Federal Employment Data Exchange System (FEDES), the Wage Record Interchange System (WRIS), and/or the Internal Revenue Service, which would offer a more complete and reliable look at earnings over time, occupational details (e.g., number of jobs, industry), and employment mobility. 12 While some of these data sources may already be available and linked to educational records through state longitudinal data systems, ensuring student privacy and data quality make accessing these data a challenge. \u2022 EMPLOYMENT CHOICE AND SATISFACTION: Gainful employment and steady income are important post-college outcomes, but few studies collect data documenting employment choice and decision-making processes, and employment satisfaction. Seven surveys, including both NLSY and NSF surveys, collect data on employment satisfaction, and four surveys collect data on employment decision-making. Given the importance of college completion, policymakers and researchers would benefit from understanding whether the degrees received are providing individuals with both gainful and meaningful employment. \u2022 CIVIC EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT: While a number of the surveys collect information on volunteer activities/community service (ATUS, B&B, ELS:2002, HS&B, NELS:88, NLSY97) and voting record (ELS:2002, HS&B, NELS:88, NLSY97), additional data on civic education and participation-both at the college and post-college levels-could enhance our understanding of how education contributes to the on-going development of a strong democratic society. The bipartisan Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, authorized under the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2016 through the sponsorship of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), 13 is charged with examining the breadth, depth, and strength of current federal data collections, infrastructure, and privacy in order to improve federal programs and tax expenditures. The Commission's report, to be released at the end of 2017, will make recommendations regarding whether federal program and survey data should be housed under a shared clearinghouse and who should access the data. With this in mind, the federally-funded sample surveys examined in this paper could be made more immediately useful to policymakers, researchers, and other postsecondary stakeholders if they were housed under a common website. Much like the NCES DataLab website, 14 which allows users to locate relevant surveys by filtering for topic, a cross-agency tool that allowed users to sort through all federal surveys based on key attributes, such as population, design (e.g., longitudinal, crosssectional, cohort), and topics addressed, would improve the transparency of which postsecondary data are available at the federal level. This kind of shared resource would involve interagency cooperation that may lead to more integrated survey efforts in the future. Figure A1.
