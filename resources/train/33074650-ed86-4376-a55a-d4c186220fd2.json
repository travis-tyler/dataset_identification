There are many possible reasons for this variation, ranging from the resources given to the educational system, the practices followed, differences in family backgrounds of students, and differences in learning resources outside of the formal educational system. Outcomes also vary greatly within countries, producing a performance. We use an internationally comparable data set that includes a very large number of developed and developing countries and a sufficiently large number of students per country. This allows us to estimate country-specific associations between background and educational test scores. The chapter thus sheds light on the international variation in the importance of socioeconomic status in affecting the quality of educational outcomes.\nSince students in 150 schools in each country in each year, which gave us a sample of 246,102 eighthgrade students. While our analysis deals solely with the eighth-grade mathematics test, we also examined the science tests for eighth-graders and the mathematics and science test scores for fourth-grade students. We found similar patterns to those that we report here.\n3 Table 1 \nwhere T ics is the test score of student i, in class c and school s; X ics is a vector of family-background variables; and G is a 0/1 dummy for being female. Our measures of advantaged homes are the following: the presence of books at home, which is positively correlated with the socioeconomic status of the family (Beaton et al. 1996) and an important predictor of students' performance (Woessmann 2003 (Woessmann , 2004 ; dummy variables for the highest level of schooling by either of a student's parents; 6 and dummy variables for whether the student was an immigrant or native and whether the student's parent was or was not an immigrant.\nWe estimate equation 1 for the entire population of students in the sample using ordinary least squares. 7 Columns 1 and 4 in table 2 give the estimated coefficients on the relation of background factors to the test scores for the two years. In 2007 the coefficient on female is not statistically different from zero; that on being born in the country is positive significant; while the positive coefficients on the measures of books in the household and parental education show substantial advantages to a more privileged background on outcomes. 8 To see whether family background affects students differently at different points in the conditional distribution of achievement, we also estimated equation 1 with quantile regressions. Columns 2 and 5 and columns 3 and 6 give the estimated coefficients for quantile regressions for persons at the 5th and 95th percentiles. If the effects of a variable that improves outcomes are greater at the 95th percentile than at the 5th percentile, that raises inequality, while the converse holds if the effects of a variable are greater at the 5th percentile than at the 95th percentile. Specifically, in both years the coefficient of books at home at both 5th and 95th percentiles is larger for higher levels of parents' education and a greater number of books at home. Moreover, if we focus on the coefficient of parents' university education and books at home (200 and above), the larger coefficient at the 95th than at the 5th percentile 6 This dummy variable has been constructed from the variable available in TIMSS: \"Parents' highest education level\"\n(which takes the following categories: university degree; completed postsecondary education but not university; completed upper-secondary education; completed lower-secondary education; less than lower-secondary education; do not know). 7 To address missing data and not to exclude observations, we estimated missing values by means of a multiple imputation technique in King et al. (2001) : the multivariate imputation by chained equations (Van Buuren and Oudshoorn 1999, \"MICE\" method in STATA). This imputes missing variables from an iterative multivariable switchingregression technique. We created five imputed data sets and averaged regression coefficients over the five sets to estimate values for the missing independent variables. 8 Farkas (2010) shows how by middle school students from ethnic minorities and more disadvantaged backgrounds lag behind their higher-income counterparts in both learning and behavioral outcomes.\n6 would suggest that an increase in these two variables has a larger impact on students at the high end of the distribution. Immigration status is more important for students at the low end of the distribution, whereas the number of books at home is more important for persons in the higher part of the distribution.\nThe most telling change in coefficients over time is on gender. The TIMSS contains enough observations on students in each country to allow us to do something that is rare in analyses of social background effects: to estimate the relationship between background and outcomes for a large sample of countries using the same survey instrument. We divided the sample by country and estimated the equation in table 2 for all of the counties in the TIMSS surveys. These calculations show large cross-country variation in the effect of background on test scores. In some countries, background contributes greatly to the variation in scores, whereas in others it has modest effects. Figure 2a 11 Hertz et al. (2007) use the regression coefficient of parents' education as a predictor of schooling across generations and find a long-run decrease in this indicator of intergenerational educational inequality. By contrast, Hertz et al. (2007) find a constant correlation between parents' and children education, at around 0.4, and parents' education to be an important predictor of the cross-country variance of students' achievement. Woessmann (2008) examined the effect of family background on students' performance in seventeen western European countries and the United States by relying on TIMSS 1995 and finds that equality of opportunities is unrelated to countries' mean performance.\nIn short, the results on books in the household show that greater impacts on test scores are associated with higher levels of scores and lower levels of dispersion, and thus contribute to the virtuous relation between them.

Higher scores on tests presumably contribute to economic prosperity due to the link between educational outcomes and future labor income. Lower dispersion of test scores within a country presumably reduces future labor-market inequalities and enhances intergenerational mobility by reducing differences in skills associated with family backgrounds. Recent comparable international test scores reveal large variation in educational performance across countries, even when the focus is limited to countries with similar levels of economic development. , Test score comparisons also reveal large variations in equality in educational opportunities.\nUnderstanding the effect of family background on students' educational achievement is important,\ngiven that the family is one of the main agents in children's development of their human capital.\nMoreover, intergenerational mobility in education is closely related to intergenerational mobility in earnings.

To answer the first question, we estimated the following ordinary least-squares regression model for the two TIMSS waves:\nThis result could depend on the metric used to assess tests. For example, a scoring method that valued high scores much more than low scores could yield different results. In this case, an improvement at the bottom of the distribution of test scores could have a lower impact in the improvement of the overall performance. If the sole goal of the country was to produce Math Olympiads, for instance, the only thing that would matter would be the very top scores and the country would weight at zero improvements at the bottom of the distribution. 5 Hanushek (2007) and Hanushek and Woessmann (2010b) provide a review of the education production functions estimated in the literature.\nwhere T ics is the test score of student i, in class c and school s; X ics is a vector of family-background variables; and G is a 0/1 dummy for being female. Our measures of advantaged homes are the following: the presence of books at home, which is positively correlated with the socioeconomic status of the family (Beaton et al. 1996) and an important predictor of students' performance (Woessmann 2003 (Woessmann , 2004 ; dummy variables for the highest level of schooling by either of a student's parents; 6 and dummy variables for whether the student was an immigrant or native and whether the student's parent was or was not an immigrant.\nWe estimate equation 1 for the entire population of students in the sample using ordinary least squares. percentile, that raises inequality, while the converse holds if the effects of a variable are greater at the 5th percentile than at the 95th percentile.

Immigration status is more important for students at the low end of the distribution, whereas the number of books at home is more important for persons in the higher part of the distribution.\nThe most telling change in coefficients over time is on gender. In 1999, eighth-grade girls did significantly worse on the math exam than eighth-grade boys; but consistent with other studies that show women catching up with men in mathematical tests (Hyde et al. 2008; Nosek et al. 2009 The TIMSS contains enough observations on students in each country to allow us to do something that is rare in analyses of social background effects: to estimate the relationship between background and outcomes for a large sample of countries using the same survey instrument. We divided the sample by country and estimated the equation in table 2 there is a weak, often negligible correlation between the coefficients of the background variables across countries in the same year. On the basis of these correlations, the measures seem to reflect independent channels and thus should not be \"forced\" into a single latent variable model of background.\nGiven this finding, we ask next whether countries with larger or smaller coefficients on particular background factors have higher/lower average test scores or greater/lesser within-country inequality in scores. A priori it is not clear how larger background coefficients affect outcomes. On the one side, larger background coefficients might produce greater levels of inequality given that they reflect the ability of more advantaged homes to pass on their advantages to their children.\nThis in turn might be associated with lower average scores owing to the inverse relation between inequality and average scores shown in figures 1a and 1b. On the other side, large background coefficients could reflect the openness of society to parental investments in children that could induce parents with fewer resources to invest more heavily in their children. Persons from disadvantaged groups whose parents obtained greater education or who had many books in their household would be more likely to help their children in a society where the coefficients on those factors are high compared with a society where the coefficients on those factors are low.\nTo determine whether the estimated impact of having books in the household affects the level of test scores across countries, figure 3a 11 Hertz et al. (2007) use the regression coefficient of parents' education as a predictor of schooling across generations and find a long-run decrease in this indicator of intergenerational educational inequality. By contrast, Hertz et al. (2007) find a constant correlation between parents' and children education, at around 0.4, and parents' education to be an important predictor of the cross-country variance of students' achievement. examined the effect of family background on students' performance in seventeen western European countries and the United States by relying on TIMSS 1995 and finds that equality of opportunities is unrelated to countries' mean performance.\nIn short, the results on books in the household show that greater impacts on test scores are associated with higher levels of scores and lower levels of dispersion, and thus contribute to the virtuous relation between them. On the contrary, the results using parental education as the background measure show less of an association with the country-level outcomes. This suggests a larger inequality impact of an income proxy such as books at home as compared to parents' education.\nOther chapters in this volume examine inequality of educational opportunity in the United States (for example, Hout and Janus; Reardon). Hout and Janus (2011) find that educational mobility has decreased since the 1970s in the United States mainly due to the slow growth in high school and graduation rates, leaving current students only slightly ahead of their parents in terms of graduation rates. We observe that in 2007, the United States is ranks lower with respect to the coefficient of books at home than in 1999 (figs. 2a and 2b). In the short period of time that separates the two TIMSS waves, we also observe that both the coefficient on parents' education and the measure on inequality in achievement have decreased for the United States between ( fig.   4b )."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Cross-country analyses are notoriously problematic. Data often come from surveys that differ substantially in representativeness and quality. There is a diverse set of potential measures of country characteristics that researchers can use to explain country differences: language, geographic, ethnic composition, history, culture-more variables than countries, indeed. Many of the measures, moreover, are subject to potential misinterpretation without detailed knowledge of the country. 12 This is particularly the case when countries with nominally identical policies implement policies more or less rigorously\nIn the area of education, measures of student outcomes across countries suffer from differing nonresponse rates and inclusion or exclusion of special groups of students, such as those with learning disabilities. Although serious, these problems with international student achievement data do not seem to overturn existing research findings (Hanushek and Woessmann 2010a, 2010b ).\nGranted, cross-country comparisons of educational outcomes can almost never yield as firm conclusions about educational processes as random assignment studies or other analysis focused on particular inputs, but they can still contribute to our knowledge of the potentialities for improving educational outcomes.\nThere are two main lessons from our cross-country analysis of student performance on the TIMSS tests. The first is the negative relation between the wide cross-country variation in the level and dispersion of test scores. That countries with the highest test scores are those with the least inequality in scores suggests a \"virtuous\" equity-efficiency trade-off in improving educational outcomes. The second is that the large cross-country differences in the impact of familybackground factors on educational outcomes suggest the value of detailed studies of the transmission from parents to children of human capital. That countries with larger coefficients on books in the home in regressions determining test scores had higher test scores and lower dispersion of scores than countries with weaker relations between books in the home suggests a nuanced view of the effects of background factors on educational inequalities.

The logic for choosing the variables related to family background is the following: average number of books at home has been used in order not to arbitrarily choose one of the five books-related categories; parents' completed college education has been used as reference variables in these graphs as it has been found in the existing literature to have a positive and significant effect on students' performance and it is comparable across countries (the other categories related to education available in TIMSS are: completed postsecondary education but not university; completed upper secondary education; completed lower secondary education; less than lower secondary education)."}]
