The updated CAP, called the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan, will propose future greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and incorporate strategies to adapt to climate change impacts. The CAP update will build on the results of significant work to date; identify and fill key gaps; establish goals and priorities for future action; and recommend cost-effective strategies, policies, and programs to reduce GHG emissions and increase the City's resilience to climate impacts. Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), developed this report to describe existing conditions in Alameda and work conducted to date, identify gaps, and recommend next steps to inform the development of the CAP update. It serves as a baseline that the City can use to track progress toward CAP update implementation, and it synthesizes studies and plans in a single location to facilitate future updates. In addition, this report includes information that ERG obtained consultation with City of Alameda staff, the Green Working Team, Alameda Municipal Power (AMP), and the CAP update Task Force. 1 Informed by this review and consultation, ERG proposes draft GHG reduction targets and resiliency goals as a starting point for robust stakeholder input and community-wide engagement."}, {"section_title": "GHG Emissions, Reduction Strategies, and Targets", "text": "ERG reviewed and summarized the following documents, studies, and plans related to GHG emissions and reductions to provide a basis for the CAP update: \uf0b7 2008 CAP (CoA, 2008) \uf0b7 2015 GHG emissions inventory (CoA, 2017a) \uf0b7 Transportation-related plans: 2009 Pedestrian Plan (CoA, 2009a) and Bicycle Master Plan (CoA, 2010a) \uf0b7 AMP energy efficiency efforts (AMP, 2018) \uf0b7 Zero Waste Implementation Plan (CoA, 2010b) Using the studies and plans, as well as input from City staff and stakeholders, ERG will investigate and possibly update the 2030 and 2050 projections in the City's GHG emissions inventory. In addition, ERG will conduct a gap analysis to determine the potential shortfall in GHG reductions as compared to the preliminary GHG reduction targets for 2030. ERG will also collect input from City staff and stakeholders on additional GHG reduction measures that may be considered for analysis and addition to the CAP update. Next, ERG will propose a list of the highest-priority measures for City and stakeholder consideration. Priority will be based on criteria such as GHG emissions reduction potential, estimated range of potential implementation costs, and other factors to be determined. Upon receiving additional input from the City and stakeholders, ERG will analyze in detail the selected mitigation measures, potential costs, and GHG reduction impact of implementing them as part of the CAP update. The Alameda City Council adopted the City's current GHG reduction target of \"25% below 2005 levels by 2020\" in February 2008. GHG reductions from \"planned City actions\" are estimated to fall short of the 2020 goals by 31,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) (CoA, 2017a).

This will be accomplished by defining hazard-specific goals and determining adaptation actions needed to achieve them. Several vulnerability or hazard assessments have been conducted for Alameda in the past decade. The most notable assessments include the following: These assessments provide the foundation for more detailed adaptation planning in Alameda. All the assessments identify similar key hazards facing Alameda and the vulnerability of assets and systems to these hazards. Key vulnerabilities include: \uf0b7 Sea level rise and associated coastal flooding and permanent inundation. \uf0b7 Inland flooding due to rising groundwater levels and an overwhelmed stormwater management system. \uf0b7 Reliance on transportation systems and utilities that are at high risk from sea level rise. \uf0b7 Earthquake risk and the potential for sea level rise to exacerbate the risk of liquefaction as groundwater levels rise. \uf0b7 Other climate hazards that are lower priority but still pose a threat to Alameda, including extreme heat events, drought, and wildfire smoke. The ART Alameda County Project has produced the most detailed vulnerability assessment, covering the three key components of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Although the Sea Level Rise Hazard Assessment included a detailed review of specific assets' exposure in Alameda, it did not discuss Consider implications of more intense precipitation events in the future and provide recommendations for updating the storm drain modeling. Existing assessment of overlapping sea level rise/earthquake risk was broad (Bay Area) and not specific to Alameda.

Addressing this linkage in the CAP update will make the plan robust and responsive and acknowledge co-benefits such as the following: \uf0b7 Green infrastructure, green roofs, and tree plantings reduce GHG emissions (via carbon sequestration), mitigate flooding and heat impacts, and improve water quality. \uf0b7 Reducing reliance on single-occupancy vehicle trips by promoting other forms of transportation (bicycles, ferries) reduces GHG emissions and reliance on flood-prone transportation routes (e.g., Webster and Posey Tubes). \uf0b7 Land use planning that encourages development near transit hubs reduces GHG emissions via fewer vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and could also locate new development away from areas at high risk of sea level rise. \uf0b7 Nature-based shoreline stabilization methods, such as living shorelines, can reduce coastal flooding impacts while increasing biodiversity, improving water quality, sequestering carbon, and reducing GHG emissions. The City of Alameda has already begun to see the impacts associated with climate change, including rising seas, higher temperatures, and more extreme weather events. As an island, the City is particularly vulnerable to these impacts and is proactively trying to both mitigate the potential for climate change through GHG reduction efforts and to increase its resilience to climate change impacts by implementing adaptation strategies. Efforts to address GHG emissions date back to February 2008, when the Alameda City Council approved the CAP and established a GHG reduction goal of 25 percent by 2020 compared to a 2005 baseline. The City has made progress toward this goal but still has work to do. The original CAP did not include recommendations for implementing climate change adaptations, and the City is committed to pushing forward on that front as part of the CAP update. The City is developing a new Climate Action and Resiliency Plan that meets or exceeds California's GHG reduction goals and increases the resilience of the City, its assets, and its residents to the impacts of climate change. The CAP update will integrate and use other City plans to help institutionalize adaptation and GHG reduction throughout all City planning activities. Alameda has already made substantial progress in addressing GHG emissions and is committed to be a leader in reducing emissions and preparing the City for climate change impacts.

Before the settlement and development of California, Alameda was a peninsula covered in dense forest. The original landmass for both Alameda Island and Bay Farm Island comprises slightly more than half of the total land area at the core of the islands. The rest of the current landmass was built on fill material, including Alameda Point and many of the City's coastal neighborhoods, such as the South Shore and East Shore neighborhoods, as well as substantial portions of Bay Farm Island. Due to its location in San Francisco Bay, Alameda relies on connections to the mainland for critical services like transit and utilities. Residents rely on multiple modes of transportation; in 2015, an estimated 40.1 percent of commuters used transit options other than driving.

Between 1994 and the 2010 Decennial Census, the population decreased by 5,485 residents to a total of 73,812 (-6.9 percent from 1994 to 2010). At the same time, the population of Alameda County more broadly increased by 12.8 percent. Recently, Alameda has seen a population increase, with an estimated 79,177 residents in 2017, living in 30,678 households (USCB, 2018). In 2013, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projected that the Alameda population would reach 80,300 in 2020, reflecting growth of 8.8 percent from 2010 to 2020, driven largely by new residential development in former industrial areas and military installations, most notably Alameda Point and along the northern waterfront. Housing in Alameda is characterized by residential properties with few multi-unit buildings. In 1973, the City passed initiative Measure A, prohibiting the construction of residential structures with more than two units. According to the \"2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates,\" the ratio of persons per household in Alameda is 2.48 (average for all household), consistent with previous 5-year estimates. ABAG's 2020 population estimates are driven by the rate of new building construction because household size is not expected to change significantly. The age distribution of Alameda residents did not change significantly between the 2000 and 2010 Census, and the City has an age distribution roughly similar to Alameda County more broadly, but with a higher proportion of residents older than 55 and a lower proportion under 15. According to the 2012-2016 5-year estimates, the age distribution has not substantially changed since the most recent complete Decennial Census in 2010. Alameda residents are generally wealthier than Alameda County and the Bay Area as a whole.

Although many municipalities have started to develop climate resilience plans with defined goals, the goals often lack specificity and do not provide sufficient detail to support identification and prioritization of adaptation strategies. The CAP update for Alameda will include clear hazard-specific goals that are coupled with metrics to help quantify the extent to which actions make progress toward a more resilient Alameda. At a higher level, Alameda has an overall vision to increase resilience to climate change, and each of the hazard-specific goals will be designed to collectively meet the larger vision. No specific goals have been defined at this time, but the overall vision for Alameda may be similar to the example shown at right. The City should develop resilience goals that can be paired with quantitative metrics to track progress and help the public understand how different strategies are performing.

Although the City is projected to undershoot its 2020 target by 9 percent (i.e., 64 percent of the total targeted reduction) ( Figure 4-1), it is worth nothing that many other local jurisdictions are also projected to miss their target. Ten municipalities in Alameda were polled and stated that their 2015 GHG inventories are on average about 75 percent of a 2015 interim target; they ranged from being 30 percent of the way to the 2015 interim target to exceeding it by 180 percent (Kitahara, 2018).

Several of these have overlapping drivers and impacts. For example, sea level rise can directly cause coastal flooding, but it also impacts groundwater levels and the functioning of the City's stormwater system, Key Terms Used in This Synthesis: Vulnerability consists of the following components: o Exposure: The presence of people, ecosystems, or assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected. (Adapted from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report: Annex II) o Sensitivity: The degree to which people, ecosystems, or assets are affected by climate change. (Adapted from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report: Annex II) o Adaptive capacity: The ability of people, ecosystems, or assets to adjust to adverse effects. (Adapted from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report: Annex II) Risk is the threat posed by a negative impact or hazard event. It is the combination of likelihood and consequence. Adaptation response is a combination of three key elements: 1) a key vulnerability directly linked to the outcome of the risk assessment, 2) one or more actions that could be taken to address the key vulnerability, and 3) implementation options to guide each action or set of actions. (Adapted from The ART Approach White Paper) Resilience is the capacity of systems or assets to absorb disturbances and adapt to stress and change in a manner that retains function and structure.

(Adapted from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report: Annex II) Task 1 Report August 30, 2018 6 thereby leading to flooding in inland portions of the City. To facilitate a coherent presentation of existing conditions in Alameda, this synthesis is organized into the following sections, based on priority threats and their impacts: 1. Sea level rise and coastal flooding 2. Inland flooding from surface water runoff and rising groundwater 3. Earthquakes 4. Drought 5. Extreme heat 6. Wildfires Based on the findings of previous assessments in Alameda, sea level rise and flooding are the threats of greatest concern because of their likelihood and the major consequences associated with them. Multiple factors drive flooding in Alameda, including sea level rise, and it can be one of the costliest issues the city faces. The other climate-related threats included here are also of concern but given the relatively minor risk associated with them (as defined by the 2016 LHMP, which focused on occurrence and potential consequences), they will not receive as much attention in the CAP update (CoA, 2016). However, there is substantial opportunity to better understand these threats and identify adaptation strategies to address them, and the CAP update will include actionable guidance targeted at each of the threats listed above. In addition to seal level rise and flooding, the greatest concern for Alameda is earthquakes. Although the CAP update will ostensibly focus on climate threats, there are numerous opportunities to also identify adaptation strategies that could increase resilience to earthquakes. Furthermore, there is a relationship between sea level rise and earthquakes, as highlighted in several reports by ABAG and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), including the Stronger Housing, Safer Communities report released in 2015. These studies identified the potential for sea level rise to compound the effects of liquefaction potential 3 -earthquake frequency is unlikely to change, but the impacts could be much larger if more land is susceptible to liquefaction as a result of rising seas. The Alameda CAP update builds on past studies; to avoid duplication, it is therefore necessary to extract key information from these documents before taking next steps. A major part of updating the CAP is identifying where and how climate-related impacts are already being experienced, because these impacts are of immediate concern and likely to get worse. Several vulnerability and risk assessments have been conducted with varying levels of technical detail. This synthesis identifies gaps in these previous assessments that need to be filled during the risk assessment process. It also extracts findings, recommendations, and actionable guidance to provide a common starting point for developing adaptation strategies and actions moving forward. The text box at right shows some of the sources reviewed for this synthesis. The Vulnerability and Risk Report (2012) developed as part of the ART Alameda County Project is the most comprehensive existing assessment of vulnerability and risk. It assesses exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for 14 key asset groups and sectors (BCDC, 2012). This synthesis will not present the findings of the Vulnerability and Risk Report in detail but will identify what information already exists; these findings will serve as the starting point for the risk assessment activities conducted for the CAP update. Observations and Projections Globally, sea levels have risen roughly 7 to 8 inches since 1900, and nearly 3 inches of that rise has occurred since 1993 (USGCRP, 2017). The same is true in California, with observed sea level rise of 7 inches since 1900 in San Francisco (CAEPA, 2018). At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gauge in Alameda, sea level has risen at an average of +0.03 inches per year from 1939 to 2016, with rates increasing to nearly +0.1 inches per year from 1993 to 2010 (CAEPA, 2018). When considering sea level rise projections and their potential impact, it is important to understand the height of king tides, the two to four highest tides of the year, which are primarily driven by astronomical 3 The U.S. Geological Survey defines liquefaction as \"a process by which water-saturated sediment temporarily loses strength and acts as a fluid\" (USGS, n. conditions. Sea level rise projections and inundation maps often reference king tides and other extreme tides-higher events driven by a combination of astronomical conditions, water temperature, and storms-because they are very useful targets for planning. Historically, the 10 highest king tides recorded by NOAA in Alameda over the past 75 years measured 8.6 feet to 9.5 feet above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, roughly equivalent to mean sea level. King tides generally occur in the winter months (November-February) when storm frequency and severity are typically highest (CoA, 2016). Along with flooding associated with individual events such as El Ni\u00f1o, king tides can cause flooding on city streets. For example, the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event left 2 feet of standing water on Main Street (CoA, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding", "text": "Sea level rise has a very wide range of impacts, as highlighted in the text box to the left. It is important to distinguish between inundation and flooding when considering sea level rise projections and potential impacts. The Alameda CAP update will use BCDC's 2017 inundation maps from the ART Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project (BCDC, 2017). This project distinguished permanent inundation (inundation at daily high tide levels) from temporary flooding (event-based flooding driven by storms or extreme high tides) (BCDC, 2017). Regular and predictable temporary flooding can also occur during king tides on a semi-annual basis. California has formally adopted several sea level projections, which BCDC used to produce the inundation maps. In 2013, the California Ocean Protection Council (OPC) formally adopted the NRC report Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future (NRC, 2012) as the best available science on sea level rise for the state. The NRC projections in Table 5-2 previously served as the underpinnings for inundation mapping and sea level rise analysis throughout California until the Rising Seas in California report (Griggs et al., 2017) defined new projections in 2017, and the OPC finalized its subsequent State of California Sea-Level Rise Guidance for projections in 2018, as shown in Table 5-3 (OPC, 2018). 2.8 -5.8 5.7 13.0 21.9 a All projections are for the high emissions (RCP 8.5) scenario. Projections for low emissions (RCP 2.6) can be found in the OPC sea level rise guidance. The low emissions scenario is considered extremely unlikely given current global emission trends. b OPC considers the top end of the \"likely range\" to be equivalent to a low risk aversion decision. c OPC considers the 1-in-200 chance to be equivalent to a medium-high risk aversion decision. d OPC considers the H++ single scenario to be equivalent to an extreme risk aversion decision. e Most climate models do not extend past 2100. There is greater uncertainty with these longer-range projections. Overall, the new projections in the State of California Sea-Level Rise Guidance are consistent with the NRC's 2012 projections; the \"likely range\" from the California guidance matches the \"most likely projections\" from the NRC report. The new guidance adds projections representing a 5 percent (1-in-20) and 0.5 percent (1-in-200) chance of sea level rise exceeding a certain value, as well as a single scenario model-the H++ scenario-that reflects the top end of potential sea level rise if ice caps melt at a much higher rate and to a greater degree than expected. These higher sea level rise levels are useful when determining flooding and inundation scenarios to use as a target during adaptation response development. The ART Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project sought to produce new Bay Area inundation maps that had the flexibility to be robustly interpreted and applied as the underlying sea level rise projections continue to evolve, including for anticipated future changes to California's official sea level rise planning guidance. BCDC's most recent iteration of inundation mapping in 2017 leveraged the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) 2013 hydrodynamic modeling data, as well as topographic LiDAR data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NOAA in 2016, as the basis for modeling (BCDC, 2017). BCDC developed inundation maps for a range of sea level rise scenarios while also considering king tide and extreme tide levels. As a result, maps exist up to a maximum of 108 inches of additional water level compared to current mean higher high water (MHHW); this corresponds roughly to the combination of 66 inches of sea level rise (permanent inundation) combined with a 100-year extreme tide event (temporary flooding). Alternatively, the inundation maps can be viewed as 108 inches of sea level rise inundation with no consideration of king tides or extreme tide events driven by storms. Several other factors influence total water level, including El Ni\u00f1o, storm surge, waves, and rainfall/runoff. Climate models cannot predict changes in these conditions with great accuracy. The BCDC mapping effort addressed this by covering a range of possible extremes to account for uncertainty in the frequency and magnitude of these conditions. Additional information on factors that influence local water levels in addition to sea level rise is available in the ART Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project's final report (Section 2.2) (BCDC, 2012). The new BCDC inundation maps include 10 sets of maps for each county representing a range of possible water levels associated with SLR and extreme tides of different historic recurrence intervals (e.g., 1-year, 5-year, 100-year).

ART Alameda County Project: Vulnerability and Risk Report 2012Countywide vulnerability assessment was completed in 2012 using outdated inundation maps. Review results of 2012 vulnerability assessment and verify the findings are still accurate given new projections. ART Alameda County Project: Vulnerability and Risk Report 2012Several assessments of vulnerability to sea level rise and extreme tides have been conducted in the Bay Area broadly and in Alameda specifically. The ART Alameda County Project included the most comprehensive vulnerability assessment-examining exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity-for a wide range of critical asset categories and sectors. Due to its relatively broad scope covering the entirety of Alameda County, the ART Alameda County Project: Vulnerability and Risk Report did not include a comprehensive assessment of assets specific to the City of Alameda (although it included many), but rather focused on asset categories more broadly. Furthermore, the vulnerability assessment was completed in 2012 using older sea level rise inundation maps that relied on somewhat outdated projections. Table 5-4 above shows key gaps in existing assessments. More recently, the City of Alameda LHMP included a high-level assessment of the risk sea level rise poses to critical assets, using the NRC sea level rise projections from 2012 and a previous iteration of BCDC inundation maps. This high-level assessment did consider asset sensitivity to permanent inundation and temporary flooding, but only for general types of assets (e.g., buildings, utilities) and not for specific assets (CoA, 2016). The City of Alameda Sea Level Rise Hazard Assessment was completed in 2017 using the most recent BCDC inundation maps and focusing on nine neighborhoods (see text box to the right). The City and other stakeholders collaborated to select these neighborhoods based on known hazards and local expertise (CoA, 2017b). In updating the CAP, the City will expand the analysis to cover neighborhoods excluded from the original assessment. The Sea Level Rise Hazard Assessment was also limited to an exposure analysis with no consideration of inundation depth, sensitivity, or adaptive capacity. An important component of developing a climate adaptation plan for the City of Alameda is identifying the appropriate set of assets, services, and systems that should be the target of the risk assessment and adaptation strategy development. Table 5-5 summarizes the assets examined in previous assessments. Several criteria can be used as a starting point to ensure appropriate assets are considered without overwhelming the assessment. The graphic below shows examples of criteria that can help prioritize assets for the assessment. Exposure Assets and residents in the Bay Area are already being exposed to the impacts of sea level rise to a greater degree than in the past. Most notably, king tides that predictably occur two to four times a year currently lead to flooding in low-lying coastal areas around San Francisco Bay, including on some streets in Alameda (BCDC, 2017). Areas that are currently flooding at king tides are likely to be impacted more quickly and to a greater degree as water levels continue to rise. These are areas that should be targeted with early interventions to alleviate sea level rise impacts. Assessments conducted to date in Alameda have reviewed asset exposure in detail, specifically the Sea Level Rise Hazard Assessment completed in 2017, but gaps need to be filled in the extent of exposure analysis to complete the assessment in all Alameda neighborhoods. The 2017 assessment also did not incorporate depth in its analysis, focusing only on the lateral extent of inundation, so there is limited understanding of how severely assets are exposed to sea level rise. However, the 2017 BCDC inundation maps do reflect both depth and inundation and can facilitate consideration of exposure to different inundation and/or temporary flooding depths. Table 5-6 presents the results of the Sea Level Rise Hazard Assessment, identifies the sea level rise level at which each neighborhood is impacted, and provides additional details on asset-specific exposure for each scenario. \uf0b7 City of Alameda LHMP (2016): This plan provides a high-level overview of the potential impacts of priority hazards (sea level rise, flooding, earthquakes) on general asset groups (buildings, utilities, transportation) but does not consider asset-specific sensitivity, or adaptive capacity."}, {"section_title": "Critical Assets", "text": "The following section summarizes the findings of the abovementioned assessments that examined sensitivity. Conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for specific assets in Alameda will require additional analyses, using the results of previous assessments as a starting point. In general, the potential impacts of sea level rise may include coastal flooding associated with shoreline overtopping, inland flooding associated with rising groundwater levels, coastal erosion in unprotected areas, and undermining of and damage to existing structures (e.g., bridge abutments) (CoA, 2016 Asset sensitivity makes an important distinction between temporary flooding and permanent inundation-each condition has its own unique set of impacts. The text box to the left describes potential impacts from flooding as defined by the LHMP. In general, the LHMP found that flooding is likely to be a temporary condition driven by tide cycles as well as storm intensity and duration, with flooding likely to be shallow in most cases (approximately 2 feet or less). The location of flooding is of particular importance when analyzing the sensitivity of critical services to sea level rise, as damage or destruction of key transportation corridors can impact emergency services. Previous ART projects in the region and locally conducted more detailed assessments of asset sensitivity than the City of Alameda LHMP. Using the ART framework, the Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study (which focused on Bay Farm Island and the area surrounding the Oakland Coliseum) developed profile sheets that presented sector-and asset-specific information. These profile sheets defined vulnerabilities for the following categories: governance, information, physical, and functional. The study also defined vulnerabilities using the ART Assessment Questions, and its framework can serve as the foundation for similar detailed analysis of assets and asset groups for the rest of Alameda."}, {"section_title": "Adaptive Capacity", "text": "A full vulnerability assessment evaluates adaptive capacity, or the ability of assets, systems, or people to adjust to an adverse impact. The most complete assessment of the adaptive capacity of Alameda's assets and systems is the ART Alameda County Project, which analyzed 14 critical sectors. The ART Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study also considered adaptive capacity when developing asset-specific profile sheets. Table 5-7 summarizes the results of the ART Alameda County Project: Vulnerability and Risk Report for both sensitivity and adaptive capacity. These project results will serve as the foundation for a more detailed assessment of the vulnerability of specific assets in the City of Alameda. Findings and Recommendations The previous assessments and plans related to sea level rise and associated impacts have produced a wide range of findings and recommendations, including identification of information gaps, prioritization of hazards and assets, and specific adaptation or hazard mitigation strategies to consider for implementation. The 2016 LHMP also provides a list of completed hazard mitigation strategies, primarily since the 2010 LHMP, that can help Alameda identify existing interventions to support prioritization of future adaptation actions. For example, an Emergency Alert System (Nixle 360) was established to send voice messages to targeted geographic areas. This strategy addresses several potential hazards and provides a platform for the City to send information to residents based on their exposure to a threat, but it should be revisited and expanded to meet new, advancing technological needs and capabilities. Table 5-8 presents example findings from the Oakland/Alameda study for the schools asset group. The City of Alameda can build upon this study's findings and recommendations when updating the CAP. Similar findings are presented in the Oakland/Alameda study for the other asset groups and specific assets listed above in Table 5-5. The Oakland/Alameda study identified several adaptation responses for each of the vulnerabilities defined for each asset or asset group. The responses defined during this previous effort can be used to target pilot projects and \"earlytrack\" implementation in Alameda. The text box to the right shows key high-priority targets for adaptation identified during the Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study and related Bay Farm Island Technical Memorandum."}, {"section_title": "Inland Flooding from Surface Water Runoff and Rising Groundwater", "text": "Observations and Projections It is difficult to separate the impacts of sea level rise from other flooding sources because of Alameda's location, but inland flooding in portions of the city that are not directly impacted by sea level rise and shoreline overtopping is a special concern. Surface water runoff and rising groundwater-which is exacerbated by sea level rise-can cause inland flooding during heavy precipitation events. Alameda struggles frequently with overwhelmed or blocked stormwater infrastructure, as summarized in the 2016 LHMP and several assessments related to the stormwater system. The City is very flat, especially along the coast, where it is primarily constructed on infill areas. The flat topography prevents the use of a gravity stormwater system, necessitating pump stations to manage stormwater (CoA, 2016). Furthermore, seawater during high tides currently covers stormwater outfalls, and mud deposition can block outfalls, requiring additional pump stations and lift stations to move water out under pressure. The City completed a Storm Drain Master Plan, completed in 2008 and most recently updated in 2017, and has conducted several assessments of the stormwater system (see text box to the right). These assessments identify potential flooding locations where stormwater infrastructure could be overwhelmed due to the combination of surface water runoff and sea level rise. Analyses included both the 10year storm event and 25-year storm event using current storm intensity estimates, but they did not project future changes in storm intensity; however, the analyses did consider changing ocean water levels (CoA, 2008b;CoA, 2009b)."}, {"section_title": "Critical Assets to Consider for Early Implementation of Adaptation Actions", "text": "In 2018, FEMA approved and officially adopted new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) based on modeling completed in 2015. These updated maps include a larger 100-year and 500-year floodplain area, approximately XX units greater than the previous maps from 2009. 4 There has been little analysis of the potential impact of rising groundwater on flooding in Alameda. Due to the complexities of subsurface hydrology and the lack of quantitative data on groundwater in the City, conducting a detailed analysis of the potential impact of sea level rise on groundwater levels would be difficult. The text box below lists several such studies that have been conducted in specific locations. These could provide valuable information as Alameda considers groundwater in developing its adaptation strategies. However, without substantial groundwater monitoring data in Alameda, the types of comprehensive analyses conducted elsewhere cannot be conducted in the City. Despite this limitation, Alameda can consider sea level rise impacts on groundwater levels and subsequent surface flooding during the CAP update. Several sources of information on the current and projected storm intensity in Alameda and the Bay Area region could be used when assessing Alameda's vulnerability to flooding from storm-driven surface water runoff. To date, no specific studies have been completed that explicitly consider potential future changes in storm intensity due to climate change. The graphic below depicts the projected changes in storm intensity from current levels. These projections are based on an ensemble approach that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used for water resources planning, with model projections provided at the scale of a 30 x 30-mile grid (USEPA, 2016). The City can incorporate the projected intensities into a vulnerability assessment and consider them when developing adaptation responses. Put another way, the projected storm intensity increase shown in the graphic above would be roughly equivalent to a current 10-year storm event (3.27\"/24hr) occurring every five years by 2060. Assess inland assets' vulnerability to flooding (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity)."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessment Summary", "text": "\n\nThe City has not specifically assessed the potential vulnerability of its residents to wildfire smoke impacts.

These assessment results were included in the 2016 LHMP's hazard assessment, which explicitly considered stormwater assets and included the maps of storm-drain-related flooding potential from the City's previous analysis. However, none of these assessments conducted a detailed evaluation of vulnerability to flooding for other assets if the stormwater system is overwhelmed. The results of the storm drain modeling can be used to assess the vulnerability of critical assets, communities, and residents to inland flooding, particularly when records of stormwater overflows and their resulting inland flooding are reviewed to identify low points in the City that may not appear on coastal inundation and FEMA floodplain maps. Exposure Although storm drain modeling efforts identified pumps and other assets that are likely to be overwhelmed during storm events or due to sea level rise, these previous analyses did not extrapolate the flooding potential to surrounding assets to determine what areas or assets might be exposed if the stormwater system is overwhelmed. Previous modeling efforts determined flood level above the street for point locations, providing the foundation for determining the exposure of surrounding assets to flooding. Figure 5-3 below shows an example of the results from the 2008 Storm Drain Master Plan's 25-year storm analysis and highlights the information available when assessing other assets' vulnerability to inland flooding. Portions of Alameda disconnected from the coast are likely to still experience flooding, especially as groundwater levels rise, and these portions of the City should be evaluated for their exposure to overland flooding events. "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity", "text": "No detailed assessment of asset sensitivity to flooding has been completed for Alameda. Many of the findings from the assessments focused on sea level rise (described earlier in this synthesis) apply to inland flooding. The 2016 LHMP also included some generic information regarding the vulnerability of assets, as well as the relative risk of individual buildings to hazards overall, but that evaluation did not discuss asset sensitivity in detail. Modeling conducted to support the Storm Drain Master Plan and subsequent updates did evaluate the system's functionality during a 25-year storm event at current intensity on top of 18 inches and 55 inches of sea level rise. These models indicated that 18 inches of sea level rise had little impact on the system during a 25-year storm event, but 55 inches of sea level rise presented major flooding difficulties without system optimization and upsizing. The model findings provide some information on stormwater assets' sensitivity to flooding after sea level rise, but they do not extend into an analysis of other assets' sensitivity to flooding caused by an overwhelmed stormwater system. Adaptive Capacity None of the assessments conducted to date specifically discuss the assets' adaptive capacity to flooding caused by surface water runoff and rising groundwater. However, the findings of the ART Alameda County Project related to sea level rise and coastal flooding apply in some cases and could be extrapolated to interior portions of Alameda that are not directly impacted by sea level rise but may still experience flooding.\nAs highlighted in the 2016 LHMP, characteristics of Bay Farm Island and Alameda Island make coastal neighborhoods more susceptible to damage from earthquakes. Both islands have \"central cores\" of relatively stable higher ground surrounded by areas of man-made fill that are more sensitive to shaking and ground disturbances. Alameda's sensitivity to earthquakes is also driven by its dependency on connections to the mainland that earthquakes could damage, including transportation infrastructure, utilities, commerce, and services. Notably, the 2016 LHMP reports that an earthquake could result in Alameda needing to be fully selfsufficient for 72 hours or more if bridges and utility crossings are severely damaged. These assets are also at high risk from sea level rise, highlighting the fact that many of the same assets are affected by multiple threats. These assets should be considered high-priority when identifying targets for adaptation action. Regionally, ABAG has conducted assessments of the sensitivity of communities and assets to earthquakes that can serve as the foundation for a more specific evaluation of assets in Alameda. Adaptive Capacity To date, no assessments have evaluated the adaptive capacity of Alameda's assets to the risk posed by the confluence of earthquakes and sea level rise. The ART Alameda County Project and ART Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study both provide information on asset vulnerability to earthquakes, including adaptive capacity. This information can be leveraged to develop adaptation strategies that address both climate hazards and earthquake risk.\nIncreasingly severe and prolonged droughts in California have impacted and will continue to impact assets and communities in Alameda. Given the indirect impacts of drought on the City, no detailed assessment of asset sensitivity to drought is necessary. The City can instead identify adaptation responses that include water conservation best practices to reduce the burden on EBMUD, based on recommendations from the EBMUD Urban Water Management Plan. Adaptive Capacity Alameda has the capacity to adapt to drought to the extent that residents, businesses, and City-managed properties can conserve water to reduce stress on the system overall. No assessment has been conducted to identify the adaptive capacity of specific assets (e.g., parks, open spaces, and City-owned buildings), but EBMUD provides the general framework for conserving water.\nThe impacts from extreme heat events and heat waves include: \uf0b7 Public health issues, especially for vulnerable communities (children, elderly, infirm, poor), such as heat stroke, dehydration, and asthma. \uf0b7 Public health threats to outdoor employees (construction workers, public works department employees, etc.) and associated decreased productivity. \uf0b7 Damage to transportation infrastructure, including buckled rail lines, pavement softening and expansion, and equipment failure. Although there are no assessments of heat event impacts on Alameda specifically, there are detailed case studies that describe the impacts of extreme heat events and heat waves on transportation infrastructure. The City can leverage these case studies to assess the vulnerability of its transportation assets to extreme heat and identify adaptation strategies. Adaptive Capacity Alameda has not specifically assessed the adaptive capacity of its assets to extreme heat events but can apply other report findings and more general assessments to the City's assets."}, {"section_title": "Findings and Recommendations", "text": "The most relevant findings from previous assessments come from the Storm Drain Master Plan and subsequent updates, specifically the 2011 Storm Drain Pump Station Assessment (CoA, 2011) and the 2017 Storm Drain Master Plan Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Update. Modeling efforts identified stormwater assets that are most at risk from climate change and recommended system upgrades to account for potential future changes in ocean level. Notably, the analyses used current storm intensity (10-year or 25-year depending on the modeling effort) but did not consider changes to the intensity of storm events. The Storm Drain Master Plan CIP Update includes recommended system renovations, including new pump stations and upsizing of existing assets.\nThe 2016 LHMP highlights progress Alameda has made toward increased resilience to earthquakes, most notably related to earthquake-induced fires. The City has a Class 01/1Y ranking, placing it in the top 0.2 percent of 48,000 fire agencies in California. This high ranking is due in part to systems that Alameda put in place to enhance 911, E911 wireless, and VoIP communications; computer-aided dispatch; geographic information systems; and an established incident management system. Several studies and reports have identified strategies to increase resilience to earthquake risk, including the 2016 LHMP, the ART Alameda County Project, the ART Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study, and the ABAG Stronger Housing, Safer Communities report. Of these, the ABAG report provides the most detailed information on the overlap between climate threats and earthquakes, and it can serve as the starting point for identifying adaptation responses that increase resilience to both earthquakes and sea level rise.\nThe City of Alameda has limited control over source water protection against drought. However, the EBMUD Urban Water Management Plan outlines strategies for water conservation systemwide to support long-term sustainability. The EBMUD recommendations will serves as the basis for water conservation strategies in Alameda.\nThe 2016 LHMP recommended that future LHMP revisions should re-assess the risk that extreme heat poses as the climate changes. Recent heat waves give greater impetus to this recommendation. The risk assessment conducted as part of the CAP update can help serve this purpose.

ABAG has conducted extensive analysis of the overlap between sea level rise and earthquakes, including in the Stronger Housing, Safer Communities report released in 2015. Sea level rise results in higher groundwater levels that can saturate soils and sediment underlying developed land. This saturated soil is at much higher risk of liquefaction during an earthquake. As such, the City of Alameda is including earthquakes in its climate adaptation assessment and strategy development to ensure it identifies actions that could address this compounded risk."}, {"section_title": "Observations and Projections", "text": "Alameda is located within a high earthquake hazard zone, as defined by the USGS. The Hayward Fault is closest to Alameda and is more likely than other faults in California to result in major damage to the City. However, the fault type in and around Alameda has less potential to cause a very extreme earthquake of greater than M8.0. The area has a history of observed earthquake activity and has experienced 20 strong earthquakes and one major earthquake in the Bay Area in the past 165 years, including the 1868 Hayward Fault quake and the 1906 San Andreas quake. Two historic earthquakes that caused major damage to Alameda occurred before the islands were expanded with man-made fill. The most recent strong earthquake to occur after the infilling of the islands was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (M6.9). All areas of damage during that earthquake were on infill outside of the original islands' shorelines (CoA, 2016). In 2013, USGS and ABAG made the following projections of earthquake hazard for the Bay Area and Alameda: \uf0b7 72 percent chance over the next 30 years of an earthquake of M6.7 or higher in the Bay Area. \uf0b7 28 percent chance over the next 30 years of an earthquake of M6.7 or greater on the Hayward Fault. \uf0b7 All scenarios combined-10 percent chance of MMI 8 to MMI 9 shaking in Alameda over the next 50 years. Alameda is also highly susceptible to liquefaction, particularly in areas where development occurred on top of infill material. Liquefaction was documented at Alameda Point and the Harbor Bay Business Park during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (CoA, 2016). Several studies have attempted to connect sea level rise and earthquake risk, specifically by considering sea level rise's impact on liquefaction potential in the Bay Area. Notably, the ABAG Stronger Houses, Safer Communities report included a detailed evaluation of the overlap between sea level rise inundation and earthquake liquefaction risk, as did the Bay Area Housing and Community Risk Assessment Report, a related effort. Several existing assessments have evaluated the vulnerability of communities and assets to earthquake risk. However, few have evaluated specifically how earthquake risk and climate hazards combine to influence asset vulnerability. Despite the substantial potential risk that earthquakes pose to Alameda, an adaptation plan for climate hazards should focus on this overlap. The ABAG Stronger Housing, Safer Communities report findings provide the best information on the potential impact of earthquakes to the Bay Area in concert with sea level rise. Other information sources, including the 2016 LHMP, ART Alameda County Project, and ART Oakland/Alameda Resilience Study, discuss the exposure and sensitivity of asset groups to earthquakes and suggest adaptation responses to the threat of earthquakes.

In general, areas of Alameda that are built on infill, including the majority of Bay Farm Island, Alameda Point, and most coastal areas on Alameda Island, are most susceptible to liquefaction. Overall exposure to earthquakes is similar throughout Alameda due to its proximity to the Hayward Fault and to a lesser degree the San Andreas Fault. USGS recently completed the HayWired Earthquake Scenario-an analysis of a \"worst-case scenario\" rupture on the Hayward Fault-to describe the potential impacts of a major earthquake on the Bay Area. In this scenario, the epicenter of the earthquake was located under Oakland, leading to major shaking in Alameda. Although the HayWired scenario provides information on the potential impacts of a M7.0 earthquake on the Bay Area, it did not analyze specific asset types. Figure 5-4 shows the study area's liquefaction potential during the HayWired scenario. An adaptation plan for the City of Alameda can build upon the ABAG Stronger Housing, Safer Communities report by considering its findings in light of the USGS HayWired scenario and analyzing the exposure of critical assets to potential liquefaction, which sea level rise could exacerbate.\nAlameda is not directly exposed to drought impacts because EBMUD provides its water supply.

This plan helps EBMUD ensure water supply by advocating water conservation, water recycling, and long-term water supply projects. It specifically considers climate change, with a Climate Change Monitoring and Response Plan released in 2014, building on an initial effort in 2008 to incorporate climate change into the long-term strategic plan. Long-term drought conditions in California, especially from 2013 to 2015, have led water suppliers to incorporate climate change into planning activities.

However, climate change may affect that assessment, as highlighted by EBMUD's emphasis on drought and water conservation. Given Alameda's limited control over the drinking water supply, projections for future drought conditions are relevant only so far as they influence conservation practices in the City.  Cal-Adapt is developing long-term, downscaled drought projections for specific locations in California, which may be available in late 2018/early 2019. These projections will inform drought contingency plans for water suppliers and will provide further justification for water conservation efforts in Alameda. Vulnerability Assessment Summary Alameda has not conducted a specific assessment of asset vulnerability to drought, likely due to the lack of direct control it has over its water supply, and no comprehensive vulnerability assessment is necessary. EBMUD has conducted extensive analyses of the vulnerability of its water supply overall to the risks posed by increasingly severe and prolonged droughts. Alameda can leverage the findings of EBMUD assessments to identify strategies for reducing per capita water consumption.\nThe other main impact of extreme heat is on transportation infrastructure. Roadways are more susceptible to damage during extreme heat events due to pavement softening, and rail lines can buckle during heat waves as metal becomes more pliable. Task 1 Report August 30, 2018 31 Vulnerability Assessment Summary Caltrans conducted a vulnerability assessment in 2018 that describes the risk extreme heat events pose to transportation assets in California (Caltrans, 2018). The findings apply to Alameda, especially as heat events become more severe and prolonged due to climate change. The City has not conducted a detailed evaluation of its residents' vulnerability to extreme heat. Exposure No assessments have directly considered the exposure of specific assets, services, or sectors to extreme heat events. Similarly, no assessments have evaluated the extent to which an increase in extreme heat events is likely to impact Alameda's residents. Generally speaking, extreme heat events occur at a wide scale, with the exception of local urban heat island effects. Therefore, the majority of Alameda residents would be exposed to these events if they increase in the future as projected. An assessment of Alameda's exposure to extreme heat would focus on disadvantaged communities and other residents that may be highly vulnerable to the impacts, using information such as BCDC's community vulnerability mapping effort, EPA's EJSCREEN tool, and CalEnviroScreen to identify at-risk populations."}, {"section_title": "Heat", "text": "Extreme heat events, including hot days, warm nights, and heat waves, are an issue that is expected to increase in severity and duration.

There is consensus that climate change will exacerbate the conditions that can lead to fires, but it is difficult to project wildfires because of interannual variability and other drivers.
