[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": ". We began this series in 2000 with the aim of making available in an easily accessible format all the advances on the genetic basis of a large family of exercise-related traits. The current review presents the 2004 update of the human gene map for physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes. It is based on peer-reviewed papers published by the end of 2004. The genes and markers with evidence of association or linkage with a performance or fitness phenotype in sedentary or active people, in adaptation to acute exercise, or for training-induced changes are positioned on the genetic map of all autosomes and the X chromosome. Negative studies are reviewed but a gene or locus must be supported by at least one positive study before being inserted on the map. One new feature is that we have incorporated the genes whose sequence variants have been associated with either the level of physical activity or indicators of sedentarism. By the end of 2000, in the early version of the gene map, 29 loci were depicted. In contrast, the 2004 human gene map for physical performance and health-related phenotypes includes 140 autosomal gene entries and quantitative trait loci, plus four on the X chromosome. Moreover, there are 16 mitochondrial genes in which sequence variants have been shown to influence relevant fitness and performance phenotypes. Thus, the map is growing in complexity and progress is being made. The number of laboratories and scientists concerned by the role of genes and sequence variations in exercise-related traits is rising. But exercise science and sports medicine is generally lagging behind in terms of utilizing the advances in genetic and genomic technologies."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "T his paper constitutes the fifth installment in the series on the human gene map for performance and health-related fitness phenotypes published in this journal. It covers the peer-reviewed literature published by the end of December 2004. The search for relevant publications is primarily based on the journals available in MEDLINE, the National Library of Medicine's publication database covering the fields of life sciences, biomedicine and health, using a combination of key words (e.g., exercise, physical activity, performance, training, genetics, genotype, polymorphism, mutation, and linkage). Other sources include personal reprint collections of the authors and documents made available to us by colleagues who are publishing in this field. The electronic prepublications, that is, articles that are made available on the web site of a journal before being published in print are not included in the current review. The goal of the human gene map for fitness and performance is to review all genetic loci and markers shown to be related to physical performance or healthrelated fitness phenotypes in at least one study. Negative studies are briefly reviewed for a balanced presentation of the evidence. However, the nonsignificant results are not incorporated in the summary tables.\nThe physical performance phenotypes for which genetic data are available include cardiorespiratory endurance, elite endurance athlete status, muscle strength, other muscle performance traits, and exercise intolerance of variable degrees. Consistent with the previous reviews, the phenotypes of health-related fitness retained are grouped under the following categories: hemodynamic traits including exercise heart rate, blood pressure, and heart morphology; anthropometry and body composition; insulin and glucose metabolism; and blood lipid, lipoprotein, and hemostatic factors. Here, we are not concerned by the effects of specific genes on these phenotypes unless the focus is on exercise, exercise training, athletes, or active people compared with controls or inactive individuals, or exercise intolerance. This is particularly important for the genetic studies that have focused on body mass index, adiposity, fat-free mass, adipose tissue distribution, and various abdominal fat phenotypes. If there were no exercise-related issues in those studies, the papers are not considered here. However, the interested reader can obtain a full expose of these other studies in one of our complementary papers published every year in Obesity Research under the general theme of the status of the human obesity gene map (125) , or can consult the following e-version of this other map: http://obesitygene.pbrc.edu.\nThe studies incorporated in the review are fully referenced so that the interested reader can access the original papers. Of interest to some could be the early observations made on athletes, particularly Olympic athletes. The results of these case-control studies based on common red blood cell enzymes were essentially negative and are not reviewed in this edition of the map. The interested reader can consult the first installment of the gene map for a complete summary of these early reports (138) . (139) . We have also depicted in Figure 2 the gene loci in the mitochondrial DNA in which sequence variants have been shown to be associated with fitness and performance phenotypes. Table 1 provides a list of all genes or loci, cytogenic locations, and conventional symbols used in this re-view. The terminology and symbols used are as defined in the footnote to the Tables.\nThe reader will have noticed that the human gene map for performance and health-related fitness traits is now produced by an expanded team of scientists. Indeed, the original team put together by T. Rankinen and C. Bouchard, which included L. P\u00e9russe, R. Rauramaa, M. A. Rivera, and B. Wolfarth, has now been reinforced by contributions from M. S. Bray, J. M. Hagberg, and S. M. Roth. This reflects the fact that the project is growing in scope and complexity. We believe that this expanded team will be able to provide a thorough coverage of all the advances in the field and make it possible to deliver a publication ready product in a timely fashion. It remains our collective goal to make this publication a useful resource for those who have to teach the role of inheritance on fitness and performance traits and the impact of genetic variation on the health of human beings. It is also our hope that the yearly update of the fitness and performance gene map will be found useful to the exercise scientists and the sports medicine community."}, {"section_title": "PERFORMANCE PHENOTYPES Endurance Phenotypes", "text": "Case-control studies. The case-control studies reporting statistically significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies between endurance athletes and sedentary controls are summarized in Table 2 . Three papers were published in 2004. In a Turkish study comparing 80 university athletes with the same number of healthy volunteers, Turgut and coworkers found a significant difference for the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism, with more athletes carrying the I-allele (196) . Participants of two consecutive South African Ironman Triathlons were investigated with regard to the ACE I/D polymorphism. The fastest 100 South African-born finishers had a higher frequency of the I allele, compared with 166 South Africanborn controls. In addition the authors found a significant linear trend for the allele distribution among the fastest 100 finishers, the slowest 100 finishers and 199 South Africanborn controls. The frequencies of the I allele were 0.52, 0.48, and 0.42, respectively (20) . In the same group of triathletes, allele and genotype frequencies of the \u03ea55 C/T polymorphism of the uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) gene did not differ between the fast and slow finishers (60) .\nCross-sectional association studies. Five new studies published in 2004 investigated cross-sectional associations between DNA sequence variation and endurancerelated phenotypes (Table 3) . McCole et al. (99) investigated postmenopausal women and found an association between the adrenergic receptor \u24242 (ADRB2) Gln27Glu genotype and arterial-venous oxygen difference (a-vDO 2 ) during submaximal and maximal exercise. The Gln/Gln homozygote women showed 1.2-2 mL\u00b7100 mL \u03ea1 greater a-vDO 2 compared with the Glu/Glu carriers. In the same cohort, the Gln carriers had higher values for maximum oxygen uptake (V O 2max ) than the Glu carriers. In addition, the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the adrenergic receptor \u24243 (ADRB3) gene was investigated and revealed a significant difference between the Trp/Trp homozygotes and Trp/Arg heterozygotes with higher V O 2max in the latter group. However, the association disappeared after adjusting for habitual physical activity level. All other phenotypes showed no significant associations with the ADRB3 polymorphism (99) .\nDelta efficiency (DE) was significantly associated with the Bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2) genotype (\u03e99/9) in a study including 115 sedentary men and women. The BDKRB2 genotype (\u03ea9/9) had the highest DE and in a multivariate analysis, including gender as a covariate, the BDKRB2 genotype accounted for 11.2% of the variance in DE. In an interaction analysis including also the ACE I/D genotype, those with the highest predicted kinin receptor activity (ACE I/I and BDKRB2 \u03ea9/9) had a significantly higher DE compared with those with the lowest kinin receptor activity. The ACE D/D and BDKRB2 \u03e99/\u03e99 combination was also found more often in a group of longdistance runners competing in short endurance events than in athletes from long-distance events (\u03fe5000 m) (210) . Oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients was found to be associated with the ACE I/D genotype after a graded exercise test on an ergometer. In patients with the D/D genotype, DO 2 after exercise was significantly lower compared with patients carrying the I/D and the I/I genotype. However, no difference was found between genotype groups with regard to DO 2 in the resting state (74) . The ACE I/D polymorphism was targeted as a candidate gene for exercise heat tolerance in a study by Heled and coworkers (57) . After exposing 58 subjects to a 2-h exercise heat-tolerance test, they found the relative changes in body core temperature, heat storage, and heart rate during the test to be lower in the I-allele carriers as compared with the D/D genotype group. However, they found no association for various aerobic performance measures including V O 2max and V O 2 at anaerobic threshold (57) . In a study including 199 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure, peak V O 2 before and after beta-blockade did not differ between the ACE I/D genotypes (25) .\nAssociation studies with training response phenotypes. A cohort of 95 COPD patients was submitted to an 8-wk pulmonary rehabilitation program including five (89) ."}, {"section_title": "Linkage Studies", "text": "The HERITAGE Family Study cohort was used for a genomewide linkage scan for V O 2max and maximal power output (W max ).

The studies reporting candidate gene associations with muscle strength or anaerobic performance phenotypes are summarized in Table 5 . In 2004, seven studies reported data related to muscle strength phenotypes. van Rossum and colleagues (200) reported the significant association of the ER22/23EK polymorphism within the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) with arm and leg muscle strength in men but not women. Arm and leg strength was measured using arm pull dynamometry and high jump, respectively. Grundberg et al. (47) Roth et al. (160) reported significant associations with the VDR FokI polymorphism (f and F alleles) and knee extensor isometric strength in 302 older Caucasian men. However, these associations were no longer significant once leg fat-free mass was accounted for in the models, suggesting that the genotype-strength associations were explained by differences in muscle mass. Schrager and colleagues(166) examined the ApaI polymorphism (A/G) of the insulinlike growth factor-2 (IGF2) gene in relation to muscle strength and power phenotypes in 485 men and women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. They reported significantly lower arm and leg isokinetic strength measures in women homozygous for the A allele compared with G/G homozygotes; these differences were not observed in men. Thomis and colleagues (184) studied polymorphisms in both myostatin (GDF8) and ACE genes in relation to elbow flexor strength responses to resistance training in 57 young men. Only one rare allele was observed for any of the four myostatin variants, preventing analyses for that gene. For the ACE insertion/ deletion (I/D) polymorphism, no significant differences were observed for either baseline strength or the response of strength to resistance training. Hopkinson et al. (59) reported significantly higher knee extensor maximal strength in COPD patients carrying the ACE D-allele compared with the I/I patients. This association was not observed in 101 age-matched healthy controls. Finally, Riechman and coworkers (151) reported no association between the interleukin-15 receptor gene (IL15RA) and the gain in arm or leg one-repetition maximum strength in response to strength training in 153 young men and women."}, {"section_title": "Linkage studies.", "text": "In 2004, two investigations provided linkage results relevant to muscle strength phenotypes (Table 4) . Huygens et al. (62) performed a linkage analysis in 329 young Caucasian male siblings from 146 families using a marker in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1; D13S153) for trunk strength. LOD scores between 1.62 and 2.78 (P \u03fd 0.002) were reported for trunk flexion measures with no evidence of linkage for trunk extension phenotypes. In a second study, Huygens and colleagues (61) performed a similar linkage analysis for various measures of muscle mass and strength in the same young male cohort with microsatellite markers selected in the vicinity of 10 candidate genes from the myostatin pathway. Suggestive linkages were reported with markers D2S118, D6S1051, and D11S4138 for knee extension and flexion peak torque measures. These markers are located within 12,000 -680,000 base pairs of the myostatin (GDF8), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and myogenic factor 3 (MYOD1) gene loci, respectively (61)."}, {"section_title": "HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS PHENOTYPES Hemodynamic Phenotypes", "text": "Acute exercise. Eisenach et al. (31) studied the effect of the Arg16Gly ADRB2 variant on hemodynamic responses during handgrip exercise to fatigue in young, nonobese, normotensive men and women (Table 6 ). They found that peak heart rate at fatigue during the handgrip exercise was significantly higher in Gly16 than Arg16 homozygotes (100 \u03ee 4 vs 93 \u03ee 3 beats\u2150min \u03ea1 , P \u03ed 0.001). Heled and coworkers (57) investigated the effect of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism on the interindividual variability of hemodynamic responses to a 2-h exercise heattolerance test . They found that D/D homozygotes tended to have a higher heart rate response at the end of the 2 h of exercise in a warm, humid environment than I allele carriers (P \u03ed 0.06).\nKanazawa and coworkers (74) investigated the effect of the ACE I/D polymorphism on pulmonary hemodynamics and O 2 delivery during exercise in patients with COPD. They found that with exercise mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were greater in ACE D than I homozygotes, whereas O 2 delivery showed the opposite relationship with ACE genotype, with ACE D homozygotes having lower O 2 delivery than ACE I homozygotes. In all cases, ACE I/D heterozygotes had values intermediate between the two homozygote groups.\nMcCole and coworkers (99) studied the hemodynamic responses of postmenopausal women to submaximal and maximal treadmill exercise. They found that the Gln27Glu variant at the ADRB2 locus was independently associated with only a-vDO 2 during submaximal and maximal exercise. The Trp64Arg ADRB3 variant did not independently associate with any hemodynamic responses to submaximal or maximal exercise. Woods and colleagues (218) reported that acute exercise -induced increase in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II levels were not associated with the ACE I/D genotype."}, {"section_title": "Gene-physical activity interactions", "text": "Franks and coworkers (36) in a large population study in England found that the inverse relationship usually evident between physical activity levels and blood pressure was not present in carriers of the minor alleles, but was seen in common homozygotes at the G-62A and C914T loci within the G-protein coupled receptor 10 (GPR10) gene (Table 6 ). Haplotypes incorporating the G-62A and C914T loci interacted with physical activity levels to significantly associate with diastolic blood pressure (P \u03ed 0.023) while tending to associate with systolic blood pressure (P \u03ed 0.08).\nMcCole and coworkers (99) studied the hemodynamic responses of postmenopausal women ranging from sedentary to endurance-trained athletes to submaximal and max- imal treadmill exercise. They found that the Gln27Glu variant at the ADRB2 locus interacted with habitual physical activity levels to significantly affect only a-vDO 2 during submaximal exercise. The Trp64Arg variant of the ADRB3 did not interact with habitual physical activity levels to affect any hemodynamic responses to submaximal or maximal exercise (99) .\nTraining response. No new studies on the associations between candidate genes and hemodynamic phenotype training responses were published in 2004 (Table 7) ."}, {"section_title": "Linkage studies", "text": "No linkage studies pertaining to the response of hemodynamic phenotypes to exercise were reported in 2004 (Table 8) .\nExercise and familial cardiac arrhythmias. No new mutations underlying exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias were reported in 2004."}, {"section_title": "Anthropometry and Body Composition Phenotypes", "text": "Association studies. Three studies reported significant associations between candidate genes and phenotypes related to body composition in response to exercise (Table  9 ). In one study, changes in percent body fat, fat mass, and trunk fat in response to 24 wk of endurance exercise were tested for associations with polymorphisms in the alpha-2B-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), ADRB2, and ADRB3 genes in 29 sedentary men and 41 postmenopausal women (127) . No association was found with the ADRA2B gene, but body fat changes were associated with variation in the ADRB2 and ADRB3 genes. The three adrenergic receptor gene interactions were also significant. A second study examined whether polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide (CYP19), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes were associated with changes in body fatness after a year-long exercise intervention trial in 173 postmenopausal women (197) . One polymorphism in the CYP19 gene was associated with greater reductions in BMI, percent body fat, and fat mass, whereas one polymorphism in the COMT gene was associated with a smaller decrease in percent body fat. The third study examined the contribution of polymorphisms in the IL15RA gene in muscle phenotype responses to 10 wk of resistance exercise training in 153 men and women (151) . Polymorphisms in the exon 4 and the untranslated region of exon 7 of the IL15RA gene were associated with muscle mass response to exercise and explained 7.1 and 3.5% of the gains in lean body mass, respectively. The IL15RA poylmorphism was also associated with changes in leg and arm circumferences (151) . Linkage studies. No linkage studies pertaining to the response of body composition to exercise training were reported in 2004 (Table 10) .\nInsulin and glucose metabolism phenotypes. A total of four studies reported associations between candidate genes and the response of glucose and/or insulin metabolism phenotypes to exercise (Table 11 ). The effects of the Gln27Glu and Arg16Gly polymorphism of the ADRB2 gene on glucose metabolism was investigated in 124 Japanese men who participated in a 3-month exercise program of low to moderate intensity (65) . No association was found with the metabolic characteristics at baseline, but changes in fructosamine levels, an indicator of the average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 wk, were greater in the Glu allele carriers than in the noncarriers (P \u03ed 0.0005). No association was found between the two ADRB2 polymorphisms and changes in body fatness.\nIn a second study, polymorphisms in the leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes were tested for association with glucose homeostasis in response to endurance exercise in 397 men and women from the HERITAGE Family Study (85) . The LEPR K109R, Q223R, and K656N polymorphisms were associated with exerciseinduced changes in various measures of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. A polymorphism in the LEP gene (A19G) was also found to be associated with exercise-induced changes in fasting insulin. A third study examined the influence of the interleukin 6 (IL6) 174G/C polymorphism on changes in various indicators of glucose tolerance after 24 wk of aerobic exercise in 56 men and women (101) . The training-induced changes in glucose area under the curve were significantly associated with the IL6 polymorphism, whereas no association was found with training-induced changes in other indicators of glucose tolerance and body fatness. Finally, a polymorphism in the promoter of the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene was investigated for its association with the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in 522 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) randomized to either an intervention (detailed advices on diet and exercise to reduce body weight) group (N \u03ed 248) or a control group (187) . A significant interaction was found between the LIPC polymorphism and the study group (P \u03ed 0.024), which resulted in a significant effect of the polymorphism in the rate of conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to Type 2 diabetes in the intervention group but not in the control group. No linkage studies pertaining to the responses of insulin and glucose metabolism phenotypes to exercise training were reported in 2004 (Table 12) .\nBlood lipid and lipoprotein phenotypes. In 2004, four new papers were published that included lipid responses to acute or chronic exercise and/or physical activity (Table 13 ). Woo et al. (215) investigated the association between variation in the apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) gene and plasma lipid response after 6 d of acute submaximal aerobic exercise in 100 Korean men. Individuals with a S2/S2 genotype had significantly higher triglyceride (TG) levels at baseline and significantly greater decreases in TG after exercise (after adjustment for baseline values) compared with S1/S1 or S1/S2 genotypes. Measures of total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), glucose, and insulin were not different by genotypes either before or after acute exercise (215)."}, {"section_title": "Leon et al. (89) studied the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on lipid responses after 3 d\u00b7wk", "text": "\u03ea1 exercise training for 20 wk in a family-based cohort of white and black men and women from the HERITAGE study. Distinct race and gender differences in exercise training lipid response by APOE genotype were observed. Of all race and gender groups, white women experienced the greatest number of APOE-related changes after exercise, with significant changes by genotype for LDL-C, HDL-C, HDL-C fractions, VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) levels. The greatest differences in lipid changes after exercise were generally between the 2/* genotype classes versus the 4/4 genotype class. White women with an APOE 4/4 genotype exhibited dramatic decreases in triglycerides and somewhat smaller decreases in apo AI and HDL 2 -C and an increase in LDL-C, whereas women with a 2/4 genotype experienced changes in the opposite direction for all of these measures. In contrast to white women, the only lipidrelated measure showing a significant difference by APOE genotype after exercise in black women was in apo AI levels, which decreased for individuals with a 2/4 genotype but increased in all other genotype classes. White men were the only group that experienced a significant change in TC levels by APOE genotype after exercise, with individuals carrying an E2 allele showing decreased TC and individuals with 3/3, 3/4, or 4/4 genotypes showing increased levels of TC after exercise training. No other race or gender group demonstrated any significant exercise-related change in TC by APOE genotype. White men also demonstrated significant APOErelated changes in LDL-C, VLDL-C, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) levels. The most dramatic differences in lipid values in the white men were for triglycerides, in which the 2/2, 2/3, 3/3, and 3/4 genotype classes exhibited substantial decreases after exercise but individuals with a 4/4 genotype experienced a large gain in triglyceride levels. The only significant APOE-related change after exercise in black men was in LDL-C, in which individuals with a 2/3 or 2/4 genotyped showed decreases and those with a 3/3, 3/4, or 4/4 genotype showed increases in LDL-C (89) .\nIn a study by Thompson et al. (185) , the association between APOE genotype and serum lipids after chronic exercise was assessed in healthy sedentary subjects who underwent 6 months of 4 d\u00b7wk \u03ea1 aerobic exercise training. After adjustment for baseline values, BMI, and age, APOE genotype was significantly associated with TC/HDL, LDL/ HDL, and ApoB/AI ratios, with APOE 2/3 and 3/3 subjects experiencing small decreases in each of these values and APOE 3/4 subjects experiencing slight increases in these values after exercise training. Surprisingly, measures of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, APOB, HDL-cholesterol fractions, Apo AI, and postheparin hepatic triglyceride lipase were not different among APOE genotype groups in the total cohort either before or after exercise. \nBMI, body mass index; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; GH, growth hormone; RER, respiratory exchange ratio; FM, fat mass; %FAT, percent body fat. \nQTL, human quantitative trait locus identified from a genome scan; FFM, fat-free mass; FM, fat mass; %FAT, percent body fat; ATF, total abdominal fat; ASF, abdominal subcutaneous fat.\nLipoprotein lipase levels were significantly different among women only (N \u03ed 60) in the Thompson study (185), with subjects with APOE 3/3 genotype exhibiting decreased levels and 2/3 and 3/4 genotypes showing increased levels of the enzyme. Mukherjee et al. (111) reported a significant interaction between variation within the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene and physical activity in predicting serum HDL-C levels in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and healthy controls (N \u03ed 390 males, N \u03ed 114 females). In CAD cases only, active men and women (those who exercised the equivalent of an h daily walk) with a B1/B1 genotype had significantly higher HDL cholesterol levels compared with individuals with B1/B2 or B2/B2 genotypes, regardless of activity level. This association was also found in all 2-and 3-vessel CAD cases (but not 1-vessel) and in individuals with a previous myocardial infarction (111) . Hemostatic factors, inflammation phenotypes, and plasma hormone levels. Aerobic exercise training for six months, which led to a 24% increase in V O 2max , was associated with a statistically significant decrease in plasma coagulation factor VII antigen level in middle-aged men and women. However, the change was unrelated to coagulation factor VII gene polymorphisms [(\u03ea323 (0/10 bp/401 (G/T) haplotype or \u03ea402 G/A) genotype.]. On the other hand, factor VII antigen changes associated with apolipoprotein E genotype as well as with ATPase binding cassette-1 genotype (44) .\nC-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of chronic low-grade inflammation, has been shown to be inversely associated with physical activity. Training (118) or strenuous exercise (13) -induced changes in plasma CRP levels appear, however, to be independent of genetic polymorphisms at the CRP gene loci. On the other hand, plasma CRP is induced by IL-6, which in turn is partly regulated by another pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1. Resistance exercise has been reported to associate with gene expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis alpha depending on IL-1beta genotype (28).\nRiechman et al. (152) investigated the association between a G\u03feA polymorphism in the 3= region of the steroid sulfatase (STS) gene and changes in plasma dehydropediandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated conjugate, DHEAS, levels after resistance exercise and training. The investigators reported that carriers of the G allele experienced significantly greater increases in DHEA after acute and chronic exercise and DHEA/DHEAS ratio after chronic exercise only, compared with A/A homozygotes for the STS gene (152) .\nChronic diseases. Slattery and colleagues (177) investigated the interactions between physical activity and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms on the risk of colon and rectal cancers in two case-control cohorts. There was a significant interaction between physical activity and the Fok1 polymorphism of the VDR gene on the colon cancer risk. Sedentary ff homozygotes had over threefold increased risk and physically active FF homozygotes had over twofold increased risk of developing colon cancer compared with the ff homozygotes who reported high levels of physical activity (177) .\nExercise intolerance. Four studies reporting four new genes related to exercise intolerance were published in 2004 (Table 14) . Hellerud and coworkers (58) reported a 20-yr follow-up study of two boys with glycerol kinase (GK) deficiency due to a deletion of exon 17 and an A/G mutation in exon 7 of the GK gene. Both subjects showed pronounced exercise intolerance in childhood. However, the exerciserelated symptoms, as well as symptoms invoked by fasting, had disappeared when the subjects were retested at 23 and 31 yr of age (58) . Pantoja-Martinez and colleagues (123) reported a case study of a 7-yr-old boy suffering from intense muscle pain after physical exercise. Myalgia coincided with greatly elevated (16 times normal) creatine kinase levels, which were normalized at rest. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD1) deficiency was confirmed from skeletal muscle biopsy. DNA analysis identified the boy to a homozygote for the Q12X nonsense mutation in exon 2 of the AMPD1 gene leading to a truncated and inactive form of the enzyme (123). Three novel mutations in the sarcoglycan gamma gene (SGCG) were reported in two Turkish and one Moroccan males with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (201) . All patients had experienced progressive walking disturbances, exercise intolerance, and leg pains for several years, and clinical examination confirmed the limb-girdle weakness and calf hypertrophy. DNA sequence analysis identified a homozygous splice site mutation in exon 5 in the Turkish brothers, whereas a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 2, which replaces a tryptophan residue at codon 31 by a premature stop codon, was found in the Moroccan patient (201) . McFarland et al. (100) reported a reexamination of an exercise intolerance patient, whose symptoms were initially attributed to a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Phe) gene (MTTF). However, resequencing of the patient's entire mitochondrial DNA revealed that the true pathogenic mutation was a T to C substitution in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (MTCO2) gene, which changes the encoded amino acid from leucine to proline in a highly conserved region of the enzyme. Considering the high mutation rate in the mitochondrial genome, these data emphasize the importance of the whole mitochondrial genome sequencing in the detection of causal mutations for mitochondrial disorders (100). Physical activity. The previous editions of the Human Fitness Gene map have focused exclusively on physiological and biological traits in the context of acute and chronic exercise. This year we are incorporating for the first time a section on genes and physical activity (behavior). Although both environmental and social factors have major influence on the habitual physical activity levels, both twin and family studies support the notion that genetic factors are also involved. Studies in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins have consistently reported greater intraclass correlations for activity traits in MZ than in DZ twins. Likewise, family studies have reported greater between family than within family variance in phenotypes reflecting physical activity and sedentarism. Heritability estimates have ranged from 30 to 83% in twin studies and from 10 to 30% in studies with nuclear families.\nData on molecular genetics of physical activity levels in humans are still scarce. However, animal studies provide several examples how genes may affect physical activity patterns. For example, mice lacking the dopamine transporter gene exhibit marked hyperactivity (39) , whereas dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) deficient mice are characterized by reduced physical activity levels (78) . Another example of the potential involvement of a gene in physical activity regulation comes from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). These insects exhibit two distinct activity patterns related to food-search behavior; rovers move about twice the distance while feeding compared with sitters. This activity pattern is genetically determined and is regulated by the dg2 gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (121) . PKG activity is significantly higher in wild-type rovers than in wild-type and mutant sitters and activation of the dg2 gene reverts foraging behavior from a sitter to a rover. Furthermore, overexpression of the dg2 gene in sitters changed their behavior to the rover phenotype (121) .\nAssociation studies. Only a few association studies on DNA sequence variation in candidate genes and physical activity traits are available (Table 15 ). The candidate genes with positive findings include DRD2, ACE, LEPR, calciumsensing receptor (CASR), and aromatase (CYP19A1). The first three genes were investigated with an a priori hypothesis on the association between physical activity and DNA sequence variation (175, 178, 213) . In the other studies, the activity traits were treated as covariates in association analyses focusing on other target traits (bone mineral density (BMD)) (91, 162) .\nSimonen and coworkers (175) investigated the associations between physical activity phenotypes and DNA sequence variation in the DRD2 gene locus in the Qu\u00e9bec Family Study (QFS) and the HERITAGE Family Study subjects. In both cohorts, a C/T transition in codon 313 of the gene was associated with physical activity levels in white women. The T/T homozygote women of the QFS reported significantly less weekly activities during the previous yr than the heterozygotes and the C/C homozygotes. Similarly, among the white women of the HERITAGE Family Study, the T/T homozygotes showed lower sports and work indices derived from the ARICBaecke questionnaire than the other genotypes. No associations were found in males or in black women (175) . In Pima Indians, a glutamine (Gln) to arginine (Arg) substitution in codon 223 of the LEPR gene was associated with total physical activity, calculated by dividing 24-h energy expenditure by sleeping energy expenditure measured in a respiratory chamber. The Arg233Arg homozygotes showed about 5% lower physical activity level than the Gln223Gln homozygotes (178) . Winnicki et al. (213) investigated the determinants of habitual physical activity level in a group of never-treated stage I hypertensives. Physical activity was assessed by a questionnaire and the subjects were classified as sedentary or exercisers (leisure or sports activities at least once a week during the previous 2 months). The ACE I/D genotype, age, sex, marital status, profession, and coffee and alcohol consumption were included as predictors of physical activity level in the regression model. The ACE genotype and marital status were the strongest contributors to physical activity status. The frequency of the D/D genotype was significantly higher in the sedentary group than among active subjects approximately 76% of the D/D homozygotes were sedentary, whereas the corresponding frequency in the I-allele homozygotes was 48% (213).\nLorentzon and colleagues (91) investigated the associations between the CASR gene polymorphism and BMD and its predictors, including habitual physical activity, in adolescent Swedish girls. The weekly amount of weight-bearing physical activity during the previous year was estimated using a standardized questionnaire, and a G/T transversion in codon 986 inducing an alanine to serine substitution was genotyped with a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Carriers of the serine allele reported about 1.4 h less physical activity per week than the homozygotes for the alanine allele (91) . In postmenopausal Finnish women, a TTTA repeat in intron 4 of the CYP19A1 gene was not associated with BMD, fracture risk, or circulating estradiol levels (162) . Physical activity was the only predictor of bone health that was associated with the CYP19A1 genotype. The proportion of physically active persons, defined as 3 or more hours of physical activity per week, was 36.6, 25.7, and 19.6% in women with short, midsize, and long TTTA repeats, respectively (162) . Linkage studies. The first genomewide linkage scan for physical activity traits was carried out in the Qu\u00e9bec Family Study cohort (176) . The scan was based on 432 polymorphic markers genotyped in 767 subjects from 207 families. Physical activity measures were derived from a 3-d activity diary (total daily activity, inactivity, moderate to strenuous activity) and an 11-item questionnaire (weekly physical activity during the past year). The strongest evidence of linkage (P \u03ed 0.0012) was detected on chromosome 2p22-p16 with the physical inactivity phenotype. Suggestive linkages were also found on 13q22 with total daily activity and moderate to strenuous activity phenotypes, and on 7p11 with both inactivity and moderate to strenuous activity (Table 15 ). In addition, weekly activity during the past yr showed suggestive evidence of linkage on 11p15 and 15q13, inactivity on 20q12, and moderate to strenuous activity on 4q31 and 9q31 (176)."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "This review provides a compendium of all genes and markers that have been associated with performance and health-related fitness phenotypes in scientific papers published by the end of 2004. Even those who know little about molecular biology realize that exciting advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular and cellular regulation of the adaptation to activity and inactivity in the last decade. These advances have been recently summarized in a book entirely devoted to this topic (110) . Although we have a long way to go, we are beginning to understand which genes and pathways are contributing to the response of various tissues and organs to acute or repeated exposures to exercise or muscle contractions. These studies are of paramount importance if we are to understand the true biological determinants of physical performance and of the role of regular exercise in disease prevention or of physical inactivity in common chronic diseases and premature death.\nIn contrast, little progress has been made with respect to the genetic basis of human variation in performance and health-related fitness. Indeed, although a growing number of genes are being identified, only a handful of them have been investigated with a view to assess whether DNA sequence variation in such genes play a role in the biological basis of human individuality. The latter is a topic that has received only very limited attention to date. The current stagnation on the genetic front needs to benefit from the advances that are taking place in the broader field of the molecular and cellular biology of exercise.\nThe 2004 map includes 140 autosomal entries, four X chromosome assignments and 16 mitochondrial DNA markers. There are 33 nuclear and one mitochondrial genome markers more than in 2003. Given the complexity of the performance and health-related fitness phenotypes, it should be obvious that we have a long way to go before we have a satisfactory understanding of the role of genetic inheritance on exercise related traits and in the adaptation to a physically active lifestyle. A new section added to the review this year is that of the role of genes and specific DNA sequence variations on the level of sedentarism or the level of physical activity. Hopefully, it will be of interest to all those who study the circumstances under which people change from a sedentary behavior to a physically active lifestyle. As in previous years, we conclude that advances in the genomics of fitness and performance are registered at a very modest pace. Given the growing prevalence in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases associated with physical inactivity, an increased understanding of how the genetic susceptibilities that lead to these diseases may interact with exercise and physical activity interventions is urgently needed. Despite the fact that progress has not been as spectacular as in other areas, particularly common chronic diseases, there are a growing number of genes with at least a minimum of evidence supporting their involvement in fitness and performance related phenotypes. This is illustrated by the trends in the number of loci from 2000 to 2004 for the families of phenotypes as defined in this review. Table 16 presents this synthesis for the 10 classes of phenotypes considered here. In each case, the number of genes or markers appears to increase steadily since the topic was first reviewed in 2000."}]
