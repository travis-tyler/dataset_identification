Additionally, the shift over the *The views expressed are those of the author and should not be attributed to the Economic Research Service or USDA. 1 For example, a study by [1] showed that between 1991 and 2009, agricultural production shifted to larger farms. In 1991, family farms with production of more than $1 million accounted for 21 percent of total production. By 2009, this sales class accounted for 39 percent of farm production. The same study documents over the same time period, using median rate of return on equity, the higher profitability of these larger farms compared to farms in smaller sales categories. Theoretical Economics Letters signed into law on March 23, 2010 , has implications for the source of health insurance coverage for farm operator households and possibly for how much of their time they allocate to off-farm employment. The ACA requires employers with at least 50 full-time-equivalent employees to offer \"affordable\" health insurance to employees working 30 or more hours per week. This requirement of the ACA may have implications on both the levels of offered weekly work hours by employers in the off-farm labor markets and on off-farm hourly-wages, particularly for the young and low educated individuals [14] .\nConsidering the importance of the income from off-farm wages and/or salaries and/or off-farm business to the wellbeing of farm households, and of the employer-provided health insurance, the need to examine how a labor allocation decision by the farm operator that heavily favors off-farm employment may impact the per-hour off-farm earning capacity of the farm operator becomes evident. 3 The specific objective of this study is to investigate, in accordance with the theory of equalizing differences as proposed by Rosen [12] , if there is a difference in the effect of working full-time off the farm on the hourly off-farm wage rates among two diverse groups of farm operators; those who have employer-provided health insurance coverage, and those who obtain health insurance coverage from \"other\" sources. 4 To allow for the discernment of impact of full-time work at various locations of the distribution of wage rates\nand not just at the \"mean\", the paper utilizes a conditional quantile regression developed by [16] ."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "A general view among economists is that an employer seeking to maximize profit would react to costs associated with the provision of health insurance coverage by lowering wages, an action which is undertaken to ensure the maintenance of the total reward package paid to employees. Despite such a stipulated inverse relationship between wages and health insurance benefits, existing research on the subject continues to be mixed where some studies point to evidence in support of the theory of compensating differential originated by [12] , while others stand in opposition or find evidence of a trivial impact.\nEarly research by [17] found, based on multivariate analysis and data from the 1974 Rand Health Insurance Experiment, a positive, albeit statistically insignificant association between wages and employer-paid total health insurance premiums even after controlling for worker characteristics. Using a hedonic wage 3 A study by Riportella and O'Neil [15] notes that under the ACA, members of farm families no longer need to work off-farm just for the purpose to secure affordable health insurance. Furthermore, since only income and family size are considered under the ACA, even farm families with high net worth (land, buildings, equipment, etc.) can qualify for health insurance through expanded Medicaid because the ACA does not include an \"asset test\" for eligibility nor for premium tax credits. 4 Other sources of health insurance coverage include a direct purchase of private policy by or for the household, the farming operation associated with the farm household, A paper by [21] reviewed an extensive and diverse body of empirical studies that emerged in prior years to assess the impact of health insurance on the labor market, with the summary of evidence showing that employees, as a group, ultimately bear the costs of any payments an employer makes for health insurance.\nOlson [22] used health insurance coverage from the 1990-1993 CPS along with two-stage lease squares estimation to discern the impact of employer-provided health insurance on wages of married women with full-time employment. Findings indicated, in contrast to a number of earlier studies, a 20% discount in wages resulting from health insurance coverage. Goldman, Sood, and Leibowitz [23] examined information for employees under age 65 at a single U.S. firm in addition to information on employee compensation decisions during a three-year period (1989-1991) when health insurance premiums were rising rapidly. Findings suggested that about two-thirds of the increase in health insurance premium was financed out of cash wages and the remaining one-third was financed by a reduction in benefits."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The primary data source for this study is the 2015 ARMS.

These results of discounted off-farm wages at the 50 th and 75 th percentiles of the off-farm wage distribution for farmers with \"full-time\" off-farm employment and who have health insurance coverage through their \"off-farm\" employer, and especially those results of the larger drop in off-farm wages for farmers across all the percentiles relative to when health insurance coverage is obtained from other sources, are consistent with the notion of compensating differential as prescribed to in the compensating wage theory. 21 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Data from the 2015 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and quantile regression were used to discern the effect of working \"full-time\" off the farm and of \"other\" factors on the hourly off-farm wage rates among U.S. farm operators.\nThe specific groups of targeted operators were those with an \"employer-provided\" health insurance coverage, and those with health insurance coverage obtained from \"other\" sources.\nThis research finds, based on the use of a quantile regression procedure to estimate a \"Mincerian\" wage equation, a statistically negative association between \"full-time\" off-farm work and off-farm wages, but only for those operators in both categories of health insurance coverage who are already located in the higher portions of their respective off-farm wage distributions. While the result that alludes to a trade-off between off-farm wages and health insurance for farmers who work \"full-time\" off the farm regardless to whether health insurance is provided by an off-farm employer or from other sources is in accordance with what the compensating wage theory predicts, it is prudent to point out that not all of the reduction in the off-farm wage rate can be relegated to health insurance coverage. However, the suggestion of a possible trade-off between off-farm wages and health insurance at the upper quantiles of the off-farm wage distribution is timely as it might inform the current healthcare debate among policymakers 21 However, and because the off-farm wage model used does not control for other benefits that are part of an employer's compensation package (e.g., bonuses, 401K matching contributions, reimbursement for continuing education, life insurance, etc.) due to lack of such data in the ARMS, it is hard to assert with certainty that the full amount of the discount in wages is due to the health insurance coverage that the farmer obtains for the employer. Accordingly, all the levels of the discount in off-farm wages reported to imply the presence of compensating differential should be viewed as upper bounds to these differentials. Yet another caveat to be noted is that a Wald-test to discern whether the differences in the coefficients are statistically significant across the two models based on the source of health insurance when farmers worked \"full-time\" off their farms and across all the percentiles considered was not conducted. This was due to the complexity of the estimation that would have resulted particularly when the specified SNP-based single index g(.) was set at 15 and when the standard errors of estimated coefficients were measured based on 1000 replicate samples. Theoretical Economics Letters concerning the \"ultimate\" bearer of the cost of healthcare when a firm, with farm operators constituting part of its labor force, offers health insurance to its core of \"full-time\" employees.\nFindings further demonstrate the importance of operator's work experience in positively impacting off-farm wages among those operators who are already in the higher spectrum of the off-farm wage distribution. This is particularly true in the case of those operators where health insurance is provided by the \"off-farm\" employer whereby the reward to experience was only for those in off-farm jobs that pay the highest wages.\nFarm operators with a college education and whose health insurance is obtained from sources \"other\" than from an \"off-farm\" employer are found with higher returns to schooling if their off-farm wages are in the two quantiles above the middle of the off-farm wage distribution. The fact that not all of these college-educated farmers across the off-farm wage distribution are shown to benefit from higher returns to their higher education may be related to the type of off-farm occupation that was held by these farmers. Findings by [55] , which may help in explaining the lackluster off-farm wage premium for this group of farmers, point to a flattening in the growth of the wage gap that was witnessed in the U.S. between 2010 and 2015 between workers with a college or graduate degree and those with only a high school. Valletta [55] attributes this lack of growth in higher educational returns to two factors. The first of these factors is \"polarization\", which is interpreted as a shift away from middle-skilled careers driven mainly by technological change. The second cause is \"skill downgrading\", which is construed as a general weakening in the demand for advanced cognitive skills. In contrast, farm operators whose health insurance is provided by an \"employer\" seem to benefit the most from having a college education as the educational impact on off-farm wages seems to have higher wage premia across all of the off-farm wage quantiles with the exception of the lowest and highest quantiles. In that farmers in this category who benefit from the higher educational returns may be explained by both the level of their higher education and the type of occupation that they hold. Valletta [55] notes that the higher education wage premium, which may be relevant to farmers in this category of health insurance coverage, results from the rising demand for the most highly educated individuals in careers that require extensive non-routine cognitive skills.\nAmong the two groups of farmers where health insurance coverage is obtained either from an \"off-farm\" employer or from \"other\" sources, college education (i.e., BA, BS, and graduate degrees) is identified as the one covariate with the potential of widening the off-farm wage gap among those in the lower two quantiles of wage distributions. A similar conclusion was reached by [56] , who noted that investments on education may contribute to an increase in the inequality between the lower part of the wage distribution up to roughly close to the median. A study by [57] pointed to some possible reasons for obtaining a positive relationship between returns of education and higher wage quantiles. One of these reasons is the possibility that over-education in low paid jobs may lead to rather low returns to education in the left-hand tail of the wage distribution. Another reason may be related to the \"ability\" of the individual, which is thought to be increasing with higher wage levels with its attendant impact in magnifying the returns of education in the right-hand tail of the wage distribution. If any of these reasons hold true in explaining the lower returns to education for farmers in the lower portions of the off-farm wage distributions, this suggests that investments in specialized \"skill-increasing\" education tailored to high paid jobs in rural areas are needed to help stem disparity in the off-farm wage distribution."}]
