[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Subject motion in positron emission tomography (PET) studies leads to image blurring and artifacts; simultaneously acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data provides a means for motion correction (MC) in integrated PET/MRI scanners. Purpose: To assess the effect of realistic head motion and MR-based MC on static [\n18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images in dementia patients. Study Type: Observational study. Population: Thirty dementia subjects were recruited. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T hybrid PET/MR scanner where EPI-based and T 1 -weighted sequences were acquired simultaneously with the PET data. Assessment: Head motion parameters estimated from high temporal resolution MR volumes were used for PET MC. The MR-based MC method was compared to PET frame-based MC methods in which motion parameters were estimated by coregistering 5-minute frames before and after accounting for the attenuation-emission mismatch. The relative changes in standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) between the PET volumes processed with the various MC methods, without MC, and the PET volumes with simulated motion were compared in relevant brain regions. Statistical Tests: The absolute value of the regional SUVR relative change was assessed with pairwise paired t-tests testing at the P 5 0.05 level, comparing the values obtained through different MR-based MC processing methods as well as across different motion groups. The intraregion voxelwise variability of regional SUVRs obtained through different MR-based MC processing methods was also assessed with pairwise paired t-tests testing at the P 5 0.05 level. Results: MC had a greater impact on PET data quantification in subjects with larger amplitude motion (higher than 18% in the medial orbitofrontal cortex) and greater changes were generally observed for the MR-based MC method compared to the frame-based methods. Furthermore, a mean relative change of 4% was observed after MC even at the group level, suggesting the importance of routinely applying this correction. The intraregion voxelwise variability of regional SUVRs was also decreased using MR-based MC. All comparisons were significant at the P 5 0.05 level. Data Conclusion: Incorporating temporally correlated MR data to account for intraframe motion has a positive impact on the FDG PET image quality and data quantification in dementia patients."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "information and are already commonly used for both excluding other diseases causing cognitive impairment as well for dementia subtype classification. [4] [5] [6] For example, combining separately acquired PET measurements of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization using [\n18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and MR-derived brain atrophy measures showed greater accuracy in predicting cognitive decline and conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than using cerebrospinal fluid sampling or clinical biomarkers alone [7] [8] [9] ; combining both imaging biomarkers also improved the accuracy of differentiating either AD or MCI patients from healthy controls than using either modality alone. 10 Apart from simultaneous data acquisition, an additional benefit of hybrid PET/MRI scanners is that the information obtained from simultaneous MR acquisitions can be used to correct for nonideal PET effects such as photon attenuation, partial volume effects, and subject motion. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] As the PET data acquisition is on the order of tens of minutes, subject motion is inevitable 16 and introduces blurring and image quality degradation. Although the visual interpretation of static PET images is usually not severely compromised by motion, 17 the inaccurate quantification could lead to bias and increased variability when conducting group studies. 16 While not all the dementia patients move more than healthy subjects (and vice versa), a greater proportion of them are prone to motion. 17 As a result, this subject population is more susceptible to motion-related effects, leading to decreased PET image quality and quantitative accuracy. 3, 17 Consequently, applying some form of motion correction (MC) is required in PET studies. 17 Various methods have been devised to cope with subject motion, ranging from those aimed at preventing motion using head restraints (not particularly generalizable because they may be uncomfortable and do not completely restrain the subject 18 ) to those trying to compensate for subject motion. The first group in this second category is that of image-based methods, or frame-based MC (FBMC), in which the head motion is estimated by coregistering the reconstructed PET images to a reference position. [19] [20] [21] FBMC has been designated as the MC method of choice in large, multicenter studies (eg, AD Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI, http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis/pre-processing and Japanese ADNI: J-ADNI 17 ). Nevertheless, simulation studies have shown that FBMC methods are reliable only when intraframe motion is less than 5 mm, 22 as they are not able to compensate for the motion present within each short frame and the coregistration of the images generated from low-statistics frames is more susceptible to errors. 21 Another group of methods known as event-based methods manipulate the raw list-mode PET data such that the coincidence events are repositioned in the line of response (LOR) space in a way that resembles the acquisition in the absence of motion. [23] [24] [25] This approach requires the estimation of the motion during the scan, either using an external motion tracking system (eg, an optical system with cameras and/or markers 18, 26 ) or from a different imaging modality such as MRI 12, 27 as in the case of integrated PET/MRI devices.\nProof-of-principle studies have been performed previously, demonstrating the feasibility of MR-based MC (MRMC). 12, 27 However, those studies only involved a limited number of healthy volunteers and the motion was mainly represented by large voluntary positional changes of the head.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the impact of MRMC has not previously been assessed in dementia patients exhibiting realistic motion (instead of sudden head positional changes). Thus, in this project we aimed to assess the effect of realistic head motion and MRMC on static FDG PET images in dementia patients and assess the effects of MRMC compared to the commonly used FBMC method."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MR and PET Data Acquisition", "text": "Thirty subjects (Table 1) with either MCI (n MCI 5 2), AD (n AD 5 18), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n FTD 5 10) were included in this study. All patients exhibited a mild level of cognitive impairment or dementia symptoms (ie, Clinical Dementia Rating 1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or an authorized surrogate decision-maker. The Institutional Human Research Committee approved the study. The patients were scanned in supine position with no restraints other than the foam pads routinely used for MR examinations placed around their heads. The PET data were acquired on a prototype MR-compatible brain PET scanner (\"BrainPET\") designed to fit inside the Magnetom Trio 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Approximately 5 mCi (185 MBq) of FDG was administered shortly after initiation of MR acquisition and 32 The volume obtained with this sequence (run before the fMRI) was set as the \"reference position\" for PET MC. The l-map of the MR RF coil was combined with the head l-map. The final reconstructed PET volumes consisted of 153 slices with 256 3 256 voxels, 1.25 mm isotropic; all subsequent analyses were performed in this PET space. The volumes corresponding to the four 5-minute frames were simply averaged to obtain the non-motion-corrected 20-minute static frame. The MC methods are described in detail in the following subsections. Region-based analyses were carried out with anatomical labels derived from the T 1 -weighted MR image using the FreeSurfer software. The cortex was parcellated into 70 regions according to the Desikan-Killiany Atlas and the subcortical regions, cerebellum, and brainstem (hereafter referred to as the \"subcortical regions\") were segmented into 41 regions. Of these segmentations and parcellations, 28 representative regions, with mean sizes ranging from 1.25 6 0.25 cm 3 in the left amygdala to 11.62 6 2.67 cm 3 in the right inferior parietal cortex (a complete list of region sizes are provided in Supplementary Table S1 ), were selected for further analysis."}, {"section_title": "MR-Assisted Motion Estimation and Correction", "text": "Motion estimates derived from the fMRI raw data were used to correct the PET data before image reconstruction. 12 The original EPI volumes (not those prospectively motion-corrected) were used to estimate the true position of the subject's head in the scanner. The subsequent volumes were registered to the first EPI volume using SPM8, 6 degrees of freedom rigid body transformation, and normalized mutual information as the cost function. Six motion parameters (three rotations and three translations along the main axes) characterized the motion at each timepoint. For times during the scan when fMRI data were not acquired (eg, during the acquisition of the T 1 -weighted sequence, which on average happened 10.81% of the total PET acquisition time of each subject; detailed acquisition times are provided in Supplementary Table S2) ; piecewise cubic polynomials were used for motion parameter interpolation. The motion parameters were median filtered twice in successive 20-second blocks, before and after interpolation, to remove high-frequency components and to obtain motion estimates for the whole duration of the scan (shown in Fig. 1 for a representative subject).\nTo qualitatively assess the overall motion of a subject, a 21 3 21 3 21-voxel cube centered at (50,50,50) of the image matrix was placed in the image space and transformed according to the estimated six transformation parameters at any given timepoint. The Euclidean distances of the eight pairs of corresponding vertices before (a i ) and after transformation (a i ') were summed to provide a motion magnitude metric (M) at each timepoint during the scan:\nThese values were integrated over the 20 minutes to obtain the total aggregate motion. The six subjects with the highest aggregate motion (top quintile) and six with the lowest aggregate motion (bottom quintile) out of the 30 subjects were identified.\nThe algorithm for performing the PET MC was previously described. 12 Briefly, the 20 minutes of raw PET data were divided into four 5-minute blocks (same duration as that used for the image-based methods described in the next section and similar to the ADNI data processing protocol) that were subdivided into multiple 20-second subframes and transformed individually using the filtered motion estimates. The corresponding LORs were moved by applying the inverse transformation of the motion estimates and the data were binned into sinograms. The l-map of the head was derived in the reference position; the hardware was \"moved\" with the scanner for sensitivity and attenuation correction. During scatter correction, a time-weighted average of the subframe coil sinograms was added to the l-maps for scatter estimation and for final reconstruction of the whole motioncorrected image frame. The volume corresponding to the 20-minute acquisition (PET MRMC ) was produced by averaging the four 5-minute volumes reconstructed with corrected LOR data. Coregistration to the T 1 -weighted MR volume in reference position was performed to ensure all PET volumes were affected equally by voxel interpolation."}, {"section_title": "Frame-Based Motion Correction", "text": "For comparison purposes, two FBMC methods were also applied: FBMC with a single-pass reconstruction (PET FBMC-SP ) and FBMC with two-pass reconstruction (PET FBMC-TP ). 33 In the first case, the four 5-minute frames were reconstructed using the l-map in the reference position. In the second case, the T 1 -weighted MR image was coregistered to each of those first-pass PET volumes (also using SPM8) and the transformation parameters were used to generate frame-specific l-maps (n 5 4) used for the second-pass reconstruction. In both cases, the four reconstructed dynamic PET frames were denoised using empirically determined thresholds (60,000 and 600 Bq/mL) and blurred with a 3-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel; three of these frames were coregistered (also using SPM8 with the same setup described previously) to the last PET frame to obtain the transformation parameters used to move the original images. The moved original images and the original last frame were summed and averaged."}, {"section_title": "Postprocessing of FDG PET Data", "text": "The PET NoMC and PET MRMC volumes were also denoised and blurred with a 3-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel and the 10 planes at the edges of the field of view (FOV) were eliminated to prevent the registration from being biased by noisy data and maintain similar image quality to the FBMC volumes. The PET NoMC , PET FBMC-SP , and PET FBMC-TP images were registered to the PET MRMC image using SPM8 (same setup as previously described) such that all PET, MR, and FreeSurfer label images were in the reference position. Tissue activity concentration ratios were obtained by normalizing the PET images by the mean activity concentration of the cerebellar cortex. Henceforth, we will use standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) to denote these tissue ratios, as this term is more frequently used in the AD literature and the two ratios are mathematically equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of the Effect of Simulated Motion on FDG PET Data", "text": "To investigate the effect of motion on SUVRs, we simulated motion by applying the MR-derived transformers to individual PET volumes. Specifically, for each subject the PET MRMC volume was moved in image space using each one of the 60 sets of transformers obtained during the 20-minute acquisition of a subject; the resulting volumes were averaged to yield the simulated volume (PET sim ), an approximation of the PET NoMC volume. For the quantitative analyses, 15 planes at the bottom of the FOV were removed from the FreeSurfer labels and emission volumes to exclude possible missing data due to coregistration (eg, when a region initially outside of the FOV moves inside after a translation in the axial direction or for certain rotations). Mean regional SUVR values for PET NoMC , PET FBMC-SP , PET FBMC-TP , and PET MRMC were calculated for voxels in all FreeSurfer-defined regions and a composite region of the postcentral, precentral, and pericalcarine areas that exhibit preserved metabolism in this patient population. 34 To assess the impact of MC at the ROI level (for affected and preserved cortical regions and subcortical regions), the mean absRC ROI values were calculated between PET NoMC and either PET FBMC-SP , PET FBMC-TP , or PET MRMC across all subjects and for the two extreme quintiles separately.

The motion magnitude, directionality, and pattern (eg, gradual vs. sudden) varied from patient to patient. Consequently, the impact of MC was also variable, both between subjects and in different ROIs. The \"unblurring\" effect of MC is expected to depend on the nature of the subject's motion and the length of the reconstructed frame. Although MC reduces the PET quantification bias for individual high-motion subjects (and highlights the need to perform MC when including these subjects in a group study), the overall impact at the group level depends on the variability in subject motion and the proportion of high-motion subjects.\nThe impact different MC methods have on the PET data was assessed on a region-by-region basis. The absRC ROI values of SUVRs showed that the single-pass FBMC method had a smaller impact than two-pass FBMC or MRMC. The differences between the single-and two-pass FMBC highlight the importance of minimizing the mismatch between the emission and attenuation data even in the case of FBMC. The observation that more regions showed the largest changes after MRMC suggests this method might be more accurate than even two-passed FBMC.\nSimulations were performed because there is currently no established metric to assess the impact of motion compensation on the PET data quantification. Examining the mean and SD absRC ROI values between PET sim and PET MRMC confirmed the qualitative observation that the impact of MC was variable across subjects; applying motion estimates from the subjects with greater motion resulted in greater RC values than applying those from a subject with less motion. In addition, the simulations also confirmed that the effects of MC were also variable across regions, with larger RCs observed generally in smaller regions. The absRC ROI values observed in real data were similar to those obtained from the simulations, suggesting that the effect of MC on the PET data acquired from this group of subjects was within the expected range.\nThe effect of MC methods on PET intraregion voxelwise CV in the regional SUVRs was also examined in a relevant composite region. 34 Compared to no MC and the two FBMC methods, MRMC showed a decrease in the intraregion voxelwise CV. In most of the regions observed, MRMC showed a larger effect compared to two-pass FBMC. This and the decrease in intraregion voxelwise CV observed using MRMC suggest that this method could be more effective in reducing motion effects in PET images than FBMC and has the potential to reduce motion-induced regional variability in FDG PET imaging compared to the standard FBMC method. The way different MC methods are applied could explain the differences observed in PET quantification. Compared to the single-pass FBMC, the two-pass FBMC addressed not only the interframe subject motion but also the emission-attenuation mismatch. In addition, the MRMC approach was also able to compensate for intraframe motion and thus had an even larger impact on PET quantification. However, both methods are susceptible to coregistration errors (when using an image-based approach for MR-assisted motion estimation) and the effect of MC is dependent on the extent of subject motion during the scan.\nStudies have shown that FBMC methods would be accurate when there is only limited intraframe motion. 22 While two-pass FBMC and MRMC performed similarly with regard to the chosen metrics in this particular group of patients, the results suggest that with larger subject motion or longer scan times the difference between the two methods could be larger. Therefore, in contrast to this study, in which we focused only on the motion within one 20-minute frame, in longer PET acquisitions the patient would have a greater chance of exhibiting a larger range of motion and tremors or sudden jerks. In addition, if the PET data are reconstructed as one volume (in contrast to the four 5-minute blocks used in this work), the MRMC method might yield slightly better reconstructions due to better data statistics and outperform FBMC further. Furthermore, the MRMC methods are likely more accurate than FBMC in the case of studies performed using tracers that only localize to specific regions of the brain (such as raclopride), as these images lack the anatomical features required for accurate coregistration.\nAnother area warranting further investigation is the postprocessing of the PET/MR data. To remove spurious noise from the EPI volume coregistration process, the motion estimates were median-filtered in 20-second blocks. This would result in the event-based method being conceptually analogous to a frame-based method that uses short 20-second reconstructed PET frames for coregistration. However, the EPI volumes used for coregistration are of higher image quality than the PET ones reconstructed from 20 seconds of data. A possible limitation of this method, however, is that susceptibility artifacts could distort the EPI volumes and affect the motion estimates derived from these data. However, the head, relative to other parts of the body, is less susceptible to such distortions and can be seen as a rigid body. The choice of a PET frame for coregistration is also a possible limitation. While we believe using the last frame for FBMC had a minimal impact on our results, the choice of the reference frame needs to be considered carefully when using FDG data acquired at different timepoints and even more so for other radiotracers. The effect of emission-attenuation mismatch affecting both FBMC methods (in interframe and secondpass coregistrations) is also a potential area for further investigation. Another limitation is that motion can be tracked only when acquiring fMRI data. As the MR component of the integrated scanner should never be used just as an expensive motion-tracking device, deriving motion from the MR data acquired for other purposes (eg, arterial spin labeling or diffusion-weighted imaging) or using sequences such as those in Ref. 35 in tandem with PET-based or external motion tracking systems would enable diverse PET/MR studies with full motion-tracking throughout the whole acquisition time. In terms of the computation time, while adjusting the LORs for MRMC is time-consuming in our current implementation, it is a parallelizable task and thus using cluster systems with parallel computing capabilities the PET reconstruction time for MRMC would be comparable (and thus feasible for routine use) to the other methods.\nOne study design limitation is that we only analyzed the effects of motion on regional SUVR changes and focused on static PET images. Further studies should investigate how MC affects kinetic parameters obtained from dynamic studies. Additionally, motion-related effects should also be investigated in aged-matched healthy controls. Motion tracking in this work was done based on EPI data and the subject motion could have been affected by the inherent acoustical noise.\nIn conclusion, MRMC and FBMC had comparable impact on PET data quantification in a group of dementia patients. In addition, greater SUVR absRC ROI values (compared to PET NoMC ) were observed in more cortical regions for PET MRMC than PET FBMC-TP , and reduced intraregion voxelwise CV in the composite cortical region was observed for PET MRMC . These results suggest that incorporating temporally correlated MR data to account for intraframe subject motion in the reconstruction of FDG PET images has a positive impact on the reconstructed PET image quality and data quantification. The improved PET data quantification using spatiotemporally correlated MR data may enable more accurate assessment of subtle changes in brain metabolism and allow for reduced sample sizes in clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents."}]
