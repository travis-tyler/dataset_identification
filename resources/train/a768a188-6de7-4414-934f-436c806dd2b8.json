However, the precise sequence of spread remains ambiguous. The prevailing model posits that Alzheimer's neurodegeneration starts in the entorhinal cortices, before spreading to temporoparietal cortex. Challenging this model, we previously provided evidence that degeneration within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), a subregion of the basal forebrain heavily populated by cortically projecting cholinergic neurons, precedes and predicts entorhinal degeneration (Schmitz and Spreng, 2016) . There have been few systematic attempts at directly comparing staging models using in vivo longitudinal biomarker data, and determining if these comparisons generalize across independent samples. Here we addressed the sequence of pathological staging in Alzheimer's disease using two independent samples of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N1 = 284; N2 = 553) with harmonized CSF assays of amyloid (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), and longitudinal structural MRI data over two years.\nWe derived measures of gray matter degeneration in a priori NbM and the entorhinal regions of interest. To examine the spreading of degeneration, we used a predictive modelling strategy which tests whether baseline gray matter volume in a seed region accounts for longitudinal change in a target region. We demonstrated that predictive pathological spread favored the NbM\u2192entorhinal over the entorhinal\u2192NbM model. This evidence generalized across the independent samples (N1: r=0.20, p=0.03; N2: r=0.37, p<0.001). We also showed that CSF concentrations of pTau/A\u03b2 moderated the observed predictive relationship, consistent with evidence in rodent models of an underlying trans-synaptic mechanism of pathophysiological spread (t826=2.55, p=0.01). The moderating effect of CSF was robust to additional factors, including clinical diagnosis (t826=1.65, p=0.49). We then applied our predictive modelling strategy to an exploratory whole-brain voxelwise analysis to examine the spatial specificity of the NbM\u2192entorhinal model. We found that smaller baseline NbM volumes predicted greater degeneration in localized regions of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. By contrast, smaller baseline entorhinal volumes predicted degeneration in the medial temporal cortex, recapitulating the prevailing staging model. Our findings suggest that degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system is a robust and reliable upstream event of entorhinal and neocortical degeneration, calling into question the prevailing view of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease neuropathology progresses in stages, with certain brain regions affected by neuronal deposition of insoluble amyloid (A\u03b2) and hyper phosphorylated tau (pTau) before others. The asymmetrical progression of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in different brain regions may reflect selective neuronal vulnerabilities local to each region (Mattson and Magnus, 2006; Saxena and Caroni, 2011; Wu et al., 2014; Schmitz and Nathan Spreng, 2016) . However, evidence in both mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (De Calignon et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012) and in human Alzheimer's disease patients (Schmitz et al., 2018; Sepulcre et al., 2018) indicates that neuropathology also spreads across anatomically and functionally connected brain regions. It is therefore possible that pathologies arising from selective neuronal vulnerability local to a given brain region might precede and predispose the subsequent spread of pathology across networks (Warren et al., 2013) . Despite these observations, the precise sequence of neuropathological spread and its relationship with neurodegeneration during the earliest stages of disease remains ambiguous, and can only be resolved with in vivo longitudinal data integrating measures of proteinopathy and microstructural change. Moreover, there have been few systematic attempts at generalizing staging models across independent samples, which limits their clinical utility.\nDetermining when and why certain brain regions are affected in the course of Alzheimer's disease is essential for understanding the mechanistic basis of disease progression, accurately staging the disease, and identifying individuals for early therapeutic interventions. The prevailing staging model posits that abnormal A\u03b2 and pTau accumulation starts in the entorhinal cortices (Braak and Braak, 1991; Corder et al., 2000; Braak et al., 2006) , before spreading to interconnected areas of medial temporal and posterior parietal cortex. The selective vulnerability of neurons in the entorhinal cortex to these proteinopathies is attributed to their high metabolic activity, the complexity of their axonal projections and the lifelong maintenance of their axonal plasticity (Mattson and Magnus, 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Roussarie et al., 2018) . One individual spiny stellate neuron in layer II of the entorhinal cortex innervates the entire transverse axis of the dentate gyrus, CA2/CA3 and the subiculum (Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1993) . Under a recent framework, amyloid pathology in entorhinal neurons potentiates hyper-phosphorylation of tau proteins ; Khan et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016) , which then spread via trans-synaptic mechanisms to distal neocortical areas which receive inputs from EC; i.e. the EC\u2192Neocortical model. See Figure 1A .\nChallenging the EC\u2192Neocortical model, we have provided initial evidence that degeneration within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), a subregion of the basal forebrain, precedes and predicts degeneration in the EC (Schmitz and Spreng, 2016) . The NbM (also referred to as Ch4 in Mesulam's nomenclature (Mesulam, 1983; Mesulam and Geula, 1988) is heavily populated (90% of cell bodies) by cortically projecting cholinergic neurons (Mesulam et al., 2004) which are also known for their extremely long and complex branching; the full arborization length of a single neuron was estimated in humans at >100 meters (Wu et al., 2014) . Like the layer II entorhinal spiny projection neurons, the cortical cholinergic projection neurons of the basal forebrain accumulate A\u03b2 and pTau early in the course of Alzheimer's disease, and as early as the third decade of life (Mesulam et al., 2004; Baker-Nigh et al., 2015) . Lending further support to early vulnerability of the basal forebrain to Alzheimer's disease, we previously found that longitudinal NbM degeneration was selectively increased in cognitively normal older adults with abnormal CSF biomarkers of A\u03b2, over and above age-related degeneration in cortical areas including entorhinal cortex (Schmitz and Spreng, 2016) . These initial findings raise the possibility that Alzheimer's disease pathology spreads from the basal forebrain to entorhinal cortex (NbM\u2192EC), possibly via the same trans-synaptic mechanisms of tau spread proposed previously in the rodent research (Liu et al., 2012) . If true, the NbM\u2192EC model would add a crucial 'upstream' link to the EC\u2192Neocortical predictive pathological staging of Alzheimer's disease. Under this model, the ascending cholinergic projections from NbM first 'seed' the EC with tau pathology, thereby eventuating the pattern of temporoparietal neurodegeneration typically attributed to the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. Support for the NbM\u2192EC model would have major clinical implications, motivating a shift toward preventative treatment strategies aimed at relieving agerelated pressures on the cortical cholinergic projection system.\nHere we directly compared the NbM\u2192EC and EC\u2192NbM models of predictive pathological staging in a large sample of older adults ranging from cognitively normal to Alzheimer's dementia, and then examined if the results generalized to a second independent sample of adults spanning the same clinical diagnostic continuum. In each sample, we first integrated CSF biomarkers of A\u03b2 and pTau neuropathology into a ratio pTau/AB and delineate two groups of older adults in each of the two samples using an independently defined ratio cutpoint which was recently cross-validated at ~90% sensitivity and specificity (Hansson 2018 , Schindler 2018 . Individuals below the cutpoint exhibit a 'neurotypical' biomarker-based phenotype of brain aging; individuals above the cutpoint exhibit an 'Alzheimer's pathological' phenotype. Because CSF pTau/AB is sensitive to the earliest abnormalities of AD (Jack et al 2013), we identified many cognitively normal adults falling above the cutpoint in both samples. We then tracked these groups with structural MRI (sMRI) indices of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal neurodegeneration over a two-year period. Both the CSF and sMRI data were acquired from multiple phases of the Alzheimer 's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\nTo examine the 'spread' of degeneration between NbM and EC, we used a predictive modelling strategy which tests whether baseline gray matter volume in a seed region accounts for variation in subsequent longitudinal degeneration (change over future timepoints) in a target region. We determined whether evidence of predictive pathological spread favored either the NbM\u2192EC or EC\u2192NbM model, and whether this evidence generalized across the independent samples. We then determined whether CSF concentrations of pTau/A\u03b2 moderated the observed predictive relationship, consistent with an underlying trans-synaptic mechanism of pathophysiological spread. Additional moderating factors, including clinical diagnosis, were evaluated in this framework. We then examined the selectivity of predictive pathological spread between NbM and EC using a whole-brain voxel-wise predictive modelling strategy. Finally, we used the same whole-brain strategy to test whether the EC\u2192Neocortical model recapitulates the spread of neuropathology from EC to temporoparietal cortices observed in prior work (Liu et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2014) . If degeneration in the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system is a robust and reliable upstream event of entorhinal degeneration, then it should predict localized entorhinal degeneration, whereas entorhinal cortex should predict downstream events in temporal and parietal cortices."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI Data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nWe used data from the ADNI-1 as first cohort and ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 combined (ADNI-GO/2) as second cohort. ADNI-1 was carried out in 1.5T MR scanners and ADNI-GO/2 in 3T MR scanners. All high-resolution T1 sMRI scans were downloaded from ADNI LONI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). A total of 502 ADNI-1 sMRI scans were downloaded from a standardized 2-years interval image collection. This data collection was created to minimize variability between studies and ensure a minimum quality control of the images (Wyman et al., 2014) . To obtain the ADNI-GO/2 sMRI scans, we first selected those subjects that had CSF biomarker data (see below) and searched by their research IDs (RIDs). We downloaded longitudinal sMRI images from 714 ADNI-GO/2 participants. To select the two longitudinal time points for each individual, we applied a bounded interval of a mean=1.5 years +/-12 months to maximize the inclusion of participants. 104 participants didn't have longitudinal sMRI data within the bounded interval. For ADNI sites with GE and Siemens scanners, we used images corrected for distortions (GradWarp) and B1 non-uniformity. For ADNI sites with Philips scanners, these corrections are applied at acquisition (see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-tool/mri-preprocessing/). Finally, to be able to compare ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2 data as two independent samples, we discarded participants from ADNI-GO/2 that also took part in the ADNI-1 studies (n=49), due to the smaller sample size of the ADNI1 cohort."}, {"section_title": "CSF biomarkers", "text": "Accumulation of brain A\u03b2 in plaques and pTau in neurofibrillary tangles are the main neuropathological signs of AD.

CSF samples of A\u03b2 and pTau from the baseline visit were produced with a fully-automated Elecsys protocol (see Supplementary section CSF procedures). We calculated a ratio of pTau/A\u03b2 and used a standardized cut-off of 0.028, which was recently cross-validated between the ADNI and Swedish BioFinder studies (Hansson et al., 2018) to classify participants into abnormal (aCSF; pTau/A\u03b2 >= 0.028) and a normal CSF groups (nCSF < 0.028). Using ratios of pTau over A\u03b2 supersedes using single analytes to distinguish amyloid status using positron emission tomography (Schindler et al., 2018) . 216 participants from ADNI-1 didn't have CSF measures and were therefore not included.

In order to study the effect of the CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers independently of other factors, we included the APOE genotype as a covariate of no interest in our analyses. The APOE information for all individuals with both sMRI and CSF data was obtained from the APOERES.csv spreadsheet and the \u03b54+ status was defined as having at least one \u03b54 allele.

This procedure unifies rigid-body registration, intensity inhomogeneity correction and non-linear diffeomorphic transformation in a single iterative model.\nInitially, all of the individual time-points were co-registered to the ICBM 152 volume to ensure good starting parameters for the high-dimensional DARTEL warping algorithm. We then employed within-subject symmetric diffeomorphic registration of the two timepoints to create a midpoint average T1-image for each subject. Computing a mid-point average image prevents introduction of biases associated with using individual time-points as the reference (e.g., results\ndiffer depending of the time-point that is used as a reference). The mid-point average was scaled by the interscan interval. The registration step produced Jacobian determinant maps, which index contractions and expansions for each time-point relative to the mid-point average image. The default parameters for noise estimation, warping and bias regularizations were used. The mid-point average images were then segmented using SPM's unified segmentation with the following settings: light regularization, 60mm of FWHM gaussian smoothness of bias and 2,2,2,3,4,2 Gaussians per tissue type. The resulting 1.5mm 3 GM and white matter maps were used to create separate DARTEL group templates for each sample (ADNI-1, and ADNI-GO/2). The DARTEL algorithm improves the inter-subject alignment by using multiple parameters per voxel when aligning the images (Ashburner, 2007) . The segmented GM maps were multiplied by the Jacobian determinants of each time-point (Mechelli et al., 2005) . We then warped the segmented GM and white matter maps into the DARTEL template space with the 'preserve amount' option. Default settings were used elsewhere. The warping step produced modulated GM and white matter volumetric maps for each timepoint.\nTo check the quality of the images for subsequent analyses, the warped, modulated GM maps of each timepoint were visually inspected for segmentation and normalization inaccuracies by creating a plot showing a slice for all the subjects and were inspected for the presence of outliers by calculating the correlation between all the volumes using the CAT12 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/). Subjects that exhibited a correlation below 2 standard deviations and abnormalities on their segmented GM volume (e.g. low signal intensity, inhomogeneities, warping errors) were excluded. Two subjects were discarded due to low data quality in ADNI-1 and eight in ADNI-GO/2. See Table 2 for complete information of the included participants.

The NbM ROI is equivalent to areas Ch4 and Ch4p (Mesulam, 1983; Mesulam and Geula, 1988) . The ROIs were then resampled and warped to the DARTEL group template (see Fig. 1b ). Estimates of modulated GM volume (in units of milliliters) at each time-point were obtained using the ROI as a masking region, and by summing the total intensity of voxels falling within the masking region adjusted for the size and number of voxels (http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/vbm/get_totals.m).

We next used regression-based modelling to test if the degeneration in the NbM and in the EC reflects interdependent pathological processes. We used robust linear regression to examine these competing models in the aCSF and nCSF groups. Consistent with an interdependent NbM\u2192EC model, we found in the aCSF group that baseline NbM volumes predicted longitudinal degeneration in the EC in both ADNI-1 ( Fig. 3a; r=0.20, t166=2.12, p=0.03) and ADNI-GO/2 ( Fig. 3b; r=0 .37, t308=5.15, p<0.001). We next examined whether the predictive pathological staging of NbM and EC degeneration is observable under conditions of normal CSF pTau/A\u03b2. It could be the case that the underlying neuropathological process driving this relationship also occurs at 'neurotypical' levels of pTau/A\u03b2, but that this process is exacerbated in the aCSF group. In this case, we would expect to observe the same NbM\u2192EC interrelationship, though possibly at a smaller magnitude.

We found that baseline NbM volumes predicted degeneration in a circumscribed cluster of regions localized to the right entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and in the left middle temporal gyrus (Fig. 5a ). The predictive pathological spread of NbM\u2192EC neurodegeneration therefore exhibits a high degree of anatomical specificity.\nIn our a priori ROI-based regression models, we found negligible evidence in support of the EC\u2192NbM model. However, following from non-human animal work (Khan et al., 2014) , we hypothesized that that predictive pathological spread of degeneration from EC might target anatomically and functionally connected cortical areas including the parahippocampal and posterior parietal cortices. To test this hypothesis, we computed a second voxel-wise regression analysis in the pooled aCSF group between baseline volumes in the EC and longitudinal APC in every brain voxel of the gray matter mask (see Methods). We found that baseline EC volumes predicted longitudinal degeneration in a circumscribed network of temporal cortical regions including the entorhinal, perirhinal, parahippocampal and fusiform cortices and temporal poles ( Figure. 5b) . Additional clusters were detected in the insular and posterior parietal cortices.\nFinally, we tested the same models in the nCSF cohort, collapsing individuals from both ADNI Cohorts. No significant voxels were found at the corrected statistical threshold (p<0.05 FWE) in either of the models (NbM\u2192whole brain; EC\u2192whole brain). Taken together, the voxel-wise regression results show that among individuals expressing abnormal CSF: (1) baseline NbM volumes selectively predict degeneration in the EC and adjacent perirhinal cortex, and, (2) EC degeneration 'spreads' to anatomically and functionally connected areas including the parahippocampal gyrus and other temporoparietal regions (Khan et al., 2014) . "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We provide evidence that degeneration in the NbM is an upstream event of subsequent degeneration in the EC and temporal cortices. Our results generalized across two non-overlapping and well-powered datasets. As hypothesized, the NbM\u2192EC relationship was moderated by the presence of abnormal CSF biomarkers of pTau and A\u03b2, consistent with a mechanism of transsynaptic spread of these proteins across anatomically connected regions. Using whole-brain regression models, we presented novel evidence that the relationship between baseline NbM volumes and neurodegeneration was spatially specific to regions of the EC and the perirhinal cortices, regions hypothesized to be among the earliest to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (Braak and Braak, 1991; Khan et al., 2014) . Finally, baseline EC volumes predicted neurodegeneration mainly in regions of the temporal cortex, recapitulating the prevailing staging model (Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012) . These findings highlight the relevance of the cholinergic BF nuclei in Alzheimer's disease and motivate novel interventions targeted to these neuronal populations.\nThe intrinsic properties of the BF cholinergic neurons, including their location, connections and morphology, might be key to understanding why these cell types are selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (Mattson and Magnus, 2006) . The NbM cholinergic neurons have large projecting axons with extensive arbors that expand long distances in the central nervous system (Wu et al., 2014; Ballinger et al., 2016) . Extremely large axons and arbors exert high metabolic demands in order to support their maintenance, repair and transport. A less efficient cellular response to axonal perturbations could increase their vulnerability to the accumulation of abnormal proteins (Wu et al., 2014) . In addition, large surface areas increase their exposure to toxic environments (Mattson and Magnus, 2006) . Consistent with its selective vulnerability, the NbM is one of the most vulnerable regions to the early accumulation of intracellular tau pathology (Mesulam et al., 2004; Del Tredici, 2011) and , interestingly, intraneuronal amyloid oligomers (Baker-Nigh et al., 2015) . There is increasing evidence showing that intraneuronal amyloid can have deleterious early effects in the cells, such as disrupting their retrograde axonal transport machinery (Morfini et al., 2009 ) which in turn can cause a neurotrophic deficiency (Bellucci et al., 2006) leading to neurodegeneration (De Lacalle et al., 1996) . In vivo structural MRI studies have added further support for the vulnerability of the BF, showing reduced BF volumes cross-sectionally (Grothe et al., 2012; Cantero et al., 2017) and longitudinally (Hall et al., 2008; Grothe et al., 2013; Schmitz et al., 2018) in individuals in the Alzheimer's disease continuum.\nIn this study, the pathological spread of neurodegeneration from the NbM to the EC was exacerbated in individuals with abnormal levels of CSF pTau and A\u03b2. Evidence from non-human animal studies shows that protein aggregates can spread trans-synaptically to neuroanatomically connected regions. In an amyloid precursor protein mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, neuronal accumulation of A\u03b2 was observed first in the EC, followed by the dentate gyrus, a downstream region receiving monosynaptic projections from the EC (Harris et al., 2010) . Evidence further suggests that tau aggregates propagate from the EC to limbic and then neocortical connected areas (De Calignon et al., 2012; Kfoury et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016) . For example, in mice that expressed human tau restricted to the EC, the axonal terminals of the EC projecting neurons showed increasing markers of tauopathy over time (Liu et al., 2012) . In all, this shows that A\u03b2 and tau can propagate synaptically across neural networks of anatomically connected vulnerable cells. If the NbM is one of the earliest regions to accumulate tau and A\u03b2, then these proteins may spread to the EC trans-synaptically, inducing the observed downstream neurodegeneration. Our results are therefore compatible with animal research showing a transsynaptic mechanism of abnormal spreading of tau proteins. However, to ultimately demonstrate that degeneration in the EC is driven by the spread of tau pathology from the NbM in humans, longitudinal studies integrating both structural MRI and tau positron emission tomography are needed. In addition, we observed a relationship between the NbM\u2192EC in the normal CSF group.\nThis effect was weaker and not reliable across samples, indicating the possibility that there are other age-related pressures on the NbM cholinergic neurons independent from A\u03b2 and pTau (Nitsch et al., 1992; Wurtman, 1992) .\nUsing longitudinal whole-brain structural MRI, we also showed a reliable ( Figure 3A -E) and\nhighly specific ( Figure 5A ) sequence of neurodegeneration from the NbM to the EC. This result challenges the most widely accepted model of Alzheimer's disease staging, which posits that the neuropathological and neurodegenerative cascade initiates in the transentorhinal and EC (Braak and Braak, 1991; Corder et al., 2000; Braak et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2014) . This model was primarily advanced from post-mortem histology studies that examined the brains of individuals who died at different ages from different causes, which showed tau aggregates forming in the EC even in non-demented individuals (Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2006) .\nPredictive pathological staging based on histological strategies are limited by the heterogeneity of the post-mortem samples, the inability to track pathology with progressive neurodegeneration within individuals, the variability in tissue staining techniques used to profile underlying pathology, and the variability in anatomical coverage across both cortical and subcortical regions.\nWe overcame these limitations by using an in vivo longitudinal neuroimaging strategy of predictive pathological staging in a large cohort of over 800 older adults. We quantified the baseline CSF profile of amyloid and tau pathology in each individual based on the automated Elecsys protocol, which was harmonized between samples. We then applied an independently defined cutpoint to delineate unbiased groups of individuals exhibiting abnormal and normal CSF biomarkers. By comparing the spreading dynamics of neurodegeneration between these two groups, we demonstrated that baseline NbM volumes predicted an accelerated annual rate of degeneration in a future time point in the EC in the presence of abnormally elevated A\u03b2 and pTau. In addition, we found evidence that this neuropathological background was associated with neurodegenerative spreading from EC to targets of its projections in the medial temporal lobes. These latter findings parallel those of recent cross-species translational research comparing transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease with at-risk human participants (Khan et al., 2014) . In all, our results added evidence that NbM degeneration is an earlier pathological event in the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade.\nHere, we showed that the NbM\u2192EC model reliably generalized between two different populations. It is important to note that the data of the ADNI-GO/2 sample were acquired in 3T and the ADNI-1 in 1.5T scanners. Previous reports have only used 1.5 datasets (Schmitz and Spreng, 2016) and it is well known that the signal to noise ratio of subcortical structures is higher at 3T (Tardif et al., 2010; Marchewka et al., 2014) . It is therefore likely that degeneration in the NbM is more accurately quantified in the ADNI-GO/2 sample. Although it is estimated that approximately 90% of the NbM neurons in monkeys are cholinergic (Mesulam, 1983) , to ultimately prove that the degeneration in the EC is driven by a cholinergic deficit in humans, degeneration that is specific to cholinergic cell types should be demonstrated. The combination of structural MRI with cholinergic positron emission tomography (Aghourian et al., 2017; Schmitz et al., 2018) could help elucidate this issue. Finally, late onset Alzheimer's disease is a complex, multifactorial (Veitch et al., 2018) , polygenic (Tan et al., 2019) In conclusion, the current study provides reliable and anatomically specific support for a predictive pathological staging model of Alzheimer's disease that progresses in the following sequence:\nNbM\u2192EC\u2192Neocortex. In all, our findings call into question the prevailing view of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, suggesting instead that degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system is an upstream event to that of its most vulnerable cortical targets in the EC. If the cholinergic neurons of the BF are selectively vulnerable to the early accumulation and propagation of Alzheimer's disease pathology, then interventions targeting these neuronal populations in early disease stages may be useful for modifying disease progression prior to cognitive decline.
