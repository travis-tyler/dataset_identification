[{"section_title": "", "text": "make estimates of the effects of the policies on the number of children of, and the job satisfaction of, faculty members, using the UC Berkeley survey data. Then we make estimates of the effects of the number of children and job satisfaction on the retention of faculty, using the SDR data. Combining the two sets of estimates gives estimates of the effects of the policies on retention of faculty members. Although UC Berkeley had Family Responsive policies available, the 2002 and 2003 faculty surveys indicated that many faculty did not know about them, or thought that use of them caused a stigma. After 2003, the university instituted a major campaign to educate faculty and department chairs about how to use Family Responsive policies and to change the climate and practices on campus for using FRP. The 2009 survey, plus feedback from faculty, department chairs, and administrators, indicated that the campaign had been successful in implementing FRP (in the sense of increasing the usage of the policies). The survey also showed that men increased their usage of the policies to a large extent. UC Berkeley also enhanced the FRPs after 2002. 6 The individuals in the 2002 and 2003 surveys are treated as a control group for an institution that has not successfully implemented FRPs, and the individuals in the 2009 survey as a treatment group for an institution that has successfully implemented FRPs. We think that this is a conservative yet realistic approach, because higher education institutions often have FRPs \"on the books\" yet these policies have not been successfully implemented. For institutions that do not offer FRPs, we would expect an even larger faculty response from implementing FRPs than the responses reported here. In step (ii), we used a study of costs of FRPs at Iowa State University 7 to estimate the costs of faculty attrition and associated recruitment costs. We combined steps (i) and (ii) into a simulation of faculty flow through the university under the two different policy regimes to estimate the benefits minus the costs of the outcome of successful implementation of FRPs. This provides an estimate of the net benefit, or the value-added, of the programs. This simulator provides a higher education organization with outcomes in two possible situations: In one, the university has fully implemented a suite of best-practice family-friendly policies; in the other situation, the university does not have these policies implemented. 8 The predictions are provided at the present time (t=0) and outcomes in five years (t=5). A comparison of outcomes in the two situations provides an estimate of the value added (or net benefit) of implementing the FRPs. Note that, as in many social science models, our data allow us to establish only correlation, not causation. It is of course difficult to make such predictions of causation without a controlled randomized trial, which of course (and obviously rightly so) is impossible for this topic. However, our data sets allow potential estimates of the benefits and costs of FRPs. There are many assumptions on which the accuracy of these estimates can be judged, and we call attention to one key assumption, namely that the environment in 2009 (and the preceding few years) at UC Berkeley differed from that in 2002/2003 (and the preceding few years) mostly in terms of the change in implementation of the FRPs. We think that this is a reasonable assumption to make in order to explore how faculty respond to family friendly policies."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Creation of Simulator (see Flow Charts I, II, and III)", "text": "Input: Upload File with Characteristics of all Faculty Members: Age, Gender, Tenure, Under-Represented Minority, Married/Partnered, Department Output: Predicted Costs and Benefits Notes on the required input file format. The file you upload should be a csv (comma separated value) file. You can create it using Microsoft Excel or an alternative such as OpenOffice; if you like, you can first create it as a file with a .xls extension and then later use \"Save As\" and choose the file type as csv. (Data should be separated by commas, not tabs.) The first row must have the following entries in exactly the following form: \"Age\",\"Female\",\"Tenured\",\"UnderRepresentedMinority\",\"Mar-riedOrPartnered\",\"Department\". (Note that, for example, capitalization matters). Each row after the first row represents the respective characteristics of a faculty member in a department or university. Age should be a positive number. Female, Tenured, UnderRepresentedMinority, and Mar-riedOrPartnered are all variables that must have values either 0 or 1. So, for example, 1 for Female means the faculty member is female, and 0 means the faculty member is male. The meaning of Under-RepresentedMinority, defined to conform to the definition used by the SDR data sets we use, is a person of any race other than White non-Hispanic or Asian non-Hispanic. For Department, the variable must be 1, 2, 3 or 4; 1 represents Math/CS/Physical Sciences; 2 represents Life Sciences; 3 represents Engineering; 4 represents Social Sciences."}, {"section_title": "Basic Summary of the Prediction Methods:", "text": "The Simulator first uses the UCB data sets to predict the presence of children (in certain age groups) in the household of, and the job satisfaction of, a faculty member, in the case of FRPs being implemented and in the case of their not being implemented. (This is done by letting the 2009 observations represent the former scenario and the 2002/2003 observations the latter.) Then, as we do not have access to UCB retention data, the SDR data sets are used to predict the likelihood that a faculty member will stay at a university given the earlier predictions about child indicators and job satisfaction (as well as other control variables such as age and race). As well, data from an ISU study are used to estimate the costs of hiring, and also the costs of implementing FRPs. (Users can also provide their own estimates for these costs.) Finally, the simulator compares the increased costs from implementing FRPs against the possible benefits of reduced hiring costs if retention rates are increased. \u2022 Uses retrospective regressions to estimate number of children in previous 5 year period, and uses this as estimate. \u25aa (ii) Estimate probability of ASMD usage given that one has a child \u25aa Multiply (i) by (ii) to get expected number of uses of ASMD in years t=0 through t=5 \u2022 (B) Estimate Probability of Stopping Tenure Clock in years t=0 through t=5 \u25aa Uses UCB data \u25aa Use probit regression over last 5 years in order to estimate this. \u25aa Assumes that tenure clock is stopped either zero or 1 times (i.e., assumes it is never stopped twice). \u2022 ( "}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the Method Used", "text": "In many of the estimated relationships using UCB data, the key variable is the 2009 indicator dummy variable. This is used in our design as a proxy variable for having stronger policies in place, as the university had undertaken important activities to educate faculty and department chairs about FRPs after 2003 in order to change the campus climate so that use of these policies became standard practice. These policies had a higher take-up rate in 2009 than in 2002 or 2003, and also child-bearing rates increased, as we see below. In order to estimate faculty responses by major department categories, we had to classify the three UCB surveys and the three SDR surveys by department categories, and match the categories across surveys as well as possible. The data appendix shows what departments or schools each major department category contains. UCB surveys included all departments and schools, and so we were able to create a non-STEM category (mostly humanities), which we use as our benchmark (i.e., excluded) category for the department dummies in the regressions. 10 The SDR does not include respondents in the humanities, and so only STEM categories are used in estimations using the SDR to estimate retention for each department category. In many of the estimated relationships, we often restrict to particular age ranges to make the empirical work realistic (eg, to reflect realistic child-bearing ages for female faculty). In general, we encountered two problems in estimating our simple regressions. First, in some of the probit regressions, the estimation process did not converge or there was one coefficient that was not well specified. There is a technical reason for this called \"complete separation\" or \"quasi-complete separation.\" (See, e.g., http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/complete_separation_logit_models.htm ) An example of this kind of situation occurs when everyone (or almost everyone) who is male and not married/partnered has no children. Then to get the best possible statistical fit, the algorithm fitting the probit (i.e. maximizing a likelihood function) essentially \"wants\" to choose the \"coefficient\" on \"not married\" to be as negative as possible, and would go to \"negative infinity\" if it could, but the algorithm stops, because -5 is similar to \"negative infinity\" when they are inputs to the standard normal cumulative distribution function. So the approach we take is to predict that a male has no children if not married, and then restrict the regression to males who are married/partnered. Second, some relationships that are assumed to be a function of age encountered estimation problems. (The regressions include an age and age-squared term.) For example, we might expect the predicted number of children under age 6 to increase until around age 35 or 40 and then decrease afterwards. In some cases in which the estimated model did not behave in this fashion, in order to have age function realistically, we instead chose to do such things as restricting to age ranges where the relationship made more sense (e.g. to females <= 50 years old). Please see the data appendix for a detailed description of the variables and how they were created from the UCB faculty surveys and the SDR."}, {"section_title": "Estimated Relationships", "text": "Before discussing the relationships estimated using the pooled UCB faculty surveys, we look at the number of cases available (informally, N). The following table gives the number of observations in each of the three UCB surveys, by gender and departmental group. (Note that in many of the regressions, we pool the 2009 survey together with one of the other two surveys.) 2002 2003 2009 2002 2003 2009 (i)  Next we estimate job satisfaction. Unfortunately we cannot use child indicator variables as controls because of data limitations."}, {"section_title": "Female", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Male", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "(I) (B) Predicting Job Satisfaction at time t=0", "text": "Use 2 linear regression models: 2 genders Job satisfaction responses take the values 0,1,2, and 3. The model can predict noninteger values. 12 The numbers outside the range 0 to 3 are truncated to either 0 or 3. Uses UCB data; these regressions pool the 2003 and 2009 data. Note that we do not use 2002 data here because the 2002 data does not have data on job satisfaction. (We cannot use child indicators as control variables because the 2003 data does not have data on child indicators.) We noticed stronger associations for assistant professors, so we included a term that interacts the 2009 dummy term with the tenured variable. The two regressions have the following form (for females and for males, separately) Job satisfaction = (constant, 2009 dummy, Age, Age Squared, Department dummies, Under-Represented Minority dummy, Married or Partnered dummy, Tenured dummy, Tenured/Dummy Interaction Term) Where the department dummies are for Math/CS/Physical Sciences; Life Sciences; Engineering; Social Sciences. Female regression (N=354) Male regression (N=788) Now we turn to estimating the costs of the FRPs. First we look at the faculty use of ASMD, and predict (i) the number of children a faculty member will have in the next five years in situation where FRPs are available, and (ii) the probability that the faculty member will use ASMD, using UCB data. (I) (C) Predicting Child < 6 in hh at time t=5 Three cases: (i) If female and EITHER (a) > 50 now or (b) had a child 12 to 18 in hh as of 5 years ago, then predict 0 for the probability of having a child under 6 now. NOTE THAT in practice, the input of \"having a child 12 to 18 in household\" is a predicted probability from another regression; so what the simulator does, is that if there is a child 12 to 18 in hh as of 5 years ago with 99% or greater probability, then it predicts 0 for the probability of having a child under 6 now. Otherwise it looks at case (ii). (ii) If female and BOTH (a) <= 50 now AND (b) did NOT have a child 12 to 18 in hh as of 5 years ago (or, in practice in the simulator, had one with <1% probability), then use a probit, as described below. (iii) If male, use the probit described below. (ii) If female and BOTH (a) <= 50 now AND (b) do NOT have a child 12 to 18 in hh as of 5 years ago (or, in practice in the simulator, have one with <1% probability), then use this probit regression. Uses pooled 2002 and 2009 UCB data, RESTRICTED TO THOSE AT MOST 50 YEARS OLD AT TIME OF SURVEY AND WITH NO CHILDREN 12 TO 18 YEARS OLD AS OF 5 YEARS AGO, AND RESTRICTED TO THOSE WHO WERE AT UCB AS OF 5 YEARS AGO, FEMALE ONLY Using Characteristics 5 Years Before the Survey. (i) Predict total number of children that a faculty member will have in years t=0 through t=5 We use linear regressions to estimate the number of children in previous 5 year period, and use this as an estimate of number of children in the next 5 years. Note that in estimating the regression coefficients, we use characteristics from 5 years ago; in the prediction stage, we use characteristics as of t=0. Female regression (N=364) Male regression (N=817) (ii) Estimate probability of ASMD usage given that one has a child (Note that in estimating the probit coefficients, we use characteristics from the time of the most recent child.) Use probability of ASMD usage for the most recent child; then assume it is the same conditional probability for each child. 13 Use 2 probit regression models: 2 genders Uses pooled 2002 and 2009 UCB data. We truncate at 0 children (no negative values used). The two regressions have the following form (for females and for males, separately) Prob(Using ASMD for Most Recent Child) = Phi (constant, 2009  Female regression (N=113) Male regression (N=239) (iii) Multiply predictions from (i) by predictions from (ii) to get expected number of uses of ASMD in years t=0 through t=5 Here we make the assumption that if a faculty member has multiple children in years t=0 through t=5, then their probability of using ASMD given that one has a child is the same for all of these children. This is a limitation of our data, as the 2009 UCB survey asked only about usage of ASMD for the most recent child. (Of course, in practice, one might guess that if a faculty member uses ASMD for their most recent child, they are likely to also have used it with their second most recent child.) Having made this assumption, we can then argue as follows, in order to spell out why the simple multiplication of the predictions in (i) and (ii) is justified. (Note that we also ignore instances of twins in this heuristic argument.) Assumes that tenure clock is stopped only once, which has only rare exceptions. To be eligible for Stopping the Tenure Clock, one must have a newborn (or a newly adopted or foster child under 5) and one must not have tenure. Therefore these estimates are restricted to those who do NOT have tenure at the time of the most recent birth, and we do not put an indicator for having a child <6 on the RHS. Note that in estimating the probits, we use age at time of most recent birth. These probits only use three RHS variables as the sample size is fairly small. When we included indicators for children 6-11 in hh, and children 12-18 in hh, as control variables, the estimation process did not converge, probably because there were only a few cases where a faculty member had children this old and was now untenured. So we did not use these indicators as control variables. Probit regression using pooled 2002 and 2009 data from UCB surveys. For FEMALE or MALE, if older than 45, predict 0. Next we predict the probability of retention of the faculty member at the end of 5 years. Here we use the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) data because we did not have this data for UCB faculty."}, {"section_title": "(I)(D) Predicting Probability of Retention at time t=5", "text": "These models use linked data from the 2003, 2006 and 2008 waves of the SDR. For an observation to be used, it must be present in all three waves. (This is necessary in order to detect retention, as the questionnaires only ask if they were at the same job as in the previous wave; i.e., the 2008 questionnaire does not ask if they were at the same job in 2003 as in 2008.) We estimate 8 regressions (2 genders in 4 department categories).

At a university without such policies, of course there is no cost to implement the policies, while at a university with the policies, the costs are estimated at about $19,600. 18 Summing costs of both (i) hiring and (ii) policy implementation gives total costs of $1.916 million if the department were at a university without best practice policies and total costs of $1.794 million if the department were at a university with best practice policies. The estimated net savings from FRP policies for the department is approximately $122,000. 19 We hope that you find the simulator easy to use and of benefit to your organization. Please let us know!
