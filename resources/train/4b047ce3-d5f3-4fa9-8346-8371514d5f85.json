It sets them on a path that influences their subsequent learning and school achievement. For most children, kindergarten represents the first step in a journey through the world of formal schooling. However, children entering kindergarten in the United States in the 1990s are different from those who entered kindergarten in prior decades. They come from increasingly diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, social, economic and language backgrounds. Many kindergartners now come from single-parent families and from step-parent families. They also differ in the level and types of early care and educational experiences that they have had prior to kindergarten (Zill et al. 1995). Our nation's schools face new opportunities and new challenges. Schools are expected to meet the educational needs of each child regardless of their background and experience. Services, such as meals and before-and after-school child care, that were provided by other institutions in the past are now being provided by schools. Teachers are faced with classrooms of children with increasingly diverse needs. In addition, growing pressure to raise academic standards and to assess all students' progress towards meeting those standards places even more burden on schools and teachers. Much of the literature on the status of children in our nation's schools is focused on elementary (e.g., fourth-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress) and secondary school children (e.g., twelfth-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress and eighth-, tenth-and twelfthgraders in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988). Little information is available on kindergarten programs in the United States and on the nation's children as they enter kindergarten and move through the primary grades. Information about the entry status of the nation's kindergartners can inform educational policy and practice, and especially those policies and practices that are targeted to meeting the needs of a diverse population of children entering kindergarten for the first time. In the fall of 1998, about 4 million children were attending kindergarten in the United States, approximately 95 percent of them for the first time. Of the children attending kindergarten, 85 percent were in public school, 15 percent in private school, 55 percent were in full day programs and 45 percent were in part day program. Whether or not children succeed in school is in part related to events and experiences that occur prior to their entering kindergarten for the first time. Children's preparedness for school and their later school success are related to multiple aspects of their development. Children's physical well-being, social development, cognitive skills and knowledge and how they approach learning are all factors that contribute to their chance for success in school (Kagan et al. 1995). Additionally, the differences we see in children's knowledge and skill as they enter kindergarten can be contributed to a variation in family characteristics (e.g., maternal education, family type) and home experiences (home educational activities, nonparental care). A complex and continuous collaboration exists between the child and the family; and, the family can provide the resources and support that children require to increase their chances of succeeding in school (Maccoby 1992). For some children, the absence of resources and support place them at increased risk for school failure. This report presents the first findings from a new national study of kindergartners, their schools, classrooms, teachers and families. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), began following a nationally representative sample of some 22,000 kindergartners in the fall of 1998. The ECLS-K will follow the same cohort of children from their entry to kindergarten through their fifth grade year. Data will be collected not only in the fall of kindergarten but also spring kindergarten, fall first grade, spring first grade, spring third grade and spring fifth grade. In the fall of kindergarten, data were collected from children, their parents and their teachers. Information from children was gathered during an individualized in-person assessment with the child in the child's school, parents were interviewed over the phone and teachers were given self-administered questionnaires. Westat, Inc. is conducting the kindergarten and first grade collections for NCES. This report is based on the 95 percent of children entering kindergarten for the first time in the fall of 1998. Future reports will provide information on those children who repeated kindergarten in the fall of 1998."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Skills and Knowledge", "text": "Children's cognitive skills and knowledge are frequently thought of as core ingredients in the recipe for success in school. Researchers have conceived cognitive development as an extended set of vi 1 0 multidimensional skills and proficiencies which include language/literacy, reasoning and general knowledge (Kagan et al. 1995). Children's language and literacy refers to both their oral communication (language) and understanding of the written word (literacy). Children's reasoning refers to their mathematical skills. The concept of general knowledge refers to children's conceptions and understandings of the world around them. As children enter kindergarten for the first time, they differ in their cognitive skills and knowledge. Children's reading, mathematics and general knowledge are related to their age as they enter kindergarten, the level of their mother's education (see figure A), their family type, the primary language spoken in the home and their race-ethnicity. In reading, mathematics and general knowledge, older kindergartners (born in 1992) outperform the younger kindergartners (born September through December 1993). The older kindergartners are more likely to score in the highest quartile of the distribution of scores than the younger kindergartners. However, some of the youngest children, those just turning 5, also score in the highest quartile (16 percent in reading, 12 percent in mathematics and 12 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some of the older kindergartners (born in 1992) are scoring in the lowest quartile (15-19 percent in reading, 13-17 percent in mathematics and 11-16 percent in general knowledge). Children's performance in reading, mathematics and general knowledge increases with the level of their mothers' education. Kindergartners whose mothers have more education are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics and general knowledge than all other children. However, some children whose mothers have less than a high school education also score in the highest quartile (6 percent in reading, 7 percent in mathematics and 4 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some children whose mothers have a bachelor's degree or higher are scoring in the lowest quartile (8 percent in reading, 18 percent in mathematics and 10 percent in general knowledge). Children's performance in reading, mathematics and general knowledge differs by their family type: kindergartners from two-parent families are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics and general knowledge than children from single-mother fathilies. However, some children with single mothers also score in the highest quartile (14 percent in reading, 14 percent in mathematics and 12 percent in general knowledge). Additionally, some children from two-parent families are scoring in the lowest quartile (22 percent in reading, 21 percent in mathematics and 20 percent in general knowledge). In terms of their specific skills in reading and math, 66 percent of first-time kindergartners are proficient in recognizing their letters, 29 percent are proficient in understanding the beginning sounds (letter sound relationship at the beginning of words) and about 17 percent are proficient in understanding the ending sounds (letter sound relationship at the end of words). In math, nearly all (94 percent) firsttime kindergartners are proficient in number and shape (recognizing numbers, shapes and counting to 10), VII 58 percent are proficient in understanding relative size (sequencing patterns and using nonstandard units of length to compare objects) and 20 percent are proficient in understanding ordinal sequence (identification of the ordinal position of an object in a sequencee.g., fifth in line).

Young children construct knowledge by interacting with others and their environment (Bandura 1986). In order to interact successfully in a variety of circumstances and with a variety of people, children need to possess interpersonal skills. They need to feel secure enough to join, question and listen to their peers and adults. This report explores indicators of children's social development by looking at children's interpersonal skills and behavioral patterns as rated by their parents and teachers."}, {"section_title": "1.2", "text": "For the most part, parents and teachers report a high incidence of prosocial behaviors and a low incidence of problem behaviors. Parents report that about 82-89 percent of first-time kindergartners often to very often join others in play, make friends and comfort others. Teachers report that about 75 percent of first-time kindergartners are accepting of peer ideas and form friendships. In terms of more problematic behaviors (e.g., fighting and arguing), parents report that about 33 percent of first-time kindergartners argue with others often to very often and less than 20 percent of first-time kindergartners fight with others and get angry easily often to very often. Teacher ratings are lower, with about 10 percent of first-time kindergartners arguing with others, fighting with others and easily getting angry often to very often. Teacher ratings of children's prosocial and problem behaviors differ by children's family type and minority status. Kindergarten teachers rate children with some characteristics of risk for school difficulty (those whose mothers have less than a high school education, are single mothers or whose families have received or are receiving public assistance) less likely than children whose mothers have at least a high school diploma, who come from two-parent families and whose families have never utilized public assistance to accept peer ideas and form friendships. Reports of children's problem behaviors vary by race/ethnicity. The pattern of these differences and their magnitude depends on who is rating the children's behavior. When teachers rate the children in their classrooms, black children are more likely than white and Asian children to be seen as exhibiting higher levels of problem behaviors (arguing with others, fighting with others, getting angry easily). When parents rate their children, we see fewer differences between black and white children. Instead, we see more differences between Asian children and white, black and Hispanic children. Asian children are less likely than children in these other groups to be seen as arguing or fighting often to very often by their parents."}, {"section_title": "Physical Health and Well-Being", "text": "Information on children's physicality helps untangle the diverse skill set children possess at entry to kindergarten. An important part of learning relates to children having enough rest, enough good foods to eat and good physical health (Kagan et a. 1995). The concept of physical health and well-being is broad; it not only includes a disease-free state but also having gross and fine motor skills appropriate to the child's age. The average first-time kindergartner in 1998 was about 45 inches tall and weighed about 46 pounds. About 12 percent of boys and 11 percent of girls have a body mass index which classifies them as at risk for being overweight. Kindergartners are generally healthy (see figure B)though their general health differs by their family type, the level of their mothers education and whether or not they utilized public assistance (i.e., Aid for Families with Dependent Children). A small percentage of kindergartners are showing signs of developmental difficulty (e.g., high activity level, low attention span). "}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Learning", "text": "How children approach learning is central to their chances for success in school. Children's learning styles reflect how they address the task of learning (Kagan et al. 1995). Children need to tie able to persist at tasks, be eager to learn and be creative in their work. These characteristics tend to manifest themselves at a relatively early age, and children demonstrate diversity in their approaches and behaviors toward learning. As children enter kindergarten for the first time, parents report that about 75 percent persist at tasks often to very often (figure C), about 92 percent seem eager to learn (figure C) and 85 percent demonstrate creativity in their work. Teachers are slightly more conservative in their ratings (figure C), reporting that about two-thirds to three-quarters of beginning kindergartners persist at tasks, seem eager to learn and are able to pay attention. Teacher ratings of kindergartners approaches to learning differ by child characteristics, such as their gender, age at entry, level of mother's education and minority status. x 14 Both parents and teachers report that girls persist at tasks more often than boys, older kindergartners (born in 1992) persist at tasks more often than the younger (born September through December 1993) and children not at risk persist at tasks more often than children at risk for school difficulty (mother's education less than high school, single-mother and receipt of public assistance), except on the basis of home language. xi 15 The Child and the Family The nature and frequency of family interactions relate not only to children's development but also to children's preparedness for school. The frequency with which parents interact in positive ways with their children may indicate the investment parents make in their children's education. Home activities such as reading to the child or interacting through playare related to children's school preparedness and chances for success in school. The majority of parents report having more than 25 children's books in the home, and more than half of parents report having more than five children's records, audio tapes or CDs in the home. Nearly half of parents report a family member reading to the child or singing songs with the child every day. Activities such as reading to children vary by level of mother's education (see figure D), family type, receipt of public assistance and minority status. As the labor force participation rate of mothers with young children has increased, the percentage of children receiving care from someone other than their parents has increased as well. In the 1990s, a large majority of children have been cared for on a regular basis by someone other than their parents prior xii to entering first grade (West et al. 1992). Today, many kindergarten and primary school children receive before-and after-school care regularly from persons other than their parents (Brimhall et al. 1999). Prior to starting kindergarten, about four out of five first-time kindergartners received care on a regular basis from someone other than their parents. Upon entering kindergarten, about half of children currently receive care on a regular basis before or after school from someone other than their parents. Both the care children received prior to kindergarten and their current care (e.g., relative, nonrelative, center-based) varies by characteristics such as level of mother's education and race/ethnicity status. At kindergarten entry, children whose mothers have less than a high school education are more likely to receive before-and/or after-school care from a relative than from a nonrelative or center-based provider. In contrast, kindergartners whose mothers have a college education are more likely to receive care in a center-based setting than in either of the two home-based settings. At kindergarten entry, black children are more likely than white, Asian or Hispanic children to receive before-and/or after-school care."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "While first-time kindergartners are similar in many ways, this report demonstrates that differences exist in children's skills and knowledge in relation to their characteristics, background and experiences. The report adds to our understanding of the diversity of young children's skills and knowledge. Even as they are just beginning their formalized educational experience, children are different. They demonstrate differences in their cognitive skills and knowledge, social skills, health and approaches to learning, and bring with them differences in their home educational experiences and environments. This report is highly descriptive in nature, presenting a broad array of information on children's status as they begin their journey to school. Future reports based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), will a take more analytical approach and examine specific issues more in depth.

For instance, differences exist in parent and teacher perceptions of children's prosocial skills, problem behaviors and approaches to learning. Primarily, we presented the data by looking at parent perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics and teacher perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics. However, future analysis can compare the similarities and, the differences in parent and teacher perceptions of the same child. For example, in terms of approaches to learning, specifically children's eagerness to learn, the racial/ethnic differences seem much greater in the teacher ratings than in the parent ratings in the aggregate. Furthermore, in this report, we look at the constructs by a specific set of child and family characteristics (e.g., child's sex, age at entry, race/ethnicity, maternal education). Future reports can take a different perspective, and analyze the constructs in terms of additional family characteristics and school characteristics. For example, the data can be analyzed in terms of pre-school attendance, kindergarten program type (i.e., full day/part day) and school type (e.g., public/nonpublic). xv 19.

It sets children on a path that influences their subsequent learning and school achievement. For most children, kindergarten represents the first step in a journey through the world of formal schooling. However, children entering kindergarten in the United States in the 1990s are different from those who entered kindergarten in prior decades. They come from increasingly diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, social, economic and language backgrounds. Many kindergartners now come from single-parent families, step-parent families and homes with very different social and economic backgrounds. They also differ in the level and types of early care and educational experiences that they have had prior to kindergarten (Zill et al. 1995). These trends present new opportunities and pose challenges to our nation's schools. Schools are expected to meet the educational needs of each child regardless of their background and experience. Services, such as meals and before-and after-school child care, that were provided by other institutions in the past are now being provided by schools. Teachers are faced with classrooms of children with increasingly diverse needs. In addition, growing pressure to raise academic standards and to assess all students' progress toward meeting those standards places even more burden on schools and teachers (Kagan 1990, Meisels 1992. Much of the literature on the status of children in our nation's schools is focused on elementary (e.g., fourth-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress) and secondary school children (e.g., eighth and twelfth-graders in the National Assessment of Educational Progress and eighth-, tenthand twelfth-graders in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988). Little information is available on the achievement of children in kindergarten programs in the United States and on the nation's children as they enter kindergarten and move through the primary grades. Information about the entry status of the nation's first-time kindergartners can inform educational policy and practice, and especially those policies and practices that are targeted to meeting the needs of a diverse population of children entering kindergarten for the first time. In the fall of 1998, about four million children were attending kindergarten in the United States, approximately 95 percent of them for the first time. Of the children attending kindergarten, 85 percent were in public school and 15 percent in private school. Over the past few decades, the nature of kindergarten programs has shifted from typically half-day programs to full-day programs. Presently, 55 percent of children are in full-day programs, and 45-percent in part day programs. 2 This report will present a snapshot of these first-time kindergartners. It describes some of the skills, knowledge and experiences that children bring with them as they enter kindergarten . It describes some of the things firsttime kindergartners can and cannot do, what problems they may or may not have and what resources may or may not be available to them. The report examines variations in children's skills, knowledge and experiences across a set of sociodemographic characteristics of children and their families. Children's Skills, Knowledge and Experiences Whether or not children succeed in school is in part related to events and experiences that occur prior to the their entering kindergarten for the first time. Children's preparedness for school and their later school success are related to multiple aspects of the children's development, such as their physical well-being, social development, cognitive skills and knowledge and their approaches to learning (Kagan et al. 1995). Along with these characteristics, some would emphasize the role that schools play in determining whether particular children are prepared for school and their success in the classroom (Crinic and Lamberty 1994;Meisels 1999). Additionally, children's preparedness for school involves a complex and continuous collaboration between the child and the family. The family can provide the resources and support that children require to increase their chances to succeed in school (Maccoby 1992). For some children, the absence of resources and support place them at increased risk for school failure. Coenitive Skills and Know lecke. Children's cognitive skills and knowledge are frequently thought of as core ingredients in the recipe for success in school. Researchers have conceived cognitive development as an extended set of multidimensional skills and proficiencies which include language/literacy (e.g., reading), reasoning (e.g., mathematical knowledge and skills) and general knowledge (Kagan et al. 1995). Children's language and literacy refers to both their oral communication (language) and understanding of the written word (literacy). In this study, children's reasoning refers to their mathematical skills. The concept of general knowledge refers to children's conceptions and understandings of the world around them. These three cognitive domainsreading, mathematics and general knowledgeplay an important role in children's chances for scholastic success. The cognitive skills children demonstrate at kindergarten entry can potentially shape their early school experience (Sameroff and Haith 1996). Therefore, documenting the skills children possess before they receive formal schooling provides a baseline for assessing their progress in kindergarten and beyond (Meisels 1996). This report will describe children's cognitive skills in the reading, mathematics and general knowledge domains as they enter kindergarten for the first time. Social Skills. Children's social skills relate both to the quality and success of their school experiences (Meisels et al. 1996). Young children construct understanding by interacting with others and their environment (Bandura 1986). In interacting successfully in a variety of circumstances with a variety of people, children demonstrate interpersonal skills. They need to feel secure enough to join, question and listen to their peers and adults. This report will explore indicators of children's social development by looking at children's interpersonal skills and behavioral patterns as rated by their parents and teachers. Specifically, this report will present information on first-time kindergartners' interpersonal skills and behaviors, both prosocial and problem. Physical Health and Well-Being. We also consider the relationships among children's physical well-being, motor development and educational outcomes. The stage for learning is often set with enough rest, good foods to eat and good physical health (Kagan et al. 1995). The concept of physical health and well-being is broad; it not only includes a disease-free state but also a physical prowess appropriate to the child's age in terms of gross and fine motor skills. Consequently, information on children's physicality helps untangle the diverse skill set children possess at entry to kindergarten. This report will present information on first-time kindergartners' height and weight, body mass index, fine and gross motor skills, general health and developmental difficulties they are experiencing that may affect their classroom experience. Approaches to Learning. How children approach learning is central to their chances for success in school. Children's learning styles reflect how they address learning (Kagan et al. 1995). Children need to be able to persist at tasks and be eager to learn. In addition, demonstrating creativity in their thinking and in their work can also increase their chances for success in school. These characteristics tend to manifest themselves at a relatively early age. As early as kindergarten entry, children demonstrate diversity in their approaches and behaviors toward learning. Therefore, this report will explore basic information on children's approaches to learning. The Child and the Family. The nature and frequency of family interactions relate not only to children's development but also to children's preparedness for school. The frequency with which parents interact with their children may indicate the investment parents make in their children's education. Home activitiessuch as reading to the child or interacting through playare related to children's school preparedness and chances for success in school. As the labor force participation rate of mothers with young children has increased, the percentage of children receiving care from someone other than their parents has increased as well. In the 1990s, a large majority of children have been cared for on a regular basis by someone other than their parents prior to entering first grade (West et al. 1995). Today, many kindergarten and primary school children receive before-and after-school care regularly from persons other than their parents (Brimhall et al. 1999). The importance to early school success of the home literacy environment, parents' regular interaction with their children and children's participation in early care and education programs has led the National Education Goals Panel to include these as proxy measures of school readiness in their annual report. Consequently, this report on children's status at entry to kindergarten includes information on each of these measures."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "This report presents the first findings from a new national study of kindergartners, their schools, classrooms, teachers and families. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), began following a nationally representative sample of some 22,000 kindergartners in the fall of 1998. Westat, Inc., conducted the study for NCES. In the fall of the 1998-99 school year, public and private schools offering kindergarten programs and a sample of the children attending kindergarten in these schools were selected to participate in the ECLS-K.3 Baseline data about these children, their families and kindergarten programs were collected at this time. The findings reported here are based on data from telephone interviews with these children's parents/guardians and self-administered questionnaires completed by the children's kindergarten teachers. Findings also come from data gathered during an individualized assessment with each child (see the Methodology Section for a description of the variables and measures used in this report). The current longitudinal design of the ECLS-K includes five additional waves of data collection. Data will be collected from the same sample of children in the spring of kindergarten, the fall4 and spring of first grade and the spring of third and fifth grades. Sample. A nationally representative sample of approximately 22,000 children enrolled in about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year were initially sampled. The children attended both public and private kindergartens that offered full-day and part-day programs. The sample included children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and included oversamples of Asian children, private kindergartens and private school kindergartners. This study supports separate estimates of public and private school kindergartners; black, Hispanic, white and Asian children; and children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The kindergarten population includes both first-time kindergartners and repeat kindergartners. In order to explore children's status as they enter school for the first time, first-time kindergartners need to be separated from repeat kindergartners. Therefore, this report concentrates only on first-time kindergartners,5 and the findings generalize only to that population. The report has two purposes: (1) it provides the first national picture of entering kindergartners in the United States and (2) it introduces the rich data set associated with the ECLS-K. This first publication uses the fall kindergarten data and provides descriptive statistics on many variables that relate to children and their families. Future reports will describe kindergarten teachers and kindergarten classrooms, address more complex models and hypotheses and will utilize the longitudinal nature of the study.  Zill et al. 1995). Other factors that are extrinsic to the child also influence their health and physical-well being, social skills, cognitive skills and knowledge and how they approach the task of learning. These factors include their mother's education, family type (two-parent, one-parent), home language and their families' receipt of public assistance (Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics 1999;Zill et al. 1995). Consequently, when reporting information on children and their families, this report will present the data by these salient characteristics. In this report, children's physical well-being, social development, cognitive skills and knowledge and approaches to learning are treated separately.

The findings pertain only to first-time kindergartners, and the cognitive skills and knowledge section presents information only for those first-time kindergartners who were assessed in English. In the discussion of findings from the family interview, parents are referred to as the respondent, which is true in the majority of cases (97 percent of respondents were parents). Children begin school already possessing knowledge and skills in the areas of reading (Vacca et al. 1995), mathematics (Baroody 1993;Ginsburg 1989)  The ECLS-K assessment battery has been developed to assess common skills and knowledge across children. These common skills reflect school curricula across the nation; therefore, the battery samples typical and important elements of the curriculum with particular emphasis on content and process areas that are critical to growth and can be expected to reflect growth on the same scale over time.  (Snow et al. 1998). The twolanguage and literacycannot be separated; together, they enable children to express and interpret thoughts, beliefs and desires. A close relationship exists between learning language and learning to read, both of which are complex processes. Children's phonemic knowledge, understanding sounds and how they form words and learning to read are reciprocal. While phonemic knowledge plays an essential role in learning to read, growth in reading skills contributes to more advanced phonemic knowledge (Perfetti et al. 1987;Snow et al. 1998). The ECLS-K measure of reading in kindergarten assesses children's basic literacy skills (e.g., recognizing the printed word, identifying sounds, word reading, vocabulary and reading comprehension)."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "Mathematics has been described as \"a way of thinking about the world\" that is more than mere computation of numbers (Baroody 1993, p. 151 Assessment Battery Scores. To describe the variability of first-time kindergartners' performance in reading, mathematics and general knowledge, scores from each assessment domain were converted into both normative and criterion-referenced proficiency scores. To compare the performance of first-time kindergartners, their reading, mathematics and general knowledge scores were converted to t-scores with a mean score equal to 50 and a standard deviation of 10. To further explore the differences in children' s scores, we divided the t-scores into quartiles. Children in the lowest quartile (0-25 percent) scored with the lowest 25 percent of children. Children in the highest quartile (76-100 percent) scored with the highest 25 percent of children. In addition to normative interpretations of scores, the ECLS-K battery scores are converted into criterion-referenced proficiency scores. Criterion-referenced scores can be used to evaluate performance on specific sets of skills within each domain. The clustering of items was empirically based, with each cluster representing skills necessary to successfully complete the typical item located at points along the scale. Children who pass a particular level have generally mastered the preceding levels. The ECLS-K reading assessment domain includes the following five criterion-referenced proficiency levels: First level measures recognition of upper and lower case letters of the alphabet; Second and third levels assess phonological sensitivity at the subword level (e.g., knowledge of letter and sound relationships at the beginning and at the end of words); Fourth level measures the ability to read common words; and Fifth level measures comprehension of written text. In addition to understanding that words in print have meaning and recognizing that letters have distinct forms and can be related to word sounds, beginning to read involves understanding how words are represented in printconventions of print or writing. As children recognize words in print, they also become familiar with the rules and conventions of reading (e.g., words are printed in discrete units, bound by spaces and sequenced from left to right) and the terms used to talk about reading (e.g., top of the page, first sentence). Children learn these concepts of print conventions as they begin learning the relationships between printed letters and sounds in spoken words and in analyzing words. The measure of children's familiarity with the conventions of print in the ECLS-K was comprised of a cluster of three items: directionality at both the word and sentence levels and where a reading passage ends. The mathematics assessment consisted of measures of children's skills and knowledge of the properties and functions of numbers and geometric shapes, operations and applications. There are five mathematics proficiency levels at the kindergarten level, each level representing a higher level of skill and knowledge. Level one refers to a cluster of items that measures reading numerals, recognizing shapes and counting to 10. Level two includes items that measure reading numerals, counting beyond 10, sequencing patterns and using nonstandard units of length to compare objects. Level three items measure number sequence, reading two-digit numerals, identification of the ordinal position of an object and solving a word problem. Level four includes calculating sums up to 10 and relationships of numbers in sequence. Level five measures problemsolving using multiplication and division and number patterns."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "Assessors read the items to the child. Items were presented with graphics and manipulatives. Children could use counting blocks and paper and pencil to solve the problems. This assessment battery is intended for use with both kindergarten and first-grade children. Therefore, when looking at the proficiency scores of beginning kindergartners, it is not out of the ordinary for the majority of children to be scoring in the lower proficiency levels (e.g., letter recognition, beginning sounds, number and shape recognition and relative size). In reading, girls slightly outperform boys. A larger number of girls than boys score in the highest quartile in reading (table 1). Girls and boys perform similarly in mathematics and general knowledge (tables 2 and 3). A similar proportion of boys and girls score in the highest quartile in mathematics and general knowledge. In reading, mathematics and general knowledge, older kindergartners (born in 1992) outperform the younger kindergartners (born September through December 1993). The older kindergartners are more likely to score in the highest quartile of the distribution of scores than the younger kindergartners. However, some of the youngest children, those just turning 5, also score in the highest quartile (16 percent in reading, 12 percent in mathematics and 12 percent in general knowledge). Children's performance in reading, mathematics and general knowledge increases with the level of their mothers' education. Kindergartners whose mothers have more education are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics and general knowledge. However, some children whose mothers have less than a high school education also score in the highest quartile (6 percent in reading, 7 percent in mathematics and 5 percent in general knowledge). Children's reading, mathematics and general knowledge performances differ by their family type: kindergartners from two-parent families are more likely to score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics and general knowledge than children from single-mother families. However, some children with single mothers also score in the highest quartile (14 percent in reading, 14 percent in mathematics and 12 percent in general knowledge). In reading, mathematics and general knowledge, children's performances differ by the primary language spoken in the home: more kindergartners in homes where the primary language is English score in the highest quartile in reading, mathematics and general knowledge than those in homes where the primary language is not English. Children who are white are more likely to score in the highest quartile than black or Hispanic children in reading, mathematics and general knowledge. However, that is not to say that minorities are not achieving above the average. In reading, some black (15 percent) and Hispanic (15 percent) children score in the highest quartile. As children enter kindergarten for the first time, 66 percent pass reading proficiency level one (recognizing their letters); 29 percent pass level two (beginning sounds); 17 percent pass level three (ending sounds); 2 percent pass level four (sight words); and 1 percent pass level five (words in context) (table 5). More girls than boys pass reading proficiency levels one (recognizing their letters), two (beginning sounds) and three (ending sounds). Older first-time kindergartners (born in 1992) are more likely to pass levels one through four than younger first-time kindergartners (born September through December 1993). Older first-time kindergartners are also more likely to have all three print familiarity skills than younger first-time kindergartners. Children with few risk factors are more likely to pass various reading proficiencies than children at risk. For example, children whose mothers have higher levels of education passed the first three reading proficiency levels at higher rates than kindergartners whose mothers have less education. Plus, children from families who do not receive welfare services are more likely to pass reading proficiency levels one (letter recognition), two (beginning sounds) and three (ending sounds) than kindergartners from families who did receive public assistance. The same pattern is true for print familiarity. Children whose mothers have higher levels of education are more likely than children whose mothers have less education and children whose families did not receive public assistance are more likely than children whose families received public assistance, to have all three print familiarity skills. Children's reading proficiency and print familiarity also differ by family type. Children from families with two parents pass reading proficiency levels one through four more often than kindergartners with single mothers and are more likely to have all three print familiarity skills. Children who are white are more likely to pass levels one (letter recognition), two (beginning sounds) and three (ending sounds) than children who are black or Hispanic.

The ability to make and keep friends and maintain relationships with peers and adults (such as teachers) form the social foundation of school. Children's social skills may be related to their later academic achievement (Swartz and Walker 1984). And their experiences with peers will likely influence their attitudes toward school and learning (Kagan et al. 1995). Children's social skills may be conceptualized along two linesprosocial and problem behaviors (Meece 1997). Prosocial behavior includes positive behaviors that facilitate successful social interaction. Children act in ways to help others without necessarily experiencing gain for themselves. As children expand their social worlds and cognitive understanding of self and others, they are more able to empathize and share with others. Prosocial skills in young children can be as simple as the abilitiy to accept peer ideas in play or to form friendships. Conversely, problem behaviors are those that tend to impede social interaction. Children who exhibit problematic behavior (e.g., fighting, arguing) may not be liked by peers or may be seen as disruptive by adults. Both the positive and negative behaviors that children exhibit frame their learning environment by affecting the social dynamics within this environment. Several discrete behaviors serve as indicators of children's social skills, either prosocial or problematic in nature. Children may exhibit different behaviors at home and school. Thus, it is important to frame children's social skills in the context of the home and in the context of the school. Therefore, parents and teachers of each sampled child answered questions on the frequency with which the child acts in certain ways (e.g., joins others in play, makes friends, argues with others, fights with others). The frequency of these behaviors is categorized as never/sometimes and often/very often."}, {"section_title": "45", "text": "Prosocial Behavior.

Parents rated how frequently their child easily joins others in play, makes and keeps friends and comforts or helps others (table 7). Similarly, teachers noted how often a child accepts peers' ideas for group activities, forms and maintains friendships and comforts or helps other children (table 8)."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings: Prosocial Behavior", "text": "From parent ratings, at least 80 percent of children join others, make friends or comfort others often or very often. From teacher ratings, about three-quarters of first-time kindergartners are adept at forming friendships and accepting peer ideas, engaging in these behaviors often or very often. Additionally, half of kindergartners comfort other children in school. Both parents and teachers rate girls as more likely than boys to comfort others often or very often. Teachers also rate kindergarten girls as more likely to accept peer ideas and form friendships. Parents of kindergartners do not see large differences in how often boys and girls join others, but parents do report that girls make friends slightly more often than boys. From the perspective of the kindergarten teacher, the older children (born September to December 1992) are more likely than the younger children (born September through December 1993) to accept the ideas of others and to comfort others. Parents' perceptions reflect these age differences for joining others. Also, from the perspective of kindergarten teachers, children with some characteristics of risk for school difficulty (those whose mothers have lower education, are single mothers or whose families have received or are receiving public assistance) are less likely than children whose mothers have higher levels of education, who come from two-parent families and whose families have never utilized public assistance to accept peer ideas and form friendships. Parent reports concerning joining others and making friends reflect most of these differences. Based on the reports of their parents and teachers, children whose home language is one other than English are less likely to engage in the three prosocial behaviors examined here than children whose primary home language is English.  Problem Behavior. Children who exhibit aggressive or antisocial behaviors may have a more difficult time adjusting to school. Children who fight, argue or yell at others are more likely to experience peer rejection, and such rejection has been associated with academic difficulties and increased likelihood for school dropout (Kupersmidt et al. 1990;Parker and Asher 1987). In this report, children's problem behaviors are described by three single item indicators. Parents and teachers (tables 9 and 10, respectively) each rated how often the child argues with others, fights with others, or gets angry easily."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings: Problem Behavior", "text": "The incidence of problem behavior is relatively infrequent in first -time kindergartners. Teachers report that 10 to 11 percent of first-time kindergartners argue or fight with others or get angry easily often to very often.

According to their parents, 15 percent of children often or very often fight with others and 33 percent often or very often argue with others. The frequency of children's problem behaviors varies by their family type. Single mothers are more likely than respondents from two-parent families to report their children as arguing, fighting or getting angry often or very often. Teachers are less likely to rate children from households with two parents than children from single-mother families as exhibiting problem behavior. Reports of children's problem behaviors vary by race/ethnicity. The pattern of these differences and their magnitude depends on who is rating the children's behavior. When teachers rate the children in their classrooms, black children are more likely than white and Asian children to be seen as exhibiting higher levels of problem behaviors (arguing with others, fighting with others, getting angry easily). When parents rate their children, we see fewer differences between black and white children. Instead, we see more differences between Asian children and white, black and Hispanic children.

Indeed, children's physical and motor development play a key role in their preparedness for school. Children's physical well-being may frame their learning opportunitieslimiting or expanding them. The child with poor fine motor skills will have difficulty holding and using a pencil, which may contribute to difficulties in printing letters and words. Fine motor skills (i.e., visual motor) can predict reading, mathematics and general school achievement, and such perceptual skills may be more predictive than even cognitive skills for later success in reading comprehension (Tramontana et al. 1988). Children's social interactions and emotional well-being may also be influenced by their physical developmental status. Children who have problems with their health or have lower levels of physical activity may feel lonely and less well liked by their peers (Page et al. 1992). In terms of height, adults and young children alike tend to rate taller boys as more able or more liked than shorter boys, and preschool boys tend to evaluate taller girls as more liked (Eisenberg et al. 1984). In regard to weight, an overweight child may be teased and feel lonely, potentially limiting his or her confidence in joining cooperative learning activities or speaking in class. Furthermore, children with developmental difficulties (e.g., increased activity levels, attention difficulties, articulation difficulties) may develop feelings of separateness from their peers and adults other than their parents, potentially adversely affecting their school experiences (Kagan et al. 1995;Meisels et al. 1993). The maturational process of growing relates to numerous other physical well-being processes, such as activity level and coordination. The following section describes a set of key characteristics that represent the domain of physical well-being. Each of these characteristics reflects an aspect of physical health and well-being that potentially influences children's adaptation to and success in school. The child-specific areas of physical well-being in this report include children's height and weight (body mass index), fine motor skills (e.g., copying figures, manipulating blocks), gross motor skills (e.g., hopping on one foot, walking backward in a line), general health and developmental limitations. Trained assessors measured each child's height, weight and motor skills. Parents reported on their child's general health and potential developmental difficulties. Height and Weight. Children's height and weight are robust indicators of general health and well-being (Shonkoff 1992). Both serve as markers of children's ability to thrive and reflect the effects of nutrition, the consequences of persistent and chronic illness or environmental conditions. At entry into kindergarten, children's growth is relatively rapid. At this young age, there is a good amount of variation in children's height and weight. On average, first-time kindergarten children are 45 inches tall and weigh 46 pounds, with boys averaging 45 inches, 47 pounds and girls averaging 44 inches, 46 pounds (not shown in tables). Body Mass Index. Obesity is a significant health problem, with medical and psychological consequences for children (Hammer et al. 1991). Rosner and his colleagues (1998) report that \"childhood obesity is the most prevalent and serious nutritional problem in the United States\" (p. 211). Because of the concern with effects of childhood obesity, the measurement of the relationship of height to weight has recently been added as an indicator of health (Rosner et al. 1998). Body mass index (BMI), the ratio between height and weight (weight in kilograms/height in meters2), is used as an index of overweight in children and adolescents. Body mass index guidelines are sex and age specific (Rosner et al. 1998), in that age is a part of the computation and the index is calculated separately for males and females (table 11). A boy, aged 5 who is of average height-45 incheswould need to weigh 53 pounds to be considered at risk for overweight. This is about 13 percent more than the average weight of 47 pounds. A girl, aged 5 who is of average height-44 incheswould need to weigh 51 pounds to be considered at risk for overweight. This is about 11 percent more than the average weight of 46 pounds."}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "Key Findings: Body Mass Index For both boys and girls, percent at risk for overweight varies by level of mother's education. Specifically, boys and girls whose mothers have less than a bachelor's degree are at greater risk for being overweight than boys and girls whose mothers have a bachelor's degree or higher. Boys and girls who come from homes where the primary language is not English are at greater risk for being overweight than boys and girls who come from homes where the primary language is English. Risk for being overweight also varies by children's race/ethnicity. Hispanic boys are at greater risk than their white and black counterparts for being overweight. White girls are less likely to be at risk for overweight than their black and Hispanic counterparts.  (Bukatko and Daehler 1995;Meisels et al. 1993). Children's control and coordination of balance and body movements relates to their performance in academic areas in the elementary grades. Specifically, children's visual motor skills (i.e., coordination of eyes and hand movements) are among the best predictors of reading achievement in the first through third grades (Tramontana et al. 1988). Other studies (e.g., Wailbrown et al. 1975) demonstrate that although cognitive measures are more effective predictors of reading vocabulary, perceptual measures are' better predictors of reading comprehension. Children's motor development and neuromotor maturation affect their socioemotional development as well. Problems in motor coordination correlate with peer ratings and loneliness (Doan and Scherman 1987;Hartup 1983;Hops and Finch 1985;Page et al. 1992). For boys in particular, physical prowess is a consideration in the formation of social networks as boys progress through the elementary years. In combination with height and weight, motor assessment gives an indication of the well-being of the child. The ECLS-K direct measures of fine motor skills involve children constructing forms with wooden blocks, copying basic figures (e.g., circle, square, cross) and drawing a person. The gross motor assessment involves balancing on each foot, hopping on each foot, skipping and walking backward on a line. For comparison purposes, note that the fine motor (maximum nine points) and the gross motor (maximum eight points) scales are not scored the same as each other. On both scales, higher scores indicate higher levels of coordination (tables 12-13). To fully appreciate differences by child and family characteristics in fine and gross motor ability, the scores were empirically divided into approximate thirds. Therefore, comparisons about the characteristics of children scoring in the lower, middle and higher portion of the distribution can be made. The middle group of children is able to perform the fine and gross motor tasks expected for children their age. The lower group of children are scoring about one or more standard deviations below the average. These children are possibly at risk for later developmental difficulties."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Key Findings: Motor Skills More girls than boys score in the higher portion of the distribution for both fine and gross motor skills (tables 13 and 14).

"}, {"section_title": "61", "text": "Developmental Difficulties. Children's health and well-being is broadly defined as the absence of or freedom from disease or chronic symptoms that limit successful engagement in age-appropriate physical, mental and social activities. A healthy youngster is not simply one who is growing well and is free from disease, but one who demonstrates appropriate physical, mental and social competencies for his or her age and the capacity to engage successfully in age-appropriate activities (Shonkoff 1992). Information about pre-existing and persistent difficulties contributes to a fuller understanding of first-time kindergartners. The developmental difficulties described in this section are important indicators of greater vulnerability for poor school outcomes. However, the presence of a limitation does not in itself indicate a diagnosis or impairment. The parent-reported developmental difficulties presented in this section include: vision, hearing, activity level, attention, articulation and coordination. Parents were asked to rate their child as compared to other children of the same age. Teachers and parents of kindergarten children rated a child's ability to sit still and pay attention as essential or very important to his/her being ready to start school (West et al. 1993). Parents were asked about their children's overall activity level and ability to pay attention. Risk for developmental difficulties pertaining to activity level was indicated if the parent responded their child was a lot more active than children the same age. Risk for developmental difficulties pertaining to ability to pay attention was indicated if the parent responded their child paid attention less well or much less well than other children the same age (table 16). Children's coordination also relates to their chances for school success. If children possess a marked lack of basic coordination (such as movement of arms and legs), this lack of coordination may impact how they relate to others. Similarly, a difficulty in articulation may detrimentally affect how children relate to others. Parents were asked to rate their child's coordination and ability to pronounce words and communicate effectively. Risk for developmental difficulty was indicated if the parent felt their child's coordination and word pronunciation was slightly less or much less than other children the same age (table 16).\nAnd third, some interesting patterns emerge across domains. For example, black children are more likely to score in the higher group of children in gross motor skills than any racial/ethnic group. At the same time, black children are also being rated by their teachers as demonstrating higher frequencies of problematic behaviors (e.g., arguing, fighting) than other racial/ethnic groups and are also being rated by their parents as being much more active than other children their age. Together, these findings present an interesting picture that warrants consideration. As we have seen in this report, children entering kindergarten for the first time have a wide range of skills, knowledge and experiences. While they are similar in many ways, differences exist in relation to children's background and experiences. As we mentioned, kindergarten is a critical period in children's early school careersthis experience sets children on a path that influences their subsequent learning and school achievement. This report and future data from the ECLS-K will help to inform researchers, practitioners, educators, parents and policymakers on issues concerning young children's education and aid in a deeper understanding of the connection between children's early school experiences and later school success."}, {"section_title": "62", "text": "Key Findings: Developmental Difficulties Only a small percentage of first-time kindergartners are experiencing vision (6 percent) and hearing problems (3 percent).'

The ways in which children approach learning frames the very essence of how they think and act in learning situations (Kagan et al. 1995). Consequently, it is important to examine behavioral inclinations or dispositions such as independence, task persistence, eagerness to learn and creativity (Kopp 1982). The term approaches to learning represents a broad array of behaviors that influence learning. Certain characteristics related to children's approach to learning may influence how prepared they are for learning in a formal school setting. Children who are able to work undisturbed and persist at tasks and who are attentive are more likely to have a successful experience in the school setting. Kindergartners' ability to sustain their attention, for example, has been shown to predict later achievement in reading and mathematics (Tramontana et al. 1988) and to contribute to an easier adjustment to school. Children who are rated by teachers as able to complete tasks, follow directions and the like tend to also be rated higher in their academic achievement in general and in reading and mathematics in particular (Clark et al. 1985). Consequently, we examine children's learning styles in terms of their task persistence, eagerness to learn new things, creativity and ability to focus attention. Parents and teachers provided information on children's learning approaches. Parents were asked to rate how frequently their child persists at tasks, seems eager to learn new things and demonstrates creativity. Teachers were asked similar questions, rating how frequently the child persists at tasks, seems eager to learn new things and pays attention.8 Parent and teacher responses were categorized as either never/sometimes or often/very often. 8 The construct of paying attention is also addressed in the developmental difficulties section of the previous chapter. In the Physical Well-Being chapter, we presented parent ratings of concern for their children's ability to pay attention. Here, we present teacher ratings of how often the child pays attention in the classroom. Therefore, depending on the context of the question, the construct of paying attention can be conceptualized as both a potential risk for developmental difficulty and as an integral part of a child's approach to learning."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings: Approaches to Learning", "text": "Parents and teachers have similar views of children's task persistence.

Both parents and teachers attribute task persistence more often to girls than boys, to the oldest (born in 1992) than the youngest (born September through December 1993) and to children not at risk than children at risk for school difficulty (low maternal education, single mother and receipt of public assistance), except on the basis of home language. Both parents and teachers were less likely to rate black children as often or very often persistent at tasks than white and Asian children. Teachers are less likely than parents to identify the children as often or very often eager to learn. Parents report that 92 percent of children behave in this way; teachers report that 75 percent children seem eager to learn. Teachers perceive differences by child and family characteristics in children's eagerness to learn. For example, girls are more likely than boys to be seen as eager to learn, and older children (born in 1992) are more likely rated as eager to learn than younger children (born September through December 1993). Children with some characteristics of risk (low maternal education, single-mother household and receipt of public assistance) are less likely to be seen as eager to learn than children not at risk. White and Asian children are more likely to be seen as eager to learn by their teachers than black or Hispanic children. Parent ratings of children's eagerness to learn differ by mother's education and receipt of public assistance. Children whose mothers have lower levels of education and those who have received public assistance are less likely to be seen by their parents as eager to learn in comparison with children whose mothers have higher levels of education or whose family had not received public assistance. About 85 percent of children are seen by their parents as demonstrating creativity in work or play often to very often. Children whose mothers have not completed high school are less often seen as creative by their parents than children whose mothers have a high school diploma or greater. White children are more often seen as creative by their parents than black, Asian or Hispanic children. A majority of children's teachers (66 percent) state that first-time kindergartners are able to pay attention most of the time (often to very often). Girls are more likely than boys and older kindergartners are more likely than younger kindergartners to be seen as having this ability. According to teachers, children with some characteristics of risk are less likely than other children to be able to pay attention. Their teachers view black children as less likely than white, Asian or Hispanic children to be able to pay attention.

The variability of children's knowledge, skills and behaviors at entry to kindergarten can be attributed to the variety of the educational opportunities in the home. Parents play a central role in young children's socialization and learning (Maccoby 1992). To a large extent, young children learn by interacting with others. Young children thrive when they can actively participate in and construct their knowledge (Ginsburg and Opper 1988). They learn through both direct experience and vicarious experience (Bandura 1986). It is extremely important for young children to directly experience activities such as reading, constructing projects, playing with puzzles and playing sports. Children gain invaluable experience and knowledge through actively doing. Also, children learn through observation. When parents or family members read stories, tell stories and sing songs, children construct knowledge and learn skills by modeling the behavior. Additionally, parents serve as mentors who can effectively bridge children's skills to the next level; this too is an invaluable part of the learning process (Wertsch 1985). Furthermore, child care experiences may be associated with the variance in skills children demonstrate as they enter kindergarten. In the mid-1990s, approximately 60 percent of preschool children under the age of 6 experienced some type of nonparental care and education (West et al. 1995); approximately 40 percent of kindergartners received nonparental care before or after school (Brimhall et al. 1999). High quality programs with experienced, well-trained staff provide an enriched setting that may serve as a foundation for the transition to school. Quality early care and education programs provide opportunities to explore social and cognitive tasks that better prepare children for success in school. For example, children who have participated in group care may have an easier time interacting with a large group of unfamiliar peers and adults. They may also be better acclimated to the school setting and to learning experiences and tasks. Once in kindergarten, the care and education children experience before and after school may serve to further support or enrich what is taught in the classroom (Brimhall et al. 1999)."}, {"section_title": "69", "text": "Literacy Environment and Family Interactions. The extent to which parents and families in the United States interact with young children in the home is of particular interest. Specifically, policymakers, researchers, educators and parents take an interest in suggested practices (Bredekamp and Copp le 1997) such as the frequency with which parents read, tell stories, sing and play with their children. Moreover, information about the literacy environment in the home may shed light on children's cognitive skills as they enter kindergarten. A strong indicator of the literacy environment in the home may be the number of child-oriented resources (e.g., books, tapes and CDs). A literacy rich environment contributes to children's language and literacy development, which in turn plays a role in their chances for school success (Snow et al. 1991). Similarly, the opportunities for children to interact with their family in educational activities may enhance their chances for school success. Experiences such as reading with children, singing songs with children and playing with children serve a dual purpose. These activities not only enrich their language and literacy experiences but also potentially transmit information and knowledge about people, places and things. Research suggests that these types of activities are on the rise (Wright et al. 1994). Moreover, we need to consider not only the literacy environment and home educational activities but also how the literacy environment and home educational activities differ by child and family characteristics (National Center for Education Statistics 1998)."}, {"section_title": "7 0 Key Findings: Literacy Environment and Family Interactions", "text": "The majority of parents report having more than 25 children's books in the home (table 19). More than half of parents report having more than five children's records, audiotapes or CDs in the home. The number of children's books in the home varies by maternal education and family receipt of welfare. Mothers with lower education and families reporting receipt of welfare were more likely to report having fewer books in the home (0-25 books) than mothers with higher education and families with no reported welfare receipt. This pattern is also found for the number of children's records, audiotapes or CDs in the home. Nearly half of parents report reading to their child (table 20) and singing songs to their child (table   21) every day (45 percent). Thirty-eight percent of parents report playing games with their kindergartners three to six times a week (table 22). Nearly half (44 to 47 percent) of families engage in telling stories, doing arts and crafts and playing sports or exercise once or twice a week or less. Activities such as reading and singing songs vary by maternal education, family type, welfare receipt and race/ethnicity. Children whose mothers have lower levels of education, single mothers, families reporting receipt of welfare services and black parents are less likely to be read to every day than those with mothers with higher levels of education, two-parent families, families without welfare support and white, Hispanic and Asian parents (respectively). A different pattern emerges with an activity like singing songs.

A child's social world is influenced by many different groups, the closest being the family. Upon entering kindergarten, a child's world expands to include the school and larger community. For many children, however, another vital influence is the nonparental care and education they receive. These settings can provide educational opportunities similar to those provided in the home and the school. Their influence on children can be as essential as that of the parents, teachers and schools. With the number of children receiving care from persons other than their parents, their participation in nonparental care and education is of concern. High quality care and education programs have positive influences on children's social-emotional and cognitive development, and can provide children with the opportunity to develop more advanced social and language skills, a more positive disposition, and increase the complexity of their play and cooperativeness (Love et al. 1996). Attendance in a preschool program may account for variance in children's cognitive skills at kindergarten entry (Gullo and Burton 1992). In particular, the type of care children receive (e.g., center-based, relative care) relates to differences in their social-emotional and cognitive development, as well as their school performance (Miller and Marx 1990;Pierce et al. 1999;Vanden and Corasaniti 1988).

Prior to kindergarten, children from homes where English is not the primary language are less likely to have attended a center-based program the year before starting kindergarten. Once children enter kindergarten for the first time, about 50 percent of these children receive care before and/or after school from someone other than their parents (table 24). As children enter kindergarten, before-and/or after-school care is most often provided in a private home by a relative of the child. Center-based care is the second most frequent type of before-and after-school care setting followed by nonrelative care. At kindergarten entry, children whose mothers have less than a high school education are more likely to receive before-and/or after-school care from a relative than from a nonrelative or center-based provider. In contrast, kindergartners whose mothers have a college education are more likely to receive care in a center-based setting than in either of the two home-based settings. At kindergarten entry, black children are more likely than white, Asian or Hispanic children to receive before-and/or after-school care.

In this report, we also demonstrate that risk factors such as having a mother with less than a high school diploma, being from a single-mother family, welfare receipt and a non-English primary language relate to the differences in children's knowledge, skills and health at school entry. The findings in this report suggest some areas for further investigation. To name a fewfirst, in this report, we looked at children's knowledge and skills by a specific set of child and family characteristics (e.g., child's sex, age at entry, race/ethnicity, maternal education). Future reports can take a different perspective, and analyze children's knowledge and skills in terms of additional family characteristics and school characteristics. For example, the data can be analyzed in terms of pre-school attendance, kindergarten program type (i.e., full day/part day) and school type (e.g., public/nonpublic). Furthermore, the data can be analyzed in terms of the possible cumulative effects of risk factors (e.g., low maternal education, minority status, receipt of welfare services) and the interaction of these risk factors (e.g., maternal education with race/ethnicity) with other child and program characteristics. These types of analysis may have important policy implications.

Primarily, we presented the data by looking at parent perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics and teacher perceptions in relation to child and family characteristics.

It is designed to provide detailed information on children's early school experiences. The study began in the fall of the 1998-99 school year. The children participating in the ECLS-K will be followed longitudinally through the fifth grade. ,Sample Design. A nationally representative sample of 22,625 children enrolled in 1,277 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99-school year were sampled to participate in the ECLS-K. The children attended both public and private kindergartens that offered full-day and part-day programs. The sample included children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and included oversamples of Asian children, private kindergartens and private school kindergartners. This study supports separate estimates of public and private school kindergartners; black, Hispanic, white and Asian children; and children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Sampling for the ECLS-K involved a dual-frame, multistage sampling design. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 100 primary sampling units (PSU) from a national sample of PSUs. The PSUs were counties and county groups. Public and private schools were then selected within the PSUs, and students were sampled from the selected schools. Public schools were selected from the Common Core of Data, a public school frame, and private schools were selected from a private school frame developed from the Private School Survey.10 Approximately 23 kindergartners were selected on average within each of the sampled schools. Fall kindergarten data were obtained from September to December 1998. Data were collected from the child, the child's parents/guardians and teachers in the following ways. Child Assessments. Children were asked to participate in various activities designed to measure important cognitive (e.g., general knowledge, literacy and quantitative skills) and noncognitive (e.g., motor skills) skills. All measures were obtained through an untimed one-on-one assessment of the child. 1\u00b0 During the spring of 1998, Westat identified new schools that were not found on either frame. A sample of these schools was included in the ECLS-K school sample."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Each child was assessed using a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), administered oneon-one from the assessor to child. The assessment consists of three cognitive domains (reading, mathematics and general knowledge); a psychomotor assessment, including fine and gross motor skills; and height and weight measurements. The cognitive assessment included a two-stage battery, where the first stage in each domain contained a routing test that determined a child's approximate skills. According to the child's performance on the routing test, the child was administered the appropriate skill level assessment for that domain (the second stage). The reading and mathematics assessments had three skill levels, while the general knowledge domain had two skill levels. Parent Interview. Parents/guardians were asked to provide key information about their children on subjects such as family demographics (e.g., age, relation to child, race/ethnicity), family structure (household members and composition), parent involvement, home educational activities, child care experience, child health, parental education and employment status and child's social skills and behaviors. Most of the data were collected through a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), though some of the interviews were collected through a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) when respondents did not have a telephone or were reluctant to be interviewed by telephone. Teacher Questionnaires. All kindergarten teachers with sampled children were asked to fill out three self-administered questionnaires. The first two pertained to their own educational backgrounds, teaching practices, experiences and the classroom settings where they taught.

These schools were included in order to meet the target sample sizes for students. Substitute schools are not included in the school response rate calculations. The ECLS-K school response rates are comparable to or exceed those of past NCES longitudinal surveys. In the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), 69.7 percent of the originally sampled schools agreed to participate in the base year. Of the sampled children, 19,173 participated in the fall kindergarten child assessment for an 89.8 cooperation rate or a response rate of 66.4 percent (74% X 89.8%). There were no large differences in cooperation rates for subgroups of children: 89.5 percent of sampled boys participated, and 90.4 percent of sampled girls participated. Asians had the lowest cooperation rates at 88.6 percent while American Indians or Alaskan Natives had the highest response rate of 93.4 percent. There were 18,101 parent interviews completed during the fall of the school year for a cooperation rate of 85.3 percent or a 63 percent response rate (74% X 85.3%).

Five different approaches are being used to examine the possibility of bias in the ECLS-K sample. First, weighted and unweighted response rates for schools, children, parents, teachers and school administrators are being examined to find large response rate differences by characteristics of schools (e.g., urbanicity, region, school size, percent minority and grade range) and children (e.g., sex, age, race-ethnicity). Second, estimates based on the ECLS-K respondents are being compared to estimates based on the full sample. The distributions of schools by school type, urbanicity, region and the distributions of enrollment by kindergarten type (public versus private), race-ethnicity, urbanicity, region and eligibility for free and reduced-price lunch are being compared for the responding schools and all the schools on the sampling frame. Third, estimates from the ECLS-K are being compared with estimates from other data sources (e.g., Current Population Survey, National Household Education Survey, Survey of Income and Program Participation). Fourth, estimates using the ECLS-K unadjusted weights are being compared with estimates using the ECLS-K weights adjusted for nonresponse. Large differences in the estimates produced with these two different weights would indicate the potential for bias. Fifth, and last, simulations of nonresponse are being conducted. All of the above analyses are underway and some have been completed. The results of these analyses will be summarized in the ECLS-K User's Manual and reported in detail in the ECLS-K Methodology Report. Preliminary findings from these analyses suggest that there is not a bias due to school nonresponse. In particular, there is no evidence of a bias in the types of estimates found in this report."}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-K are subject to two types of error, sampling and nonsampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. Nonsampling Errors. Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations, as well as data collection, processing and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically problems like unit and item nonresponse, the differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of the questions, response differences related to the particular time the survey was conducted and mistakes in data preparation."}, {"section_title": "8 7", "text": "In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias caused by this error. In the ECLS-K efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible. For instance, during the survey design phase, focus groups and cognitive laboratory interviews were conducted for the purpose of assessing respondent knowledge topics, comprehension of questions and terms and the sensitivity of items. The design phase also entailed testing for the CAPI instrument and a field test that evaluated the implementation of the survey. By designing the child assessment to be both individually administered and untimed both coverage error and bias were reduced. Individual administration decreases problems associated with group administration such as children slowing down and not staying with the group or simply getting distracted. The advantage of having untimed exams was that the study was able to include most children with learning disabilities, hearing aids, etc. The only children who were excluded from the study were those who were blind, deaf, those whose Individual Education Program (IEP) clearly stated that they were not to be tested and non-English speaking children who were determined to lack adequate English or Spanish to meaningfully participate in the ECLS-K battery. Exclusion from the direct child assessment did not exclude children from all other parts (e.g., teacher questionnaire, parent interview). Another potential source of nonsampling error is respondent bias which occurs when respondents systematically misreport (intentionally or unintentionally) information in a study. One potential source of respondent bias in this survey is social desirability bias. If there are no systematic differences among specific groups under study in their tendency to give socially desirable responses, then comparisons of the different groups will accurately reflect differences among the groiips. An associated error occurs when respondents give unduly positive assessments about those close to them. For example, parents may give rosier assessments about their children's school experiences than might be obtained from school records or from the teachers. Response bias may also potentially be introduced in the responses of the teachers about each individual student. Each teacher filled out a survey for each of the sampled children they taught in which they answered questions on the child's socioemotional development. Since the survey was conducted in the fall it is possible that the teachers did not have adequate time to observe the children, and thus some of the responses may be influenced by the expectations of the teacher based on which groups (e.g., sex, racial, linguistic, disability) the children belonged to. In order to minimize bias, all items were subjected to multiple cognitive interviews, field tests and actual teachers were involved in the design of the cognitive assessment battery and questionnaires. NCES also followed the criteria recommended in a 67 83 working paper on the accuracy of teacher judgments of students' academic performances (Perry and Meisels 1996). Readers should be aware that respondent bias may be present in this survey as in any survey. It is not possible to state precisely how such bias may affect the results. NCES has tried to minimize some of these biases by conducting one on one, untimed assessments and by asking some of the same questions about the sampled child of both teachers and parents. Sarno lime Errors and Weightinjr. The sample of kindergarten children from the class of 1998-99 was just one of many possible samples that could have been selected. Therefore, estimates produced from the ECLS-K sample may differ from estimates that would have been produced from other samples. This type of variability is called sampling error because it arises from using a sample of children attending kindergarten in 1998-99, rather than all children attending kindergarten that year. The standard error is a measure of the variability due to sampling when estimating a statistic. Standard errors for estimates presented in this report were computed using a jackknife replication method. Standard errors can be used as a measure for the precision expected from a particular sample. The probability that a complete census count would differ from the sample estimate by less than 1 standard error is 68 percent. The chance that the difference would be less than 1.65 standard errors is about 90 percent, and that the difference would be less than 1.96 standard errors, about 95 percent. Standard errors for all of the estimates are included in appendix A in this report. These standard errors can be used to produce confidence intervals. For example, it is estimated that 51 percent of the parents reported that their children had excellent general health, and this statistic has a standard error of 0.70 percent. Therefore, the estimated 95 percent confidence interval for this statistic is approximately 50 to 52 percent (1.96 X .70 = 1.4; confidence interval = 51 4-1-1.4). In order to produce national estimates from the ECLS-K data collected during the fall of the 1998-99 school year, the sample data were weighted. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities at the school and child levels and adjusts for school, child, teacher and parent nonresponse. The first stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the sampled primary sampling units (PSUs) equal to the inverse of the PSU probability of selection.12 The second stage of the weighting process assigns weights to the schools sampled within PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of selecting the school. The base weights for eligible schools are adjusted for nonresponse. These adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. The base weight for each child in the sample is the school nonresponse adjusted weight for the school the child attends multiplied by a post-stratified within school student weight (total number of students in the school divided by the number of students sampled in the school). The parent weight, which is the weight used to produce the estimates found in this report, is the base child weight adjusted for nonresponse to the parent interview. Again, these adjustments are made separately for public and private schools. In addition to properly weighting the responses, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed because the data were collected using a complex sample design. Complex sample designs, like that used in the ECLS-K, result in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of the results. Frequently, the standard errors of the estimates are larger than would be expected if the sample was a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. WesVarPC was used in this analysis to calculate standard errors. Replication methods of variance estimation were used to reflect the actual sample design used in the ECLS-K. A form of the jackknife replication method (J1(2) using 90 replicates was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report. The jackknife methods were used to estimate the precision of the estimates of the reported national percentages and means. To test the difference between estimates, Student's t statistic was employed, using unbiased estimates of standard errors derived by the replication methods mentioned above. Also, trend tests were used to test statements regarding the relationship between two characteristics (e.g., mother's education and children's performance on the ECLS-K assessment battery). As the number of comparisons at the same significance levels increases, it becomes more likely that at least one of the estimated differences will be significant merely by chance, that is, it will be erroneously identified as different from zero. Even when there is no statistical difference between the means or percentages being compared, there is a 5 percent chance of getting a significant F or t value from sampling error alone. As the number of comparisons increases, the chance of making this type of 69 90 error also increases. A Bonferroni adjustment procedure was used to correct significance tests for multiple comparisons. This method adjusts the significance level for the total number of comparisons made with a particular classification variable. For example, the total number of comparisons for the type of family is three (i.e., single father vs. single mother, single father vs. two parents, single mother vs. two parents). Thus the significance criterion for each family type comparison is adjusted to p = 0.0167 (i.e., 0.05/3). The Reading assessment included questions in basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word recognition), vocabulary (picture vocabulary) and comprehension (listening comprehension, close sentences, words in context)."}, {"section_title": "Definitions of Variables", "text": "Comprehension items were targeted to measure skills in initial understanding, developing interpretation, personal reflection and demonstrating critical stance. The reliability of the estimate of overall reading ability (IRT-based theta) was .90. About half of the Mathematics assessment consisted of questions in number sense and number properties and operations. The remainder of the assessment included questions in measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics and probability; and patterns, algebra and functions. The assessment items were designed to measure skills in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge and problem solving, with the heaviest emphasis on problem solving. The reliability of the estimate of overall mathematics ability (IRT-based theta) was .90. The General Knowledge assessment was a composite of science and social studies material. The science questions assessed conceptual understanding; observing/collecting data/classification; communication; and drawing/testing inferences, in the context of questions based on life science and the physical sciences. Social studies material included questions relating to history/government, culture, geography and economics. The assessment questions drew on children's experiences with their environment and many questions related to more than one of the categories listed. The reliability of the estimate of overall general knowledge and skills (IRT-based theta) was .88."}, {"section_title": "70", "text": "Standardized Scores (T-Scores): The standardized scores reported in the ECLS-K database are transformations of IRT theta (ability) estimates, resealed to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 using cross-sectional sample weights for fall kindergarten. For example, a t-score of 55 represents a reading achievement level that is half a standard deviation higher than the mean for the fall kindergarten population represented by the tested sample of ECLS-K participants. T-scores do not measure mastery of a particular skill or set of skills. They provide only normative information; that is, an estimate of an individual's or a subgroup's achievement level relative to the population as a whole. T-Scores cannot be used to determine whether the population means are high or low, or whether average population gains over time are large or small. They can only provide an indicator of the extent to which an individual or a subgroup ranks higher or lower than the national average and how much this relative ranking changes over time. Proficiency Level Scores: Proficiency scores provide a means of distinguishing status or gain in specific skills within a content area from the overall achievement measured by the IRT Scale Scores and T-Scores. Clusters of four assessment questions having similar content and difficulty were included at several points along the score scale of the Reading and Mathematics assessments. (No proficiency scores were computed for the General Knowledge assessment, since the questions did not follow a hierarchical pattern.) A student was assumed to have mastered a particular level of proficiency if at least three of the four items in the cluster were answered correctly, and to have failed at this level if two or more items were wrong. Clusters of items provide a more reliable assessment of proficiency than do single items because of the possibility of guessing: it is very unlikely that a student who has not mastered a particular skill would be able to guess enough answers correctly to pass a four item cluster.. The proficiency levels were assumed to follow a Guttman model; that is, a student passing a particular skill level was expected to have mastered all lower levels; not passing a particular skill level indicates non-mastery at higher levels. Only a very small percentage of children in fall kindergarten had response patterns that did not follow the Guttman model, that is, a non-passing score at a lower level followed by a passing score at a higher level. Other Direct Assessments. In addition to cognitive assessments, children's height, weight and psychomotor skills were also directly assessed. The psychomotor assessment consisted of both fine and gross motor skills. For the fine motor skills (scale 0-9) children were asked to manipulate blocks and copy a formation (maximum 2 points), copy basic figures (maximum 5 points) and draw a person 71 (maximum 2 points). For the gross motor assessments (scale 0-8), children were asked to balance on one foot (maximum 2 points), hop on one foot (maximum 2 points), skip (maximum 2 points) and walk backward on a straight line (maximum 2 points). Children's Social Skills. Problem Behaviors. Approaches to Learning and Health Status. Parents and teachers were administered items which assessed children's social skills (e.g., frequency with which children make friends and comfort others), problem behaviors (e.g., frequency with which children fight with others and get angry easily) and how children approach learning (e.g., frequency with which children persist at tasks and seem eager to learn). Parents were asked to provide information about children's general health, activity level, ability to pay attention, coordination and articulation. In a largescale survey setting it is difficult, time-intensive and costly to directly assess young children's social skills, problem behaviors, approaches to learning and health status. Therefore, parents and teachers reported on these constructs. When interpreting this information, we need to take into account that the nature of the data is parent and teacher report and not a direct assessment (for a review see Zill et al. 1995). Derived Variables. A number of variables used in this report were derived by combining information from one or more questions in the ECLS-K. The derivation of key variables is described in this section. Children's age at entry to kindergarten: This variable was constructed using two variables: month and year of birth. These variables were combined to form five categories: children born prior to September 1992, born between September December 1992, January April 1993, May August 1993and September December 1993 Mother's education: This variable was constructed using the question on the highest grade the mother had completed, and whether the mother had obtained a high school equivalency degree if she did not complete high school. This information was collapsed into four categories: less than high school, high school or equivalent, some college including vocational/technical training and bachelor's degree or higher. Family type: This variable is a composite that is constructed from the household roster. The following information was used in the construction: whether there was a mother present in the household and her relationship to the child (birth, adoptive, step, foster, partner), whether there was a father present 72 93 in the household and his relationship to the child (birth, adoptive, step, foster, partner). This information was used to construct a variable with the following categories: single-mother household, single-father household and two-parent household. Welfare receipt: Welfare receipt refers to the utilization of Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) since the child was born or in the past 6 months. Primary language spoken in home: For this report a dichotomous variable was used to indicate whether English was the primary language spoken at home. This composite was constructed by using responses to three questions in the parent interview: whether another language other than English was regularly spoken at home; if yes, whether English was also spoken at home; and if English and one or more other languages were spoken at home, which of those languages would be considered the primary language spoken at home. Children's race/ethnicity: The race/ethnicity composite was constructed from two parentreported variables: ethnicity and race. New Office of Management and Budget guidelines were followed under which a respondent could select more than one race. Thus each respondent had to identify whether the child was Hispanic, and then select one or more race. The following are the seven composite race/ethnicity categories: white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian, Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native and more than one race specified non-Hispanic. Due to sample size restrictions, this publication only does significance tests for whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians.
