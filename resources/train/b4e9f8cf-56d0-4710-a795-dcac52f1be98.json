[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease xx (20xx) Background: Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by cerebral amyloid-\u2424 positivity (A\u2424+) in cognitively normal (CN) older adults. Objective: To estimate the risk of progression to the symptomatic stages of AD due to PET A\u2424+ and the extent that progression was influenced by other demographic, genetic, and clinical characteristics in a large prospective study. Methods: Fine-Gray subdistribution modeling was used to examine the risk of progression from CN to MCI/dementia due to A\u2424+, APOE 4 carriage, and their interaction in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) flagship study of aging CN cohort (n = 599) over 8 years.\nResults: 17.7% A\u2424+ and 8.1% A\u2424-progressed over 8 years (OR: 2.43). Risk of progression for A\u2424+ was 65-104% greater than A\u2424-. A\u2424+ APOE 4 carriers were at 348% greater risk than all other participants. Significant risk factors of progression in A\u2424+ were age (HR: 1.05), PET SUVR (HR: 2.49) and APOE 4 carriage (HR: 2.63); only age was a significant risk factor in A\u2424-(HR: 1.09). A\u2424-progressors were not near the threshold for A\u2424+. These relationships were not moderated by hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or stroke/TIA. Conclusion: A\u2424+ is an important prognostic marker for progression from CN to MCI/dementia in older adults and APOE 4 carriage provides further predictive value in the presence of A\u2424+. These data suggest that A\u2424-associated clinical progression is consistent with clinical-pathological models of AD, whereas progression in the absence of elevated A\u2424 deposition may be the result of neuropathological processes other than AD that accumulate with age."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Clinical-pathological models propose that Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with accumulation of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) followed by aggregation of tau, which result in cortical atrophy, cognitive decline and, ultimately, dementia [1, 2] . Biomarker studies using positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling show that A\u2424 accumulation begins up to 20 years prior to the onset of dementia [3] . According to these models, cognitively normal (CN) older adults with elevated levels of A\u2424 (A\u2424+) are in the preclinical stages of AD [2, 4] . Even though CN A\u2424+ individuals are clinically asymptomatic, preclinical AD is characterized by subtle progressive cognitive decline, primarily in episodic memory [5] , which may reflect insidious loss of cortical brain volume due to A\u2424+ [6] [7] [8] . Prospective studies in both experimental and epidemiological cohorts have indicated that CN A\u2424+ adults have higher risk of progression to clinical classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia compared to those without elevated A\u2424 (i.e., A\u2424-) [9, 10] . Clinical trials of A\u2424-lowering drugs have endeavored to recruit CN A\u2424+ older adults based on their increased risk for incident MCI/dementia in an attempt to slow cognitive decline and prevent onset of symptomatic AD (e.g. Clinical Trials NCT02569398 and NCT02008357) [11] . Furthermore, recently proposed guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledges the centrality of biomarkers such as A\u2424+ for recruitment of participants for early AD clinical trials, where Stage 0 includes individuals who are asymptomatic but have evidence of AD pathophysiologic changes [12] . Understanding the risk of progression to MCI/dementia associated with A\u2424+ over the long time periods characteristic of preclinical AD is therefore necessary to inform models of disease etiology and guide recruitment and outcome expectations in clinical trials or clinical studies of preclinical AD and AD.\nIncidence of progression to MCI/dementia in large samples of A\u2424+ CN adults ranges from 17.7% over an average of 3.7 years in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA, mean age 76) [10] , 26 .4% over 5 years in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center study (Knight ADRC, mean age 72) [13] , 19% over 6 years in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL, mean age 73) [14] , to 32.2% over an average of 4 years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, mean age 74) [15] . In all studies, the incidence of progression was at least two times greater in A\u2424+ compared to A\u2424-. Together, these studies show that A\u2424+ increases risk for clinical disease progression in CN adults, although the error associated with some risk estimates is increased by the small sample sizes at the longer follow-up intervals [16] . For example, in ADNI, data beyond 4 years were available for 16% of the initial A\u2424+ sample [15] . Similarly, estimates of progression at 5 years were based on 25% of the baseline MCSA sample [10] , and 35% of the Knight ADRC data were available beyond 5 years [17] . These small samples limit the use of complex analyses to examine the influence of other characteristics proposed to hasten progression to symptomatic disease (e.g., age, interactions between apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 carriage and A\u2424 status) [18] . APOE 4 carriage is associated with increased risk of both A\u2424+ and dementia in CN older adults [19, 20] , and neuropsychological studies show that A\u2424+ APOE 4 carriers experience greater cognitive decline than A\u2424+ APOE 4 non-carriers [18, 21, 22] ; therefore, the prognostic value of A\u2424 and APOE 4 may be increased by examining their effects combined. Finally, although there is evidence that vascular and metabolic conditions increase risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in CN adults [23, 24] , few studies have sought to account for their influence on estimates of A\u2424-associated clinical progression. Although the prevalence of vascular disease in the population-based MCSA is higher than that found in controlled experimental samples [25] , it was reported that adjustment for vascular diseases did not change their progression risk estimates [10] . Whether this remains the case in a large experimental cohort is yet to be seen.\nThe first aim of this study was to examine the incidence of A\u2424-associated progression to MCI/dementia among CN older adults. The second aim was to identify demographic and clinical characteristics that moderate the relationship between A\u2424 status and progression. The first hypothesis was that A\u2424+ would be associated with greater risk of clinical disease progression over 8 years. The second hypothesis was that A\u2424-associated progression to MCI/dementia would be increased further by APOE 4 carriage. Post-hoc analyses explored how demographic and clinical risk factors influenced clinical disease progression in A\u2424+ and A\u2424-CN adults."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were enrolled in the AIBL flagship study of aging, details of which have been described elsewhere [26] . Briefly, volunteers were excluded from entry if they had any of the following: non-AD dementia, history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, current depression (Geriatric Depression Scale score >5), Parkinson's disease, cancer (other than basal cell skin carcinoma) within the last 2 years, symptomatic stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, past head injury with >1 hour of post-traumatic amnesia, or current regular alcohol intake above recommended limits [27] . Health status at each study visit was determined from clinical assessment comprising measurement of vital signs (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure using an electric sphygmomanometer) and self-reported medical history. Blood pathology for all participants was assessed at baseline. All included participants were identified to have no, or medically well-controlled systemic illnesses at baseline. Ethics approval for the AIBL study was granted by St Vincent's Health, Austin Health, and Edith Cowan University, and written informed consent was collected from all participants prior to clinical and neuropsychological assessment at every 18-month interval.\nCurrently, the AIBL study includes 787 CN adults aged above 60 years who have undergone A\u2424 PET neuroimaging. Participants were recruited in two waves: an inception cohort (n = 444) followed for up to 8 years, and an enrichment cohort (n = 343) followed for up to 4.5 years. Of the initial cohort, 70.5% have remained active in the study for all visits up to 8 years.

Data for 19 participants with inconsistent clinical classification (n = 16) or A\u2424 status (n = 3) during the study period were excluded from all analyses. Twenty participants had incomplete covariate data, which were imputed based on information contained in their clinical visit notes where possible.

Threshold values for elevated A\u2424 deposition vary by radiotracer, so a linear regression transformation was applied to the FBP and FLUTE SUVR to create a \"PiB-like\" SUVR unit called Before the Centiloid Kernel Transformation (BeCKeT) [34] . All participants with SUVR/BeCKeT\u22651.40 at their most recent PET scan were classified A\u2424+ and those below the threshold were classified A\u2424-; however, participants whose SUVR/BeCKeT fluctuated around the threshold on multiple PET scans could not be accurately classified and were therefore excluded from all analyses."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses Baseline group differences", "text": "All continuous variables were assessed for normality by visual inspection of Q-Q plots.

To examine the effects of health factors proposed to influence disease progression, diabetes and stroke/TIA were added in Model 4. Finally, Model 5 included an A\u2424 status by APOE 4 interaction to compare the hazard of progression between participants who had both A\u2424+ and APOE 4 against all other participants.

The results supported the first hypothesis that A\u2424+ would be associated with greater risk of progression to MCI/dementia. Eight-year risk of progression to MCI/dementia in CN A\u2424+ adults from the AIBL study was increased by 65-104% compared to A\u2424- (Table 2 ). This indicates that A\u2424+ is an important prognostic marker for progression to MCI/dementia in CN older adults. The second hypothesis, that A\u2424-associated risk for progression to MCI/dementia would be increased further by APOE 4 carriage, was also supported. The large sample studied here allowed the risk of progression conferred by concurrent A\u2424+ and APOE 4 carriage to be estimated, taking into account health factors posited to influence progression to MCI/dementia as well as competing risks such as death or withdrawal due to illness. Risk of progression to MCI/dementia was 348% greater in A\u2424+ APOE 4 carriers compared to all other participants ( Table 2) . Similar findings were observed in the MCSA, although their risk estimate was reported relative to A\u2424-APOE 4 non-carriers (190%) [37] . In this study, no difference in risk was observed between A\u2424-APOE 4 non-carriers, A\u2424-APOE 4 carriers and A\u2424+ APOE 4 non-carriers, suggesting an additive effect between A\u2424+ and APOE 4 carriage that is greater than the sum of their individual contributions. This is consistent with results of neuropsychological studies showing that CN A\u2424+ APOE 4 carriers experience greater cognitive decline over time with earlier onset [18, 21, 22, 38] . In agreement with a recent report that episodic memory performance remains stable in A\u2424-regardless of APOE 4 status, APOE 4 carriage did not increase the risk of clinical disease progression in A\u2424- (Fig. 2c) [38] . Previous research shows that APOE 4 reduces clearance of cerebral A\u2424 but does not affect rates of A\u2424 production [39] ; therefore, the findings of this study indicate that the impaired clearance of A\u2424 due to APOE 4 is most clinically significant in individuals who have high levels of A\u2424.\nAs progression to MCI/dementia was observed in a small number of individuals with normal A\u2424 levels (8.1%), risk factors within the A\u2424+ and A\u2424-groups were investigated. Previous studies indicate that health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or stroke/TIA can contribute to cognitive decline and clinical disease progression in older adults [23, 24, 40] . Although higher prevalence of hypertension and lower BMI was observed in the A\u2424+ group, these differences were very small. Thus, both groups had similar cardiovascular risk profiles and these factors did not influence risk of progression within either A\u2424 group. For both A\u2424 groups, higher age at baseline was associated with increased risk of progression to MCI/dementia (Table 3) . Although A\u2424 deposition, and therefore risk of disease progression, is known to increase with age [41] , other neuropathological processes such as brain atrophy are also associated with age [42] . Higher relative A\u2424 deposition increased progression risk in the A\u2424+ group by 150%; however, PET SUVR/BeCKeT for A\u2424-progressors was not near the threshold for A\u2424+ (median 1.16, range 1.02-1.39) making it unlikely that progression in the A\u2424-group was due to any unrecognized increase in A\u2424. While it remains unknown whether abnormal levels of A\u2424 deposition play a causative role in the development of dementia due to AD, the recent NIA-AA Research Framework proposed that AD be defined by the presence of cortical A\u2424 and tau aggregates and neurodegeneration rather than by clinical symptoms due to the poor specificity of cognitive symptoms to detect AD neuropathological processes [4] . Taken together, these data suggest that A\u2424-associated clinical progression is consistent with AD neuropathological changes, whereas progression in the absence of elevated A\u2424 deposition is the result of disease processes other than AD that accumulate with age [43] . This indicates that the prognostic value of A\u2424+ is specific to dementia due to AD. Despite the longer time interval and greater statistical control over demographic, health and clinical characteristics, the 17.7% incidence of progression due to A\u2424+ was consistent with that observed previously over 6 years (19%) in the AIBL sample [14] . However, the current 8-year estimate of A\u2424-associated progression remained lower than those reported in the ADNI (32.2%) and Knight ADRC (26.4%) cohorts over similar time periods [15, 44] , and was equal to that reported by the MCSA (17.7%) over an average of 3.7 years [10] . The relatively lower incidence of progression in AIBL may reflect differences in the samples studied and the respective inclusion/exclusion criteria. For example, the ADNI and Knight ADRC cohorts were, on average, 2-4 years older than AIBL and the MSCA cohort was 6 years older than the AIBL cohort. The populationbased MCSA cohort reports higher prevalence of risk factors other than A\u2424+ for MCI/dementia: at baseline, 79.4% of the MCSA participants had hypertension, 18.7% had diabetes, and 14.3% had history of stroke [25] , compared to 38.8%, 7.3% and 1.8%, respectively, in the AIBL CN cohort. Despite the increased presence of these factors and older age in the MCSA, the estimates of A\u2424-associated progression were similar and may also reflect comparable methods for measuring A\u2424 deposition and defining A\u2424+ using PET; however, the follow-up time for the MCSA was shorter than that for AIBL and may be expected to increase with similar follow-up. It is also possible that the higher incidence of disease progression in the other samples reflects some unreliability in their estimates due to small sample size or differences in method of A\u2424+ classification. Both ADNI and Knight ADRC used different cut-off values and either PET neuroimaging or CSF amyloid sampling to classify A\u2424 status across participants, while both AIBL and the MCSA used only PET to measure A\u2424 levels in all participants; therefore, differences between the A\u2424+ samples identified in these studies may also reflect different prospective estimates of incident MCI/dementia. Measuring A\u2424 levels with a common method for all participants rather than using different biomarkers to do so will increase the reliability of classification. Finally, the methods utilized to define clinical status vary across the different studies. The Knight ADRC relies on CDR score to classify participants and, while AIBL and the MCSA both use a consensus panel to determine clinical status, these panels define cognitive impairment differently (\u2264-1.5 SD on two tests versus \u2264-1 SD on one domain score). ADNI also utilizes clinical consensus classifications; however, the public availability of this data has meant different researchers have also utilized CDR ratings and actuarial neuropsychological approaches to define clinical status, which itself has resulted in different estimates of A\u2424-associated progression [15, 46, 47] . These varying approaches to clinical classification and sample selection may explain the differences in estimates of A\u2424+ progression between studies. Findings of consistency or inconsistency in outcomes between different samples is crucial because this provides information about the effects of potential sampling bias associated with the different studies on models of disease progression and the disease processes reported from these individual cohorts. Lower incidence of progression in the current study may reflect the larger sample sizes at longer follow-up times, the more stringent criteria for cognitive impairment, the use of consensus classification, and the more exclusive sample when compared to the other large studies of preclinical AD. Nonetheless, these data indicate that A\u2424+ is an important factor for clinical disease progression in AD.\nA recent consensus group reported the importance of established and putative risk factors for dementia among older adults, and stated that the predictive value of A\u2424+ for progression to MCI/dementia was equivocal over 3 years [48] . While they agreed that age and APOE 4 carriage were important risk factors of clinical progression to symptomatic disease, these factors are non-modifiable. The group, therefore, considered other potentially modifiable risk factors and concluded that hearing loss, hypertension and obesity in midlife, and smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation, and diabetes in late-life held greater prognostic utility than did A\u2424 [48] . The present study examined risk factors for progression accounting for age and APOE 4 carriage and showed that A\u2424+ was a strong predictor of clinical disease progression in CN adults over 8 years, while health factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity were not. The current findings converge with that from other prospective studies of A\u2424+ risk for MCI/dementia, suggesting that the consensus position be reconsidered with data from longer prospective studies, given that the preclinical stages of AD can extend for up to 20 years [3] . Some aspects of this study limit the generalizability of its findings to a wider population. First, the AIBL study utilized a convenience sample and recruited healthy and well-educated older adults. Participants who did not progress were more likely to have attended all study visits, suggesting the presence of a healthy survivor effect. This may have contributed to the lack of relationship between health factors and disease progression in this study; hence, conclusions drawn here about the influence of these aspects of health on late-life risk for MCI/dementia should be challenged in similar studies using population-based sampling methods, such as the MCSA, using midlife health risk factors where possible. Although the number of participants retained in AIBL at 8 years was larger than the sample sizes of the other studies at their longest intervals and AIBL had the longest average follow-up time, even longer follow-ups are necessary to elucidate the disease course and risk factors for MCI/dementia. For this reason, it is not known whether those who did not progress over the study period will go on to progress in the future. Furthermore, as A\u2424-associated progression was the focus on this study, neurodegeneration measures were not examined. Despite these caveats, the current results indicate that A\u2424+ has strong prognostic value for the development of clinical symptoms of dementia due to AD even when health factors and competing risks for progression are taken into account. APOE 4 carriage provides further predictive value in the presence of elevated A\u2424; therefore, A\u2424+ APOE 4 carriers are ideal candidates for early intervention trials of disease-modifying therapies."}]
