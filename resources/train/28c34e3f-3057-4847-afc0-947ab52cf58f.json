[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Past studies have examined the models for the effects of early numeracy activities on children's later mathematics achievement, with parental values as a precondition and socioeconomic status (SES) as an interaction measure with numeracy activities. This study proposed models of (1) the multiple effects of early numeracy activities, conditioned by parental value, on mathematics achievement and affect (e.g. confidence and interest) and (2) the multiple effects to be mediated by SES and early numeracy activities conditioned by parental value and child gender. The proposed models were examined using structural equation modeling with data from Taiwanese parental reports and child grade-4 tests and reports (N = 4,291; 49% girls) of TIMSS 2015. Three major results go beyond those previous research findings and may provide recommendations for educational practices. (1) Early numeracy activities have effects on mathematics confidence and interest in addition to achievement. (2) SES mediates the effects of early numeracy activities on achievement and confidence but not on interest. The mediating effect of SES suggests that high-quality educational provision should be provided during early numeracy activities. (3) Parents provide fewer numeracy activities for girls, which suggests that parents should provide more early numeracy activities to girls."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Early numeracy activities may be more than simply serious mathematics games played between parents and children because they may contribute to multiple outcomes affecting children later in life. Parental and children's characteristics may also play roles in early numeracy activities, which in turn may affect children's achievement (Anders et al., 2012) . A sufficient, comprehensive path model to organize vital variables may deepen the understanding of the precedent, mediating, and consequent variables in relation to early numeracy activities and provide suggestions for parenting and educational practices.\nPast research has posited a likely path model from parents' perceived values toward mathematics (i.e. 'parental mathematics values' in this study) as a pre-condition, to early numeracy activities as a process, which in turn leads to children's achievement as an outcome (Skwarchuk, Sowinski, & LeFevre, 2014 ). The path model, however, is not fully confirmed. For example, Missall, Hojnoski, Caskie, and Repasky's (2015) study of families in the United States finds that early numeracy activities can be attributed to parental mathematics values but do not relate to children's mathematics achievement. As such, there is a need to first validate this relatively well-developed model especially for a sample from a different culture.\nThe next steps are to incorporate vital variables into the path model, which may facilitate the design of early numeracy activities. A variable that needs to be added to the path model is family socioeconomic status (SES). Past studies have found that SES interacts with early numeracy activities and children's achievements (Letourneau, Duffett-Leger, Levac, Watson, & Young-Morris, 2013; Levine, Suriyakham, Rowe, Huttenlocher, & Gunderson, Rationales. A recent meta-analysis finds that informal, basic numeracy activities are better predictors of children's mathematics achievements than formal numeracy activities (Dunst, Hamby, Wilkie, & Dunst, 2017) . Skwarchuk et al.'s (2014) model, however, indicates that parental numeracy attitudes, informal numeracy tools, and formal numeracy activities have effects on children's mathematics knowledge or skills; on the other hand, the effects of basic numeracy activities on learning outcomes are not significant, which may be because informal numeracy tools are included in their model. Further, Missall et al. (2015) only find that parental mathematics values are related to their provision of early numeracy activities to children, which in turn are not related to child mathematics achievement.\nThe previous literature appears to suggest but not fully confirm the path model from parental mathematics values, basic early numeracy activities, to mathematics achievement, as indicated by Model A (Figure 1) and Hypothesis 1. Examining the model using a sample of students from a different culture can validate and generalize the speculation suggested by the previous studies and build understanding of how early numeracy activities can serve as part of a process with the pre-condition of children's learning contexts and the effect on children's learning outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Contribution of this paper to the literature", "text": "\u2022 Early numeracy activities have effects on mathematics achievement, confidence, and interest.\n\u2022 SES mediates the effects of early numeracy activities on achievement and confidence.\n\u2022 Parents provide fewer numeracy activities for girls.

An interaction effect, however, may not imply a causal theory, effect, or design (Wu & Zumbo, 2008) . Another likely interaction effect is that SES plays a role in mediating the effect of early numeracy activities on children's learning outcomes. The mediating role of SES can be posited if there are interactions between SES, early numeracy activities, and learning outcomes (Baron & Kenny, 1986) .\nResearch has indicated that SES has relationships with parent-child interaction quality (Bradley, Corwyn, McAdoo, & Garc\u00eda, 2001) , additional resources, and supportive neighborhoods directing children to achievement (Dietrichson, B\u00f8g, Filges, & Klint J\u00f8rgensen, 2017) . Parents' knowledge (e.g. number talk) plays a role in the interaction between parents and children when they engage in early numeracy activities (Levine et al., 2010) .\nFurther, SES has significant but small effects on children's affective and cognitive development (Letourneau et al., 2013) . Children with high mathematics achievement tend to have more frequent and higher quality child-parent interactions and more engaging behaviors in numeracy or literacy activities than those with low mathematics achievement (Zhou et al., 2006) . Relatively few studies suggest that parental education does not link to children's performance in mathematics skill tests (Murray & Harrison, 2011) .\nGiven the literature and the first focus of this study (Model A), it could be further hypothesized that SES plays a mediating effect on the relationship from early numeracy activities to child learning outcomes (e.g. mathematics achievement and affects). Model C (Hypothesis 3) attempts to examine this. If SES plays a role mediating the effect of numeracy activities on child mathematics learning outcomes, then SES needs to be reconceptualized as 'parental knowledge capital,' which can be utilized to promote, reduce, or intervene in the effects of numeracy activities on learning outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Effects of Early Numeracy Activities on Achievement and Affect", "text": "Defining mathematics affect. Mathematics curricula and mathematics education focus on both cognitive outcomes (mainly mathematics achievement and skills) and affective learning outcomes (e.g. mathematics confidence and interest; Chiu & Whitebread, 2011) . Both cognitive and affective dispositions (e.g. beliefs about self and mathematical learning, heuristic methods, mathematics knowledge, meta-knowledge, and self-regulatory skills) are essential for competent mathematics learners (De Corte, 2004) . Furthermore, parental involvement in their children's learning activities relates to children's academic interest, confidence, and engagement (Fan & Williams, 2010) . Mothers' involvement in their children's mathematics homework predicts their children's later mathematics confidence (Denner, Laursen, Dickson, & Hartl, 2016) .\nThe above research generally suggests that mathematics-related activities are likely to play roles in both mathematics achievement and affect. There is, however, little agreement on what constitutes mathematics affect or the major components of mathematics affect. Theories on both mathematics education and educational psychology indicate that confidence (or self-concept and self-efficacy) and interest (or enjoyment and being cheerful) are two major components of mathematics affect or motivation for children to engage in mathematics or general learning activities (Gomez-Chacon, 2000; Pintrich, 2003) . Further, the relationships between mathematics confidence, interest, achievement, and activities are well documented in mathematics education and educational psychology literature (Chiu, 2012; Riconscente, 2014) . This study therefore will focus on the two affective variables in mathematics: confidence and interest.\nRationales. Past research only focuses on the effect of early numeracy activities on cognitive outcomes, mainly mathematics achievement or skills (Dunst et al., 2017; Skwarchuk et al., 2014 ). There appears to be no research to date addressing the issue of the effect of early numeracy activities on affective outcomes. Children may perceive early numeracy activities as both a learning experience and a playful one (Cohrssen, Tayler, & Cloney, 2015) , which in turn may impact their mathematics achievement and affect.\nEarly numeracy activities can be a playful experience for children and parents, but they can also have a meaningful influence on the young learners (Cohrssen et al., 2015) . The early numeracy activities link to children's development of both cognitive and social-emotional skills (Van Voorhis, Maier, Epstein, & Lloyd, 2013) . Mathematics related games such as chess, block building, and online games have been shown to have positive relationships with children's mathematics achievement (Kolovou, van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, & K\u00f6ller, 2013 ) with a larger effect for unhappy children in chess play (Rosholm, Mikkelsen, & Gumede, 2017) and for block-building tasks combined with storytelling (Casey et al., 2008) . Child playfulness comprises factors such as physical spontaneity, social spontaneity, cognitive spontaneity, manifestion of joy, and sense of humor (Bundy, Nelson, Metzger, & Bingaman, 2001) . Playfulness is positively related to happiness, including the sense of having a pleasurable, meaningful, and engaged life (Proyer, 2014) .\nTo summarize the above literature, early numeracy activities can be both educational and playful experiences for children. Engaging in early numeracy activities potentially plays a role not only in mathematics achievement, a well-researched learning outcome (e.g. Dunst et al., 2017; Skwarchuk et al., 2014) , but also in mathematics affect (mainly confidence and interest), a rarely-researched learning outcome.

Early numeracy activities, conditioned by parental mathematical value and child gender and mediated by SES, have effects on children's later mathematics achievement, confidence, and interest (Model E in Figure  2 ).\n"}, {"section_title": "Child Gender as a Missing Predictor of Early Numeracy Activites", "text": "Gender differences in mathematics achievement. Gender differences in mathematics achievement are highly researched even for young children (Anders et al., 2012) . Most small-scale studies have found that gender differences in mathematics achievement are small, favoring girls through middle school but favoring boys starting from high school across countries (Reilly, Neumann, & Andrews, 2015) . Large-scale studies reveal a different picture that gender differences in mathematics achievements vary across countries. However, there are generally more boys than girls as top achievers (OECD, 2014b, p. 72) , and boys are better at advanced mathematics tasks than girls (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Hooper, 2016a) .\nFor example, in Taiwan, the longitudinal trend of gender differences in mathematics achievements reveals variations across years and initial evidence warning that boys may be outperforming girls. Gender differences in grade-4 mathematics achievements are not significant from 2003 to 2011 but began favoring boys in 2015 although the gender differences in grade-8 mathematics varied and were not significant from 1999 to 2015, as revealed in a report using the data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; Mullis et al., 2016b) . In the PISA 2012 study, Taiwanese 15-year-old boys also outperformed girls in mathematics (OECD, 2014b, p. 73 ).\nThe phenomenon of gender differences that are small but slightly favor boys, especially in advanced mathematics participation in Taiwan and some other countries, suggests a need to examine reasons arising from the very early years of children's mathematics learning experiences. Past research rarely addresses how children's gender may play a role in parents' provision of early numeracy activities. This study appears to be the first in the literature to consider this missing variable in the path model for early numeracy activities and may contribute to both knowledge and educational practices.\nRationales. Parents' gender-biased perspectives of mathematics as a males' domain may limit their provision of early numeracy activities to girls (Gunderson, Ramirez, Levine & Beilock, 2012) . Research has indicated that mothers with gender stereotypes tend to reduce their involvement in their daughters' mathematics homework in late primary school (Denner et al., 2016) . Further, mothers' gender stereotypes relate to their daughters' lower mathematics confidence and to their son's higher mathematics confidence, and mothers' rating of their children's mathematics ability is a stronger predictor of children's mathematics confidence than teachers' (Jacobs & Eccles, 1992) . There are also consistent findings that girls have lower mathematics and science confidence and interest than boys even though girls have similar mathematics and science achievements to boys worldwide (OECD, 2007 (OECD, , 2014b .\nGiven the aforementioned literature, it is reasonable to hypothesize that children's gender affects parents' provision of early numeracy activities to their children and girls have fewer opportunities to experience early numeracy activities than boys do (Hypothesis 5, Model E). Adding gender as a pre-condition may deepen our understanding of whether parents will preclude girls' participation in numeracy activities starting from early years."}, {"section_title": "The Current Study and Hypotheses", "text": "Past studies on path, causal, or interaction models for early numeracy activities have investigated detailed activities in relation to parental factors (e.g. parental mathematical value) and cognitive learning outcomes (i.e. mathematics achievement; DeFlorio & Beliakoff, 2015; Skwarchuk et al., 2014) . The aforementioned review of the literature further suggests that early numeracy activities may play a role not only in mathematics achievement but also in mathematics affects such as confidence and interest at a later stage of learning. The missing variable, gender, may need to be added, and the confusing role of SES needs to be clarified. Further, the relationships between precedent, mediating, and consequent variables in the path model may be elaborated by using structural equation modeling (SEM) instead of regression analysis when there is a large sample size.

This finding confirms Skwarchuk et al.'s (2014) speculation and replicates their research findings that parental mathematics values play a role in children mathematics achievements. However, in Skwarchuk et al.'s study, basic numeracy activities fail to have effects on child mathematics knowledge or skills, and only formal numeracy activities and informal numeracy tools do. As such, this study contributes to knowledge by demonstrating that informal, basic numeracy activities can play a role in the path model similar to formal, advanced numeracy activities.\nOne may argue that one of the reasons for this result may be that Skwarchuk et al.'s study places basic and formal numeracy activities and informal numeracy tools together in their model, whereas this study only uses basic numeracy activities. However, the result is consistent with research findings that child-parent interactions relate to children's mathematics achievements even with few parental strategies (Letourneau et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2006) and that basic numeracy activities predict children's mathematics achievement better than formal numeracy activities do (Dunst et al., 2017) .\nThe result suggests that parental values affect parents' provision of early numeracy activities, which in turn lead to increased children's later mathematics achievement in grade 4, even with few formal numeracy teaching activities. Educators and policymakers can encourage parents to provide their children basic numeracy activities or games (even without formal mathematics teaching), which still benefit children's later mathematics achievement.\nTaiwanese parents normally value academic achievements and frequent formal teaching (Huntsinger, Jose, & Larson, 1998; Shih & Yi, 2014) . This finding suggests that Taiwanese parents can reduce their anxiety about formally teaching their children by themselves, in school, or in after-school classes. Informal, basic, and playful mathematicsrelated activities or games (e.g. counting things, playing shape games, and playing with building blocks) can also play roles in their children's future mathematics achievement. Educators and policymakers need to encourage parents to initiate basic, playful numeracy activities even if they do not engage in formal or advanced teaching in their daily lives. This encouragement can include raising parental mathematics values and emphasizing the longterm effects of early numeracy activities on their children' mathematics achievement. DeFlorio and Beliakoff (2015) find that SES (indicated by family ability to pay for private schooling) positively interacts with early numeracy activities and mathematics achievements. This study finds that SES (indicated by educational and professional levels) plays a role mediating the effect of early numeracy activities on mathematics achievements (Model C), not a role conditioning early numeracy activities (Model B). This result is partially consistent with Levine et al.'s (2010) finding that parents' number talks predict children's mathematics achievement even when controlling for SES."}, {"section_title": "Mediating Role of SES (Models B and C)", "text": "Past studies on SES in relation to early numeracy activities and mathematics achievement tend to only focus on its moderating or conditioning role (DeFlorio & Beliakoff, 2015; Letourneau et al., 2013) . The mediating role of SES is only partially implied. For example, children's mathematics achievements in primary school can be predicted by children's early numeracy activities at home (LeFevre et al., 2009 ) and supportive home environment, which can reduce SES mathematics achievement gaps (Galindo & Sonnenschein, 2015) . The present study's finding contributes to the knowledge that SES (if measured as parental educational and professional levels) can mediate the effects of early numeracy activities on mathematics achievement at grade 4. This finding has several implications for parenting and educational practices.\nThe mediating role of SES may mean that parents transfer their knowledge capital to children's executive functions such as in-depth self-talk, self-regulatory strategies, and numeracy skills, which then lead to later mathematics achievement (Lee & McDonough, 2015; LeFevre, Polyzoi, Skwarchuk, Fast & Sowinski, 2010) . Future research can deepen the understanding of the knowledge transfer process by adding further parental and child mediating variables into the models. Identifying more mediating variables between early numeracy activities and mathematics achievement can help in the design of effective teaching and parenting programs.\nEarly childhood education is viewed as one of the most effective measures to break the cycle of poverty worldwide (Connell, 1994; Leseman & Slot, 2014) . Parents in Taiwan play a much more important role in influencing children' achievements than those in Western countries do (D'Ailly, 2003) . The present findings appear to support the worldwide belief that early childhood education breaks the cycle of poverty and the cultural effort that parents play important roles in children's achievement because SES plays a mediating role, not a conditioning one, for the parents and children from Taiwan in this study.\nOn the other hand, the findings may serve as a warning that there is social reproduction involved in high-SES families creating high-achieving children, but this is through the cultural capital of SES (as a mediator, not a condition). Early childhood education has been shown to be a notable predictor for low-SES children's later achievements (including mathematics achievement), even when controlling for child gender and parental disability (Apps, Mendolia, & Walker, 2013) .\nEducational policymakers need to provide free, high-quality early childhood education for children from low-SES families (Bauchm\u00fcller, G\u00f8rtz, & Rasmussen, 2014) . Another measure would be to increase low-SES parents' parenting knowledge and skills, which may be incorporated into early childhood education programs, in order to teach both children and parents concurrently. The parenting education program can also start from the maternal pregnancy period in order to increase future caregivers' abilities to provide mental stimulation and responsive caregiving that promotes children's cognitive and social-emotional development (Leseman, 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Early Numeracy Activities on Cognition and Affect (Models D and E)", "text": "This study confirms that early numeracy activities have effects not only on mathematics achievement but also on mathematics affects (i.e. confidence and interest) with (Model D) or without (Model E) adding gender as a condition. Although the effects of early numeracy activities on mathematics achievement have been widely researched (DeFlorio & Beliakoff, 2015; Skwarchuk et al., 2014) , their effects on mathematics affects have received little attention in past research. Early numeracy activities are meaningful for children not only because they are playful but also because they are educational. Mathematics curricula and mathematics teaching emphasize both cognitive and affective outcomes, as revealed in the national mathematics curricula of Taiwan and most countries (Chiu & Whitebread, 2011; Cohrssen et al., 2015) .\nIncluding affective outcomes (e.g. confidence and interest) into the model has increased the understanding of the effects of early numeracy activities. The same coefficient leads from early numeracy activities to mathematics achievement (.266) in Models A and E, but early numeracy activities in Model E have additional significant effects on affects (confidence and interest). This result suggests that mathematics affects are a missing outcome in past research and worth incorporating into future models for examining the effects of early numeracy activities.\nSES mediates the effects of early numeracy activities on mathematics achievement and confidence but not on interests (Model E; Table 3 ). The result reveals that early numeracy activities only have direct effects on children's later mathematics interest, which emerges regardless of SES or parental knowledge capital. This result provides valuable suggestions for educational practices. In particular, even without high SES or parental knowledge capital, children can still benefit from early numeracy activities in their later mathematics interest development. Confidence and interest are two major reasons for students to choose advanced science courses and careers (Chiu, 2017; Venville, Rennie, Hanbury, & Longnecker, 2013; Uitto, 2014) . In this sense, early numeracy activities are a worthwhile investment, and the results of this study suggest that they be advocated by educators and policymakers and implemented by parents.\nTaiwanese students generally have high mathematics and science achievements, but the variances in the achievement scores are large compared with other countries in large-scale international studies (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Arora, 2012, p. 42; OECD, 2014b, pp. 19 and 72) . This means that, even though Taiwan's mean scores are high compared with most countries in the world, there are large differences or gaps between low and high achievers in test results. On the other hand, the mathematics motivations of students in Taiwan (and some East Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan) are more highly related to mathematics achievements than those in some Western countries (e.g. England and Australia) (Zhu & Leung, 2011) . Research also indicates that mathematics achievement can lead to mathematics affect and vice versa (Chiu, 2012) . Although cultural factors or educational designs may play roles in the issue, this finding offers a measure (i.e. playful, informal, or basic numeracy activities that can increase both mathematics achievement and affect) to reduce the gap between low and high achievers in Taiwan."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Child Gender on Early Numeracy Activities (Model E)", "text": "This study finds that girls are given fewer opportunities to experience early numeracy activities with their parents than boys (Model E).

In other words, Taiwanese parents, like parents in Western cultures (Denner et al., 2016; Jacobs & Eccles, 1992) , have a gender stereotype that mathematics is a male domain. This stereotype may reflect the phenomenon that there are large gender gaps favoring males in advanced mathematics in the final year of secondary education (Mullis et al., 2016a ) and more top-achieving boys than girls at 15 years old (OECD, 2014b) . This phenomenon continues into higher education. More male students than female students studied science and engineering in Taiwan (2018), with only 27.47% females studying science and 13.78% females studying engineering, compared with 52.84% females studying education and 50.55% females studying the humanities and arts. The phenomenon that males are better at advanced mathematics than girls or that more boys than girls are top mathematics achievers across cultures suggests in-depth research is needed to identify reasons and narrow this gender gap using a wide range of student, school, and cultural variables.\nEducators and policymakers need to raise parents' awareness about the detrimental impacts of limiting early numeracy activities for girls and encourage parents to provide girls early numeracy activities. Teaching programs to decrease the gender stereotype of mathematics and science as male domains are still needed in Taiwan (Chiu, 2011) . One way to encourage parents may be to emphasize the contribution that early numeracy activities can make in their children's later mathematics achievement, confidence, and interest, as Models D and E (Figure 2) show."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of this Study and Suggestions for Future Research", "text": "This study has two limitations relating to the methodology. Firstly, this study used survey data to examine path models, which imply a cause-and-effect relationship. However, only experiments can address the relationships between causes and effects. Secondly, this study only uses data from a specific culture. For example, perhaps the mediating role of SES is only salient for parents in Taiwan, most of whom have the habit of teaching their children through early numeracy activities, and knowledgeable parents provide higher quality teaching during early numeracy activities than less knowledgeable parents do. Future research can use data from other cultures to validate the mediating role of SES.\nTwo limitation relates to the conception of the model formulated in this study. Firstly, this study uses the numeracy activity as a whole (latent concept), which comprises several numeracy activities (i.e. number toys, counting things, shape games, and building blocks). Future research can further investigate whether certain numeracy activities are more effective in predicting children's later learning outcomes than some other numeracy activities (e.g. one-to-one counting and labeling set sizes; Casey et al., 2018) . Secondly, SES is indicated in this study by parental educational and professional levels. However, the methods that SES is transferred to children's learning outcomes are still under-researched. Past research has indicated that parents may value and attempt to apply early numeracy activities for their children but lack early mathematics knowledge and place less emphasis on mathematics than on languages (Cannon & Ginsburg, 2008) . Future research needs to achieve a clearer understanding about the process of how SES (or parental knowledge capital) is transferred from parents to their children. Educators can develop measures to teach parents about how to support their children's learning during early numeracy activities, which can both benefit educational practices and increase understanding of the knowledge transfer process."}]
