Furthermore, we 48 determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus 49 replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 50 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon 51\nalpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that -upon passaging in 52\nVero E6 cells -SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive 53 mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative 'furin-like 54 cleavage site' in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent 55 phenotypic change in plaque assays. 56 57 INTRODUCTION set of smaller nsps (nsp7-10) that mainly appear to serve as cofactors/modulators of other 112"}, {"section_title": "nsps. 113", "text": "The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly identified as a CoV that is relatively closely 114 BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020; (34), which will be used throughout this study. Until now, this 139 isolate has been provided to 17 other laboratories worldwide to promote the rapid 140 characterization of SARS-CoV-2, in this critical time of lockdowns and other preventive 141 measures to avoid a collapse of public health systems. 142\nIn this report, we describe a comparative study of the basic replication features of SARS-CoV 143 and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, including growth kinetics, virus titres, plaque phenotype 144 and an analysis of intracellular viral RNA and protein synthesis. Additionally, we analysed 145 infected cells by light and electron microscopy, and demonstrated cross-reactivity of 13 146 available SARS-CoV-specific antisera (recognising 10 different viral proteins) with their SARS-147\nCoV-2 counterparts. Finally, we established the conditions for a medium-throughput assay to 148 evaluate basic antiviral activity and assessed the impact of some known CoV inhibitors on 149 SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to many anticipated similarities, our results also 150 established some remarkable differences between the two viruses that warrant further 151 investigation. One of them is the rapid evolution -during virus passaging in Vero cells -of a 152 specific region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that contains the so-called 'furin-like cleavage 153 Dried agarose gels were used for direct detection of viral mRNAs by hybridization with a 32 P-186 labeled oligonucleotide probe (5'-CACATGGGGATAGCACTAC-3') that is complementary to 187 a fully conserved sequence located 30 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of the genome and 188 all subgenomic mRNAs produced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. After hybridization, RNA 189 bands were visualised and quantified by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon-9410 variable 190 mode scanner (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). In order to 191 verify the amount of RNA loaded, a second hybridization was performed using a 32 P-labeled 192 oligonucleotide probe recognizing 18S ribosomal RNA (5'-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC- Leiden, the Netherlands) while including appropriate quality controls after each step of the 210 procedure. Sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina). 211\nSubsequently, sequencing reads were screened for the presence of human (GRCh37.75), 212 mouse (GRCm38.p4), E. coli MG1655 (EMBL U00096.2), phiX (RefSeq NC_001422.1) and 213 common vector sequences (UniVec and ChlSab1.1). Prior to alignment, reads were trimmed 214 to remove adapter sequences and filtered for sequence quality. The remaining reads were 215 mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 GenBank reference sequence (NC_045512.2; (38)). Data 216 analysis was performed using Bowtie 2 (39). Raw NGS data sets for each virus sample 217 analysed in this study are deposited in NCBI Bioproject and available under the following 218 links: ---. Only SARS-CoV-2-specific reads were included in these data files. 219\nTo study evolution/adaptation of the S protein gene, we performed an in-depth analysis of 220 reads covering the S1/S2 region of the S protein gene. This was done for the p2 stock and for 221 the four virus samples of the plaque picking experiment shown in Fig. 1a . First, all reads 222 spanning nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the SARS-CoV genome were selected. Next, reads 223 constituting less than 1% of the total number of selected reads were excluded for further 224 analysis. The remaining number of reads were 3,860 (p2 stock), 1,924 (S5p1), 2,263 (S5p2), 225 4,049 (S5p3) and 3,323 (L8p1). These reads were translated in the S protein open reading 226 frame and the resulting amino acid sequences were aligned, grouped on the basis of 227 containing the same mutations/deletions in the S1/S2 region and ranked by frequency of 228 occurrence (Fig. 1b) . 229 230"}, {"section_title": "Antisera and immunofluorescence microscopy 231", "text": "The SARS-CoV-specific rabbit or mouse antisera/antibodies used in this study are listed in 232 Table 1 . Most antisera were described previously (see references in Table 1) , with the 233 exception of three rabbit antisera recognizing SARS-CoV nsps 8, 9 and 15. These were raised 234 using full-length (His)6-tagged bacterial expression products (nsp8 and nsp15) or a synthetic 235 peptide (nsp9, aa 4209-4230 of SARS-CoV pp1a), which were used to immunize New Zealand 236 white rabbits as described previously (40, 41). Cross-reactivity of antisera to SARS-CoV-2 237 targets was evaluated microscopically by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and for some 238 antisera (nsp3 and N protein) also by Western blot analysis. Double-stranded RNA was 239 detected using mouse monoclonal antibody J2 from Scicons (42). 240\nCells were grown on glass coverslips and infected as described above (43). At 12, 24, 48 or 241 72 h p.i., cells were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Cells 242 were washed with PBS containing 10 mM glycine and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 243 in PBS. Cells were incubated with antisera diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS.

Nuclei were stained 247 with 1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33258 (ThermoFischer).

The virus was then propagated two more 296 times at low MOI in Vero E6 cells, in which it caused a severe cytopathic effect (CPE). We 297 also attempted propagation in HuH7 cells, using the same amount of virus or a ten-fold larger 298\ninoculum, but did not observe any cytopathology after 72 h (data not shown). At 24 h p.i., 299 immunofluorescence microscopy (see below) revealed infection of only a small percentage of 300 the HuH7 cells, without any clear spread to other cells occurring in the next 48 h. We therefore 301 conclude that infection of HuH7 cells does not lead to a productive SARS-CoV-2 infection and 302 deemed this cell line unsuitable for further SARS-CoV-2 studies. 303\nThe infectivity titre of the Leiden-p2 stock grown in Vero E6 cells was analysed by plaque 304 assay, after which we noticed a mixed plaque phenotype (~1:3 ratio of small versus large 305 (plaques; data not shown) while a virus titre of 7 x 10 6 PFU/ml was calculated. To verify the 306 identity and genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2/p2 virus stock, we isolated genomic RNA 307 from culture supernatant and applied next-generation sequencing (NGS; see methods for 308 details). The resulting consensus sequence was found to be identical to the sequence 309 previously deposited in GenBank (accession number MT007544.1) (34), with one exception 310 (see below). Compared to the SARS-CoV-2 GenBank reference sequence (NC_045512.3) 311\n(38) and other field isolates (29), isolate BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 exhibits >99.9% 312 sequence identity. In addition to synonymous mutations in the nsp14-coding sequence 313\n(U19065 to C) and S protein gene (U22303 to G), ORF3a contains a single non-synonymous 314 mutation (G26144 to U). Strikingly, the 3' untranslated region (UTR) contains a 10-nt deletion 315 (nt 29750-29759; CGAUCGAGUG) located 120 nt upstream of the genomic 3' end , which is 316 not present in other SARS-CoV-2 isolates thus far (>670 SARS-CoV2 sequences present in 317\nGenBank on April 17, 2020). 318\nIn about 71% of the 95,173 p2 NGS reads covering this position, we noticed a G23607 to A 319 mutation encoding an Arg682 to Gln substitution near the so-called S1/S2 cleavage site of the 320 viral S protein (see Discussion), with the other 29% of the reads being wild-type sequence. As 321 this ratio approximated the observed ratio between large and small plaques, we performed a 322 plaque assay on the p1 virus stock (Fig. 1a , leftmost well) and picked multiple plaques of each 323 size, which were passaged three times in Vero E6 cells while monitoring their plaque 324 phenotype. Interestingly, for several of the small-plaque virus clones (like S5; Fig. 1a) we 325 observed rapid conversion to a mixed or large-plaque phenotype during these three passages, 326\nwhile large-plaque virus clones (like L8) stably retained their plaque phenotype (Fig. 1a) . NGS 327 analysis of the genome of a large-plaque p1 virus (L8p1) revealed that >99% of the reads in 328 the S1/S2 cleavage site region contained the G23607 to A mutation described above. No other 329 mutations were detected in the genome, thus clearly linking the Arg682 to Gln substitution in 330 the S protein to the large-plaque phenotype observed for the L8p1 virus. 331\nNext, we also analysed the genomes of the p1, p2 and p3 viruses derived from a small-plaque 332 (S5) that was picked. This virus clone retained its small-plaque phenotype during the first 333 passage ( Fig. 1a; S5p1 ), but began to yield an increasing proportion of large(r) plaques during 334 subsequent passages. Sequencing of S5p2 (Fig 1b) revealed a variety of low-frequency reads 335 with mutations near the S1/S2 cleavage site motif (aa 681-687; PRRAR\u2193SV), with G23607 to 336 A (specifying the Arg682 to Gln substitution) again being the dominant one (in ~0.9% of the 337 reads covering nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the genome). At lower frequencies single-nucleotide 338 changes specifying Arg682 to Trp and Arg683 to Leu substitutions were also detected. 339\nFurthermore, a 10-aa deletion (residues 679-688) that erases the S1/S2 cleavage site region 340 was discovered, as well as a 5-aa deletion (residues 675-679) immediately preceding that 341 region. The amount of large plaques increased substantially upon the next passage, with NGS 342 revealing the prominent emergence of the mutants containing the 10-aa deletion or the Arg682 343 to Gln point mutation (~22% and ~12% of the reads, respectively), and yet other minor variants 344 with mutations in the PRRAR\u2193SV sequence being discovered. Taken together these data 345 clearly link the large-plaque phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 to the acquisition of mutations in this 346 particular region of the S protein, which apparently provides a strong selective advantage 347 during passaging in Vero E6 cells. 348 349"}, {"section_title": "Comparative kinetics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells 350", "text": "To our knowledge, a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication kinetics 351 in cell culture has not been reported so far. Therefore, we infected Vero E6 cells with the 352 SASR-CoV-2/p2 virus stock at high m.o.i. to analyse viral RNA synthesis, protein expression 353 and the release of infectious viral progeny (Fig. 2a) . This experiment was performed using 4 354 We also monitored viral protein production by Western blot analysis using antisera targeting 377 a non-structural (nsp3) and structural (N) protein. As expected from the RNA analysis, the 378 accumulation of both viral proteins increased with time, and was detected somewhat earlier 379 for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV (data not shown). Overall, we conclude that in Vero E6 380 cells, SARS-CoV-2 produces levels of intracellular RNA and proteins that are at least 381 comparable to those of SARS-CoV, although this does not translate into the release of equal 382 amounts of infectious viral progeny (Fig. 2a) . 383 384"}, {"section_title": "Cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV targets 385", "text": "To be able to follow virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells more closely, we explored 386 cross-reactivity of a variety of antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV targets, in 387 particular a variety of nsps. In an earlier study, many of those were found to cross-react also 388\nwith the corresponding MERS-CoV targets (35), despite the relatively large evolutionary 389 distance between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Based on the much closer relationship with 390 SARS-CoV-2, similar or better cross-reactivity of these SARS-CoV reagents was expected, 391 which was explored using immunofluorescence microscopy. 392\nIndeed, most antisera recognizing SARS-CoV nsps that were tested (nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, 393 nsp9, nsp13, nsp15) strongly cross-reacted with the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 target (Fig.  394   4 and Table 1 ), the exception being a polyclonal nsp6 rabbit antiserum. Likewise, both a 395 polyclonal rabbit antiserum and mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the N protein cross-396 reacted strongly (Fig. 4b and Table 1 ). The same was true for a rabbit antiserum raised against 397 a C-terminal peptide of the SARS-CoV M protein (Fig 4e) .

Punctate 401 structures in the same area of the cell were labelled using an antibody recognizing double-402 stranded RNA (dsRNA), which presumably recognizes replicative intermediates of viral RNA 403 synthesis (45, 46). The N protein signal was diffusely cytosolic (Fig. 4b) , whereas the M protein 404 labelling predominantly showed the expected localization to the Golgi complex (Fig. 4e) , where 405 the protein is known to accumulate (47). 406 407 408"}, {"section_title": "Ultrastructural characterisation of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells 409", "text": "We next used electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructural changes that SARS-CoV-410 2 induces in infected cells, and focused on the membranous replication organelles (ROs) that 411 supports viral RNA synthesis and on the assembly and release of new virions (Fig. 5) . 412\nCompared to mock-infected control cells (Fig. 5a-b) , various distinct membrane alterations 413 were observed in cells infected with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 5c-j) . At 6 h p.i., 414 larger regions with membrane alterations were found particularly in cells infected with SARS-415\nCoV-2 (data not shown), which may align with the somewhat faster onset of intracellular RNA 416 synthesis in SARS-CoV2-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3a) . and 5h-i, asterisks). In addition, convoluted membranes (45) were readily detected in SARS-420\nCoV-infected cells, while zippered ER (25, 48, 49) appeared to be the predominant structure 421 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells ( Fig. 5e and 5i , white arrowheads). As previously described for 422 SARS-CoV (45), also SARS-CoV-2-induced DMV appeared to fuse through their outer 423 membrane, giving rise to vesicles packets that increased in numbers as infection progressed 424 (Fig 5f and 5k , white asterisks). Virus budding near the Golgi apparatus, presumably into 425 smooth membranes of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (50-52), was 426 frequently observed at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 5k-l and 5o-p) . This step is followed by transport to the 427 plasma membrane and release of virus particles into extracellular space.

Cells were infected at low MOI to allow for multiple cycles of replication. 441\nAfter three days, a colorimetric cell viability assay (60) was used to measure drug toxicity and In this report, we describe a comparative analysis of the replication features of SARS-CoV-2 464 and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, one of the most commonly used cell lines for studying these 465 two viruses. However, in contrast to the stable phenotype exhibited by SARS-CoV during our 466 17 years of working with this virus in these cells, SARS-CoV-2 began to exhibit remarkable 467 phenotypic variation in plaque assays within a few passages after its isolation from clinical 468 samples (Fig. 1a) . In addition to the BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate used in this study, nucleotide substitution in the S protein gene, clearly established that a single S protein 474 mutation (Arg682 to Gln) was responsible for the observed plaque size difference. This 475 mutation is localized near the so-called 'furin-like' S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 1b) Possibly, this pathway is also employed by our Vero E6-cell adapted SARS-CoV-2 mutants 488 that have lost the furin-like cleavage site, like clone L8p1 and multiple variants encountered in 489 S5p3 (Fig. 1a) . These variants contain either single point mutations or deletions of 5 to 10 aa 490 (Fig. 1b) , resembling variants recently reported by other laboratories (30, 70, 71) . Interestingly 491 similar changes were also observed in some clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates that had not been 492 passaged in cell culture (70). It is currently being investigated why mutations that inactivate 493 the furin-like cleavage site provide such a major selective advantage during SARS-CoV-2 494 passaging in Vero E6 cells and how this translates into the striking large-plaque phenotype 495 documented in this paper. 496\nAn additional remarkable feature confirmed by our re-sequencing of the 497 BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of a 10-nt deletion in 498 the 3' UTR of the genome (34). Screening of other available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences 499 indicated that the presence of this deletion apparently is unique for this particular isolate, and 500 likely represents an additional adaptation acquired during cell culture passaging. This deletion 501 maps to a previously described \"hypervariable region\" in the otherwise conserved 3' UTR, and 502 in particular to the so-called s2m motif (72) that is conserved among CoVs and also found in 503 several other virus groups (73, 74). The s2m element has been implicated in the binding of 504 host factors to viral RNAs, but its exact function has remained enigmatic thus far. Strikingly, 505\nfor the mouse hepatitis coronavirus the entire hypervariable region (including s2m) was found 506 to be dispensable for replication in cell culture, but highly relevant for viral pathogenesis in 507 mice (72). Although the impact of this deletion for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be studied in more 508 detail, these previous data suggest that this mutation need not have a major impact on SARS-509\nCoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. This notion is also supported by the fact that the results of 510 our antiviral screening assays (Fig. 6) correlate well with similar studies performed with other 511 SARS-CoV-2 isolates (54, 75, 76). Clearly, this could be different for in vivo studies, for which 512 it would probably be better to rely on SARS-CoV-2 isolates not carrying this deletion in their 513"}, {"section_title": "3' UTR. 514", "text": "Vero E6 cells are commonly used to isolate, propagate, and study SARS-CoV-like viruses as 515 they support viral replication to high titres (77-81). This may be due to a high expression level 516 of the ACE-2 receptor (82) that is used by both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (9) and/or the 517 fact that they lack the ability to produce interferon (83, 84). It will be interesting to evaluate 518 whether there is a similarly strong selection pressure to adapt the S1/S2 region of the S protein 519 when SARS-CoV-2 is passaged in other cell types. Such studies are currently in progress in 520 our laboratory and already established that HuH7 cells may be a poor choice, despite the fact 521 that they were used for virus propagation (9, 85) and antiviral screening in other studies (54, 522 86). Immunolabelling of infected HuH7 cells (data not shown) revealed non-productive 523 infection of only a small fraction of the cells and a general lack of cytopathology. While other 524 cell lines are being evaluated, as illustrated above, the monitoring of the plaque phenotype 525 (plaque size and homogeneity) may provide a quick and convenient method to assess the 526 composition of SARS-CoV-2 stocks propagated in Vero E6 cells, at least where it concerns 527 the evolution of the S1/S2 region of the S protein. 528\nGiven the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the detailed characterization of its replication cycle 529\nis an important step in understanding the molecular biology of the virus and defining potential 530 targets for inhibitors of replication. The cross-reacting antisera described in this study (Table  531 1) will be a useful tool during such studies. In general, the subcellular localization of viral nsps 532 and structural proteins (Fig. 4) and the ultrastructural changes associated with RO formation 533 ( Fig. 5) were very similar for the two viruses. We also observed comparable replication kinetics 534 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, although clearly lower final infectivity titres 535\nwere measured for SARS-CoV-2 (~50-fold lower; Fig. 2 ). Nevertheless, RNA synthesis could 536 be detected somewhat earlier for SARS-CoV-2 and the overall amount of viral RNA produced 537 exceeded that produced by SARS-CoV (Fig. 3) . This may be indicative of certain assembly or 538 maturation problems or of virus-host interactions that are different in the case SARS-CoV-2. 539\nThese possibilities merit further investigation, in particular since our preliminary EM studies 540 suggested intriguing differences with SARS-CoV where it concerns the presence of spikes on 541 the surface of freshly released SARS-CoV-2 particles ( Fig. 5n and 5r) . 542\nOur analysis of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNA synthesis revealed the increased relative 543 abundance of mRNAs 7 and 8 (~4-and ~2-fold, respectively) when SARS-CoV-2 was 544 compared to SARS-CoV. Mechanistically, these differences do not appear to be caused by 545 extended base pairing possibilities of the transcription regulatory sequences that direct the 546 synthesis of these two mRNAs (24). As in SARS-CoV, mRNA7 of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for 547 two proteins, the ORF7a and ORF7b proteins, with the latter presumably being expressed 548 following leaky ribosomal scanning (32). Upon its ectopic expression, the ORF7a protein has 549 been reported to induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway (87) and/or to be 550 involved in cell cycle arrest (88). The ORF7b product is a poorly studied integral membrane 551 protein that has (also) been detected in virions (89). When ORF7a/b or ORF7a were deleted 552 from the SARS-CoV genome, there was a minimal impact on the kinetics of virus replication 553 in vitro in different cell lines, including Vero cells, and in vivo using mice. In another study, 554 however, partial deletion of SARS-CoV ORF7b was reported to provide a replicative 555 advantage in CaCo-2 and HuH7 cells, but not in Vero cells (90). 556\nThe SARS-CoV ORF8 protein is membrane-associated and able to induce endoplasmic 557 reticulum stress (91, 92), although it has not been characterised in great detail in the context 558 of viral infection. Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003, a conspicuous 29-nt (out-559 of-frame) deletion in ORF8 was noticed in late(r) human isolates, but not in early human 560 isolates and SARS-like viruses obtained from animal sources (93-95). Consequently, loss of 561 ORF8 function was postulated to reflect an adaptation to the human host. The re-engineering 562 of an intact ORF8, using a reverse genetics system for the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate, 563 yielded a virus with strikingly enhanced (up to 23-fold) replication properties in multiple 564 systems (96) . Clearly, it remains to be established that the increased synthesis of mRNAs 7 565 and 8 is a general feature of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and that this indeed also translates into 566 higher expression levels of the accessory proteins encoded by ORFs 7a, 7b and 8. If 567 confirmed, these differences definitely warrant an in-depth follow-up analysis as CoV 568 accessory proteins in general have been shown to be important determinants of virulence. 569\nThey may thus be relevant for our understanding of the wide spectrum of respiratory disease 570 symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients (97). 571\nBased on the close ancestral relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (98), one 572 might expect that the patterns and modes of interaction with host antiviral defence 573 mechanisms would be similar. However, our experiments with type I interferon treatment of 574 Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6 ) revealed a clear difference, with SARS-CoV-2 being considerably more 575 sensitive than SARS-CoV, as also observed by other laboratories (76). Essentially, SARS-576\nCoV-2 replication could be inhibited by similarly low concentrations of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a that 577\ninhibit MERS-CoV replication in cell culture (35). Taken together, our data suggest that SARS-578 CoV-2 is less able to counter a primed type I IFN response than SARS-CoV (76, 99). 579\nPreviously identified inhibitors of CoV replication were used to further validate our cell-based 580 assay for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening. These compounds inhibited replication at similar 581 low-micromolar concentrations and in a similar dose-dependent manner as observed for 582 SARS-CoV (Fig. 6 ). Remdesivir is a prodrug of an adenosine analogue developed by Gilead 583\nSciences. It was demonstrated to target the CoV RNA polymerase and act as a chain 584 terminator (100-102). The clinical efficacy of Remdesivir is still being evaluated and, after 585 some first encouraging results (103), worldwide compassionate use trials are now being 586 conducted. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been labelled as potential 587 \"game changers\" and are being evaluated for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (104). 588\nBoth compounds have been used to treat malaria and amebiasis (105), until drug-resistant 589\nPlasmodium strains emerged (106). These compounds can be incorporated into endosomes 590 and lysosomes, raising the pH inside these intracellular compartments, which in turn may lead 591 to defects in protein degradation and intracellular trafficking (68, 107). An alternative 592 hypothesis to explain their anti-SARS-CoV activity is based on their impact on glycosylation 593 of the ACE2 receptor that is used by SARS-CoV (56). Finally, as expected, the non- Vero E6 cells, separated in an agarose gel and probed with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide 961 recognizing the genome and subgenomic mRNAs of both viruses. Subsequently, the gel was 962 re-hybridized to a probe specific for 18S ribosomal RNA, which was used as a loading control. 963 "}]
