In order to be included for analysis, a copy of the original survey instrument and a copy of the findings/summary of findings (e.g., publication, informative summary) had to be obtained. Additionally, only surveys of agritourism operators and surveys of visitors to agritourism operations/farms were included for analysis. A total of 13 survey instruments and various findings related to the surveys were reviewed for overall content (e.g., questions, results, methodology); nine survey instruments from the perspective of the agritourism provider and four survey instruments from the perspective of the visitor/agritourist were reviewed. Implementation dates for the 13 surveys ranged from 1999-2009.

Surveys implemented at the state level appear to be growing in popularity with some states now beginning to conduct follow-up studies. All 13 studies reviewed were conducted on a state-wide level, representing nine different states. To date, an agritourism study has not been conducted at the national level. While three national surveys exist which provide insight into agritourism or farm visits (USDA's National Survey on Recreation and the Environment, 2000; Agricultural Resource Management Survey, 2004; US Census of Agriculture, 2007), the focus of these studies was not agritourism; rather agritourism was a small component. In order for valid comparisons and generalizations to be made agritourism-focused survey data at a national scale is greatly needed. This lack of research and knowledge regarding agritourism is troubling because proper tourism planning depends upon sound research. Research provides the information base for effective decision making by tourism managers [and] allows [them] to develop policy, plans, operations, and controls more efficiently (Goeldner & Ritchie, 2006, p. 515). Moreover, van Raaij (1986 posited that consumer research on tourism should be a cornerstone of any marketing strategy given that knowledge of consumer behavior allows marketing managers the ability to understand their target audience, forecast future behavior, and provide the product/service that is wanted by the consumer. Additionally, the marketing concept asserts that the key to achieving organizational goals is determining the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfaction more effectively and more efficiently than competitors (Kotler & Bloom, 1984). In order for farms to fully benefit from agritourism as an economic resource, research is needed to understand the market and provide agritourism operations with the data and results needed to effectively market their farm to visitors. A majority of the surveys examined in this study (9 of the 13) were from the agritourism provider perspective; more research is needed examining current and potential visitors to agritourism establishments. Understanding agritourism visitors, the types of experiences they are seeking, and how they are making their travel plans will allow farmers to make wise business decisions regarding where to invest money and how to maximize profit potential."}, {"section_title": "Defining agritourism", "text": "A review of the 13 studies revealed nine unique definitions of agritourism2. Some of the commonalities found among the various definitions include: All nine definitions included the term farm and/or agriculture Four of the definitions incorporated an income component either as a means of income generation and/or as an economic activity. This is worth noting because it is often assumed farmers engage in agritourism endeavors as a means to supplement farm income (McGehee, 2007;McGehee, Kim & Jennings, 2007;Ollenberg & Buckley, 2007) Five definitions referred to recreation or recreational opportunities, five referred to education or educational opportunities, and two definitions made reference to heritage Five definitions specifically referred to activities occurring on a farm, while three made no mention of on-farm involvement, and one definition stated the activities could occur either on-farm or at other outlets Three of the definitions included the word \"experience\" -while one definition specifically mentioned \"active involvement\", suggesting active, hands-on, and/or engaging experiences Only one definition mentioned length of time. Barbieri and Tew (2009) suggest the farm must engage in these activities for fifteen days or more to be considered an agritourism operation Five definitions included the word visitor or visiting, one included travel destination, and one included tourism. Interestingly, none of the definitions distinguished between tourists and visitors (implying distance traveled). This is of importance to the study of agritourism because the term \"tourism\" is part of the term \"agritourism\", and tourists are often defined as having traveled away from their home environment for at least 50 miles one way (Goeldner & Ritchie, 2009). Findings from the studies indicated many of the visitors live in the same state/county as the agritourism operation, traveled approximately 22-129 miles, visited for the day, and/or were repeat visitors. As such, these findings appear to suggest a rationale for focusing on non-traditional tourists (e.g., visitors) potentially proving agritourism operators increased success if they market to day trippers/visitors and forged strong customer loyalty with repeat loyal customers, who are often ignored with the interest to attract traditional tourists. Further research is needed to examine the types of agritourism participants (e.g., tourists versus visitors). Not only would this research prove useful to agritourism marketing strategies but semantically speaking, referring to these occurrences as agritourism or agritourists could imply a misnomer, potentially hindering the fundamental understanding of the concept of agritourism and placing limitations on the inclusion of what enterprises and activities are truly \"agritourism\"."}, {"section_title": "CO CLUSIO", "text": "As the number of farms turning to agritourism increase, agritourism operations are in need of research and resources to help them make more informed business decisions and capitalize effectively and efficiently on national and state-wide trends to ensure the sustainability of their farms. Unfortunately, due to limited and dispersed data and resources, those engaging in these enterprises are making development and marketing decisions with limited or outdated information; and in turn, are likely basing a majority of their decisions on assumptions. Most of these enterprises are operated and managed by farmers, and very few have traditional business and marketing training or expertise. Additionally, little research on agritourism visitors and market effectiveness exists. Thus, business decisions and precious operating dollars are being invested in agritourism with little research or knowledge regarding the potential return on their investment. In short, this review of previous agritourism-related studies calls for more research on agritourism, particularly at the national-level; and calls for more research examining the types of visitors to agritourism establishments.
