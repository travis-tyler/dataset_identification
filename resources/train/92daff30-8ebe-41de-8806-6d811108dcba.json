[{"section_title": "M", "text": "ild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, 1,2 with annual progression rates to dementia of 10% to 15% of clinical samples and 6% to 10% of community samples. [3] [4] [5] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in elderly adults, 9 but a proportion of individuals with MCI never progress to AD, 6 and some revert to normal cognition. 7, 8 Being able to identify individuals with MCI at greatest risk of progression to AD (risk-AD) accurately is a research and clinical priority.\nStandard criteria for MCI 9, 10 include objective cognitive impairment, but how low test scores are defined and how many are required influence the identified prevalence of MCI 11 . These are important considerations given that normal cognitive variability means that some healthy older adults will obtain low scores on one or more tests when multiple measures are administered, 12 with up to 70% obtaining a score 1 or more standard deviations (SD) below the mean and at least 30% obtaining a score 1.5 or more SD below the mean. [13] [14] [15] The percentage of individuals obtaining a number of low scores is labeled the base rate of low scores (BRLS), and not accounting for this when interpreting performance on cognitive tests has clear implications for diagnosing MCI, as the finding that the Petersen and colleagues 9 criteria for MCI misclassified 24% of a sample when compared with comprehensive criteria that required 2 scores 1SD below the mean within a cognitive domain illustrates. 16 Although requiring 2 low scores can help overcome the effects of normal cognitive variability, the optimal number of tests to use depends upon the number and type of measures in the test battery.\nIndividuals with more low scores than expected for the BRLS would be more likely to have true impairment rather than simply exhibiting normal variability in cognitive performance. Making allowances for low scores in line with the BRLS may help to minimize false positives when diagnosing MCI. The aim of this study was to test this idea by comparing the risk-AD of participants classified with MCI using standard approaches and when the BRLS is considered. In using the BRLS for diagnosing MCI, we expected to find individuals with MCI to have a higher risk-AD than normal controls and better prediction of progression to AD than with standard criteria."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu), launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership and led by Principal Investigator Michael W.

Because objective cognitive impairment was based on LM test performance, all participants in the Petersen MCI group were categorized as having amnestic MCI (aMCI). Participants in the Petersen NC group had no memory complaints, a CDR score of 0, a MMSE of 24 or higher, normal education-corrected LM subtest scores, and no significant impairments in activities of daily living.\nTo apply the Winblad, Jak/Bondi, and NIT criteria, means and SDs of the NC group were used to calculate regression-based scores in the NC and MCI groups, as in previous studies. 22, 23 Raw scores were transformed to Tscores (mean 5 50, SD 5 10) and regressed on age, sex, and education.

MCI was diagnosed when the number of low scores equaled or exceeded the number of low scores that the worstperforming 10% (see 12, 13 ) of the Petersen NC group obtained. The NIT MCI group was subtyped as sd-aMCI, md-aMCI, sd-naMCI, and md-naMCI according to impairment patterns, with md-aMCI diagnosed when at least 1 of the low scores required for MCI was a memory score and sd-aMCI diagnosed when all the scores required for MCI were memory scores.\nThe number of low scores that Petersen NC group members obtained is shown in Table 3 . The closest cumulative percentage to a 10% cut-off was 7.9% with 3 or more low scores, and thus participants were categorized as having MCI when the number of low scores was 3 or greater. The best levels of sensitivity and specificity supported this number of low tests (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 5 0.827, P < .001, sensitivity576.6%, specificity576.9%). Using 2 or more low tests increased sensitivity (92.6%) but decreased specificity (55.9%), whereas using 4 or more low tests decreased sensitivity (51.1%) and increased specificity (88%).\nFour hundred eighty-four individuals were classified as NIT NCs and 211 as NIT MCI (21 sd-aMCI, 180 mdaMCI, 10 md-naMCI). Twenty-two (4.5%) NIT NCs and 69 (34.3%) NIT MCI progressed to AD. The NIT MCI group as a whole and NIT sd-aMCI and NIT md-aMCI were at greater risk-AD than NIT NCs. The NIT criteria gave a better balance between sensitivity and specificity and between PPV and NPV than the Petersen and Jak/ Bondi criteria. Agreement was fair between the NIT and Petersen criteria (j 5 0.34, P < .001) and moderate to substantial between the NIT and Jak/Bondi criteria (j 5 0.59, P < .001) (Figure 1 ).\nRegression analysis suggested that multicollinearity among diagnostic criteria was not a concern. Variance inflation factors were 1.19 for the Petersen criteria, 1.58 for Jak/Bondi criteria, and 1.73 for the NIT criteria. After excluding individuals with naMCI, the total sample size (NCs and aMCI) was 604. When entered into the same model, the Petersen (hazard ratio (HR) 5 4.53, 95% confidence interval (CI)51.59-12.94, P 5 .005) and NIT (HR 5 3.88, 95% CI51.85-8.12, P < .001) criteria had higher risk estimates than the Jak/Bondi criteria (HR 5 2.08, 95% CI51.03-4.19, P 5 .04).

[25] [26] [27] To test whether the number of low tests obtained by fewer than 10% of individuals gave the optimum cutpoint for predicting progression to dementia, we produced a receiver operating characteristic curve using the 695 ADNI sample individuals with the number of low tests as the predictor variable and dementia status at final assessment as the outcome. The chosen cut-point for the number of low tests had the optimal sensitivity and specificity.\nCox proportional hazards regressions were used to analyze differences in risk-AD between the MCI and NC groups, with age, sex, years of education, and MMSE score as covariates in each set of diagnostic criteria separately and combined in the same regression. To test for multicollinearity, the variance inflation factor was calculated for each of the diagnostic criteria in a regression model, with variance inflation factors greater than 10 indicating multicollinearity. 28 Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) were calculated for each set of diagnostic criteria. Diagnostic agreement between the three sets of criteria was assessed using Cohen's j, with values from 0.00 to 0.20 indicating slight agreement, 0.21 to 0.40 fair agreement, 0.41 to 0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61 to 0.80 substantial agreement, and 0.81 to 1.00 almost perfect agreement. 29 Given that all ADNI participants with MCI had verbal memory impairments and that the focus of this work was on aMCI, individuals classified with naMCI according to the Jak/Bondi or NIT criteria were excluded from the analyses. The annual progression rate was calculated by dividing risk-AD by mean years of follow-up. Alpha was set at .05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Corp., Armonk, NY)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This is, to our knowledge, the first study of the risk-AD when objective cognitive impairment is defined using the BRLS. Consistent with previous work, 12, 13, 30, 31 we observed varying numbers of low scores in NCs, reflecting normal cognitive variability. Using the bottom 10% of the sample, we defined cognitive impairment as 3 or more low scores from among 9 tests administered. These NIT criteria showed moderate agreement in MCI and NC classifications with the Jak/Bondi criteria but more balanced sensitivity and specificity than the Jak/Bondi and Petersen criteria and the highest PPV.\nThe false-negative NC diagnosis rate was 9.3% between the Petersen and Jak/Bondi criteria (Petersen NC identified as Jak/Bondi MCI), similar to the 7% error rate previously reported. 32 This rate was lower between the Petersen and NIT criteria (3.2%), in line with most cognitively healthy individuals obtaining a number of low scores because of normal variability. When the NIT and Jak/Bondi criteria were compared, Jak/Bondi criteria showed a rate of false-positive MCI diagnosis of 14.2% and a rate of false-negative NC diagnosis of 4.6%. These findings, along with a lower PPV for the Jak/Bondi than the NIT criteria, suggest that the proportion of cognitively normal individuals misdiagnosed with MCI is greater with the Jak/Bondi than the NIT criteria. Obtaining 2 low scores defined as 1.28SD or more below the mean is reportedly uncommon within the memory domain (6.1%), 30 but the percentage of cognitively normal individuals obtaining 3 or more low scores is reportedly 26.4% when a battery of 5 or more tests is given that addresses different domains, 30 and 51.1% when the cutoff for abnormality is more than 1 SD below the mean. 12 The use of more than 1 SD below the mean on 2 tests per cognitive domain or 1 test in each of 3 cognitive domains may explain the higher rate of false-positive and -negative diagnoses with the Jak/Bondi than with the NIT criteria (18.8%). The NIT criteria may be more sensitive to true cognitive impairment and more useful to identify individuals with a higher risk-AD.\nWe found a higher risk-AD for NIT sd-aMCI than for NIT md-aMCI, which contrasts with a higher rate of progression for md-aMCI than for sd-aMCI in a study using different tests and criteria to define md-and sd-aMCI, a memory-clinic sample, and a slightly shorter follow-up of 2 years. 33 Our results suggest that the severity of memory impairments, rather than the number of low test scores, might be primarily associated with risk-AD, although in participants with md-aMCI, the most commonly impaired nonmemory test was the BNT, followed by the CDT (Supplementary Table S1 ). This might indicate a profile of impairments in addition to pure episodic memory that increases risk-AD and that may be related to semantic memory or visuoperceptual abilities, one or both of which the BNT 34 and CDT identify to some extent. 35 Future studies using multiple tests that assess each of these abilities will be needed to determine whether a cognitive profile other than pure episodic memory impairment increases risk-AD. It would also be useful to expand the range of episodic memory tests beyond the orally presented tests used in ADNI.\nOur study's use of regression-based scores is a strength, 22, 23 although there are limitations associated with the sample characteristics given that MCI classification in the ADNI database did not include cognitive abilities other than memory. In line with our findings, a potential outcome of using only 1 test to diagnose MCI is false positives. A previous report suggested that some participants diagnosed with MCI in the ADNI database had a cognitive profile similar to that of those categorized as NCs when using MCI criteria that allow for some low scores. 36 Another limitation is using the original ADNI NC group to calculate regression-based z-scores, given the chances of diagnostic errors. 36 To enhance generalizability, the NIT criteria need to be evaluated in samples with nonamnestic profiles, with aMCI assessed using more and different memory tests, and with different educational levels, given that low scores are strongly related to intellectual ability. 15 The use of different tests is unlikely to limit the generalizability of our results, as long as a sufficient number of tests is used and a range of cognitive domains is covered, because our finding of a small number of low test scores being associated with normal cognitive functioning is similar to findings when different test batteries are used. [12] [13] [14] [15] We acknowledge that replication and further studies using different approaches are needed to validate our results. This could include testing the NIT criteria in samples other than the ADNI database and analyzing the effects of other variables used in MCI diagnosis, such as subjective cognitive complaints or functional status. The use of biomarkers such as amyloid-b or tau protein load, as well as functional neuroimaging, will help evaluate the accuracy of diagnoses achieved using NIT criteria.\nAn additional consideration is that our use of a 10% cut-off for defining abnormal performance is somewhat arbitrary and could have implications for prevalence of MCI and risk-AD 5 that should be further explored. The NIT criteria showed a slightly higher annual progression rate to AD (9.8-14%) from MCI than previously reported (6.3-10%), 5 although the studies reviewed in that report may have underestimated the true progression rate by not considering normal variability when diagnosing MCI. The optimal cut-point when using the NIT criteria will depend upon characteristics of the test battery administered, including total number of tests, their reliability, the pattern of intercorrelations between the tests, and the distribution of the abilities that the tests measure and the education level of the examinees. 15, 38 Our findings regarding the NIT criteria have clinical implications. Diagnosing an individual with MCI only when the number of low scores exceeds the bounds of normal variation requires a battery that generates a sufficient number of test scores, but this might not always be practical and only applies to individuals close to the threshold for diagnosis or when there are more time and resources to administer a neuropsychological test battery rather than only a brief global or screening test. Another clinical approach to avoiding a false-positive or \"accidental\" diagnosis of MCI could involve a second assessment 39, 40 to help determine whether low scores in the first were associated with normal variation or truly with MCI.\nTaking account of the normal variability in a sample of healthy controls when several cognitive measures are included is straightforward when the BRLS is known or can be calculated and could help reduce the heterogeneity in the risk-AD."}, {"section_title": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION", "text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.
