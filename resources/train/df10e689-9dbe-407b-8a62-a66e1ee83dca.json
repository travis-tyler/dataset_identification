[{"section_title": "", "text": "It is generally presumed that those from rural backgrounds engage in higher rates of substance use, an assumption likely driven by notable tobacco findings (i.e., early initiation and higher rates of use for rural individuals). 2,3 Aside from higher rates of tobacco use, studies have found that individuals from rural backgrounds engage in higher rates of methamphetamine use than those from urban areas. 4 However, other findings suggest that rural background may serve as a protective factor for other forms of substance use. 5,6 Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) indicated that rural adults (over age 18) had lower rates of alcohol and marijuana use than their urban counterparts. 4 Similarly, in the Monitoring the Future Study, rural adults (age 19-32) had lower rates of alcohol and marijuana use than their urban peers. 7 While national findings are important, considerable care needs to be taken regarding how rural/urban is defined and specific differences across the rural region(s) studied. As noted by Gfroerer and colleagues, 4 national studies such as the NSUDH are not designed to conduct rural/urban analyses, as rural participants are few in number and highly clustered. In addition, \"rural\" is not a homogenous designation that should be used at the national level; rural regions across the United States vary widely with regard to characteristics likely to impact substance use. 6,8 These regional differences can include cultural acceptance of substance use, religious values, and even availability of substances (e.g., \"dry\" counties common in the southern U.S.), all factors that may directly affect rates. As an example, rural regions in the southern U.S. show the highest alcohol abstinence rates of all rural regions. 8 Thus, when explored at the national level, rural/urban comparisons may be inaccurate due to regional divergence, and may therefore tell us little about specific risks."}, {"section_title": "Interactions with Gender and Race", "text": "Other demographic factors are likely to interact with rural/urban origin to affect substance use estimates. National substance use studies indicate that women use substances at lower rates than men. 9 It is possible that gender interacts with rural/urban background to differentially predict risk, as cultural acceptance of substance use by different genders can be quite different across regions. 10 Similarly, race is a known correlate of substance use, with whites typically demonstrating higher prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use than minority individuals, 9 and black individuals demonstrating a later age of onset for alcohol use. 11 Booth and Curran 12 examined alcohol use in black and white participants in six southern states and found that although urban black individuals reported higher abstinence than urban white individuals, racial differences were not found in rural areas. In fact, rural residence was found to be a protective factor for both groups. 12 Taken together, these factors may prove an important step in understanding use trends across rural and urban backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "Substance Use and the Transition to College", "text": "While there is an emerging research base documenting potential rural/urban differences in substance use, surprisingly little work examines changes in these groups over time. This is no small oversight; while rural background may appear a \"protective\" factor for alcohol use, 13 these static findings regarding prevalence may not remain after major life events. One of the major transitions for many individuals in young adulthood is college entry. Close to 40% of those age 18-24 will attend college in the U.S. In 2015, this number reached 20.2 million. 14 While fewer rural individuals enroll in college (31% vs. 46% from urban areas), 15 there are sufficient numbers of individuals to examine group differences. College matriculation represents a time when multiple substance use risk factors converge. 16,17 The period of \"emerging adulthood\" is a time of notable transitions, including aging into legal adulthood, changes in residence, reduced supervision, changes in peer groups, and growing independence of decision-making, making this a critical period for in substance use risk. 18 In addition, college environments tend to normalize substance use, and provide increased access to alcohol and other drugs, thereby allowing considerable opportunity for substance use. 17 In fact, research suggests that heavy drinking is more likely among college students than their non-college attending counterparts, 19 and the initiation and use of marijuana and other drugs is more likely during this transition. 16 Most certainly, some of the variance in substance use during college can be attributed to peer use. 20 Although the exact mechanism of this factor is still open to debate, 21,22 it is likely that peer modeling plays some role in substance use initiation. 23,24 Associations with substance using peers increases drug availability and normalization, which can be followed by selection of similarly-behaving peers, creating a reciprocally reinforcing trajectory. 25,26 Interestingly, emerging work suggests that the perception of peers' use, not actual use, is what guides subsequent substance use behavior, 27 indicating that perceptions of peer substance use may be a factor that works in conjunction with college transition."}, {"section_title": "The Current Study", "text": "While rural/urban and other demographic factors likely influence use prior to college matriculation, little is known about the degree to which exposure to the college environment affects initial differences. At this point, no work has examined the importance of rural or urban upbringing and substance use prospectively, across the college experience. Further, relatively few studies have examined the etiology of substance use among minority youth, 11 and we are not aware of any studies that have explored rural/urban, gender, and race differences in substance use over time. Finally, perceptions of peer use are a likely contributor to prevalence rates during a time when exposure to new friend groups is common and new relationships are formed. This study examined changes in substance use over time among undergraduate students from varied backgrounds. We examined prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use across a three-year period, thereby providing real-time data on how the college experience influences potential pre-existing group differences. We hypothesized that there would be rural/urban differences in freshman year of college (rural individuals with higher tobacco prevalence, and urban individuals with higher alcohol and marijuana prevalence), but that time in college would reduce these differences to nonsignificance during sophomore and junior years. We also predicted that gender would interact with rural/urban background to differentially predict use, with rural women demonstrating significantly lower rates of alcohol and marijuana than all other groups, particularly for freshman year, and rural men demonstrating higher levels of tobacco use. We also hypothesized both whites and non-whites from rural backgrounds would demonstrate lower prevalence of alcohol and marijuana use during freshman year but this protective influence would be reduced throughout sophomore and junior years.

Participants were recruited from introductory psychology courses and received course credit and monetary incentives for participation. Participants were pre-screened to bolster the volunteer sample through the identification of participants at risk for substance use in order to have sufficient variability to address the questions of interest. The screening measure assessed conduct problem behaviors that occurred prior to age 18, such as stealing, lying, and fighting (12 items, \u03b1 = .75). A composite score determined the distribution of scores for predicted substance use risk (calculated separately by gender).

CMH modeling was applied as an intermediate step between simple rural/urban comparisons and multivariate analyses in order to test the potential interactions with gender and/or race via Breslow-Day (BD) test and assess potential confounding in instances where BD test is non-significant, ultimately providing better understanding of the outcome variables patterns for the covariates of interest. CMH models were applied for each college year separately. Finally, we applied a generalized estimating equations (GEE) marginal model (with exchangeable covariance structure) for repeated measures in SAS PROC GLIMMIX, to estimate rural/urban status, time and their interaction effects, while adjusting for demographics. This approach allowed us to make use of all available observations over time. We also assessed the influence of peer use for each time point and substance with a similar GEE model as above, by adding it to the described model.

For alcohol, chi square comparisons indicated that alcohol consumption was higher among urban students during freshman year only. In subsequent models that included gender and race, results indicated that those from urban backgrounds, particularly white individuals, were more likely to report alcohol use. These findings are consistent with hypotheses, and are similar to other work indicating that white individuals, and those from urban backgrounds, have a higher prevalence of alcohol use. 4,7,9,12 For marijuana, chi square comparisons indicated that no rural/urban differences were found during any study year. However, Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models indicated that during freshman year, those from urban backgrounds and males showed higher rates of use, although these differences were not significant. These findings are also in line with previous work. 4,7,9 For both alcohol and marijuana, freshman year rural and urban differences faded over the course of college, eventually resulting in no significant rural vs. urban group differences by junior year. These trends suggest that exposure to the college environment attenuates previous divergence. Hypotheses were not supported for tobacco use. This is in contrast to previous work in this area. [2][3][4] However, subsequent analyses provided some clarity regarding this finding. When considering race in analyses, tobacco use was higher for rural minorities across all years of the study. The current findings indicate that rural minorities are at particular risk for chronic, unremitting use of tobacco. Importantly, after adjusting for covariates, rural/urban x time interaction effects were not significant. This study also examined whether perceived peer use of these substances could account for the changing trajectories of use over time. Results indicated that perceived peer use significantly predicted use of all three substances for all three time points. This suggests that perceived peer use may contribute to these changes in use upon college matriculation. Specifically, upon entering college, young adults' perceptions of what their friends are doing is an important influence on their behavior."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "The examination of gender and race interactions with rural/urban background provides a significant advancement of the literature given the dearth of studies in this area. Specifically, generalized rural and urban differences are quite different when subgroups are taken into account. As an example, rural female alcohol use prevalence remained low across all years, whereas prevalence of use rose for rural males. While the reasons for these subgroup differences cannot be explored in this work, results suggest that broad generalizations about rural/urban groups and substance use are inadequate to describe these populations. These results also suggest that changes in use are not simply a matter of access. It appears that specific factors of protection are closely tied to the values these young adults learned, and these values' impact on substance use did not decrease in the face of environmental influences. Capturing the nature of these values, be they religion, gender roles, or culture, will likely lead to the use of these systems as anchor topics in effective prevention and intervention strategies. The current results also suggest that specific subgroups are at risk for protracted use despite environmental influences to the contrary. For instance, tobacco use was consistently prevalent (~50% of the population) among rural minorities, despite declining rates among urban minority and urban white peers. This speaks to the need for availability of prevention and early intervention for tobacco use in rural communities prior to the onset of tobacco dependence."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "Although the current work addressed many potential background factors that affect substance use in college, due to lower rates of rural populations the size of these subgroups was limited. It is possible that failure to find significant differences for some substances by rural/urban categories is due to the low power to find effects, or that reported relations are less reliable (e.g., reproducible) given the small subgroup sizes. Future work examining use in populations selected for these characteristics may identify different relations. As an example, our sample rather low percentages of participants from each of the RUCC rural categories (e.g., with a range of 5.7% and 1.0% for categories 4-9), necessitated our use of a broad distinction or rural vs. urban only to ensure these categories were well-represented. It may be that substance use differences are related to the degree of rurality assessed on a continuum, but differences between the more specific categories can only be examined in a sample diverse enough to have adequate representations of these groups. In addition, the small minority subgroup did not allow for examination of specific minority groups, though most in this group self-identified as black. It is likely that different minority groups have differing attitudes toward substance use that could be further explored with targeted sampling of this important characteristic. The interaction between minority status and rural/urban background could also be more thoroughly explored with detailed assessment of other factors likely to covary with either or both of these designations, including socioeconomic status, parental education, or religiosity. While the current study extends previous work by examining rural/urban trends in substance use through the transition into college, this prospective assessment ended upon junior year. Future work could explore use after college to provide information about how use changes for these students during senior year and beyond. Further, the large population sampled and individual testing sessions of the current study necessitated a lengthy assessment period, with students assessed throughout both the fall and spring semesters. While those assessed later in the semester may have had more exposure to substances (e.g., alcohol availability at college), this was a necessary aspect of this study design. Future work may specifically examine peer use and substance use rates among rural individuals entering college (during the fall semester only) to examine this transition more specifically.
