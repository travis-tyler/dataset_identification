[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Rates of STIs, HIV, and pregnancy remain high among adolescents in the US, and recent approaches to reducing sexual risk have shown limited success. Future expectations, or the extent to which one expects an event to actually occur, may influence sexual risk behavior. This prospective study uses longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (N=3,205 adolescents; 49.8% female) to examine the impact of previously-derived latent classes of future expectations on sexual risk behavior. Cox regression and latent growth models were used to determine the effect of future expectations on age at first biological child, number of sexual partners, and inconsistent contraception use. The results indicate that classes of future expectations were uniquely associated with each outcome. The latent class reporting expectations of drinking and being arrested was consistently associated with the greatest risks of engaging in sexual risk behavior compared with the referent class, which reported expectations of attending school and little engagement in delinquent behaviors. The class reporting expectations of attending school and drinking was associated with having greater numbers of sexual partners and inconsistent contraception use but not with age at first biological child. The third class, defined by expectations of victimization, was not associated with any outcome in adjusted models, despite being associated with being younger at the birth of their first child in the unadjusted analysis. Gender moderated specific associations between latent classes and sexual risk outcomes. Future expectations, conceptualized as a multidimensional construct, may have a unique ability to explain sexual risk behaviors over time.\nFuture strategies should target multiple levels of influence to improve individual future expectations prior to high school and throughout the adolescent period."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite representing only 25% of the population, adolescents are responsible for nearly half of all STI diagnoses and new HIV infections in the US . This country also has one of the highest teenage pregnancy and childbirth rates among developed nations, with over 370,000 teenagers giving birth every year (The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy ; Martin et al. 2012) . Although many educational interventions have effectively reduced sexual risk behaviors, these approaches often result in only small to moderate effects and lack long-term durability (Mullen et al. 2002; Johnson et al. 2011 ). These high rates of risk and limited successes provide the rationale to investigate additional approaches to reducing sexual risk behaviors among adolescents.\nIt may be reasonable to theorize that future expectations (i.e., the extent to which one expects an event to actually occur) could influence sexual risk behavior. Future expectations, such as expectations of graduating from high school or living to age 35, facilitate goal setting, planning, and making commitments and thus direct behavior and development (Nurmi 1991; Bandura 2001; Seginer 2008) . They are particularly relevant during transitions and are thus highly pertinent to adolescence (Seginer 2008) . Expectations are also distinct from aspirations and fantasies or wishes (Simmons 1979; Constantine et al. 1998; Oettingen and Mayer 2002; Sagy and Adwan 2006) , which tend to overestimate actual expectancies and thus may be weaker foundations for behavior (Oettingen and Mayer 2002) . Theoretical models, such as the social cognitive theory, posit that standards or expectations for behavior are personal factors that help regulate dispositional traits and manage their feelings, impulses, and behaviors (Bandura 1991) . Future expectations, thus, may reasonably influence adolescent sexual risk behaviors.\nA limited body of research, however, has examined future expectations and its association with sexual risk behavior. Tevendale and colleagues discovered that positive future expectations among homeless youth were inversely related to the number of partners but not to the percentage of unprotected sex acts (Tevendale et al. 2009 ). Another study, however, reports that, in interviews with African American adolescents, positive life expectations were not associated with sexual experience in either the unadjusted or adjusted analysis (Fisher et al. 2008) . A longitudinal study using a national sample reported that individual expectations of graduating from college were associated with age of onset of sexual activity in multivariate analysis among boys, but not among girls, ages 13 to 15. Furthermore, expectations of living to age 35 were not significantly associated with age of onset of sexual activity for either gender (Harris et al. 2002) . Additionally, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health suggest that only peers' anticipation -and not an individual's anticipation -of college completion is associated with sexual risk behaviors (Soller and Haynie 2013) . The empirical evidence for the association between future expectations and sexual risk behavior therefore is currently weak and suggests the need for additional research.\nA small subset of studies has examined the association of future expectations with teenage pregnancy. Among 135 female adolescents (47 pregnant and 88 non-pregnant) in Quito, Ecuador, being non-pregnant was associated with higher levels of expectations for the future (Guijarro et al. 1999 ). Allen et al. determined that lack of future expectations predicted pregnancy in an analysis of a longitudinal study of teenagers in the United Kingdom (Allen et al. 2007 ). Data from the US did not suggest a significant relationship between future expectations and pregnancy among teenage girls who had been referred to child welfare services (James et al. 2009 ), but data from the National Education Longitudinal Study suggest that lower educational expectations (although not occupational expectations) were significantly associated with incidence of teenage pregnancy (Young et al. 2004) . The evidence of the association between expectations and teenage pregnancy is thus limited and inconsistent.\nTo date, there is weak evidence to support the association between future expectations and sexual risk behavior and teenage pregnancy among adolescents in the US. Much of the current research has employed cross-sectional designs, which obscure temporality, and has used homogenous samples, including minority race/ethnicities and low-income subpopulations, that potentially have low external validity. Furthermore, future expectations is inherently multidimensional (Nurmi 1991; , but many of these studies rely only on one dimension of expectations, such as educational expectations (Harris et al. 2002; Soller and Haynie 2013) , or measure expectations to reflect the extent to which they are positive or negative (Fisher et al. 2008; Tevendale et al. 2009 ). More rigorous longitudinal research using general adolescent population and a multidimensional construct of future expectations is needed to better understand this relationship further between future expectations and sexual risk behavior among adolescents."}, {"section_title": "The Current Study", "text": "This study investigates the impact of future expectations on sexual risk behavior with a national longitudinal cohort of youth ages 15 through 19. To guide this investigation, we use Bandura's social cognitive theory, which suggests that the environment and personal factors interact with one another to influence behavioral patterns (Bandura 1991) . Personal factors, such as cognitive and affective factors, including expectations, are thought to interact with both the environment and behavior (Glanz et al. 2002) . In this context, we focus on future expectations as our personal factor of interest and expect this theory to be an appropriate conceptual model for investigating the relationship between future expectations and sexual risk behavior.\nWe also use Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner 1989 ) to guide our exploration of the environment construct from Bandura's social cognitive theory and to understand the context of the individual. The ecological systems theory posits that common spheres of influence from multiple levels bidirectionally influence one another to affect behavior.\nBronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory has been associated with sexual risk behaviors (Small and Luster 1994; DiClemente et al. 2007 ) and teenage pregnancy (Meade and Ickovics 2005; Meade et al. 2008; Sipsma et al. 2010) . The ecological systems theory thus aligns with the social cognitive theory, which indicates that the context or environment is associated with behavior. We believe integrating Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory into our framework provides a comprehensive approach to examining the impact of future expectations on sexual risk behavior (Figure 1 ).\nResearch has demonstrated associations between future expectations and each level of the ecological systems theory, including levels of the individual, family, peer, and environment.\nFor example, individual characteristics, such as age and gender, may significantly influence future expectations. For instance, younger adolescents seem to concentrate less on career and family than older adolescents, and females put emphasis on family more than males (Raffaelli and Koller 2005) . Evidence also suggests that parents affect an adolescent's future expectations Dubow et al. 2001; McWhirter and McWhirter 2008) by setting standards, acting as role models, and perpetuating belief systems (Nurmi 1991; . Pressure from peers to conform to certain behaviors may also influence an adolescent's expectations for the future (Nurmi 1991; McWhirter and McWhirter 2008) . On the environmental level, disparities by socioeconomic status (Lamm et al. 1976; and poverty level (Freire et al. 1980; Voydanoff and Donnelly 1990; Nurmi 1991) are also highly relevant to future expectations.\nMiddle class adolescents often focus more on their education compared with careers than lower class adolescents (Poole and Cooney 1987) . There is thus evidence for all levels to be independently and simultaneously associated with future expectations among adolescents (Sipsma et al. 2012) . The use of these two frameworks, therefore, allows for the direct examination of future expectations and sexual risk behavior, while adjusting for potential confounders from multiple levels. Accordingly, we aim to examine the associations between future expectations and sexual risk behaviors, including age at first child, number of sexual partners, and inconsistent contraception use, among adolescents. We also examine whether these associations differ for males and females, as previous literature suggests possible differential effects. Our study uses latent classes of future expectations, derived in an earlier article (Sipsma et al. 2012) , as our exposure of interest. Latent classes were used to measure future expectations in order to reflect the multidimensional nature of the construct (Nurmi 1991; . These classes have been shown to be valid and robust correlates of behavior (Sipsma et al. 2012 ).\nSpecifically, we ask two research questions and make several related hypotheses.\nResearch Question 1 asks: Are multidimensional classes of future expectations predictive of sexual risk behaviors, including age at first biological child, number of sexual partners, and contraception use? Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that participants with high expectations of being in school would be less likely to engage in sexually risky behavior compared with participants with low expectations of being in school. Additionally, we believed that participants with high expectations of engaging in delinquent behavior would be more likely to engage in sexually risky behavior compared with participants with low expectations of engaging in delinquent behavior. We also hypothesized that participants with high expectations of victimization would also engage in more sexually risky behavior compared with participants with low expectations of victimization. We expect these relationships to exist at baseline and to persist over time. Research Question 2 asks: Does gender moderate associations between future expectations and sexual risk behaviors? We believed that, because previous literature has demonstrated gender differences in future expectations (Raffaelli and Koller 2005; Sipsma et al. 2012 ) and in sexual risk behaviors (Byrnes et al. 1999) , the associations between future expectations and our outcomes may significantly vary by gender. We expect stronger associations between delinquent expectations and our outcomes among males than among females and between student expectations and our outcomes among females than among males."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sample and Design", "text": "This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), which was originally designed to examine the transition from school to work as adolescents Because data on future expectations were collected only among participants age 15 or older, our analytic sample was limited accordingly based on the age at first interview (n=4,231).\nThis sample was further limited to those who had at least one valid future expectations indicator (n=3,533) and who were not of 'mixed race' (n=3,502) as these participants could not be appropriately reclassified. Lastly, the sample was limited to the first youth interviewed within each household (n=3,261) and those with at least one valid follow-up between ages 15 and 19 for a final sample size of 3,205 participants.\nParticipants ranged in age from 15 to 18 (M=15.9 SD=0.71) at baseline. One-half of the sample was male. Fifty-three percent was non-Hispanic/non-Black, 26.2% was non-Hispanic Black, and 20.6% was Hispanic. "}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Future Expectations. At baseline, participants responded to eight total items created by the NLSY97 study team; of these, five items asked the percent chance a particular event would occur in the next year (e.g., become pregnant/get someone pregnant, get seriously drunk, be the victim of a violent crime, be arrested rightly or wrongly, and die from any cause) and three items asked the percent chance of being engaged in a particular activity one year from now (e.g., be a student in a regular school, be working more than 20 hours/week if in school, and be working more than 20 hours/week if not in school). The two questions regarding working were combined to reduce conditional dependence between items, resulting in a total of seven indicators of future expectations. The continuous responses were collapsed into four categories (0-24%, 25-49%, 50-74% and 75-100%) based on apriori hypotheses about the meaning of each category. All seven items were entered into a latent class analysis with maximum likelihood estimation and robust standard errors to derive the most parsimonious and meaningful model. Four latent classes of future expectations were derived. More details can be found elsewhere (Sipsma et al. 2012 ).\nSeventy percent of participants fell into the Student Expectations class, defined as perceiving high chances of being in school and low chances of engaging in delinquent behavior or being victimized. Approximately 16% fell into the Student/Drinking Expectations class. These participants endorsed high chances of being in school in the next year but also moderate chances of engaging in delinquent behavior. The third class, called the Victim Expectations class (7.9%) perceived the highest chances of being victimized in the coming year; over 90% of this class believed they had 50% or greater chance of dying in the next year. Six percent of participants fell into the Drinking/Arrest Expectations class and were characterized by perceiving the lowest chances of being in school and the highest chances of working and engaging in delinquent behavior in the coming year (Sipsma et al. 2012 ).\nAll youth in our sample responded to questions about sexual risk behavior at baseline and at each annual follow-up.\nNumber of sexual partners. Participants who reported being sexually experienced were asked to report the number of sexual partners they had had since the last interview. At baseline, participants were asked to report the numbers of sexual partners they had in the last 12 months.\nInconsistent contraception use. Participants were also asked to report the number of times they had had sex and the number of times they had used birth control (including a condom) in the last 12 months at baseline and since the date of last interview at each annual follow-up. The number of unprotected sex acts was calculated by computing the difference between these two responses. Participants who reported not being sexually active since date of last interview were considered to have had 0 unprotected sex acts. Based on its distribution, this construct was dichotomized into inconsistent contraception use (\u22651 unprotected sex acts vs. 0 unprotected sex acts).\nAge at first child. Participants reported the birth dates of any biological children. Age at first child was calculated using the date of birth for the participant and his/her first biological child.\nThe covariates used in this analysis were derived from Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner 1989) and represent each of the following levels of influence:\nindividual, family, peer, and environment. These covariates were previously shown to be associated with class membership (Sipsma et al. 2012 ). All covariates were measured at baseline.\nAge at baseline. Age at baseline was self-reported at the first interview.\nGender. Gender was self-reported at baseline.\nRace/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized into non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or non-Hispanic/non-black (white).\nGeneral health. Health was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'excellent'\nto 'poor'. This variable was collapsed into two categories (excellent/very good vs. good/fair/poor) based on its distribution.\nLiving with both biological parents. Participants reported if they lived with a \"mother figure\" or \"father figure\" and indicated the relationship (biological, etc.) which were used to derive living with both biological parents (yes/no).\nMaternal teen birth. Maternal age at first birth was derived from the household screening and was dichotomized to indicate whether or not the participant's mother gave birth as a teenager (<19 years old).\nDeviant peer norms. Participants were asked to indicate the percentage of their peers who smoked cigarettes, got drunk, belonged to gangs, used drugs, and skipped school. Deviant peer norms was the arithmetic mean of the five items.\nEnriching peer norms. Enriching peer norms was the calculated mean of 4 items asking participants to report the percentage of their peers who participated in organized activities, planned to go to college, did volunteer work, and went to religious services regularly.\nIncome to poverty ratio. Parents reported the gross family income for the past year.\nIncome to poverty ratio was created based on standards set by US Census Bureau which accounts for a family's annual income, size, and number of children under 18 years old. For analysis this variable was categorized into < 1.00, 1.00-1.99, and \u2265 2.00.\nUrban area. Living in an urban area (yes vs. no/not clear) was based on the location of the youth's residence."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the impact of future expectations classes on age at first biological child. This analysis excluded participants who were parents at baseline (n=68) to ensure examination of the prospective relationship between expectations and outcome. Additionally, 55 participants were excluded because their calculated age at first birth was either younger than or the same as their age at baseline. This exclusion removed those who or whose partner may have been pregnant at baseline and prevents pregnancy from influencing responses. Because participants were followed through age 19, follow-up time was either the age at first biological child if 19 years or younger (status=1) or set equal the age at last available interview and considered censored (status=0).\nLatent growth curve modeling was used to model number of sexual partners and inconsistent contraception use repeated over time. First, unconditional growth models were explored by using the likelihood ratio test (LRT), AIC, and BIC to determine if the linear or quadratic model better fit the data. Next, the conditional model was used to investigate the covariates and class membership. Number of sexual partners was treated as a count variable for analysis because it had a Poisson distribution. Extreme numbers of sexual partners were winsorized and set equal to the value of the approximate 97.5 percentile to reduce the impact of outliers. This percentile was approximately equal for all time points, leading to all values beyond the 97.5 percentile set equal to 10 sexual partners. Inconsistent contraception use was modeled as a dichotomous variable (Muthen and Asparouhov 2002) .\nIn each analysis, backwards elimination based on the statistical relationship between the covariate and outcome was done by hand to determine the covariates for the final multivariate model. In latent growth curve modeling analyses, backwards elimination is particularly important as it minimizes potential problems with multicollinearity which can distort estimates and interpretability (Pedhazur 1997; Duncan et al. 2006) . Class membership was then entered to determine the additive explanatory effect of expectations classes on the outcome of interest, after controlling for other predictors. All outcomes were limited to those occurring before age 20 because ages 15 to 19 was our age range of interest. Our modeling therefore uses baseline and the first three annual follow-ups.\nModeration by gender was examined by testing interaction terms created by multiplying the class dummy variables by gender in our final models for each outcome. When interaction terms were significant (p < 0.10), we examined simple effects by stratifying our sample by gender and exploring the associations between future expectations and sexual risk behaviors among each gender.\nMissing data on each covariate ranged from 0 to 27% (income to poverty ratio) with the majority of covariates missing less than 5% of data. Because a complete case analysis could potentially bias results in the multivariate models (Little and Rubin 1987) , we used multiple imputation to handle the missing data. Assuming the data are missing at random, this technique is widely recommended to produce valid estimates because it uses the information contained in the other variables to estimate the sets of possible values (Schafer 1997 as the objective of these analyses is to examine the relationship of future expectations on sexual risk outcomes not to describe estimates for the national population."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Age at First Biological Child", "text": "Four hundred fifteen participants (13.5%) became a parent between the ages 15 and 19.\nOf these participants, the mean age at first child was 18.1 (SD = 0.88). Class membership was significantly associated with age at first biological child in the unadjusted analysis (Table 1) . Results from the multivariate model are presented in Table 1 Furthermore, older age, male gender, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, worse health, maternal teen birth, and greater deviant peer norms were significantly associated with risk for greater numbers of sexual partners at year 1. Higher enriching peer norms and living with both biological parents were significantly associated with fewer numbers of sexual partners. Age, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, health, living with both biological parents, maternal teen birth, and peer deviancy were additionally associated with changes in numbers of sexual partners over time ( Table 2) .\nThe association between classes of future expectations and numbers of sexual partners Older age, Hispanic race/ethnicity, worse health, maternal teen birth, and greater deviant peer norms were associated with increased odds of inconsistent contraception use at year 1 (all p < 0.05). Living with both biological parents, higher enriching peer norms, and living in an urban area were significantly associated with lower odds of inconsistent contraception use.\nWorse health was associated with a reduced slope of inconsistent contraception use over time.\nNo other variables were associated with changes in contraception use over time. Guttmacher Institute 2010) . We also observed increases in inconsistent contraception use over time. This pattern may be reasonable to expect given that adolescents tend to engage in longer-term relationships as they age, which have been associated with less consistent contraception use (Manlove et al. 2003) . Our sample, therefore, reasonably may represent a national sample of adolescents during this period.\nThe Drinking/Arrest Expectations class repeatedly conferred the greatest risk. Members of this class had the lowest expectations of being in school and the highest expectations of working and engaging in delinquent behavior, such as getting drunk, being arrested, and getting (someone) pregnant (Sipsma et al. 2012 Membership in the Student/Drinking Expectations class was generally associated with higher sexual risk behavior at baseline than the Student Expectations class. This class was composed of participants who were committed to school, but still expected moderately high likelihoods of engaging in delinquent behavior (Sipsma et al. 2012 ). This class, however, did not exhibit trends over time that differed significantly from the Student Expectations class, suggesting that despite increased sexual risk behaviors at baseline, their engagement in risky behaviors demonstrated increasing trends similar to those who engaged in less risk behaviors at baseline. Interestingly, the association between this class and age at first biological child was not statistically significant. Because our approach excluded those who were already parents at baseline, these results could be biased towards the null. Our results suggest that the commitment to school may be protective from engaging in greater frequencies of risk behaviors but also that commitment to school may not be sufficient to protect against engaging in heightened risk behaviors.\nSignificant gender differences were noted among the Student/Drinking Expectations class such that females had a stronger association between future expectations and sexual risk behavior than males. There may be several explanations for this difference. First, this association among females may be due to better precision in measurement of inconsistent contraception use for females. Males, for instance, may or may not know if their female partner is taking a contraceptive pill whereas females generally know whether their partner is using a condom. The measurement of inconsistent contraception use among males may be more likely to be subject to measurement error. Second, because females tended to exhibit fewer numbers of sexual partners over time than males, females in this class may have engaged in high levels of risk behaviors earlier than males in this class, possibly because they are often younger than their male partners. Thus, their increase in risk could have occurred prior to baseline. Last, females could have exhibited stronger associations between future expectations and these sexual risk behaviors as females tend to be more conscientious than males (Gullone and Moore 2000) , a trait that has been shown to be inversely associated with engaging in risk behaviors (Bogg and Roberts 2004) . These findings may suggest that strategies aiming to future expectations in order to reduce sexual risk behaviors may find greater effectiveness among females, particularly among females who resemble those in this class.\nOverall, membership in the Victims Expectations class was not statistically associated with any behaviors in multivariate models, suggesting no additional risk for those who expect to experience victimization. Associations between membership in the Victims Expectations class and sexual risk behaviors, therefore, may be explained by one or more sociodemographic characteristics, such as race/ethnicity (Sipsma et al. 2012) . Notably, however, females who were members of the Victims Expectations class had greater odds of inconsistent contraception use at baseline, whereas there was no association among males. This association among females may be the result of the \"weathering hypothesis\" where girls who are disadvantaged and face chronic stressors may feel the need to reproduce earlier than girls not facing these same circumstances (Geronimus 1991) . This hypothesis could also support the association between Victim Expectations class and age at first birth in the unadjusted analysis.\nThese results support an array of previous research. Our findings are consistent with studies suggesting that more negative expectations are associated with greater sexual risk behaviors (Seal et al. 2003; Fisher et al. 2008 ) and that more academically-oriented adolescents may be at lower risk for teenage pregnancy (Young et al. 2004 Expectations class. Therefore, interventions on multiple levels (e.g., community watch groups and family efforts) may effectively reduce engagement in sexual risk behavior by focusing on reducing tolerance for drinking. Structural interventions may be particularly important as neighborhood and community-level factors have been shown to be associated with these classes of future expectations (Sipsma et al. 2012) , and it may be difficult to positively influence expectations if improved expectations do not seem realistic in a given environment. Additionally, the Drinking/Arrest Expectations class reported the highest expectations for getting someone pregnant in the next year. Because our findings suggest this class had the greatest likelihood of becoming an adolescent parent and because strong evidence exists for the intergenerational cycle of adolescent parenthood (Meade et al. 2008; Sipsma et al. 2010) health and reassuring youth of their health and of the expectation that they will live a long life.\nSeveral strategies on multiple levels therefore may effectively improve future expectations among adolescents and reduce their sexual risk behaviors.\nOur findings lend further empirical support to aspects of the positive youth development (PYD) approach (Catalano et al. 2004 ). The PYD approach aims to foster healthy youth development by capitalizing on several levels of influence, including family members, peers, and community organizations, and emphasizing mentoring and supportive relationships with adults.\nThis preventive approach contrasts other interventions that tend to focus on problems after they have occurred. PYD programs have been shown to be significantly more effective promoting adolescent sexual and reproductive health when positive expectations are clearly articulated to youth participants (Gavin et al. 2010) . Thus, the PYD approach aligns well with these findings and appears to be an important step for reducing adolescent sexual risk behavior.\nSeveral studies have suggested that a sizable proportion of adolescents in the US express some desire for pregnancy, which may reasonably be associated with future expectations (Hellerstedt et al. 2001) . Pregnancy desire may be derived from an adolescent's future expectations. Both pregnancy desire and future expectations have been shown to be prospectively linked with contraception use and incident pregnancies (Sipsma et al. 2011) , but future research is needed to explore this potential association further. An understanding of this relationship may be another tool to strengthen strategies for preventing adolescent pregnancy.\nThis study has many strengths, including a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample of adolescents followed prospectively over time, making the NLSY97 an ideal cohort to examine the relationship between future expectations and subsequent sexual risk behavior among adolescents. Furthermore, this theoretically-based analysis used empirically driven and validated latent classes to measure a multidimensional construct of future expectations. The results of this analysis are consistent with previous results (Sipsma et al. 2012) , providing further evidence to support this latent class approach. Additionally, we use many covariates from multiple levels of influence derived from Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory to control for additional potential effects. This study provides strong evidence for understanding this relationship.\nThere are, however, limitations to this analysis. First, all measures were self-reported and therefore subject to misclassification. However, audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) technology was used for questions on sexual risk behavior. This approach allowed respondents either to read the questions themselves or to hear them read through headphones and answer privately, improving the validity of responses. Additionally, it is possible that future expectations were shaped by behaviors at baseline, and these classes predicted a trajectory of behavior already in progress. We also found few longitudinal results; the majority of the significant associations are cross-sectional. We believe, however, that these results do not detract from our findings but suggest that these trajectories may be fairly stable throughout the adolescent period. Our findings thus reinforce the importance for developing positive or healthy expectations before the age of 15. As a result, future research should explore expectations earlier in adolescence, and intervention strategies should aim to influence future expectations prior to age 15. Furthermore, it is unknown how consistently adolescents conceptualized the likelihood of a future event; did they conceptualize likelihood as a probability of future occurrence for themselves or the proportion of older individuals who had engaged in a particular behavior? Future research may qualitatively explore adolescents' conception of future expectations as well as probability of occurrence. Additionally, our analysis was limited to measures collected by the NLSY97, making it impossible to incorporate other factors, such as parental relationship quality and pregnancy desire, that were not part of the dataset. Data on number of pregnancies would have been useful but were not available for most of our analytic sample; therefore, this variable was excluded from our analysis. Missing data is also a limitation.\nMultiple imputation, however, has been widely recommended and shown to produce more valid estimates over other approaches, such as single imputation and complete case analysis (Little and Rubin 1987; Schafer 1997 "}]
