However, most of them were small sample size (less than 500 sequences) or only focus on part of genomes. The global genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, mutation patterns and transmissions are still unclear so far.\nTo answer these questions above, we analyzed 3050 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID database and found that based on different mutation patterns, the SARS-CoV-2 was classified into four main groups and 10 subgroups. The distribution of different groups of SARS-CoV-2 was varied in geography, time and age, but was similar in gender.

More than half of these mutations (nine mutations) presented in ORF1ab, followed by ORF9 (three mutations), ORF3a (two mutations), and at last only one mutation was detected in 5'UTR, ORF2 and ORF8, respectively. Of the 16 mutations in coding sequences, 11 mutations were non-synonymous mutations and five mutations were synonymous mutations.

Analogical with group B2, we found that group D and group C3 (especially group D) also shown a fast expansion trend since their firstly emerged. The group C1 was different with other groups, which presented an increased trend in Feb-2020, whereas, sharply decline in Mar-2020. (Fig. 4A) Combined with the geographic data, more findings were observed. Firstly, the SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Asia at Dec-2019, and transmitted to Europe, North America and Oceania at Jan-2020, then spread to South America and Africa at Mar-2020. (Fig. 4B) . Secondly, in the early stage (Jan-2020), the distribution of 10 subgroups were similar between Asia and North America. And then, group A and group B1 decreased with time in both continents, group B2 increased in North America gradually, instead of, group C1 was scaling-up in Asia with time.

(Fig. 4C) In detail, group A was the first observed in China at 2019/12/24, and started its first expansion to North America (USA, 2020/1/21) and Oceania (Australia, 2020/1/22), and second expansion to Europe countries and South America (Brazil, 2020/3/3). (Fig. 4C) For group B, group B1 was also first observed in China at 2020/1/5, and the expansion pattern was similar with group A, just at a bit late. Before its first expansion, group B2 emerged in USA at 2020/1/19 for the first time, followed by China (2020/1/21), Singapore (2020/1/29), Canada (2020/3/5), Australia (2020/3/8) and Iceland (2020/3/11).

Notably, to better understand the global diversity and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, we further classed the SARS-CoV-2 strains into 10 subgroups by more detailed mutation patterns in this study for the first time.\nWhen add in geography, gender, age and time data of SARS-CoV-2\nsequence, the answer was clearer and clearer.\nGroup A was the predominate strain at the beginning of globally spreading 17,18 , however, it was waned over time. Even though it transmitted to Europe, North America, South America and Oceania, we found that Group A was still mainly observed in Asia. When the group A declined, the group B1 emerged at 2020/1/5 in China. After short-time local expansion, it spread to USA, Australia and other countries.\nHowever, there was a paradoxical phenomenon, that is, group B2 firstly occurred in USA at 2020/1/19, which was sooner than group A and group B transmitted into USA (2020/1/21 and 2020/1/23, respectively). The reason maybe that the sequences of group A and group B1 (emerged before group B2) in USA was not acquired or uploaded. Since group B2 was observed, it quickly became the primary strains in USA and then spread to China, Canada and Australia. Interestingly, when the group B2 emerged in China and Australia, it was almost not expanded. Whereas, in Canada, an adjacent country of USA, it was expanded at once. This hint us the different groups of SARS-CoV-2 may be limited in geography or race.\n.

Similar with group A and group B1, group C2 was decreased over time, inversely, group C3 was increased step by step. But the dynamic of group C1 was different with the two others, which had a big expansion at Feb-2020. This was because that many SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan was uploaded at Feb-2020. This also was the reason why large compose of group C1 presented in Japan.\nGroup D was the latest occurred over time, however, once appeared, it apace expanded and had been the major strains now in the world, especially in Europe and Africa. Interestingly, we found that the group D2 were tended to decreased with age, however, the trend of group D3 was in the opposite direction. This indicated that the group D2 and group D3 were tightly with age.\nIn addition, we found two apparent expansion stages in the world of the SARS-CoV-2 spreading. One was from China and USA to the other countries at late Jan-2020, another was from Europe to the other countries at the late Feb-2020 to early Mar-2020. Notably, the second stage is expanding now. Hence, we still need to be on the alert and take active measures to contain the SARS-CoV-2 spreading.\nOur study has some limitations due to the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data.
