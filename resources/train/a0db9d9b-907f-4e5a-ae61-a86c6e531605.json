[{"section_title": "", "text": "percent from 1972 to 2002. 1 Because the fraction of new Ph.D. economists entering academe has remained fairly constant, at about 60 percent, during the same period (Siegfried and Stock, 2004), average economics class sizes in U.S. colleges and universities have necessarily been increasing (or taught by non-Ph.D.s). This tightening in the domestic labor market is evidenced by the recent increase in starting salaries, leading to salary compression and, in a few documented cases, salary inversion, so that some first year faculty earn more than sixth year faculty who are above average in productivity and working in the same department (Siegfried and Stock, 2006). Second, domestic and foreign economics Ph.D. students specialize in different fields. A sample of about 800 economists who earned Ph.D.s in either 1996-97 or 2001-02 (see Siegfried and Stock, 1999) reveals many statistically significant differences in the domestic and foreign Ph.D. mix by field. For example, 90 percent of new Ph.D.s in economic history are U.S. citizens, and between 55 and 70 percent of those in agricultural and natural resource economics, labor economics, law and economics, public economics, industrial organization, and health, education and welfare economics are U.S. citizens. In contrast, fewer than 40 percent of those specializing in international economics (24 percent), mathematical and quantitative methods (26 percent), macro and monetary economics (36 percent), and microeconomic theory (36 percent) are U.S. citizens. As the mix of new Ph.D. graduates shifts toward relatively fewer domestic students, the stock of professional economists' skills shifts away from economic history and applied micro policy, and toward international economics, mathematical and quantitative methods, and micro and macro theory, changing the nature of what economists do. 1 U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), \"Degrees and Other Formal Awards Conferred\" surveys, and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), \" Completions\" surveys, 1986-87 through 1998-99, and Fall 2000through Fall 2002 surveys. Available at: http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d03/tables/dt296.asp Third, current trends indicate that reliance on international Ph.D. graduates to fill domestic job openings in the U.S. is risky. First-time international graduate student enrollments declined for three consecutive years after September 11, 2001, and international graduate student applications declined by 33 percent from 2003to 2005(Brown and Doulis, 2005. Increased competition for Ph.D. students from universities in Europe, Asia, and Australia accounts for some of the decline in interest by international students. Difficulties securing visas for study in the U.S., and diminished perceptions of the U.S. abroad recently have exacerbated the disappearance of international applicants to Ph.D. programs. Whether international graduates will be available to meet U.S. demand for Ph.D. economists in the future is more problematic today than it seemed in the 1990s. Numerous decisions affect the number of Ph.D.s graduating in economics annually. Because most Ph.D. economists major in economics as undergraduates (Siegfried and Stock, 2004), students must first be attracted to principles of economics and their interest nurtured sufficiently so that the successful ones choose to major in economics (see Lemke, et al. 2005). It is then necessary to prepare undergraduates for graduate work in economics, encouraging them to take mathematics courses beyond the minimum required in most undergraduate curricula. Graduates must subsequently apply for admission to an economics Ph.D. program, at least one program must admit them, and, to indicate a realistic expectation that they can complete the degree, offer them financial aid. They must then enroll and persist in the program, learn skills that are useful to prospective employers, and complete the Ph.D. degree requirements in a sufficiently short time period to take advantage of career opportunities. In other papers, we have addressed several steps in this progression. We have examined the exposure of college students to a first course in economics (Siegfried, 2000), trends in the number of undergraduate degrees awarded in economics (Siegfried and Round, 2001) the time required to earn an economics Ph.D. (Siegfried and Stock, 2001;, the job market for new Ph.D.s (Siegfried and Stock 1999, 2004, and the match between economists' graduate training and their subsequent job requirements (Stock and Hansen, 2004). In other ongoing research we are examining the matriculation and attrition decisions of admitted and enrolled Ph.D. students (Finegan, Stock, and Siegfried, 2006;Stock, Finegan, and Siegfried, 2006). A remaining gap in our research on the overall process centers on the decision of undergraduates to apply for admission to a graduate program in economics. Part of this decision necessarily depends on the characteristics of their undergraduate education. Accordingly, this paper presents information on the characteristics of the undergraduate institutions of economics Ph.D.s and examines relationships between those characteristics and other factors in the Ph.D. production process, including attrition and time-todegree."}, {"section_title": "I. Undergraduate Origins of Economics Ph.D.s", "text": "In Figure 1, the number of economics Ph.D. degrees awarded by U.S. universities each year to students who earned a bachelor's degree in the U.S. is traced for the period 1966-2003. Because some foreign students earn undergraduate degrees at American colleges and universities and some domestic students earn bachelor's degrees overseas, the pattern in Figure 1 tracks, but is not identical to, the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded to U.S. citizens by U.S. universities each year. 2 The number of American-undergraduate-institution-trained (AUIT) Ph.D.s peaked at close to 800 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady decline of about one percentage point per year for three decades. 3 The distribution of types of undergraduate institutions attended by individuals awarded a Ph.D. in economics by American universities each year from 1966 through 2003 is reported in  Table 1. They are relatively constant over time, a pattern similar to that observed in science and engineering more generally (Freeman, et al, 2004, Table   3). The only noticeable shift has been a moderate increase in the share of new Ph.D. economists coming from selective private liberal arts colleges. Almost 70 percent of AUIT economics Ph.D.s is accounted for by a combination of the roughly 120 universities that offer a Ph.D. in economics and the Top-50 liberal arts colleges. Together this group of institutions accounts for less than 12 percent of the nation's four-year colleges and universities, but about 69 percent of all undergraduate degrees earned. Not surprisingly, the dominance of higher quality undergraduate institutions in producing future Ph.D.s is not limited to economics but also occurs in most other disciplines (Zhang 2004, p. 17).   The set of \"Elite-20\" institutions contains ten universities and ten liberal arts colleges. Among the ten universities are the eight northeastern Ivy League universities, Chicago, and Stanford. Seven of the ten were founded before the Revolutionary War. Among the others, Cornell (1865) is part of the Ivy League, and Chicago (1891) and Stanford (1891) are venerable institutions from beyond the northeast. All ten are among U.S. News & World Report's top 15 ranked national universities. In light of age, location, and academic credentials, only Duke, MIT, and Northwestern might have substituted for one of the ten chosen universities. All ten of the liberal arts colleges were founded before 1870. Eight of the ten are in the northeast. Oberlin (Ohio) and Grinnell (Iowa) were added for geographical diversity. Nine of the ten colleges are among U.S. News & World Report's top 15 ranked liberal arts colleges. (Oberlin ranked below 15.) In terms of age, location, and academic credentials, only Bowdoin, Carleton, Middlebury, and Davidson might have substituted for one of the ten chosen liberal arts colleges. increased only because their absolute number has declined relatively slower than the other three categories. The 25 worldwide undergraduate alma maters that generated the most U.S. economics Ph.D.s during 1997-2002 are reported in Table 2 Table 3. The list obviously is dominated by research universities that offer a Ph.D. in economics. Average annual rates of AUIT Ph.D.s generated by these institutions (one-seventh the numbers reported in Table 3) are, for example, 7 These data are not directly available via webCASPAR, but were instead obtained in late 2003 via a special tabulation from the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), the contractor to NSF for the SED. Because NORC continuously updates the webCASPAR data with late arriving surveys and the special tabulation that produced Table  3 occurred about two years before our extraction from webCASPAR of the data used in the rest of this paper, there is a slight difference in the number of Ph.D.s. reported in Tables 2 through 5. 12 from each undergraduate class at Harvard, 10 from each undergraduate class at Berkeley, and about seven annually from Cornell and Stanford. The only real surprises on the list are the private and public liberal arts colleges-e.g., Swarthmore, William and Mary, Williams, and Miami (Ohio)-surrounded by the likes of the larger Universities of Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and UCLA. For these highly productive liberal arts colleges, the annual average number of eventual economics Ph.D.s generated ranges from about 5.5 for Swarthmore to 3.5 for Miami (Ohio). To better illustrate the relative productivity of liberal arts colleges at generating eventual economics Ph.D.s,  (1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993). Although only four liberal arts colleges appear among the top 25 American undergraduate producers of eventual economics Ph.D.s listed in Table 3, Table   4 shows that it is the liberal arts colleges that send the greatest proportion of their graduates on to earn Ph.D.s in economics. Swarthmore leads the list, with an average of one-half of one percent of its graduates each year eventually earning a Ph.D. in economics, or about 15 economics Ph.D.s generated per 1,000 Swarthmore graduates. Of the top 25 institutions ranked by the proportion of the graduating class that eventually earns a Ph.D. in economics, 24 are private colleges and universities, and the one public institution (College of William and Mary) is the closest thing there is to a liberal arts college in the public sector. Eighteen of the 25 are liberal arts colleges with little or no graduate education on their campus. Although not shown in the table, the trend continues as one moves down these rankings. It is not until we reach rank 54 that a large public university (Berkeley) appears on the list! This pattern of dominance of private liberal arts colleges and private universities in producing undergraduates who eventually earn a Ph.D. in economics follows closely the doctoral production pattern in the natural sciences (Tidball 1986, p. 613). If there are a large number of economics majors at a relatively small institution, even a small proportion of economics majors proceeding on to a Ph.D. can move an institution up the list reported in Table 4. Some economics departments, however, especially those competing with an undergraduate business school, produce a remarkable number of Ph.D. economists from a relatively small pool of economics majors. These institutions are shown in Table 5, where we normalize the eventual economics Ph.D.s generated by each institution by the number of bachelor's degrees it awards in economics. Because of variation in the relative size of economics programs within colleges and universities, only ten of those listed in Table 4 survive among the leading 25 in Table 5. A few colleges and universities with relatively small economics programs near the top of Table 5 Tables 4   and 5, Table 6 presents overall institution-and economics-program size-normalized Ph.Ds. generated by each of the four categories of undergraduate institution. Although the economics Ph.D.-granting institutions generated more than 13 times as many BA/BS degrees and more than seven times as many economics BA/BS degrees as the top-50 liberal arts colleges did during 1987-1993, the liberal arts colleges generated about three times as many Ph.D.s per BA/BS awarded and more than twice as many Ph.D.s per economics BA/BS awarded. One reason for the disproportionate presence of selective liberal arts college graduates among economics Ph.D.s may be the tendency of individuals to \"follow in the footsteps\" of their parents (Laband and Lentz, 1985). While fewer than three percent of the nation's college students attend selective liberal arts colleges, almost half of the children of faculty at selective liberal arts colleges, and about a quarter of the children of faculty at national research universities attend selective liberal arts colleges (Siegfried and Getz, 2006, Table 5b). Moreover, relatively more economics departments in liberal arts colleges than at national universities report that their students' written work is published (65 percent vs. 43 percent), and of that published work, relatively more from liberal arts graduates (77 percent) than from national research university graduates (52 percent) is published in professional academic journals (McGoldrick, 2006, Table 5b). If conducting research that is publishable is more common at liberal arts colleges, academic careers may emanate from liberal arts college graduates more frequently. The institutions in Table 5 have proven to be very productive at generating eventual "}, {"section_title": "II. Undergraduate Origins and Economics Ph.D. Program Outcomes", "text": "As part of our study of the economics Ph.D. production process, we are following the progress of 586 students who began Ph.D. study in one of 27 economics Ph.D. programs during  Goldberger et al., 1995). Three are Tier 1, six Tier 2, seven Tier 3, six Tier 4, and four Tier 5. One is unranked. 9 Thus, the programs are drawn from all quality tiers; but larger, higherranked universities are over-represented. Together the 27 produced 42 percent of the Ph.D.s issued by U.S. programs awarding at least one degree from 1998 to 2001. 10 Fourteen of the 8 Each of the 22 programs with the most degrees awarded from 1998 through 2001 was invited to participate; 15 accepted. The remaining 12 programs were selected randomly from the 45 smaller programs that averaged at least 5 Ph.D.s annually from 1998 through 2001. 9 The first tier of NRC rankings consists of Chicago, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale (three of which are included in our study). The second tier is California-Berkeley, Columbia, Michigan, Minnesota, Northwestern, Pennsylvania, Rochester, UCLA, and Wisconsin. The third tier is programs ranked 16-30; fourth tier programs are ranked 31-48. We included in the fifth tier the remainder of programs, including one not ranked by the NRC. largest 20 Ph.D. programs and nine of the top 15 Ph.D. programs in economics as ranked in 1993 by the National Research Council (Goldberger, et al. 1995)  Assuming that no particular type of undergraduate institution has been more or less successful in luring or pressuring prospective Ph.D. students to apply and enroll if they are admitted, U.S. economics Ph.D. programs that want to boost applications and enrollments from domestically trained undergraduates need not look far. The largest pool of prospects comes from U.S. institutions offering a Ph.D. in economics; close to two-thirds of the AUIT first year students (142/223) earned their undergraduate degrees from these schools. An additional 15 percent of AUIT students are located at the 50 or so most prestigious liberal arts colleges. Column 3 indicates that by the beginning of their second year of study, 13 percent of the entrants (77 individuals) had dropped out. By the beginning of their third year of study (Fall 2004), attrition was 26 percent for the enrolling cohort. Substantial differences in attrition 11 There are 223 AUIT students among the 586 in the entering class. Among these, 63 percent attended economics Ph.D.-granting, 16 percent Top-50 liberal arts, 13 percent other public, and 8 percent other private undergraduate institutions. These percentages imply that our sample includes more students from economics Ph.D.-granting and fewer from other private undergraduate institutions than is represented by the SED data in Table 1 for Ph.D.s graduating in 1997Ph.D.s graduating in -2003 emerge on the basis of type and location of undergraduate training. For example, after two full years in the Ph.D. programs, the 30 percent dropout rate for AUIT Ph.D.s was six percentage points higher than that of those trained overseas, a difference that is statistically significantly different at the 0.10 level. Moreover, there are substantial differences in attrition based on the type of undergraduate institution attended. Among the AUIT Ph.D. students, the lowest attrition (21 percent after two years) occurred among Ph.D. students who earned their undergraduate degrees from the nation's 50 most prestigious private liberal arts colleges (plus the six we added), and the highest attrition (50 percent after two years) occurred among the 30 Fall 2002 matriculants whose undergraduate degrees were awarded by public universities that do not offer a Ph.D. in economics (although only the latter group's attrition rate is significantly different from that of other Ph.D. students). In their study of the match between the skills learned in graduate school and those used by economics Ph.D.s on the job, Stock and Hansen (2004 , Table 2) Table 7 presents a conundrum. On the one hand, firstyear Ph.D. students who did their undergraduate work at economics Ph.D.-granting institutions earned higher analytical GRE scores but lower quantitative GRE scores than other first-year students, while the opposite is true for students from foreign institutions where English is not the dominant language; they have the highest quantitative but the lowest analytical GRE scores among the first year class. In both cases, the GRE scores send mixed signals in terms of the students' mastery of the skills rated most important for success in graduate school. On the other hand, graduates of economics Ph.D.-granting institutions, those from top-50 liberal arts colleges, and those from foreign institutions where English is the dominant language earn higher verbal GRE scores than others, while students from foreign institutions where English is not the dominant language earn lower verbal GRE scores -suggesting that the graduates from these different types of institutions may face ease (or difficulty) in mastering the communication skills that their predecessors rate as highly important for success on the job. 12 In Table 8 we present probit regression estimates of two-year attrition for the 572 members of the entering class for whom we have complete survey information. Unlike the raw means presented in Table 7, the regression controls for differences in demographic characteristics (age, sex, citizenship), school-related characteristics (whether the student held a prior advanced degree, an undergraduate major in economics, math, or a dual major in economics/math, and the years since the undergraduate degree was earned), whether the student indicated an interest in micro theory, macro theory, or econometrics (the core of the first-year curriculum, indicated by the variable theory interest) or in another specific field of economics on their economics Ph.D. program application, and GRE scores. The regression also includes firstyear financial aid variables, undergraduate institution characteristics, and indicators for particular graduate programs (i.e. binary variables representing the 24 institutions with ten or more students in the regression sample). The regression estimates indicate that once other factors are controlled, none of the demographic or other school-related characteristics is related to attrition. The only exception is the verbal GRE score, but its impact is small, with a ten point increase being associated with only a .003 decrease in the probability of dropout. 13 Not surprisingly, those who have no financial support are more likely to dropout in the first two years of graduate study, being 21 percentage points more likely to do so than their counterparts with teaching assistantships. Among the undergraduate institution groups, only other foreign is significantly associated with dropout, with those students having about a .2 lower probability of dropout relative to their counterparts from economics Ph.D.-granting institutions. Included in the model as explanatory variables for time-to-degree are indicators for particular graduate programs (i.e. binary variables representing the six institutions with ten or more graduates in the regression sample), type of financial support, type of dissertation (traditional treatise or set of essays), field of specialization, socio-demographic and educational background characteristics, and the type of undergraduate institution attended. The variable means and coefficient estimates from the regression are reported in Table 9. 14 We have discussed the relationships between demographic and graduate program characteristics and time-to-degree elsewhere (e.g., Siegfried and Stock, 2004, p. 277;). Here we elaborate on relationships between type of undergraduate institution and time-to-degree. The group of binary variables indicating various types of undergraduate institutions attended by the 302 Ph.D. economists in our sample explains a statistically significant additional amount of the variation in the time it took them to earn their degrees (the pvalue in a test of their joint significance is 0.000). There are also economically meaningful differences in time-to-degree among those who attended different types of undergraduate institutions. Those who graduated from a selective private liberal arts college finished about eight months faster than the benchmark group whose undergraduate study was at a university that also offers a Ph.D. in economics. Those who earned undergraduate degrees from foreign predominantly English speaking universities finished eleven months faster, and those who earned undergraduate degrees from other foreign universities finished about five months faster than the benchmark. Although not significantly different from the benchmark, the slowest group is those from public universities in the U.S. that do not offer a Ph.D. in economics, the same group with the worst attrition record. Graduates who completed undergraduate study at selective American liberal arts colleges, or whose undergraduate training was in Britain, Canada, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand, earned a Ph.D. in economics sufficiently faster than the large group of undergraduates from American Ph.D. granting universities so as to save almost a full academic year. The savings from an academic year could be viewed as a full year's opportunity cost to graduates, and/or a year of financial aid from the Ph.D. department. Applicants from Swarthmore, Williams, or Carleton, therefore, might be viewed appropriately as likely \"less expensive\" Ph.D.   1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 1970 = 1967-1973, 1980 = 1977-1983, 1990 = 1987-1993, 2000 = 1997-2003.
