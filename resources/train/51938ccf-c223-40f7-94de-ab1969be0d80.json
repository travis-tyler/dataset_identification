In the present study, we aimed to examine the association of CSF clusterin levels with synaptic degeneration in individuals with different severities of cognitive impairment. Patients and Methods: In the present study, we compared levels of clusterin in CSF among individuals with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Further, linear regression models were performed to examine the association of CSF clusterin with neurogranin (NG, reflecting synaptic degeneration) with adjustment of several potential confounders. Results: We found that CSF clusterin levels were positively correlated with NG in the NC and MCI groups, but not the AD group. In all subjects, linear regression models suggested that clusterin levels were positively associated with NG levels independent of age, gender, apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype, clinical diagnosis, and CSF A\u03b242 levels.

It has been reported that synaptic degeneration is an important mechanism underlying cognitive deficit in AD. 10 Neurogranin (NG), a postsynaptic protein, has been reported to be significantly increased in the CSF of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. [11] [12] [13] In addition, CSF NG levels can predict progression of MCI to AD dementia. 14 In animals, knockdown of NG inhibits long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition, 15 while upregulation enhances LTP and cognition. 16 Given the potential roles of both clusterin and NG in AD pathogenesis, we hypothesized that clusterin may contribute to synaptic dysfunction, which leads to cognitive deficits in AD. First, we compared CSF clusterin levels among individuals with normal cognition (NC), MCI, and AD. Second, to examine the relationship between CSF clusterin and NG levels, the Pearson correlation test was conducted in each diagnostic group. Finally, linear regression models were performed to examine the association of CSF clusterin with NG levels by controlling for age, gender, educational attainment, APOE4 genotype, clinical diagnosis, and CSF A\u03b242 levels."}, {"section_title": "Patients and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)", "text": "Cross-sectional data used in the preparation of this paper were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

In addition, levels of clusterin in CSF were positively correlated with NG levels in the CN and MCI groups, but not the AD group. However, no significant difference was observed in CSF clusterin levels between the three diagnostic groups.\nAlthough clusterin gene has been regarded as a strong genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, 23, 24 the mechanism by which clusterin contributes to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. We provided in vivo evidence that clusterin may impair synaptic function to increase the risk of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between CSF clusterin and NG levels in living human. In line with these findings, a preclinical study found that in an in vitro model of ischemia, exogenous administration of recombinant clusterin induced a substantial worsening of synaptic damage, suggesting a deleterious role of clusterin in synaptic structure and function. 25 In clinical studies, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the assessment of brain atrophy, including loss of synapses and neurons. 26, 27 A longitudinal prospective study showed a significant association of the clusterin *A\u03b2 interaction with longitudinal entorhinal cortex atrophy in non-demented older adults, 28 indicating that clusterin may accelerate amyloid deposition and induce A\u03b2-associated neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the early stage of AD. [29] [30] [31] [32] Increasing evidence has been suggested that \u03b2-amyloid-mediated synaptic loss is dependent on the upregulation of the NMDA receptormediated activity and cytoplasmic calcium ions, and this process contributes to dendritic spine loss. [33] [34] [35] Recently, in non-demented older adults, Slot and colleagues found that CSF clusterin levels partially mediated the relationship between CSF ApoE levels and CSF tau levels. However, they did not find that CSF clusterin mediated the relationship between APOE4 genotype and CSF A\u03b242 levels. 36 In the present study, we found that CSF clusterin was associated with CSF NG levels after adjusting for CSF A\u03b2 levels, indicating that this association may go beyond the effect of A\u03b2 on synaptic function. However, further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to support this notion. However, it is also likely that the upregulation of clusterin levels may represent a neuroprotective response. For instance, it has been reported that clusterin can reduce amyloid formation and provide significant cytoprotection. 37 In addition, clusterin has been reported to enhance amyloid clearance from brain across the BBB via LRP2. 6 Further, a prospective longitudinal study conducted in Rotterdam found that clusterin levels in plasma were associated with the prevalence and severity of AD, but not the incidence Figure 3 Correlation between CSF clusterin and NG levels in each diagnostic group. Abbreviations: CN, cognitively normal; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; AD, Alzheimer's disease; NG, neurogranin. of AD during follow-up, suggesting that the upregulation of clusterin may be triggered by the neurodegenerative changes that occur in AD. 2 Interestingly, we found that levels of clusterin in CSF were positively correlated with NG levels in the CN and MCI groups, but not the AD group. Our data highlighted a potential role of clusterin in the early stages of AD. However, further studies are warranted to examine the mechanism by which clusterin affects synaptic degeneration in the early stages of AD.\nSeveral limitations should be noted. First, the crosssectional design applied in the present study limits the ability to differentiate whether increased clusterin levels result from, cause, or are just correlated with synaptic degeneration among older individuals. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to examine the precise relationship between clusterin and synaptic degeneration. Second, CSF readout may not reflect what exactly happening in the brain. Therefore, recent advancements, such as multiplexed single synapse assay using SynTOF panel, 38 and more direct assessments of biomarkers in interstitial brain tissue 39 should be utilized in further studies. Third, the ADNI study represents a convenience sample of volunteers, which may reduce the power to generalize our findings to other populations. Further, most of the participants of the ADNI study are Caucasian and well educated, which may also limit the generalizability of our findings. However, the ADNI study is one of the most successful studies focusing on examining whether multiple biomarkers could be used to measure the progression of MCI and early AD dementia. More markers and more neurodegenerative diseases should be included in the ADNI study to further facilitate the biomarker discovery.\nIn conclusion, our data indicated that CSF clusterin was associated with CSF NG levels among older individuals with different severities of cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dovepress", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Publish your work in this journal", "text": "Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment is an international, peerreviewed journal of clinical therapeutics and pharmacology focusing on concise rapid reporting of clinical or pre-clinical studies on a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.
