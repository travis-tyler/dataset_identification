[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The present study investigated pre-service chemistry teachers' problem solving strategies and alternative conceptions in solving stoichiometric problems and later on formulate a teaching framework based from the result of the study. The pre-service chemistry teachers were given four stoichiometric problems with increasing complexity and they need to write the process that they undertake to solve the problem. The study found out that the most prominent strategy among pre-service chemistry teachers is the mole method, which is algorithmic by nature. Very few of them used the proportionality method and none made use of the logical method. Alternative conception noted among the pre-service chemistry teachers is that some of them rely on Avogadro's number in converting between moles with a given mass. The results indicate that these pre-service chemistry teachers has the tendency to teach stoichiometry using the mole method only and that they might carry on the alternative conception about Avogadro's number as they start their teaching career. It is therefore suggested that the teaching of stoichiometry to pre-service chemistry teachers should not be confined to demonstration as they will imitate such technique when they are already a full pledged chemistry teacher. They should be involved in the process of thinking of ways to solve the stoichiometric problem in such a way that it will help them become independent thinkers and be responsible for their own learning by developing metacognitive and critical thinking strategies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is devastating that no matter how much effort the Philippine government exerts to improve the quality of science education, the country still gets dismal results in national and international competency-based examinations. In chemistry, specifically, the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reported that Filipino students got 30% average correct answers, which is way below the international average of 45% (Martin, Mullis, Gonzales, Gregory & Smith, 2004) .\nAs agreed upon by both teachers and researchers, one of the most difficult topics in chemistry is stoichimetry. Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry evaluating the results of quantitative measurements connected to chemical compounds and reactions. Therefore, students find it as very mathematical and cumulative that one gets lost when a particular topic is missed (Schmidt & Jigneus, 2003) . Recurring yearly, teachers observed that students have different strategies or approaches in solving stoichiometric problems. Some follows an algorithmic step-by-step procedure while some others deviate from the usual technique but still come up with the correct answer. This project would like to know the origin of how most students solve problems in stoichiometry -strategies which might have originated from their teachers during their pre-service preparation.\nThis exploratory study, therefore, seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the problem solving strategies used by pre-service chemistry teachers in answering stoichiometric problems?; (2) What are the similarities and differences in the way pre-service chemistry teachers answer stoichiometric problems?; (3) What are the common errors committed by pre-service chemistry teachers in solving stoichiometric problems?; (4) What are the observations of chemistry education academics in the way pre-service chemistry teachers solve stoichiometric problems?; (5) What does the result imply to teaching and learning chemistry?; and (6) What teaching framework can be formulated based on the results of the study?.\nOne of the most pronounced deficiencies in understanding Chemistry that involves calculations is the illiteracy on the Chemistry language. Glazar and Devetak (2001) proved in their study that students even after long years of studying Chemistry, still, are having difficulty in writing symbols and equations and solving Chemistry mathematical problems. This is also true in the arguments made by Fatch, De Boer & Parchman (2006) , where the learners' deficiency might have been rooted to misconception if not lacking on the knowledge of stoichiometric entities such as \"molar masses and amounts of substance\". Further, Johnstone (2006) claimed the same in his study, that learners acquired techniques but found short in acquiring fundamental concepts. For these reasons, learners' long-term memory couldn't be established because it could not make any connection to the basic skills, because they are hardly founded.\nWhile students expressed a number of deficiencies in the underlying aspects of Chemistry, It is good to point out that there are also reports were students proved to be using varied strategies in solving Stoichiometric problems; however, these are not properly organized for they have only created their own based from the problems given at hand and did not utilize the ones that were taught in Chemistry classes (Schmidt, 1990 & Schmidt & Jigneus, 2003 . In some cases where students found to be using the learned techniques in school, it is proved that that there were only two strategies taught in school that are commonly used: mole and proportionality methods (Toth & Sebestyen, 2009 ). Moreover, these techniques and the ones originally made by learners are used successfully only when dealing with simple mathematical problems but students cringed when faced with difficult ones (Schmidt & Jign\u00e9us, 2003; BouJaoude & Barakat, 2003) .\nRecently, reports proved that students seem fail to realize that they are already using the basic tenets of reasoning which are useful to solving Stoichiometric problems, yet afraid to take more risks in giving extra effort when faced with more challenging tasks. This was evident in the study made by Schmidt (1997) , where most students apply reasoning strategies to easy problems but tend to go back to algorithmic skills ones the task becomes challenging. This was substantiated by the recent study of Schmidt and Jigneus, (2003) among Swedish learners. They are confident in adopting logical strategy when solving easy chemistry problems; however, most of them recoiled and utilized \"mathematical strategy\" when answering the complicated ones. Not surprisingly, in the recent interview results of Fach, De Boer, & Parchman (2006) , there were only few among those who participated used \"reflective strategies\" and the rest failed to do so but applied Algorithm.\nMoreover, literature speaks that educators have a great impact on the success and the failure of mathematical skills acquisition among students that is relative to understanding the aspects of Stoichiometry. It is believed that whatever strategies developed by students, these could always be thrown back to the teachers. Interview reports revealed that students don't conceptualize formula but simply memorize what has been commonly taught to use (Howe & Johnstone, 1971 as cited in Johnstone, 2005) . On the historical aspect, since the early of 1900s rote learning had received a lot of favour from educators and this had been instilled into the minds of students that it in the process of repetition comes learning (Roediger, 2013) . This idea contradicted the beliefs of Piaget that to facilitate learning, students should be provided with tangible \"hands on\" and challenging tasks. This was also corroborated in the study made by Feyzio\u011flu (2009) , where the efficient utilization of laboratory skills proved a significant progress on the solving problem skills among learners. Therefore, it is best to emphasize that knowledge on theories and how the effective process of transferring specific skills to students must be well underpinned and fossilized among educators, specifically Chemistry teachers to fully grasp the idea of solving Stiochiometric problems correctly (Okanlawon, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design 106 Espinosa, Espa\u00f1a & Marasigan", "text": "The study utilized the case study qualitative research design to formulate a teaching framework for stoichiometry by investigating pre-service chemistry teacher's problem solving strategies in solving stoichiometric problems as well as their common errors in solving."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The study involved thirty three (33) junior pre-service chemistry teachers who are currently enrolled in Analytical Chemistry course during the first semester of school year 2014-2015."}, {"section_title": "Stoichiometry Questionnaire", "text": "The researchers developed the stoichiometry questionnaire intentionally for this study. The questionnaire was content and face validated by panel of experts coming from the fields of chemistry and chemistry education. Moreover, the questionnaire was pilot tested to senior pre-service chemistry teachers from a state university in Manila during the first semester of school year 2014-2015. The pilot testing was conducted to determine the readability of the questionnaire and the approximate length of time the students need to answer it. On the average, students finish answering the questionnaire in sixty (60) minutes.\nThe questionnaire contains three problems about stoichiometry with increasing complexity. Pre-service chemistry teachers need to solve each problem and show their complete solutions for each on the leftmost box. On the rightmost box, students need to explain how they come up with their answer by describing the procedure they undertake to solve it.\nThe first problem is the simplest among the three because the chemical equation is already given as part of the problem. They just need to balance the equation and solve the questions that follow. The given equation though is already balanced. The questions that follow are mole-to-mole conversion, mass-to-mole conversion, and mass-to-mass conversion. Below is problem number 1.\nHeating calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) or limestone at a very high temperature yields calcium oxide (CaO) or lime and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Lime is used in industry for the manufacture of plaster of paris, mortar, and cement. The decomposition of limestone to lime is given by the chemical equation below. The second problem gave a situation about two different substances than when in contact with each other reacts to form a new compound. The chemical equation for the reaction was not given as part of the problem. Preservice chemistry teachers need to formulate the chemical equation and balance it as well. This time, they really need to balance the chemical equation. The questions that follow are mole-to-mole conversion, mole-to-mass conversion, and mass-to-mass conversion. Below is problem number 2.\nZinc (Zn) is a metal used in the automotive industry, building industry, and construction industry, for hot tip galvanizing, for zinc castings, brass making, bronze making, and in steel making. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) or commonly known as muriatic acid, on the other hand, is a popular cleaning agent. Anything that is made of zinc should not be cleaned with muriatic acid because they react drastically to produce a zinc chloride residue (ZnCl 2 ). The third problem is a visual conception one. Pre-service chemistry teachers were given mental models of the reactants and products and they need to formulate a chemical equation from it. They also need to balance the chemical equation that they have formulated. The questions that follow are mole-to-mole conversion, mass-to-Journal of Education in Science, Environment and Health (JESEH) mole conversion, and mass-to-mass conversion. The name and the formula of the product are not given. So, they still have to predict what the product is. The problem is a revised form of a question in the Chemical Concepts Inventory (CCI), which was developed by Doug Mulford in 1996 and was published in Journal of Chemical Education On-Line: Library of Conceptual Questions in 2001.

All interviews were digitally recorded and were fully transcribed in accordance with the guidelines presented by Bogdan and Biklen (2007) that interview lengths should range from 30 to 55 minutes, with 38 minutes being the suggested average. The protocols and the accompanying written explanations on the answer sheets served as sources of data for the study. Apparently, the correct responses of pre-service chemistry teachers decrease with increasing complexity of the given problem. In table 1, since problem 1 is the easiest, most students got it correctly followed by problem 2. Students find it difficult to solve problem 3 though. Their strategy or way of solving the problem might have 108 Espinosa, Espa\u00f1a & Marasigan affected their scores -starting from how they balance chemical equations to how they utilize dimensional analysis or factor-label method to solve stoichiometric problems.

Students check the mole ratio of the two given substances from the balanced chemical equation. After getting the mole ratio, they perform a dimensional analysis or factor-label method to arrive at the number of moles of the unknown.

The mole method describes the relations between the given and the required substance via amount of substance. Proportionality method, on the other hand, is a method used by creating a relationship between the given and the required substances via a proportion. The \"logical method\" described the relations between variables in their own words, for example \"twice as much\", \"same proportion\" instead of applying mathematical algorithms.\nThe mole method and the proportionality method were the most prominent strategies used by students in the present study. It confirms the work of Schmidt and Jigneus (2003) , Gabel and Bunce (1994) and Nakleh and Mitchell (1993) that these algorithmic methods are indeed the methods used by most students in stoichiometric problems. The \"logical method\", on the other hand is limited to chemical compounds with a 1:1 mass ratio of its elements. The stoichiometry questionnaire did not provide problems with 1:1 mass ratio of elements so it is also expected that students will not rely on using the \"logical method\". Teachers should also expose students to simple stoichiometric problems to exercise the \"logical method\" among students.\nIn an interview with their teacher in general chemistry, where stoichiometry was first taught, the teacher mentioned that algorithmic methods was the prominent strategy of students in solving problems. In addition, the mole method was the most commonly used by students during class discourse. Proportionality method is the second widely used strategy. Students, on the other hand, least utilize the logical method, because the teacher gives them challenging problems instead of easy ones.\nMisconceptions were also noted in solving stoichiometric problems. The most prominent is the use of Avogadro's number to convert moles of given substance to the moles of unknown substance. In some cases, students even use this converted moles to solve for the mass of the unknown substance, which is incorrect. Caution should be made when teaching the mole concept and stoichiometry.\nIn view of students' strategies and misconceptions in solving stoichiometric problems, the following teaching framework is suggested. The above framework suggests that teachers should not demonstrate solving stoichiometric problems because students rely much on examples when they are doing it themselves. The tendency is that when they are exposed to a totally new form of problem, they easily get lost since their teacher did not demonstrate it to them. It's better to expose students to stoichiometric problems and let them think of ways on how they will solve it. In this manner, the higher order cognitive skills of students are harnessed instead of merely memorizing steps in problem solving. Misconceptions can also be detected and corrected by students themselves through careful facilitation of learning.
