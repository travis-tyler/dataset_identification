[{"section_title": "", "text": "This study is a substantive-methodological synergy, bringing to bear new approaches to factor analysis to substantively important developmental issues of how five-factor-approach (FFA) personality measures vary with gender, age, and their interaction. In particular, there has been surprisingly little methodologically rigorous research evaluating changes in FFA personality measures across the life span-especially old age.\nFactor analysis has been at the heart of the currently dominant approach in personality research that individual differences in adults' personality can universally be organized in terms of five broad trait domains-the FFA approach to personality: Extraversion (e.g., sociability, gregariousness, level of activity, experience of positive affect); Agreeableness (e.g., altruistic behavior, trust, warmth, kindness); Conscientiousness (e.g., self-control, task orientation, rule abiding); Neuroticism (e.g., distress anxiety, anger, depression); Openness (e.g., originality, creativity, and the acceptance of new ideas; for more detail on these factors as used here, see the detailed description in the online supplemental materials). Following Block (2010) , we use the generic term FFA that is not specifically aligned to any particular group of researchers or instruments but acknowledge that some personality researchers-including Block-are critical of the assumption that the self-report FFA factors really do provide an adequate representation of global personality. From this perspective, we emphasize that our focus is on self-report FFA factors-their measurement, analysis, relation to gender and age-from a developmental perspective.\nExploratory factor analyses (EFAs) have consistently identified the FFA factors, and an impressive body of empirical research has supported their stability and predictive validity across different populations, settings, and countries (e.g., and its circumplex structure (de Raad & Hofstee, 1993) . However, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) and structural equation models (SEMs) have typically failed to provide clear support for the FFA based on standard measures (e.g., Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Vassend & Skrondal, 1997) .\nProblematic FFA results based on CFAs have led some researchers to question the appropriateness of CFA for FFA research (see Borkenau & Ostendorf, 1990; Church & Burke, 1994; McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, & Paunonen, 1996; Parker, Bagby, & Summerfeldt, 1993; Vassend & Skrondal, 1997 ; also see discussions by Dolan, Oort, Stoel, & Wicherts, 2009; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) . In particular, the independent clusters model (ICM) used in CFA studies that require each indicator to load on only one factor may be too restrictive for FFA research. CFA models typically do not provide an adequate fit to the data and lead to positively biased FFA factor correlations that might distort relations with other constructs as well as induce multicollinearity (see Ashton, Lee, Goldberg & De Vries, 2009; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) . Such concerns have plagued FFA research and promoted leading FFA proponents such as McCrae et al. (1996, p. 563 ; also see Church & Burke, 1994; Costa & McCrae, 1992 , 1995 ; but also see Borsboom, 2006) to conclude the following:\nIn actual analyses of personality data from Borkenau and Ostendorf (1990) to Holden and Fekken (1994) , structures that are known to be reliable showed poor fits when evaluated by CFA techniques. We believe this points to serious problems with CFA itself when used to examine personality structure.\nHence, research into the FFA factor structure based on responses to individual items largely continues to rely on EFA (for exceptions, see Benet-Mart\u00ednez & John, 1998; Dolan et al., 2009; Gustavsson, Eriksson, Hilding, Gunnarsson, & Ostensson, 2008; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Reise, Smith, & Furr, 2001) , despite the limitations of traditional applications of EFA in comparison to the multiple advances made in CFA/SEM models over the past decades (e.g., tests of factorial and measurement invariance, differential item functioning, control for complex measurement error structures). Particularly important for the present investigation is the Dolan et al. (2009) study that extended the traditional EFA approach based on responses to the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992) Big Five instrument and foreshadowed the subsequent development of exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) through the development of an innovative approach to an EFA-based multigroup rotation procedure and tests of measurement invariance (also see Hessen, Dolan, & Wicherts, 2006; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) .\nUnderpinning FFA research into mean differences between groups (e.g., men and women) and relations with other constructs (e.g., age) are methodological assumptions of factorial and measurement invariance that cannot be appropriately evaluated with traditional EFA approaches. Hence, these assumptions have been largely ignored in most substantive research that continues to rely on FFA scale scores (manifest variables) rather than latent constructs in CFA/SEM models. Furthermore, this gap between applied, substantive research and state-of-the-art methodology appears to be increasing (Borsboom, 2006; Marsh & Hau, 2007) . Here we outline a new approach that allows for the incorporation of EFA into the SEM framework-ESEM Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2009 )-and its extension in ways to enhance further its applicability in developmental research. ESEM and the extensions presented here have the potential to resolve the many dilemmas of factor analysis in FFA research and have wide applicability to all disciplines of psychology that are based on the measurement of latent constructs. Thus, our study is a substantive-methodological synergy (Marsh & Hau, 2007) , demonstrating the importance of applying new and evolving methodological approaches to substantively important issues. We begin with a brief overview of substantive research into gender and age differences in FFA factors and then introduce methodological issues that place limits on this research."}, {"section_title": "Substantive Focus: Gender and Age Differences in FFA Factors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gender Differences", "text": "The search for gender differences in personality research has a long history (e.g., Feingold, 1994; Hall, 1984; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) , and gender is one of the more widely studied correlates of personality. In a meta-analysis of gender differences in FFA traits, Guo (1995) reported that women have substantially higher levels of Agreeableness and Neuroticism than do men but that gender differences were small for the other FFA factors. For Dutch adolescents, Klimstra, Hale, Raaijmakers, Branje, and Meeus (2009) found that girls had consistently higher scores than did boys for Neuroticism (lower Emotional Stability), Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, with tendencies toward higher scores for Openness and Extraversion that varied with age and birth cohort. Donnellan and Lucas (2008) found that across a wide range of ages, women scored consistently higher than men on Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and (to a lesser extent) Conscientiousness but that gender differences on Openness varied with nationality (higher scores for German women than German men but lower scores for British women than British men). These gender differences did not vary substantially with age or educational level. In a cross-cultural study in 36 countries (Costa, Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001) , women typically had higher scores than did men on Neuroticism and Agreeableness, but gender differences were small for Conscientiousness. However, for Openness and Extraversion, the gender differences were not consistent across subfacets of the broad trait factors. In apparently the largest cross-cultural study, D. P. Schmitt, Realo, Voracek, and Allik (2008) reported that women had higher scores for Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness than did men for most of the 55 countries but that differences in Openness were small. Interestingly, gender differences tended to be larger in countries with greater economic development, education, and health.\nIn summary, although there is considerable study-to-study variation in observed gender differences that may be a function of age, cohort, nationality, and the particular instrument considered, there is clear support for the conclusions that women tend to score higher than men in relation to Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Although less consistent, there is also evidence that women score Alternatively, life-span developmentalists (e.g., Helson, Kwan, John, & Jones, 2002; Helson & Moane, 1987 ) have argued that mean-level changes often occur in adulthood and that these are related to major life changes and role transitions. Caspi et al. (2005) reported that there was more change in FFA traits in young adulthood than in adolescence and also noted that for some FFA traits there were systematic changes well past early adulthood, leading them to favor a life-span developmental perspective on FFA change. However, they found no clear evidence that these age effects varied with gender, an issue of relevance to the interpretation of age effects of particular importance to the present investigation.\nProponents of the plaster hypothesis have suggested that results like those summarized by Caspi et al. (2005) are largely consistent with predictions in that \"from age 18 to age 30 there are declines in Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness and increases in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness; after age 30 the same trends are found, although the rate of change seems to decrease\" (McCrae et al., 2000, p. 183) . Srivastava et al. (2003) referred to this as a soft plaster hypothesis and contrasted it with the original hard plaster hypothesis.\nBased on a large database of adult responses (for ages 21 to 60), Srivastava et al. (2003) found no support for the hard plaster hypothesis on any of the FFA factors and found that support for the soft plaster hypothesis was limited to Conscientiousness. In a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies across the entire life span, Viechtbauer (2006a, 2006b ) reported increases with age for Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Social Dominance (one facet of Extraversion), especially between the ages of 20 and 40. Agreeableness showed a steady increase over the life span but particularly in old age. Social Vitality (a second facet of Extraversion) and Openness increased during adolescence and then decreased during old age. On the basis of these results, Roberts et al. (2006a) argued that their \"meta-analysis clearly contradicts the notion that there is a specific age at which personality traits stop changing, as we found evidence for change in middle and old age for four of the six trait categories studied\" (p. 14).\nMaturity principle.\nBased on their review, Caspi et al. (2005) coined the term maturity principle, saying, \"Most people become more dominant, agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable over the course of their lives. These changes point to increasing psychological maturity over development, from adolescence to middle age\" (Caspi et al., 2005; p. 470) . Noting that openness tends to decrease after young adulthood, they suggested that this pattern of maturity was more consistent with a capacity to become a productive member of society than a humanistic perspective of self-actualization. However, in their meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, Roberts et al. (2006b) did find systematic increases in Openness during adolescence and no decline until old age. Nevertheless, only eight of the 92 reviewed studies included samples over 60 years of age.\nIn a test of the maturity principle for longitudinal responses by two cohorts of Dutch adolescents followed for 5 years, Klimstra et al. (2009) reported some increases in all FFA factors but particularly Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. However, they also reported some nonlinearity for most of the age differences, as well as some inconsistency across different cohorts. Donnellan and Lucas (2008) found that across a wide range of ages (16 -86), scores decreased with age for Extraversion and Openness and increased with age for Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Although there was some nonlinearity in most of the factors, it was particularly marked for Conscientiousness (with the highest scores for middle-aged participants 40 -50 years of age). For Neuroticism, the age differences varied somewhat with country.\nIn a methodologically sophisticated study, Allemand, Zimprich, and Hertzog (2007) compared results for middle-aged (42-46) and older (60 -64) adults at each of two time points separated by 4 years. Although there were age-related differences for all FFA traits except Conscientiousness, the results were not entirely consistent over cohort and longitudinal comparisons, and the effect sizes were modest. In another study based on a large and representative sample of Dutch adults between 16 and 91 years of age, Allemand, Zimprich, and Hendriks (2008) failed to replicate these findings; they observed age-related increases in agreeableness and conscientiousness but nonsignificant or nonsystematic differences in the other traits. Unfortunately, none of these studies systematically investigated the possible nonlinearity of the effects. In their large study of FFA factors for adults 21-60, Srivastava et al. (2003) found increases with age for Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, small decreases for Neuroticism and Openness, and no differences for Extraversion. Although there were some nonlinear effects of age and Age \u03eb Gender interactions, these were mostly very small. Robins, Fraley, Roberts, and Trzesniewski (2001) evaluated FFA factors for 18-and 19-year-olds at the start of university and then again 4 years later. They found a moderate decrease in Neuroticism; small to medium increases in Agreeable-3 BIG-FIVE FACTORS ness, Conscientiousness, and Openness; and almost no mean-level changes in Extraversion.\nFinally, in probably the most comprehensive study of agerelated differences in FFA traits to date, Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, and Costa (2005) explored cross-sectional and longitudinal age-related differences (covering an age span of 20 -100) using 1,944 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The results from the longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses converged in showing (a) nonlinear decreases in Neuroticism that tended to flatten out in old age; (b) nonlinear decreases in Extraversion that tended to accelerate after 60; (c) linear decreases in Openness; (d) linear increases in Agreeableness; (e) a curvilinear (inverted U shape) pattern in Conscientiousness characterized by initial increases up to age 60, followed by subsequent decreases.\nIn summary, although there is considerable study-to-study variation in observed age differences that may be a function of cohort, nationality, study design, age range, and the particular instrument considered, there is clear support that over the life span, from adolescence to old-age, people become more agreeable and emotionally stable. Although results are mixed for Openness and Conscientiousness, there is some support for increases during adolescence and early adulthood, followed, perhaps, by decreases in old age. For Extraversion, there are no clear results, and the differences may vary for particular facets of this factor. Although these changes clearly contradict the plaster hypothesis, they also do not provide consistent support for the maturity principle. The maturity principle suggests that as individuals grow older their personalities evolve so that they become more mature, productive contributors to society. However, it is not clear whether the maturity principle applies only to changes during late adolescence and early adulthood or whether it also applies to middle and late adulthood. What appears particularly unclear is whether, as suggested by Caspi et al. (2005) , increases in dominance that were not clearly replicated in many studies could really be taken to reflect maturity. Although this may make sense since Caspi et al. appear to equate maturity with productivity, they do not specify what \"productive maturity\" means in old age, following retirement. Indeed, although few of the previous studies included participants over 60 years of age, these studies suggest that additional changes seem to occur following this age, in apparent contradiction to the maturity principle. Observations such as these led Roberts et al. (2006b, p. 31) to conclude, \"Moreover, accepting the fact that personality traits change in adulthood highlights the inadequacies of almost all theoretical positions found in personality psychology and personality development.\"\nLa dolce vita effect: FFA changes in old age. Following from the Roberts et al. (2006b) critique, apparently a better characterization of age effects relevant to old age is needed. Marsh, Martin, and Jackson (2010) offered an alternative perspective on aging based on multiple dimensions of physical self-concept for late-adolescents (16 -19; M \u03ed 17) and older adults (52-93; M \u03ed 63). Their Physical Self Description Questionnaire was designed to measure nine specific physical factors (Health, Coordination, Activity, Body Fat, Sport, Appearance, Strength, Flexibility, Endurance) and two global factors (Global Physical, Global Esteem) . Factor analyses demonstrated a well-defined factor structure that was invariant over gender and age. Age differences, not surprisingly, showed that the older adults had worse scores on all nine specific physical factors (particularly Sport, Endurance, Health, and Body Fat). Interestingly, however, the older adults had Global Physical self-concepts that were as good as or slightly better than those of the adolescent age group and significantly higher levels of Global Esteem. The authors speculated that as people grow older, their physical attributes decline, and they are generally aware of this, as reflected in lower ratings on the nine specific factors. However, they also become more accepting of these effects and develop strategies to protect their sense of self that leads to positive and resilient self-esteem (e.g., Alaphilippe, 2008; Brandtst\u00e4dter & Greve, 1994; Carstensen & Freund, 1994) . Furthermore, self-concept is highly dependent on frame of reference effects as well as other standards. Indeed, specific physical self-concept factors are closely tied to actual performances so that they are strongly influenced by declines in these objective external standards, and they show some decline with age. However, for global self-esteem and, to a lesser extent, the global physical self-concept scale, respondents have a lot more flexibility in operationalizing the frame of reference-using social comparison processes such as comparisons with others of a similar age. This suggests that these older participants understand that they have diminished attributes in many physical areas but apparently have come to terms with these differences in how they think about themselves globally; they become more content with themselves even though physical attributes are declining.\nThese heuristic speculations about the juxtaposition of age, global self-esteem, and specific components of the physical selfconcept may also have relevance to changes in FFA factors for older adults. In particular, existing research with older adults has not supported hard or soft plaster hypotheses, and support for the maturity effect has been limited largely to late adolescence and early adulthood. Thus, for example, the Roberts et al. (2006a Roberts et al. ( , 2006b ) meta-analyses, as well as the Terracciano et al. (2005) primary study, showed that Conscientiousness, Openness, Neuroticism, and Extraversion decreased during old age, whereas Agreeableness increased substantially. Similarly, Donnellan and Lucas's (2008) results suggested that the initially increasing levels of Conscientiousness may in fact start to decrease following the age of 50. Consistent with these observed differences in FFA factors and suggestions from the Marsh, Martin, and Jackson (2010) self-concept study, individuals appear to become more self-content in old age-what we here refer to as the la dolce vita effect.\nIn Italy, the expression la dolce vita is used to describe the soft, slow, enjoyable, happy, and self-indulgent traditional Italian way of life. Literally, la dolce vita thus means \"the sweet life.\" Interestingly, dolce also means dessert, which is relevant to the present proposition since the dessert is the last, and often happiest or at least sweetest, part of the meal. In Italy, one way that la dolce vita manifests itself in old age is through the increased attachment of seniors citizens to their own city or village, where they are content to spend long afternoons in the shade, talking with longtime friends, without ever feeling the need to visit neighbors that are from adjacent cities or counties. This interpretation is consistent with the observed results from FFA research showing that people become more agreeable and emotionally stable with age but also become more laid back, satisfied with themselves and what they have, and thus seem to feel less the need to reach out for more-in other words, less socially outgoing and extraverted, and more introverted as well as less conscientious-perhaps because as people start to enjoy life, they also become less preoccupied with productivity.\nSupport for the la dolce vita effect also comes from research showing that older people report fewer negative interpersonal interactions than do younger people (i.e., they are more agreeable) and that when they do, they also report less negative affect (e.g., Almeida, 2005; Birditt & Fingerman, 2005; Lefkowitz & Fingerman, 2003) . We also note that this la dolce vita effect is apparently consistent with emerging research showing that most forms of mood, anxiety, behavioral, substance abuse, and personality disorders tend to decrease past the age of 50 or 60 and that the onset of these problems in old age is rare (e.g., Degenhardt et al., 2008; ESEMeD/MHEDEA-2000 Investigators, 2004a , 2004b Grant et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2009; H. J. Jackson, & Burgess, 2000; Kessler et al., 2007 Kessler et al., , 2005 Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007) . Because there is not a lot of methodologically rigorous research comparing developmental changes in FFA factors across the entire age span from adolescence to late adulthood-and particularly old age-this is a specific focus of the present investigation."}, {"section_title": "Taxonomy of Measurement Invariance Models: Implications for Applied Research", "text": "In psychological research, comparisons of group means (and even relations between variables) are based on typically implicit, untested assumptions about measurement invariance. A particularly important application of CFA techniques has been to test the assumptions about the invariance of the FFA factor structure over multiple groups or over time (Gustavsson et al., 2008; Nye, Roberts, Saucier, & Zhou, 2008; Reise et al., 2001) . Unless the underlying factors really do reflect the same construct and the measurements themselves are operating in the same way (across groups, over age and time, or across different levels of continuous variables), mean differences and other comparisons are likely to be invalid. Important issues for applied research are the implications for failures of these tests of invariance-in relation to the development of measurement instruments and the interpretation of results based on well-established measures. Although these concerns are known to many developmental researchers, they are frequently ignored in applied research. In FFA research there are few studies that address these issues, and they apparently are not well understood by applied researchers in this field.\nTaxonomy of invariance. Marsh et al. (2009) introduced a taxonomy of 13 ESEM models (see Table 1 ) designed to test measurement invariance. Within the ESEM framework, the applied developmental and personality researcher has access to typical parameter estimates, standard errors, goodness-of-fit statistics, and statistical advances normally associated with CFA/SEMs (see Marsh et al., 2009) . Importantly, ESEM allows applied FFA researchers to pursue appropriate tests of measurement invariance when CFA models are not appropriate. This taxonomy of invariance tests (see Table 1 ) integrates factor analysis (e.g., J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1988; Marsh, 1994 Marsh, , 2007 Marsh & Grayson, 1994) and measurement invariance (e.g., Meredith, 1964 Meredith, , 1993 Meredith & Teresi, 2006) traditions to evaluate full measurement invariance: configural invariance (all parameters are freely estimated in all groups; Model 1 in Table 1 ); weak measurement invariance (factor loadings are invariant; Model 2), strong measurement invariance (invariance of factor loadings and item intercepts; Model 5), strict measurement invariance (invariance of factor loadings, item intercepts, and item uniquenesses; Model 7). This taxonomy expands this measurement invariance tradition to include tests of latent means invariance and of the factor variance-covariance matrix and various combinations of invariance constraints across different sets of model parameters (see the remaining models in Table 1 ). Although these tests require full invariance of all parameter estimates for all groups, Byrne, Shavelson, and Muth\u00e9n (1989) argued for the usefulness of a less demanding test of partial invariance in which a subset of parameters are not constrained to be invariant.\nConsequences of a lack for invariance. Tests of the invariance of factor loadings (weak measurement invariance; Model 2) are particularly important both in terms of relating FFA factors to other constructs for different groups with cross-sectional data and for evaluating patterns of relations among variables in the same group over time with longitudinal data. Indeed, all models except the configural invariance model (Model 1) assume the invariance of factor loadings. Unless the factor loadings are reasonably invariant over occasions or groups, any comparisons must be considered suspect, as the constructs themselves differ (i.e., the apples and oranges problem). However, if there is a sufficient number of items, tests of partial invariance might be warranted such that invariance of factor loadings is supported for almost all the items for each factor. Such tests of invariance might also be on the basis of selecting items to be retained in the early stages of instrument development.\nIf applied researchers want to compare latent mean differences across groups or over time, then tests of item intercept invariance (strong measurement invariance; Model 5) are critical in addition to factor loading invariance. For example, assume for six items designed to measure a particular trait, three clearly favor women and three clearly favor men. These results provide no basis for evaluating gender differences in the trait in that even the direction of gender differences would depend on the particular items used to measure the trait. Furthermore, because these six items are only a small sample of items that could be used to evaluate this trait, the results provide only a weak basis for knowing what would happen if a larger, more diverse sample of items was sampled. Support for the invariance of item intercepts would mean that gender differences based on each of the items considered separately is reasonably consistent in terms of magnitude as well as direction. These results would provide a stronger basis of support for the generalizability of the interpretation of the observed gender differences. Although issues of noninvariance of item intercepts and differential item functioning are well known and evident in some FFA measures (e.g., Costa et al., 2001; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) , these issues have been largely ignored in FFA research (but see J. J. Jackson et al., 2009; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Nye et al., 2008; Reise et al., 2001 )-due in large part to the apparent inappropriateness of CFA to FFA research (Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) . In summary, a lack of invariance of item intercepts would mean that the observed group differences are not consistent across even the items used to represent a latent factor on a particular instrument and provide no basis for the generalizability of the results across a wider and more diverse set of items that could be used to represent the trait.\nIn order to compare FFA (manifest) scale scores (or factor scores), then, the invariance of items' uniquenesses also represents an important prerequisite (strict measurement invariance; Model 7). Indeed, the presence of differences in reliability (as represented or absorbed in the item uniquenesses) across the multiple groups could distort mean differences on the observed scores. However, for comparisons based on latent constructs that are corrected for measurement error, the valid comparison of latent means only requires support for strong measurement invariance and not the additional assumption of the invariance of measurement error. Hence, comparison of group mean differences based on latentvariable models like those considered here makes fewer assumptions than do those based on manifest scores.\nA lack of invariance in relations between factors does not compromise comparisons of latent mean differences over time or groups. However, particularly for multifactorial constructs like the FFA factors, the pattern of relations among factors might have important practical or theoretical implications. Furthermore, interpretations are likely to be complicated by heterogeneity of relations between FFA factor and other variables. In more complex models, the invariance of other parameter estimates (e.g., correlated uniquenesses or path coefficients) may also be relevant as a test of the generalizability of the results.\nIssues of invariance have a long history in the development and application of standardized achievement tests in educational settings. Here issues such as differential item functioning-a lack of invariance-are evaluated routinely and even mandated by legal concerns (i.e., that tests are equally predictive for different groups). Although these issues are not considered so widely in the measurement of psychological constructs such as FFA factors, increasing methodological sophistication and the availability of appropriate statistical tools means that these approaches are likely to become more widely used. However, standards of best practice are still evolving-particularly in relation to what constitutes acceptable levels of invariance and partial invariance. An interesting perspective for applied research might be to evaluate how robust key parameter estimates and interpretations are to invariance assumptions. Thus, for example, if critical interpretations are similar for fully and partially invariant models, then applied researchers can have confidence in the appropriateness of the conclusions. However, if the interpretations change fundamentally for fully and partially invariant models, then interpretations should be made with appropriate caution. Thus, as in all applied research, the researcher has an obligation to interrogate the appropriateness of conclusions."}, {"section_title": "The Present Investigation: A SubstantiveMethodological Synergy", "text": "Despite substantial research on how FFA manifest means (e.g., scale scores or factor scores) are related to age, gender, and their interaction, these FFA developmental studies are typically methodologically weak. In particular, they often rely on the interpretation of mean differences based on manifest scale scores rather than latent variable models allowing correction for potentially complex structures of measurement error and the evaluation of measurement invariance assumptions implicit in such comparisons. Here we demonstrate ESEM-an integration of EFA, CFA, and SEM that has the potential to overcome many of the overly restrictive assumptions of CFA (that have led some to reject CFA as appropriate for FFA research) and limitations of EFA. In one of the first applications of ESEM to FFA research based on responses by late-adolescents to the 60-item NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al. (2010;  but also see Dolan et al., 2009 , for similar conclusions) found that (a) ESEM fitted the data better and resulted in substantially more differentiated (less correlated) factors than did CFA; (b) full measurement invariance of the ESEM factor structure over gender, showing that women score higher on all NEO Big Five factors, was supported; and (c) measurement invariance over 2 years and the maturity principle in late adolescence (decreases in Neuroticism but increases in Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness) were supported. Based on ESEM, they addressed substantively important questions with broad applicability to psychological research that could not be appropriately addressed with traditional approaches to either EFA or CFA. In the present investigation, we expanded this application of ESEM to the methodologically demanding task of comparing FFA factors across the entire adolescent to old age span (ages 15-99), as well as extended ESEM in a number of ways that have important substantive and methodological implications.\nOur study is based on a large, nationally representative, crosssectional sample (N \u03ed 14,021) that covers the entire lateadolescent to very old life span (ages 15-99). Methodologically, we began by comparing CFA and ESEM factor structures to test 6 the prediction that ESEM results in a better fit and smaller correlations among FFA factors than does CFA. We extended the ESEM model to test the full measurement invariance of the FFA factors over gender (based on the 13-model taxonomy presented in Table 1 ), evaluate a descriptive model of linear and nonlinear age effects on latent ESEM factors with a multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, and then combine the MIMIC and gender invariance models to test the invariance of age effects over gender. Next, we formed six groups-representing all combinations of two gender (male, female) and three age (young, middle, old) groupsand tested measurement invariance across these six groups. In evaluating this multigroup invariance model, we introduced an ESEM-within-CFA strategy that greatly enhanced the flexibility of ESEM and allowed us to partition latent mean differences into tests of age (linear and nonlinear), gender, and interaction effects. Finally, we extended the MIMIC/multiple-group hybrid approach by adding MIMIC age effects (linear and quadratic) to the genderage multiple-group models. In this way, we estimated the combined effects of age-based on continuous age (MIMIC) and multiple age groups-and their interaction with gender.\nSubstantively, and consistent with previous research, we expected women to score higher than men on Neuroticism and Agreeableness and, perhaps, on Conscientiousness and Extraversion. However, we had no clear basis for predicting how gender differences would vary across such a wide age span. Based on the productive-maturity principle, we expected that particularly during the late adolescent and early adult years there would be decreases in Neuroticism and increases in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, but we anticipated that these differences would not extend into old age. Based on the la dolce vita effect in old age, we expected our oldest participants to be more self-content, selfcentered, less preoccupied with productivity, more laid back, and happier, as represented by decreases in Openness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness but increases in Agreeableness. As a substantive-methodological synergy, we addressed these substantively important questions with new, evolving, and apparently stronger methodology than has previous FFA research and demonstrated its broad applicability to developmental and psychological research more generally. Finally, we concluded with a discussion of limitations of the present investigation, including reliance on a cross-sectional design (and resulting caveats in relation to interpretations), personality assessment based on FFA self-report measures, and complications when responses are not fully invariant over covariates."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample and Materials", "text": "In the nationally representative British Household Panel Study (BHPS), households were selected using a multistage probability design in which all household members of ages 16 and older were asked to participate. In Wave 15 of the BHPS, which is the basis of our study, FFA measures were administered in a selfcompletion format in late 2005 and 2006. The participants (N \u03ed 14,021; 54% women; ages 15-99, M \u03ed 47, SD \u03ed 19) completed the 15-item FFA instrument (Taylor, Brice, Buck, & PrenticeLane, 2009 ; also see Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006; John & Srivastava, 1999; Rammstedt & John, 2007) in which three items were used to infer each factor using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (does not apply) to 7 (applies perfectly). For more details, see the BHPS technical manual (Taylor et al., 2009 ) and the online supplements.\nConsistent with the brevity of the scales, coefficient alpha reliabilities for the FFA factors based on these data were .67 (Neuroticism), .68 (Openness), .54 (Extraversion), .53 (Agreeableness), and .53 (Conscientiousness). However, reliability varies in part with the number of items, and FFA instruments typically have much longer scales that are only moderately reliable (e.g., Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) . In addition, the few retained items are intended to maximally cover broad constructs in line with the original FFA approach; this also might lead to lowered internal consistency in combination with the small number of items but is necessary to capture the relatively broad FFA domains. In fact, the psychometric properties of this short form and its abilities to adequately cover broad FFA constructs has been well documented in previous research (e.g., Taylor et al., 2009 ; also see Donnellan et al., 2006; John & Srivastava, 1999; Rammstedt & John, 2007) . If the items were narrower in content, alpha might be higher, but the content of the FFA domains would not be covered as well by the short form. We also note that according to the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula, the reliability estimates for the full NEO-FFI instrument would be of a similar size if based on only three items. Thus, for example, when the reliability of a three-item test is .5, the estimated reliability of an equivalent 12-item test (the number of items on the NEO-FFI) is .80. Reliability estimates for the 12-item NEO scales typically vary from the mid .70s to the mid .80s (e.g., Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) . Hence, reliabilities observed here are reasonable in relation to other research after taking into consideration the number of items per scale. Of course, given the modest reliability, it is important to base conclusions on latent-variable models that correct for unreliability.\nFor all but Openness, there were two positively worded items and one negatively worded item in each factor (all Openness items were positively worded). In each case, the negatively worded item had the lowest item-total correlation (although all items-total correlations were positive following inversion of these items), and for the Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion factors, the elimination of the negatively worded item would have resulted in a slightly higher estimate of reliability. Consistent with these observations, preliminary results suggested a response bias associated with negatively worded items that is common in self-report instruments (e.g., Bagozzi, 1993; Corwyn, 2000; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1996 ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "All analyses in the present investigation were conducted with Mplus 5.2 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2008) . The main focus was on the application of ESEM to responses to the 15 FFA items. Preliminary analyses consisted of a traditional CFA based on the Mplus robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator with standard errors and tests of fit that are robust in relation to nonnormality and nonindependence of observations (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2008) . The ESEM approach differs from the typical CFA approach in that all factor loadings are estimated, subject to constraints necessary for identification (for further details, see Marsh et al., 2009) . Although there are many methodological and strategic advantages to independent cluster models of confirmatory factor analysis (ICM-CFAs), these models typically do not provide an acceptable fit to the data. In related research, Marsh (2007; Marsh, Hau, & Grayson, 2005) argued that few multidimensional assessment instruments met even minimal standards of goodness of fit based on CFA. Part of the problem, we argue, is undue reliance on overly restrictive ICM-CFAs in which each item is hypothesized to load on one and only one factor. This failure to achieve acceptable levels of fit has led to many compensatory strategies that are dubious, counterproductive, misleading, or simply wrong (e.g., analysis of item parcels). Furthermore, the misspecification of factor loadings (constraining them to be zero when they are not) usually leads to distorted factors with overestimated factor correlations that might lead to biased estimates in structural equation models (SEMs) incorporating other outcome variables Marsh et al., 2009; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010 . T. A. Schmitt & Sass, 2011 . Indeed, even when CFA does provide an acceptable fit to the data, ESEM not only provides a better fit but also results in latent factors that are much more differentiated (i.e., less correlated). This is not surprising in that ESEM uses two estimates of overlap between factors (overlap in factor loadings and correlation between factors), whereas CFA uses one estimate (correlation between factors).\nFollowing Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al. (2010) , we used an oblique geomin rotation (the default in Mplus) with an epsilon value of .5. There were few missing responses (less than 1%), that were handled with the full-information MLR estimator to correct for missing data. Because of the design of the BHPS, in which respondents are clustered within households, we used the Mplus complex survey design option to control the clustered design and adjust standard errors. Sampling weights were also taken into account in the analyses.\nIn general, the use of ex post facto correlated uniquenesses (CUs) should be avoided (e.g., Marsh, 2007) , but there are some circumstances in which a priori CUs should be included (J\u00f6reskog, 1979; . For self-report surveys that include a mixture of positively and negatively worded items, it is typical to find method effects associated with item wording (Marsh, Scalas, & Nagengast, 2010) . In the present application, four out of 15 items (one each for four of the five factors) were negatively worded. We thus adopted a standard, a priori approach to address this potential artifact by specifying CUs relating the responses to each of these negatively worded items (e.g., Marsh, 1996) . In preliminary analyses, we compared solutions with and without these CUs to evaluate the appropriateness of this strategy.\nMultigroup tests of invariance and latent mean differences. Tests of invariance and latent mean differences pursued here are based on the taxonomy of invariance tests (see Table 1 and earlier discussion). Multigroup tests of invariance typically consist of comparisons across only two groups or, possibly, more than two groups that represent different levels of the same variable (e.g., multiple age groups). However, the logic of this strategy is easily extended to include all combinations of groups representing two or more variables. Although mean comparisons based on such groups are typical in analysis of variance studies based on manifest variables, these comparisons are also based on the assumption of strict invariance (i.e., loadings, intercepts, uniquenesses) across all groups reflecting the main effects of both variables and their interaction. These assumptions-particularly in relation to groups formed by the interaction of two or more variables, are rarely tested, and there is little basis for knowing how robust the conclusions are in relation to these untested assumptions. Although this has apparently not been previously verified in published FFA research, we demonstrate an extension of the multiple-group ESEM model to test invariance across six groups representing all combinations of the two genders and three age categories: 15-30 (n \u03ed 3,194; M \u03ed 22.5, SD \u03ed 4.5), 31-60 (n \u03ed 7,211; M \u03ed 45.1, SD \u03ed 8.6), 61-99 (n \u03ed 3,678; M \u03ed 72.1, SD \u03ed 7.8). These categories correspond to roughly late-adolescent/young adulthood, middle age, and older age categories and have been considered in previous research. Thus, for example, 30 is the age at which Costa and McCrae (1994) proposed that personality becomes set like plaster, whereas 60\u03e9 is the upper age category considered by a number of previous studies (e.g., Allemand et al., 2007; Terracciano et al., 2005) and the age at which Roberts et al. (2006b) noted that there was a dearth of research, although such analyses have the obvious limitation that the continuous age variable is divided into broad categories with a potentially serious loss of information. Here we introduce a MIMIC/multigroup hybrid model to address this problem.\nMIMIC/multiple-group hybrid model of age effects (see the Supplemental Materials for further discussion). For studies of age differences in FFA factors, the tests of invariance become even more complex in that age is a continuous variable rather that a natural categorical variable with a few discrete groups (like gender). There are traditionally two approaches to this problem. The MIMIC model regresses the latent variables (the FFA factors) onto other variables (continuous like age, or categorical like gender). However, only the invariance of factor means and item intercepts (by the addition of direct effects between the covariate and the items) can be tested. In the multiple-group approach, it is possible to pursue the more rigorous tests of invariance presented in Table 1 . However, for continuous variables, these tests require researchers to transform continuous variables into a relatively small number of categories that constitute the multiple groups. Marsh, Tracey, and Craven (2006) proposed a hybrid approach involving an integration of interpretations based on both MIMIC and multiple-group approaches. Here we extended this approach in several ways: demonstrating how the MIMIC and multiplegroup approaches can both be incorporated into a single ESEM model, adding the MIMIC age (linear and quadratic effects) variables to the multiple-group model (based on gender-age groups). This allowed us to evaluate more formally whether information in the continuous age effects is lost by forming age categories and, if so, to estimate the combined age effects due to both operationalizations of age (continuous and categorical). The interaction between gender and age is substantively important to interpretations of both gender and age effects. Although tests of invariance have rarely been applied to the interaction of two variables, we illustrate how the use of ESEM to the hybrid integration of multiple-group and MIMIC models can be extended to include interactions between variables.\nESEM-within-CFA model (see the Supplemental Materials for further discussion). Despite the flexibility of the ESEM approach, we note that there are some aspects and extensions of traditional SEM models that cannot readily be implemented with ESEM as currently operationalized in Mplus (e.g., constraints on group specific correlations among factors, partial invariance of 8 MARSH, NAGENGAST, AND MORIN factor loadings, tests of higher order factor models, latent curve models based on multiple manifest indicators of the longitudinal construct, partially invariant factor mixture models; also see Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2009) . Of particular relevance to the present investigation, applied researchers cannot easily place constraints on latent means estimated in multiple-group models to test linear and nonlinear effects based on a single grouping variable (e.g., age) or the interaction between two grouping variables (e.g., Age \u03eb Gender interactions). Here we propose an extension of the ESEM approach to address this limitation-what we refer to as ESEM-within-CFA models. Although not a major focus of the present investigation, this ESEM-within-CFA strategy can easily be applied to many other situations in which CFA models cannot be evaluated with ESEM, thus further enhancing the flexibility of ESEM.\nGoodness of fit. CFA/SEM research typically focuses on the ability of a priori models to fit the data as summarized by sample size independent fit indices (e.g., Marsh, 2007; Marsh, Balla, & Hau, 1996; Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1988; Marsh, Hau, & Grayson, 2005) . Here we consider the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and the comparative fit index (CFI), as operationalized in Mplus in association with the MLR estimator (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2008) . We also considered the robust chi-square test statistic and evaluation of parameter estimates. For the TLI and CFI, values greater than .90 and .95 are typically interpreted to reflect acceptable and excellent fit to the data, respectively. For the RMSEA, values of less than .05 and .08 are typically interpreted to reflect a close fit and a reasonable fit to the data, respectively (Marsh, Hau, & Wen, 2004) . However, we emphasize that these cutoff values constitute only rough guidelines (Marsh, 2007; ; also see Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998) . Furthermore, because there are few applications of ESEM-and none that fully evaluate the appropriateness of the traditional CFA indices of fit-the relevance of these CFA indices and the proposed cutoff values are not clear (Marsh et al., 2009) .\nIt is typically more useful to compare the relative fit of different models in a nested or partially nested taxonomy of models designed a priori to evaluate particular aspects of interest than to compare the relative fit of single models (Marsh, 2007; Marsh et al., 2009) . Any two models are nested so long as the set of parameters estimated in the more restrictive model is a subset of the parameters estimated in the less restrictive model. This comparison can be based on a chi-square difference test, but this test suffers the same problems as the chi-square test that led to the development of fit indices (see Marsh et al., 1998) . For this reason, researchers have posited a variety of ad hoc guidelines to evaluate when differences in fit are sufficiently large to reject a more parsimonious model (i.e., the more highly constrained model with fewer estimated parameters) in favor of a more complex model. It has been suggested that support for the more parsimonious model requires a change in CFI of less than .01 (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) or a change in RMSEA of less than .015 (Chen, 2007) . Marsh (2007) noted that some indices (e.g., TLI and RMSEA) incorporate a penalty for parsimony so that the more parsimonious model can fit the data better than a less parsimonious model (i.e., the gain in parsimony is greater than the loss in fit). Hence, a more conservative guideline is that the more parsimonious model is supported if TLI or RMSEA is as good as or better than that for the more complex model. Nevertheless, all these proposals should be considered as rough guidelines or rules of thumb."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FFA Factor Structure: ESEM vs. CFA", "text": "The starting point for the present investigation was to test our a priori hypothesis that the ESEM model provides a better fit to FFA responses than does a traditional CFA model in which items are constrained to have zero factor loadings on all factors but the one that each was designed to measure (hereafter referred to as the independent clusters model, or ICM-CFA). Indeed, as emphasized by Marsh et al. (2009) , the ESEM analysis is predicated on the assumption that ESEM performs noticeably better than does the ICM-CFA model in terms of goodness of fit (see Table 2 ) and construct validity of the interpretation of the factor structure.\nIn our study, the ICM-CFA solution did not provide an acceptable fit to the data (TLI \u03ed .687; CFI \u03ed .761; RMSEA \u03ed .076; see TGCFA1A in Table 2 ). The next model incorporated a priori CUs (to control for method effects associated with negatively worded item; see earlier discussion); results were still inadequate, albeit improved (TLI \u03ed .722; CFI \u03ed .804; RMSEA \u03ed .072; see TGCFA1B in Table 2 ). Apparently, all existing standards of acceptable fit would lead to the rejection of the ICM-CFA model. The corresponding ESEM solutions fitted the data much better. Although the fit of the model with no a priori CUs was marginal (TGESEM1A: TLI \u03ed .889; CFI \u03ed .958; RMSEA \u03ed .045), the inclusion of CUs resulted in a much better fit to the data (TGESEM2A: TLI \u03ed .948; CFI \u03ed .983; RMSEA \u03ed .031).\nIt is also instructive to compare parameter estimates based on the ICM-CFA and ESEM solutions (see Table 3 ). In both models, the main factor loadings tended to be modest, with few loadings greater than .8 and some factor loadings less than .5. Although CFA factor loadings (M \u03ed .60, Mdn \u03ed .63) were somewhat higher than for the ESEM model (M \u03ed .57, Mdn \u03ed .56), the differences were typically very small and the pattern of factor loadings was similar for the CFA and ESEM solutions. However, the R 2 estimates of communalities were slightly higher for the ESEM solution (M \u03ed .44, Mdn \u03ed .43) than for the CFA solution (M \u03ed .40, Mdn \u03ed .40). Again, however, the pattern of results was highly similar. We also note that the factor loadings associated with the negatively worded items were consistently lower than those of the positively worded items (the same pattern was evident in the unreported models without CUs, consistent with preliminary analyses of coefficient alpha estimates).\nA detailed evaluation of the factor correlations among the FFA factors demonstrates a critical advantage of the ESEM approach over the ICM-CFA approach. Although patterns of correlations were similar, the CFA factor correlations (-.17 to \u03e9.68; M absolute value \u03ed .33, Mdn absolute value \u03ed .38) were larger than the ESEM factor correlations (-.07 to \u03e9.41; M absolute value \u03ed .16, Mdn absolute value \u03ed .16). Thus, for example, the correlation between Agreeableness and Conscientiousness was \u03e9.40 for the CFA but only \u03e9.10 for the ESEM. In this respect, the ESEM solution is more consistent with a priori predictions (see McCrae et al., 1996) that CFA factor correlations are positively biased by the failure to include cross-loading as in the ESEM solution."}, {"section_title": "BIG-FIVE FACTORS", "text": "In summary, the ESEM solution is clearly superior to the CFA solution, both in terms of fit and in the distinctiveness of the factors that is consistent with predictions based on the FFA. The comparison of results from these two models provides the initial and most important test for the appropriateness of the ESEM model-at least relative to the CFA model. It is also important to emphasize that the goodness of fit for the ESEM model is apparently much better than what has typically been achieved in previous attempts to analyze the FFA through CFAs conducted at the item level. Because the fit of the CFA model is so bad, it would be inappropriate to pursue analyses based on this model and even more dubious to base analyses on manifest scale scores computed on the implicit assumption that the fit of this CFA model is acceptable. Hence, this is clearly a demonstration of why ESEM might be so important to FFA research, as well as psychological and social science research more generally.\n\nFinally, we are now in a position to address the invariance of the latent factor means across all six groups that is a major focus of our study. Submodels MAG10p-MAG13p each tested the invariance of latent means in combination with the invariance of other parameter estimates. However, for each pair of models, the fit of the model positing no latent mean differences was systematically poorer than the corresponding model in which latent mean differences were freely estimated: differences in CFI (.077 to .082) and TLI (.075 to .089) based on comparisons of submodels MAG10p vs. MAG5p, MAG11p vs. MAG7p, MAG12p vs. MAG8p, and MAG13p vs. MAG 9p. Hence, there is clear evidence that the latent means differed systematically across these six age-gender groups. Thus, we retained Model MAG7p (partial strict invariance) as the final model. The results from this model are presented in the second column of Figure 1 and in the left-hand section of Table 7 . However, the pattern of results was nearly identical for all four profiles.\nIt is also relevant to evaluate the consistency of the mean differences based on this multigroup approach with earlier results based on the MIMIC model, particularly given that the two approaches are based on very different assumptions. In order to facilitate comparisons, we also included the results from the preceding MIMIC Gender \u03eb Age2 model, which included five terms (age-linear, age-quadratic, gender, Gender \u03eb Age-Linear and Gender \u03eb Age-Quadratic), in the first column of Figure 1 and on the right-hand section of Table 7 . For both models, group differences from each approach were transformed into standard deviation units so that mean differences are in terms of typical effect sizes. Graphs of the results from the multiple-group approach (see Figure 1) show essentially the same pattern of results as already presented for the MIMIC approach. Visually, these graphs demonstrate that the estimated effects for both groups are very similar, adding confidence in the interpretations based on each approach. This suggests that-at least in this application-the MIMIC approach is apparently reasonably robust in relation to its implicit untestable invariance assumptions, while the multiple-group approach is reasonably robust in relation to information lost in forming age categories from the continuous age values. Note. All analyses were weighted by the appropriate weighting factor and based on a complex design option to account for nesting within families. CFI \u03ed comparative fit index; TLI \u03ed Tucker-Lewis index; RMSEA \u03ed root-mean-square error of approximation; CUs \u03ed a priori correlated uniquenesses based on the negatively worded items; FL \u03ed factor loadings; Uniq \u03ed item uniquenesses; p (as in MAG3p) \u03ed partial invariance; FVCV \u03ed factor variancescovariances; Inter \u03ed item intercepts; FMn \u03ed factor means. a In preliminary analyses, we found that correlated uniquenesses among negatively worded items were needed and that these were invariant over the six groups (see earlier discussion in relation to gender), and so all models presented in this table are based on this structure. b In models with invariances of uniqueness, additional models with partial invariance were tested. In Model MAG3p, 16 of 90 (15 items \u03eb 6 groups \u03ed 90) uniquenesses were freed such that values for men and women in the oldest group were constrained to be equal to each other but not for those from the other four groups. In addition, B5A1R was freed for women in the middle-age group. This pattern of partial invariance of uniquenesses was used in all subsequent models with variance constraints on uniquenesses.\nc In models with invariances of intercepts, additional models with partial invariance were tested. In Model MAG5p, 21 of 90 (15 items \u03eb 6 groups \u03ed 90) intercepts were freed that were constrained in the model with full intercept invariance. This pattern of partial invariance of uniquenesses was used in all subsequent models with variance constraints on uniquenesses."}, {"section_title": "Invariance Over Gender", "text": "How similar is the FFA structure for men and women? Are there systematic gender differences in latent means, and are the underlying assumptions met to justify interpretations of these results? To address these questions, we applied the taxonomy of 13 ESEM models described earlier (see Table 1 ). However, application of this taxonomy of models is complicated by two features that are partially idiosyncratic to this application: the a priori CUs and tests of partial invariance of item intercepts (Byrne et al., 1989) . The results already presented based on the total sample indicate that a priori CUs are necessary to achieve even a good fit to the data. However, it is also important to determine the extent to which these a priori CUs are invariant over gender and how these influence the behavior of the various models.\nThe two-group model with no invariance constraints (MG1A in Table 4 ) provides a marginal fit to the data (TLI \u03ed .889, CFI \u03ed .958; see Table 4 ). However, consistent with earlier results, the inclusion of the set of a priori CUs substantially improves the fit (TLI \u03ed .942, CFI \u03ed .981; MG1B). Importantly, constraining these a priori CUs to be invariant over gender (MG1C in Table 4 ) resulted in almost no change in fit. For fit indices that control for parsimony, the fit is essentially unchanged or slightly better for MG1C than MG1B (.942 to .944 for TLI; .033 to .032 for RMSEA). For the CFI that is monotonic with parsimony, the change (.981 to .980) is clearly less than the .01 value typically used to support invariance constraints. These results are substantively important, demonstrating that the sizes of the six a priori CUs are reasonably invariant over gender. A similar pattern is also evident in MG2 (factor loadings invariant) and MG3 (factor loadings and uniquenesses invariant). The consistency of this pattern of results over the different models provides support for the inclusion of these a priori CUs. Thus, in order to facilitate communication of the results, we subsequently focused primarily on models that included invariant CUs (models labeled C in Table 4 ; e.g., Model MG1C for Model 1).\nWeak factorial/measurement invariance tests whether the factor loadings are the same for men and women. Model MG2C (along with MG2A and MG2B) tested the invariance of factor loadings over gender. The critical comparison between the more parsimonious MG2C (with factor loadings invariant) and less parsimonious MG1C (with no factor loading invariance) supports the invariance of the factor loadings over gender: Fit indices that controlled for model parsimony were as good or better for the more parsimonious MG2C (TLI \u03ed .960 vs. .944, RMSEA \u03ed .028 vs. .032), whereas the difference in CFI that was monotonic with complexity was only slightly smaller (CFI \u03ed .977 vs. .980) and clearly less than the .01 difference typically used to argue for the less parsimonious model. We interpret these results to provide good support for weak measurement invariance-the invariance of factor loadings. Note. All analyses were weighted by the appropriate weighting factor and based on a complex design option to account for nesting within families. CFI \u03ed comparative fit index; TLI \u03ed Tucker-Lewis index; RMSEA \u03ed root-mean-square error of approximation; CFA \u03ed confirmatory factor analysis; CUs \u03ed a priori correlated uniquenesses based on the negatively worded items; ESEM \u03ed exploratory structural equation modeling; MIMIC \u03ed multiple indicators multiple causes; L \u03ed linear; Q \u03ed quadratic."}, {"section_title": "MARSH, NAGENGAST, AND MORIN", "text": "Strong measurement invariance requires that item intercepts-as well as factor loadings-be invariant over groups. The critical comparison was thus between Models MG2C and MG5C and tested whether differences in the 15 intercepts could be explained in terms of five latent means. The fit of MG5C (TLI \u03ed .946, CFI \u03ed .966) was reasonable but not as good as the fit of the corresponding MG2C (TLI \u03ed .960, CFI \u03ed .977). This suggests that gender differences at the level of items intercepts could not be fully explained in terms of the latent means (i.e., that there was evidence of differential item functioning). Because invariance of item intercepts is so central to the evaluation of latent mean differences, we pursued alternative tests of partial invariance of item intercepts. Based on (ex post facto) modifications in which we freed parameters one at a time, we identified four (of 15) item intercepts that contributed most to the misfit associated with the complete invariance of item intercepts in Model MG5Cp (the additional p indicating that there is partial rather than full invariance).\n1 The results supported partial invariance of item intercepts. For example, fit indices that controlled for parsimony were nearly the same for MG5Cp compared with MG2C (.960 vs. .960 for TLI, .027 vs. .027 for RMSEA), whereas the difference in CFIs (.975 vs. .977) was less than the .01 value that would have led to the rejection of constraints imposed in MG5Cp. However, the interpretation of these results is cautioned by the ex post facto nature of these modifications.\nStrict measurement invariance requires that item uniquenesses, item intercepts, and factor loadings all be invariant over the groups. Here, the critical comparison was between Models MG5Cp and MG7Cp. Model MG7Cp did provide evidence of a good fit to the data (TLI \u03ed .959, CFI \u03ed .972, RMSEA \u03ed .028) that was similar to that of MG5Cp. Furthermore, comparisons of all the 1 The four noninvariant items, and the intercepts for males (M) and females (F), were as follows: Openness Item 2 (M \u03ed 4.16, F \u03ed 4.61), Agreeableness Item 1 (M \u03ed 5.64, F \u03ed 6.00), Conscientiousness Item 1 (M \u03ed 5.27, F \u03ed 5.08), and Conscientiousness Item 2 (M \u03ed 5.08, F \u03ed 5.32). See Table 2 for wording of items. Note. The CFA and ESEM models each specified five factors (see Table 2 for goodness-of-fit statistics). All parameter estimates are completely standardized. N \u03ed 14,932 sets of ratings for the 15 Big Five items. Both models also included a set of a priori correlated uniquenesses, relating negatively worded items. CFA \u03ed confirmatory factor analysis; ESEM \u03ed exploratory structural equation modeling; TG (as in TGCFA1B) \u03ed total group; A\u03ed Agreeableness; C \u03ed Conscientiousness; E \u03ed Extraversion; N \u03ed Neuroticism; O \u03ed Openness; F1-F5 \u03ed Factors 1-5; R (as in A1R) \u03ed reverse-scored. Factor variance-covariance invariance is typically not a focus of measurement invariance but is frequently an important focus of studies of the invariance of covariance structures-particularly studies of the discriminant validity of multidimensional constructs that might subsequently be extended to include relations with other constructs. Although the comparison of correlations among FFA factors across groups is common, these are typically based on manifest scores that do not control for measurement error and make implicit invariance assumptions that are rarely tested. Here, the most basic comparison was between Models MG2C (factor loadings invariant) and MG4C (factor loadings and factor variances-covariances invariant). The results provided reasonable support for the additional invariance constraints, both in terms of the values for the fit indices and their comparison with MG2C. For example, fit indices that control for parsimony were nearly the same for MG4C compared with MG2C (.959 vs. .960 for TLI, .028 vs. .027 for RMSEA), whereas the differences in CFIs (.973 vs. .977) were less than the .01 cutoff value that would have led to the rejection of constraints imposed in the more parsimonious MG4C.\nFinally, we are now in a position to address the issue of the invariance of the factor means across the two groups. The final four models (MG10Cp-MG13Cp in Table 3 ) in the taxonomy all constrained mean differences between men and women to be zero-in combination with the invariance of other parameters. Again, several models could be used to test for gender mean invariance: (a) MG5Cp vs. MG10Cp, (b) MG7Cp vs. MG11Cp, (c) MG8Cp vs. MG12Cp, and (d) MG9Cp vs. MG13Cp. However, all these comparisons led to the conclusion that latent means representing the FFA factors differed systematically for men and women. Based on these results, we chose Model MG7Cp (see Table 4 ) as the best fitting model. Based on this model, latent means for women in standard deviation units were systematically higher than for men on Agreeableness (.27), Conscientiousness (.11), Extraversion (.30), and Neuroticism (.60) but lower for Openness (-.42). Note. All analyses were weighted by the appropriate weighting factor and based on a complex design option to account for nesting within families.

The observed gender differences were consistent with a priori predications. We now extend these analyses to evaluate age differences in the FFA factors and whether gender differences vary as a function of age.\nIn summary, the MIMIC approach provides convenient tests of the statistical significance for each of the effects of gender and age. For the multiple-group approach, it is also possible to construct contrasts on the latent mean differences to test these effects. For ESEM models this can be done by converting the ESEM model into a CFA model (see the online Supplemental Materials for a discussion of this ESEM-within-CFA conversion and contrasts as operationalized in Mplus). Because of the large sample sizes, almost all these effects were statistically significant. Nevertheless, there was a reasonably good correspondence between the direction and even the relative sizes of tests based on the multiple-group approach and those already evaluated with the MIMIC approach. We now integrate these two approaches-the multiple-group model and the MIMIC model-into a single analytic framework that overcomes some of the limitations of both approaches.\n"}, {"section_title": "MIMIC Models of Age, Gender, and Their Interaction", "text": "Do FFA factors change with age? Are these effects of age linear, or nonlinear? How do these age effects vary with gender? Is there support for the plaster hypotheses, maturity effects for adolescent and early adult ages, and/or the la dolce vita effect in old age? We address these questions with a set of three MIMIC models (see Tables 2 and 5 ). We began with models including only linear and quadratic components of age and then extended these to include gender and its interaction with age.\nMIMIC models of age effects. We began with the ESEM model based on the total group (TGESEM1B, in Table 1 ) and added linear and quadratic components of age to this model. This is a standard ESEM application, combining the ESEM approach with the traditional MIMIC model. Although the MIMIC model is limited in terms of testing invariance in relation to most parameters in the factor solution-particularly factor loadings-it allows for the verification of intercept invariance.\nWe began with a restrictive MIMIC model that included the linear and quadratic effects of age on each of the FFA factors (MIMICAge1). Age was based on a continuous score, and item intercepts were assumed to be completely invariant over age (no direct effects of age were specified on the FFA items). This means that linear and quadratic age effects on each indicator were fully explained by the age effects on the latent factors. The fit for this model was reasonable (MIMICAge1, Table 1: CFI \u03ed .966, TLI \u03ed .916, RMSEA \u03ed .037) but not perfect. In a second model, we used post hoc modification indices to evaluate partial invariance models. Based on these results, we freed the linear effects of age on three indicators. Hence, intercepts were completely invariant for two FFA factors and partially invariant for three FFA factors (i.e., one of three intercepts was freed for each of three factors). However, there was no evidence of partial invariance for the quadratic age effects. Allowing for partial invariance improved the fit of the model (MIMICAge2, Table 2: CFI \u03ed .976, TLI \u03ed .936, RMSEA \u03ed .032).\nIn the final MIMIC model with age effects, we constrained all of the quadratic effects of age on the FFA factors to be zero. The fit of this model was clearly worse (MIMICAge3, Table 2 : CFI \u03ed .964, TLI \u03ed .912, RMSEA \u03ed .037), demonstrating that there were nonlinear as well as linear relations between age and FFA factors. The detailed results from the final model (MIMICAge2) are reported in Table 5 and indicate that there were statistically significant linear age effects on all FFA factors (positive for Agreeableness; negative for Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness). However, there were also statistically significant nonlinear effects of age on all FFA factors (U-shaped for Agreeableness and Extraversion; inverted U-shaped for Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness). We return to these effects when we evaluate Age \u03eb Gender interactions in the next section.\nMIMIC models of age and gender effects. We next added three new effects to the previous ESEM-MIMIC models: the main effects of gender and the interactions between gender and the linear and quadratic components of age. Again, we began with a model that assumed the full invariance of the items intercepts (i.e., no effects of any of the covariates on FFA indicators that could not be explained in terms of FFA factors). The fit for this model was reasonable (MIMICAge \u03eb Gender1, Table 2 : CFI \u03ed .966, TLI \u03ed .924, RMSEA \u03ed .032), but the inclusion of partial invariance of item intercepts (freeing four paths of the 75 paths relating the five covariates to the 15 FFA indicators) resulted in a modestly improved fit to the data (MIMICAge \u03eb Gender2, Table 2 : CFI \u03ed .974, TLI \u03ed .940, RMSEA \u03ed .028). In the final MIMIC model, we constrained all of the Age \u03eb Gender interactions to be zero. This model provided a good fit to the data (MIMICAge \u03eb Gender3, Table  2 : CFI \u03ed .973, TLI \u03ed .945, RMSEA \u03ed .027). Indeed, fit indices that took into account parsimony were actually better for this model without interaction effects than the corresponding model with interaction effects. These results demonstrate that there were almost no Age \u03eb Gender interactions for these data.\nThe results from these models are reported in Table 5 and show that there were statistically significant gender differences for all FFA factors, with women scoring higher than men for Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism but lower for Openness. As gender is nearly orthogonal to age, the age effects are nearly identical to those already discussed. Graphs of these results are presented in Figure 1 and illustrate the sizes of these effects in standard deviation units. While there are clear gender differences (particularly for Neuroticism), they are not large relative to the age effects. Although there is some nonlinearity in the age effects, only for Conscientiousness is there a clear maximum or minimum where the effect of age changed direction. Of particular relevance, the results show that the age effects were essentially the same for men and women.\nThere are, of course, potentially serious limitations of the MIMIC models. In particular, they are based on the assumption of strict measurement invariance (Model 7 in Table 1 : the invariance of factor loadings, items intercepts, and uniquenesses in relation to the linear and nonlinear components of age, gender, and the linear and nonlinear Age \u03eb Gender interactions). Although it is possible, as we demonstrated, to test and relax the assumption of intercept invariances, it is not possible even to test the invariance of uniquenesses and factor loadings in a MIMIC model. For the main effects of gender, we have already demonstrated that there is reasonable support for the invariance of factor loadings and uniquenesses and at least partial invariance of the intercepts (see Table 4 ). Even though age is a continuous variable, it is possible to construct age groups and test the set of 13 invariance models (see Table 1 ) in relation to these groups. However, this would involve an obvious loss of information in transforming a continuous variable into discrete groups. Nevertheless, the invariance of parameter estimates in relation to the Age \u03eb Gender interaction effects is a potentially more difficult limitation to which we now turn."}, {"section_title": "Multiple-Group Models of Age, Gender, and Their Interaction", "text": "For the purposes of analyses in this section, we considered a multiple-group ESEM model with six groups representing all combinations of three age groups (young, middle, old) and two gender groups (male, female). Tests of invariance in relation to these six groups reflected the main and interaction effects of age (linear and quadratic) and gender. Latent means based on these groups were similar to those based on the MIMIC model already discussed but differ in two particularly important ways. First, this multiple-group approach is much more flexible in terms of testing the strict invariance assumptions implicit (but untestable) in the MIMIC model. Second, the multiple-group approach is based on age groups rather than age as a continuous variable. We return to a discussion of these differences after presenting the results.\nThe configural invariance model provided good support for the FFA model (Model MAG1, Table 6 : CFI \u03ed .979, TLI \u03ed .943, RMSEA \u03ed .034), and fit indices that controlled model parsimony were even better when factor loadings were constrained to be equal over the six age-gender groups in Model MAG2 (TLI \u03ed .950, RMSEA \u03ed .031). The invariance of uniquenesses for all 15 items across the six groups was not supported, but there was reasonable support for partial invariance (MAG3p: CFI \u03ed .957, TLI \u03ed .950, RMSEA \u03ed .031). This pattern of partial invariance of uniquenesses was used in all subsequent models with invariance constraints on uniquenesses. Similarly, although strong measurement invariance (Model 5)-complete invariance of all 15 intercepts across all six age-gender groups-was not supported, there was reasonable support for the partial invariance of intercepts (MAG5p: CFI \u03ed .957, TLI \u03ed .948, RMSEA \u03ed .032). Putting together these two sets of constraints, there was reasonable support for partial strict measurement invariance in relation to the complete invariance of the loadings, partial invariance of uniquenesses, and partial invariance of intercepts (MAG7p: CFI \u03ed .953, TLI \u03ed .948, RMSEA \u03ed .032). Note. Based on a hierarchical design, the linear age component is the standardized (M \u03ed 0, SD \u03ed 1) age, whereas the quadratic age component is the squared age component with the effect linear age partialed out (the quadratic component of age was not restandardized, so it is in the same metric as the linear age component). Gender (-1 \u03ed male, \u03e91 \u03ed female) was multiplied times the linear and age components to obtain the interaction terms. See Table  4 for a description of the six models and goodness-of-fit statistics. MIMIC \u03ed multiple indicator multiple cause; Est \u03ed unstandardized parameter estimate; L-Age \u03ed linear component of age; Q-Age \u03ed quadratic component of age.\nTests of the invariance of the latent factor variancecovariance matrix, as is the case with other comparisons, could be based on any pair of models in Table 6 that differed only in relation to the factor variance-covariance matrix being free or not. The most basic comparison (MAG4 vs. MAG1) suggests that support for invariance of the factor variance-covariance matrix is questionable (\u232cCFI \u03ed .016, \u232cTLI \u03ed .007). Other pairs of models in Table 6 that differed only in relation to the factor variance-covariance matrix being free or not also showed lack of support for the invariance of the factor variance-covariance matrix over time. However, because these parameters are not central to the comparison of FFA latent means across the six age-gender groups, we did not pursue a strategy of partial invariance. "}, {"section_title": "A Hybrid Model of Multiple-Group and MIMIC Models of Age, Gender, and Their Interaction", "text": "Thus far, starting with the ESEM model, we juxtaposed the results from the corresponding MIMIC and multiple-group models, using each to cross-validate the results of the other. Particularly when there is such good correspondence between the two, this visual comparison might be sufficient. However, we now combine the two approaches to form a hybrid model that integrates the advantages of both into a single model. We used this hybrid model to determine whether there were statistically significant and substantively meaningful differences from one that could not be explained by the other. In order to accomplish this, we added the MIMIC effects of age (linear and quadratic) to the six-group (three age groups and two gender groups) multiple-group model MAG7p (see Table 6 ).\nWe began by providing a more meaningful reference against which to compare results for models using this hybrid (MIMIC-MAG) approach based on two preliminary models. The first (MIMIC-MAG0 in Table 8 ) posited that there are no MIMIC age effects (age effects were included in the model but constrained to be zero). This provided a lower bound for subsequent models. The second (MIMIC-MAGS in Table 8 ) is a saturated model in which paths from linear and quadratic MIMIC-age variables to all 15 FFA indicators were freely Note.

The comparison to these two models is a critical comparison in that if the difference were small or nonsignificant, it would mean that no information was lost in using the age groups instead of the continuous age variable. Particularly the indices that control model parsimony suggest that the difference between these two models was not substantial (TLI \u03ed .932 vs. .948, RMSEA \u03ed .033 vs. .030). This implies that the MIMIC model with continuous age variables did not contribute much beyond what could be explained by the multiple-group model with discrete age categories.\nNext we explored what aspects of the MIMIC age variables were critical. In MIMIC-MAG1 we included only the effects of MIMIC L-Age and Q-Age effects on latent means that were freely estimated. In MIMIC-MAG2 we added the partial invariance of intercepts identified in previous MIMIC models (see MIMICAge2 in Table 2 ) and evaluated if these were invariant across the six Age \u03eb Gender groups in the next two models. The results from these models suggest that these effects were invariant across five of the six groups and had to be freed in one group (young men). In the MIMIC-MAG5 model, we constrained all MIMIC quadratic age effects to be zero. Particularly in relation to indices that control for parsimony, the fit for this model (MIMIC-MAG5: TLI \u03ed .944, RMSEA \u03ed .030) was as good as or better than the corresponding model that included freely estimated MIMIC quadratic effects of age (MIMIC-MAG4: TLI \u03ed .942, RMSEA \u03ed .030).\nIn the final models we explored various constraints on the MIMIC linear age effects. In previous MIMIC models we noted that there were little effects of Age \u03eb Gender interactions. In MIMIC-MAG6, we evaluated this possibility by constraining all the MIMIC age effects to be equal for men and women in the same age group. In support of this constraint, there was almost no change in the fit of the model. Next we constructed a reduced model in which the smallest effects of MIMIC age were constrained to be zero, retaining 14 of the possible 30 effects (i.e., 5 FFA Factors \u03eb 6 Age-by-Gender Groups). For 12 of these 14 effects, there were matching effects for men and women within each age group. Again, constraining the effects to be invariant across gender within each of the age groups had no effect on the fit indices.\nIn summary, the systematic evaluation of the hybrid MIMICmultiple-group models showed that the MIMIC models did not contribute much beyond what could be explained by the multiplegroup models in terms of age effects. The relatively small differences were limited primarily to linear effects of age in the MIMIC models, and these effects within each age group were similar for men and women. Based on Model MIMIC-MAG6, we graphed the combined effects gender, age, and their interaction based on the combined effects in the multiple-group and MIMIC models (see Figure 1 ). This graph differs from the graph based on the multiple groups in that for each of the six age-gender groups, the additional effects of MIMIC age are added. Clearly this is the best representation of age and gender effects in our data. However, consistent with our interpretations of the statistical models, the graph based on this extended hybrid approach shows essentially the same pattern of results as is observed in results based on the separate MIMIC and multiple-group approaches also shown in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion, Implications, and Directions for Further Research", "text": "The present investigation is a substantive-methodological synergy, applying new and evolving methodological innovations to explore an ongoing substantive issue with important theoretical and practical implications for FFA and developmental research. The result of this synergy is one of the methodologically strongest studies of how FFA factors vary with gender and age. A particular design strength of the study is the use of a nationally representative sample including a wide age range. The changes in the FFA factors with age have important substantive implications for theoretical models in FFA research. The ESEM model provides clear support for the FFA factors in relation to goodness of fit that is better than the traditional CFA model. This is an important contribution in that few studies based on any FFA instruments have been able to achieve an acceptable level of fit starting at the level of the individual item. While most previous research has been based on scale scores that are a crude representation of the FFA factors, our results are based on latent ESEM factors. These ESEM models better represented the underlying FFA factors, controlled for measurement error, and allowed us to address issues that could not be studied with manifest scores (i.e., aggregated scale scores or factor scores)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Substantive Implications", "text": "Sizes of correlations among FFA factors. FFA factors are posited to be relatively uncorrelated, but McCrae et al. (1996) and others (e.g., Dolan et al., 2009; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) have argued that the application of traditional CFA models leads to inflated correlations among the FFA factors. Our results support this contention in that correlations among FFA factors defined by CFA were systematically and substantially higher than those among the corresponding ESEM FFA factors. In general, if there are at least moderate cross-loadings in the true population model, and these are constrained to be zero as in the typical CFA model, then the estimated factor correlations are likely to be inflated and the differences can be substantial Marsh et al., 2011 Marsh et al., , 2009 T. A. Schmitt & Sass, 2011) . This issue is also relevant to research based on simple scale scores and EFA factor scores. Correlations based on (a) ICM-CFA latent factors are likely to be inflated as shown here, (b) EFA factor scores are likely to be attenuated (because they do not correct for unreliability), and (c) manifest scale scores are likely to be both inflated and attenuated (although it would be difficult to determine the relative sizes of these counterbalancing biases). In all CFA applications, factor correlations will be at least somewhat biased unless all nontarget loadings are close to zero. This results in multicollinearity and undermines discriminant validity in relation to predicting other outcomes and providing distinct profiles of personality. For example, the distinctiveness of the age and gender differences across the FFA factors depends at least in part on the distinctiveness of the underlying FFA factors and how they are represented. We also note that whatever the true correlation among the factors, the estimated correlations are likely to be inflated in ICM-CFA analyses that constrain cross-loadings to be zero, and these biased estimates distort the pattern of relations between FFA factors and other variables of interest."}, {"section_title": "Plaster hypothesis.", "text": "According to the plaster hypothesis, changes in personality end-or at least slow down substantiallyafter age 30 (i.e., personality is set in plaster). Consistent with a growing body of research based on manifest measures, our research clearly refutes both strong and weak versions of the plaster hypothesis in relation to mean-level changes in FFA factors. All three sets of graphs in Figure 1 show that there are consistent changes in FFA latent means across the entire late-adolescent, adult, and old age range from 15 to 99. Indeed, only one of the FFA factors (Extraversion) suggests that there is even a decline in the rate of change with age. For two FFA factors (Agreeableness and Neuroticism) the rate of change is systematically larger-not smaller-in late adulthood. For one of the FFA factors (Conscientiousness) even the direction of change is different for older adults (there are substantial increases in late adolescence and early adulthood but systematic declines in middle and late adulthood). Although our study is consistent with other research leading to the rejection of the plaster hypothesis, our basis for doing so is stronger in terms of the methodology and age range. The plaster hypothesis is a dying urban myth that should be dropped from the FFA research literature.\nMaturity principle. The maturity principle suggests that as individuals grow older their personalities evolve so that they become more mature, although this hypothesis appears to equate maturity with productive contribution to society. This productivematurity principle has typically been formulated as to implicitly reflect a constant evolution across the life span-something that the nonlinear results obtained in the present investigation, as well as in all of the preceding studies in which participants older than 60 were included, clearly refute. At least superficially, some of our results may appear consistent with the productive-maturity principle at least when this hypothesis is taken to reflect FFA development in late adolescence and early adulthood-particularly the decrease in Neuroticism, the increase in Agreeableness, and some of the early changes in Conscientiousness. However, when the maturity-principle is taken to reflect lifelong development, complications emerge. Although there are increases in Agreeableness and decreases in Neuroticism with age, the changes tend to be larger for older adults than younger adults. Does this mean that older individuals mature more than younger ones in these factors? For Conscientiousness, the increases are limited primarily to late adolescence and early adulthood. Starting in middle adulthood, there is a dramatic decline in Conscientiousness. Does this mean that there is a decline in \"maturity\" beyond middle age, or simply that alternative processes emerge? Although predictions based on the maturity principle have been ambiguous in terms of Extraversion (and may even differ across subfacets of this factor), the decline with age observed here is apparently inconsistent with current formulations of the maturity principle suggesting that increases in dominance (a facet of Extraversion) reflect increasing maturity, or more appropriately, productive maturity. Finally, the steady decline in Openness observed here (and in many other studies) has always been difficult to explain in terms of a maturity principle. How is becoming closed to new ideas and differences a sign of increased productive maturity? In summary, to the extent that clear predictions based on the maturity principle can be made a priori, the results of the present investigation do not seem to be fully consistent with it, especially regarding old age and the specific results obtained for Extraversion and Openness. In terms of a priori explanatory power, the maturity principle has thus limited usefulness to understanding changes in FFA factors with age. At best, our research-consistent with other researchsuggests that support for the productive-maturity effect is limited to the late-adolescent to early adult period.\nLa dolce vita effect. Clearly there is no support for the plaster hypothesis or the productive-maturity effect in old age. Indeed, the term maturity does not even seem to make sense for the elderly. Based on self-concept research, we suggested that-despite obvious declines in particular physical attributes-the elderly tend to become more content with themselves in old age, as reflected in higher levels of self-esteem. We labeled this the la dolce vita effect. The results of the present investigation seem to be consistent with the emergence of such self-contentment in old age as people become happier (more agreeable, less neurotic), more self-content and self-centered (less extroverted and open), more laid back and satisfied with what they have (less conscientious, open, outgoing, and extroverted), and less preoccupied with productivity. This seems to suggest that, with age-after having devoted their lives to work, career, and family-people tend to embrace more positive attitudes toward life and maybe to embrace more positively what life still has in store for them, personally. Interestingly, our results based on FFA factors apparently converge with other studies we reviewed that considered changes in personality that emerge after the age of 55 (e.g., Donnellan, & Lucas, 2008; Roberts et al., 2006a Roberts et al., , 2006b Terracciano et al., 2005) .\nAs FFA factors have been purported to represent the core of human identity (e.g., Boyle, 2008; Caspi et al., 2005; Digman, 1990; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2006) , similar effects should be observed in other domains, and indeed this seems to be the case, thus reinforcing the la dolce vita proposition. First, as we previously noted, Marsh, Martin, and Jackson (2010) observed that as people get older, they become aware of their declining physical attributes but also become more accepting of this decline, potentially due to a reduced incorporation of external frames of references in their internal standards (for a similar interpretation in the psychodynamic area, see Hillman, 1999) . Moreover, indeed, these authors observed that for global selfesteem and global physical self-concept, older people tend to become more satisfied with themselves overall even though they decline in relation to particular physical attributes. This appears to be linked to the incorporation of more efficient self-preservation and adaptive strategies in older age (e.g., Alaphilippe, 2008; Brandtst\u00e4dter & Greve, 1994; Carstensen & Freund, 1994) . For instance, Brandtst\u00e4dter and Greve (1994) described the selfconcepts of older adults as characterized by an increased level of resourcefulness and flexibility due to the action of three interrelated mechanisms aiming at (a) preventing or compensating for losses in domains that are central to the identify; (b) readjusting personal goals or aspirations to avoid negative self-evaluations; (c) immunizing self-identity against contradictory evidence through, for instance, selective perception (i.e., reduced openness).\nSupport for the la dolce vita effect also comes from previous research showing that older people report fewer negative interpersonal interactions than do younger people (i.e., are more agreeable) and that when they do, they also report less negative affect (e.g., Almeida, 2005; Birditt & Fingerman, 2005; Lefkowitz & Fingerman, 2003) . In a study designed to investigate the reasons behind this observation, Charles and Carstensen (2008) reported that, 19 when facing negative social interactions, older adults made less negative comments about the speaker but also made fewer appraisals about them generally and expressed less desire to learn about their motives. They thus seem to simply disengage from these interactions (i.e., they are less open/extraverted). All of these results suggest that the la dolce vita interpretation provided here may represent a central mechanism to a positive human aging process in which people strive to devote their energy to the enjoyment of what life still has to offer while relying on more efficient self-regulatory mechanisms, which allows them to devote less energy to unpleasant experiences. This could also reflect the observed decrease in openness, as familiarity tends to require less efforts of adaptation.\nFinally the la dolce vita effect is also generally consistent with evidence from psychiatric epidemiology showing that the point prevalence and/or severity of most forms of mood, anxiety, behavioral, substance abuse-related, and personality disorders tend to decrease past age 50 or 60, with few new onsets occurring after that time (e.g., Degenhardt et al., 2008; ESEMeD/MHEDEA-2000 Investigators, 2004a , 2004b Grant et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2009; H. J. Jackson, & Burgess, 2000; Kessler et al., 2007 Kessler et al., , 2005 Lenzenweger et al., 2007) . Indeed, even depression, which was long thought to increase with age, was in fact found to decrease once physical health and illnesses were controlled . Although the observed decrease in anxiety may in appearance contradict the current results showing a similar decline in Openness, this juxtaposition suggests a tendency to avoid anxietygenerating situations through the aforementioned self-preservation mechanisms. Thus, there is an increase in Agreeableness and a decrease in Neuroticism (increase in emotional stability) in part because there is a decrease in Openness.\nIn summary, our results show that there are systematic developmental changes in personality over the entire adolescent and adult life span, leading us to reject the plaster hypotheses. Although there is some support for a \"productive maturation\" effect in the adolescent to early adult period, this support does not generalize to old age. Particularly as individuals grow into old age, they seem to reach a point of contentment that we have characterized as the la dolce vita effect. Although our introduction of the term la dolce vita effect in the present investigation is speculative, the effect appears to bring together patterns of changes in old age from a variety of different psychological disciplines. Further research is warranted to explore this effect and the reasons behind it.\nGender differences. Based on reviews of the FFA literature, women tend to score higher than men on Neuroticism and Agreeableness and perhaps also on Conscientiousness and Extraversion. However, there are no clear trends in gender differences for Openness. Our results are reasonably consistent with these expectations. The major differences are that we found almost no gender differences in Conscientiousness, whereas men had substantially higher scores on Openness than did women. Perhaps the most striking finding of our study was how remarkably consistent these gender differences were across such a wide age range (15-99). Although there were systematic age differences, these changes as a function of age were nearly the same for men and women. ESEM models that constrained Age \u03eb Gender interactions to be zero fitted the data nearly as well (in some cases better, according to fit indices that control for parsimony) as models where these interaction effects were freely estimated."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Methodological Implications", "text": "Multiple-group-MIMIC hybrid.\nLatent variable analysts have typically used two main approaches to testing mean differences across groups: Multiple-group comparisons and the MIMIC models. Both these approaches have critical, counterbalancing strengths and weaknesses. The MIMIC model is much more parsimonious and thus more attractive to applied studies-particularly those based on modest sample sizes. Importantly, the MIMIC approach is equally appropriate to truly categorical variables (e.g., gender), continuous variables (e.g., age), or a mixture of the two (as in the present investigation). However, critical assumptions of measurement invariance are implicit in the MIMIC model and cannot be tested. The particular strength of the multiple-group models is that they allow for tests of the full range of invariance tests like those considered here. Many multiple-group comparisons are based on only two groups (or a small number of groups representing different levels of a single variable). However, we demonstrated here that this could easily be expanded to include all levels of two or more variables and their interactions (i.e., the six age-gender groups representing all combinations of the 3 Age \u03eb 2 Gender interactions considered here). Major limitations of the multiple-group approach are the large number of estimated parameters (which typically require large Ns) and the assumption that all variables of interest can be represented by a small number of categories. Although some variables (e.g., gender) are naturally categorical, many are not. In psychological research, it is well known that there are serious limitations in using a small number of categories to represent a reasonably continuous variable like age (MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002) . Hence, both the multiple-group and MIMIC models are likely to be \"wrong\" for different reasons. In the present investigation, we explored a hybrid approach that incorporated advantages of both the MIMIC and multiple-group approaches. Again we note that this hybrid approach could be applied with either ESEM or CFA models, but CFA models would be inappropriate (as would corresponding analyses based on manifest variables) if the CFA models did not adequately fit the data or the fit of ESEM models was substantially better.\nThis application of the hybrid multiple-group-MIMIC approach makes three main contributions. First, we independently applied both the MIMIC and multiple-group approaches to the same data. Particularly important were the tests of invariance (or partial invariance) in the multiple-group approach that was implicit in the MIMIC approach. Results from these two contrasting approaches provided very similar results. Second, here we expanded the use of this hybrid approach by actually incorporating both approaches into a single model, so that age and gender effects were based on both approaches, which resulted in a graph that incorporated both multiple-group and MIMIC effects of gender and age. Third, this application demonstrates the flexibility of the ESEM approach. We also note that other combinations of MIMIC and multiple-group models are possible. For example, it would have been possible to treat only gender as a multiple-group variable and age as a MIMIC variable. Although less complete than the models investigated in 20 the present investigation, these alternative models may prove quite useful with smaller samples sizes.\nESEM vs. CFA. Why have FFA researchers not taken more advantage of the tremendous advances in statistical methodology that appear to be highly relevant to important substantive concerns like those considered here? Many of these advances are based substantially on CFA and related statistical techniques. Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al. (2010; Marsh et al., 2009) argued that the traditional ICM-CFA model is not appropriate for many well-established psychological measures, including most FFA measures. Indeed, this view is commonly expressed by FFA researchers (e.g., McCrae et al., 1996) . However, personality researchers proclaiming the inappropriateness of CFA were also forced to forgo the many methodological advances that are associated with CFA, an ironic situation in a discipline that has made such extensive use of factor analysis. In at least some situations, as demonstrated here, this apparent impasse can be largely overcome through application of ESEM. Importantly, the analytical strategies demonstrated here could also be applied in traditional ICM-CFA studies. In this respect, we present the ESEM model as a viable alternative to the traditional ICM-CFA model, but we do not argue that the ESEM approach should replace the CFA approach. Indeed, when the more parsimonious ICM-CFA model fits the data as well as does the ESEM model and results in similar parameter estimates, the ICM-CFA should be used. However, when the ICM-CFA model is unable to fit the data whereas the ESEM model is able to do so, we suggest that advanced statistical strategies such as those demonstrated here are more appropriately conducted with ESEM models than with ICM-CFA models.\nIn summary, (a) responses to FFA instruments (but, more generally, most psychological measures) typically do not meet the assumptions of the ICM-CFA model and will result in biased estimates if used despite these problems; (b) if the ESEM model fits the data better than the ICM-CFA model does, then the assumptions of the ICM-CFA model are unlikely to be valid; and (c) in many instances, the less restrictive assumptions of the ESEM model provide more valid estimates.\nFFA research has largely ignored fundamental issues related to complex structures of measurement error. Although FFA researchers routinely report coefficient alpha estimates of reliability, the \"state of the art\" has moved well beyond these historically acceptable measures. Simply reporting coefficient alpha estimates of reliability provides an index of one aspect of measurement error but largely ignores other aspects of unreliability and does not correct parameter estimates for unreliability (also see Sijtsma, 2009) . Particularly in path models with many different constructs, the failure to control for measurement error can have unanticipated results (see discussion of the \"phantom\" effect by Marsh, Seaton, et al., 2010) . The ability to define and control for complex structures of measurement error has been one of the important advances available to applied researchers through the application of CFA, but these advances are largely absent in traditional approaches to EFA. An important advantage of ESEM is to provide many of the advantages of CFA without the constraints imposed by the traditional ICM-CFA factor structure. Although ESEM does not allow the full flexibility of CFA/SEM models as currently operationalized in Mplus (e.g., constraints on group specific correlations among factors, tests of higher order factor models, fully latent curve models, factor mixture models), we also proposed (see Supplemental Material) an extension of ESEM models (ESEMwithin-CFA) that can be used to circumvent most of these current limitations."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Limitations and Directions for Further Research", "text": "Reliance on cross-sectional data. An important limitation of the present investigation is reliance on cross-sectional dataparticularly in relation to chronological age-that require additional caveats in the interpretation of the results. For example, the apparent differences as a function of age-particularly in old age-could reflect relations of FFA factors with longevity or mortality (see related discussion by Caspi et al., 2005) . Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that observed differences may also be a function of birth cohort effects (see related discussion by Roberts et al., 2006a , and Twenge, 2000 , 2001 . Reliance on cross-sectional data thus limits the issues that we were able to address. Therefore, we were not able to evaluate how consistent changes in FFA factors were for different individuals, as this would have required longitudinal data (also see discussion of person-centered approaches by Block, 2010) . For example, Costa et al. (1999) proposed an extended version of the plaster hypothesis, suggesting that in addition to mean-level stability, FFA traits were also characterized by rank-order stability over time (i.e., by stable interindividual differences). Although our results are clearly inconsistent with the plaster hypothesis in relation to mean level differences, we were not able to examine the stability of individual differences with our cross-sectional data.\nAlthough there are many advantages for longitudinal data, there are also some limitations. To the extent that the data are based on a single age cohort, then there are issues about the generalizability of the results to other age cohorts. Problems associated with mortality and longevity also affect longitudinal data, although longitudinal data provide a stronger basis for evaluating the consequences of these issues. Particularly for large, nationally representative samples, longitudinal data are much more expensive and time-consuming to collect and more likely to be plagued nonrandom missing data. Furthermore, it would not be realistically possible to collect a longitudinal data set that covered the range of ages (15-100) covered here. The best possible compromise would be a multicohort, multiwave design that combines advantages of both longitudinal and cross-sectional data. However, even here there would still be the problem of cohort and mortality variations with the older cohorts. Although there is no solution to this problem, at least our sample is a nationally representative sample of people who are currently alive that covers one of the most extensive age ranges ever considered in FFA studies. Ultimately the \"best\" description of how FFA factors change with age must be able to incorporate findings from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. We also note that it would be possible to evaluate true longitudinal data with ESEM (see Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010) , to test the invariance of responses using essentially the same set of invariance models considered here, and to compare ESEM results with those based on traditional ICM-CFA approaches.\nLimitations in the applications of ESEM. ESEM is a relatively new statistical tool, and the development of best practice will have to evolve with experience and application. Limitations 21 BIG-FIVE FACTORS and directions for further research are discussed in more detail elsewhere Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2009) . Particularly relevant to the present investigation are issues related to goodness-of-fit assessment, the appropriateness of partial invariance models based on ex post facto modifications, and analyses based on responses to individual items. Some of these issues are overcome by the application of our taxonomy of models focusing on the relative fit of competing models. However, we recommend that researchers use an eclectic approach based on a subjective integration of a variety of indices, detailed evaluations of the actual parameter estimates in relation to theory, a priori predictions, common sense, and a comparison of viable alternative models specifically designed to evaluate goodness of fit in relation to key issues. The use of ex post facto modification indices to construct models of partial invariance in ESEM is worrisome but applies to CFA studies as well. Without softening invariance assumptions to include partial invariance (e.g., invariance of intercepts in gender and age groups), the applied researcher is not entitled to pursue substantive questions of interest. While it might be possible to develop better instruments that are more fully invariant, we suspect that this will continue to be an ongoing issue in applied research.\nWe also note that partial invariance models are clearly more defensible than are analyses based on manifest scores that implicitly assume complete invariance. In the present investigation, we started at the item level. Some researchers have attempted to circumvent concerns related to CFA and partial invariance through the use of item aggregates: facet scores (e.g., Ashton et al., 2009; Gignac, 2009; McCrae et al., 1996; Saucier, 1998; Small, Hertzog, Hultsch, & Dixon, 2003) , parcels (e.g., Allemand et al., 2008 Allemand et al., , 2007 L\u00fcdtke et al., 2009; Marsh, Trautwein, et al., 2006) , or scale scores (e.g., Mroczek & Spiro, 2003) . Although potentially appropriate and useful for some specific purposes, the use of item aggregates-by definition-does not allow researchers to test appropriately differential item functioning and measurement invariance at the level of the individual items. Furthermore, unless very strict assumptions are met, analyses based on aggregates of items are likely to camouflage misfit at the item level and result in biased parameter estimates and relations among factors (e.g., Bandalos, 2008; Marsh et al., 2011) . Indeed, Marsh et al. (2011) argued that unless the ICM-CFA model fits the data as well as do ESEM models, there are potentially serious violations of assumptions of unidimensionality upon which parceling strategies are based. Hence, we recommend that applied researchers who choose to do CFA (or ESEM) analyses at the item-aggregate level should also evaluate the appropriateness of their models and interpretations at the individual item level.\nHow well can the FFA factors be explained in terms of only 15 items? Is this FFA instrument simply too short? Short forms are controversial (Marsh, Ellis, Parada, Richards, & Heubeck, 2005) and even the widely used 60-item NEO-FFI is a compromise \"short\" version of longer (180-and 270-item) instruments. This is an important issue as, increasingly, FFA researchers recognize that results as basic as gender and age differences depend in part on the items (or subfacets) used to measure the FFA factors (Costa, Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001; Terracciano et al., 2005) . Ultimately this is an issue of differential item functioning that is most appropriately addressed through tests of measurement invariance like those pursued here. However, these tests of invariance relate to the generality of findings across the items that were considered, not how the items used in a particular study map onto the population of items that could have been used (or samples of items used on other instruments). One consequence of measuring FFA factors with so few items is the inevitably low levels of reliability (see earlier discussion). We note, however, that this is not an inherent problem so long as latent variables models are used to correct for unreliability, as in the present investigation. Clearly, the use of such an abbreviated FFA instrument is an expedient compromise that made it possible for FFA measures to be included in the British Household Panel Survey.\nIn summary, ESEM is not a panacea and may not be appropriate in some situations. However, it provides developmental and personality researchers with considerable flexibility to address substantively important issues such as those raised here when the traditional ICM-CFA approach is not appropriate. Because ESEM is a new statistical tool, \"best practice\" will evolve with experience. Nevertheless, results of the present investigation (also see Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2009) provide strong support for the application of ESEM in psychological research more generally."}]
