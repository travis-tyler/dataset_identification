[{"section_title": "", "text": "Genome-wide search was used to identify common genetic variants associated with caudate nucleus volume. Two large independent samples comprising young and elderly populations were used to replicate any associations. Here a detailed view of the most associated locus is shown. Markers are represented as circles (single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with no known function) or downward-pointing triangles (coding non-synonymous mutations). Markers are placed at their position on chromosome 5 (x axis) and graphed based on the \u00c0log 10 (P-values) of their association with the phenotype (y axis). The level of linkage disequilibrium to the most associated SNP (rs163030) is represented in color using the CEU panel from HapMap Phase II. The location of genes is shown below the plots, and two genes WDR41 and PDE8B implicated in the locus are involved with dopamine development and signaling.
