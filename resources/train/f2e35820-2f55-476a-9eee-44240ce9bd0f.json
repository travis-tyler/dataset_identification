[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Running title: Polygenic architecture of human neuroanatomical diversity.\nWe analysed the genomic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity using magnetic resonance imaging and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from >26,000 individuals from the UK Biobank project and 5 other projects that had previously participated in the ENIGMA consortium. Our results confirm the polygenic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity, with SNPs capturing from 40% to 54% of regional brain volume variance. Chromosomal length correlated with the amount of phenotypic variance captured, r~0.64 on average, suggesting that at a global scale causal variants are homogeneously distributed across the genome. At a local scale, SNPs within genes (~51%) captured~1.5 times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured less variance than the rest: the 40% of SNPs with MAF<5% captured <1/4th of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of r G~0 .45. Genetic correlations were similar to phenotypic and environmental correlations, however, genetic correlations were often larger than phenotypic correlations for the left/right volumes of the same region. The heritability of differences in left/right volumes was generally not statistically significant, suggesting an important influence of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

The underlying hypothesis is that phenotypic diversity results from the action of a reduced number of genes, close to the Mendelian paradigm where a phenotype is determined by a single locus. However, the amount of neuroanatomical variance captured by candidate genes or genome-wide significant loci has remained extremely small. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aiming at identifying associated variants through international collaborative efforts such as ENIGMA and CHARGE have revealed only few statistically significant associated loci (Stein et al. 2012 , Hibar et al. 2015 , Satizabal et al. 2017 , capturing <1% of phenotypic variance. This is in contrast with the large heritability of neuroanatomical diversity estimated by twin and extended pedigree studies (Blokland et al. 2012 , Wen et al. 2016 which show that about 80% of neuroanatomical variability is captured by genetic factors.\nThe genetic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity could result, alternatively, from the aggregated effect of thousands of different loci spread across the genome, a paradigm closer to the infinitesimal model proposed by Fisher (1918) . Thanks to the development of methods to estimate heritability from whole-genome genotyping data (reviewed by Yang et al. 2017) , several groups have estimated that genotyped variants, taken together, were able to capture up to 55% of the phenotypic variance, retrieving about two-thirds of the heritability estimated by family studies , Ge et al. 2015 , 2016 , Zhao et al. 2018 , Elliott et al. 2018 ). These results are compatible with the hypothesis of a highly polygenic architecture, where phenotypes are influenced by large numbers of loci of effect sizes too small to reach genome-wide significance (usually p<5\u00d710 -8 ). While information about the function of a few candidate genes can have a strong explanatory power in the case of a few causal loci, a polygenic approach calls for alternative, system-wide, sources of biological insight.\nOur aim was to better understand the role of polygenic causes in the determination of neuroanatomical diversity. In a previous work, we used a sample of N = 2,011 subjects with whole-genome genotyping data from the IMAGEN consortium combined with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysed according to the pipelines of the ENIGMA consortium, and showed that genomic complex trait analysis (GCTA) was able to capture a substantial proportion of the variability in regional brain volumeup to 55% . Due to sample size limitations, however, standard errors were high (about \u00b1 25%) and statistical power for post-hoc analyses was limited. The advent of collaborative efforts such as the ENIGMA consortium, and large scale projects such as UK Biobank, in particular, has allowed researchers to greatly increase the number of subjects used for heritability estimation (see for example, Elliott et al. 2018 , Zhao et al. 2018 ). Here we replicate and follow up on our original results using a sample ten times larger, N = 26,818, which combines data from the UK Biobank project as well as 5 other projects that had previously participated in the ENIGMA consortium (IMAGEN, SHIP, TREND, Lothian, ADNI).\nWe used the same regional brain volumes estimates than those used in the ENIGMA consortium studies by Stein et al. (2012) and Hibar et al. (2015) : several subcortical structures, total brain volume and intracranial volume. In addition, we also studied height and intelligence scores. Brain volume correlates with height and intelligence scores (Taki et al. 2012) , which are both known to be heritable (Yang et al. 2010, Plomin and Deary 2015) . We aimed thus at determining to which extent the heritability of regional brain volumes was given by their relationship with height (i.e., affected by the same genetic factors that determine body size), or if different genetic factors affected them specifically. Similarly for intelligence scores, we aimed at better understanding its relationship with brain volume.\nFor all phenotypes, we estimated to what extent genome-wide SNPs were able to capture the inter-individual variability in regional brain volumes, that is, we estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance captured by SNPs across the genome (also called SNP heritability). Additionally, we used GWAS data to compute genome-wide polygenic scores, which provide a phenotypic prediction at the individual level. The analyses of the influence of the complete genome on our phenotypes were complemented with analyses on a series of genomic partitions: genic versus non-genic; preferential expression in the central nervous system or by cell type; low, medium or high minor allele frequency. This type of analysis can reveal whether specific genomic regions are enriched in the amount of variance they capture. Finally, we looked at the pleiotropy across phenotypes. For this, we computed genetic correlations and phenotypic correlations for all pairs of phenotypes. For brain regions, we also compared the genetic and phenotypic correlations between the left and right parts of the same structure as a means to estimate the role of genetics and environment in brain asymmetry.\nOur results confirm the observation that polygenic factors play an important role in the determination of neuroanatomical variability, and show different ways in which biological information can be obtained to better understand polygenic effects."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sharing", "text": "We obtained whole-genome genotyping from N = 26,818 subjects from 6 different projects: UK Biobank, IMAGEN, ADNI, Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, SHIP and TREND.

The UK Biobank project ( https://imaging.ukbiobank.ac.uk ) is a large, long-term biobank study in the United Kingdom aiming at investigating the contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. The study is following about 500,000 volunteers enrolled at ages from 40 to 69 years old, 54% females. IMAGEN ( https://imagen-europe.com ) is a project to identify and characterise specific genetically-influenced alterations in reinforcer sensitivity and executive control which manifest in adolescence and carry the risk for overt psychopathology later in life. It includes general population 13 to 17 year old adolescents (49% of females) from Germany, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

Through genomic partitions we can create different genetic relationship matrices based on non-overlapping regions of the genome. The SNPs on each of these partitions can capture then a different amount of variance (although, as before, SNPs within a given partition are supposed to capture all the same amount of variance). We grouped SNPs in the following partitions:\n1. Partition based on genic status. Using 66,632 gene boundaries from the UCSC Genome Browser hg19 assembly, we made a first set with all SNPs within these boundaries, two further sets that included also SNPs 0 to 20 kbp and 20kbp to 50 kbp upstream and downstream of each gene, and a last set including the SNPs not located in regions less than 50 kbp upstream or downstream of genes. Both exonic and intronic regions were included in the genic regions. These partitions do not correspond exactly to those used by Toro et al. (2015) which were: one with strict genic/non-genic boundaries (0 kbp), another with genic \u00b1 20 kbp versus the rest, and finally genic \u00b1 50 kbp versus the rest.\n2. Partition based on preferential central nervous system (CNS) expression (Raychaudhuri et al. 2010 , Lee, DeCandia, et al. 2012 ) using \u00b1 50 kbp as gene boundaries, and based on markers of brain cell types as defined by two recent scRNA-Seq studies (Skene et al. 2018 ) using \u00b1 20 kbp as gene boundaries.\n3. Partition based on allele frequency. A partition based on MAF with 4 groups: from 0.1 to 5%, from 5 to 20%, from 20 to 35% and from 35 to 50%.

Heritability estimates unbiased for measurement errors can be obtained with repeated measurements (Ponzi et al. 2018) , however, the datasets we used to measure brain volumes provide only one MRI per subject. We used datasets from CoRR, the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (Zuo et al. 2014 ) , which includes multiple MRIs per individual to estimate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (Fisher 1970 ) for each regional volume. We segmented the volumes as we did in the UK Biobank dataset, using FreeSurfer 6.0. ICCs were computed on the volumes of 836 subjects with two MRI sessions after covarying for age, sex and scanning site. For intelligence, we estimated ICC from 1,301 subjects in UK Biobank who took the fluid intelligence test 3 times. The ICC for height was considered to be equal to 1 (no measurement error).

In all cases, the meta-analytic estimates closely corresponded with the values obtained for the UK Biobank project (Table S1 .2), because of its large sample size which accounted for ~94% of the weighted estimates. Standard errors agreed well with the theoretical values proposed by Visscher et al.

As expected, the standard errors decreased with sample size, from about 76% for~550 individuals, 43% for~1,000 individuals, 24% for~1,750 individuals (IMAGEN), down to 4% for UK Biobank with more than 13,000 individuals. Our result from simulated phenotypes showed that the estimates of V G /V P obtained with sub-samples of N = 800, N = 400, N = 200 and even N = 100 subjects from the UK Biobank project were unbiased relative to the expected normal distribution. The simulations based on the ADNI project, however, showed a significant bias towards positive values when the sub-samples included N = 100 to N = 400 subjects, probably due to the heterogeneity of the population ( Figures S12-13 and Table S6-7) .\nSimilarly to what we had observed previously , the genetic variance estimates were not significantly affected by population structure: the non-inclusion of the 10 first PCs did not impact the estimates of variance, which changed on average by less than 4% (Fig. S3 ).\nFinally, our heritability estimates for the UK Biobank and ADNI projects were comparable to those of previous studies of these projects by Elliott et al.

To evaluate the impact of the number of samples used in the GWAS on the amount of variance captured by the genome-wide polygenic scores, we also computed the genome-wide polygenic scores for height using the GWAS summary statistics from~277k unrelated UK Biobank subjects not included in the validation dataset. This allowed us to capture~27% of the variance of height (an >8-times increase) ( Fig. S17 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results suggest that neuroanatomical diversity is the product of a highly polygenic architecture, with SNPs capturing from 40% to 54% of regional brain volume variance, confirming our original findings as well as those of others (Elliott et al. 2018 , Zhao et al. 2018 . At a global scale, causal variants were distributed across the genome: for different brain regions, chromosomes containing a larger number of SNPs captured a proportionally larger amount of variance than smaller chromosomes, with a correlation of r~0.64 on average. At a local scale, however, SNPs within genes (~51%) captured~1.5 times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured significantly less variance than those with higher MAF.\nWhen partitioning genetic variance into MAF bins, the lowest MAF partition, going from 0.1% to 5% (10% of the total MAF range) contained~40% of all SNPs, but captured only~16% of the total genetic variance:\nSNPs with low MAF captured significantly less variance than those with higher MAF. However, they captured more variance than expected under a neutral evolution model, where a MAF bin is expected to capture an amount of variance proportional to its size (10% size but 16% of the variance). This result suggests a negative selection model, where loci of large effect are being removed from the population . This apparent contradiction between high effect size and low captured variance for low MAF variants can be explained by the fact that the relationship between captured heritability and the allele effect for a h 2 b\ngiven SNP is dependent of its allele frequency : (Schoech et al. 2017, Zeng et al. p b p (1 ) h 2 = 2 2 \u2212 p 2018) . Given this heterogeneity in effect sizes, using more flexible models that do not make strong assumptions on the relationships between effect size, LD, and MAF, such as GREML-LDMS (Yang et al. 2015) , should improve the accuracy of the heritability estimates. Our study of rare variants is limited because of the use of datasets based on SNP arrays. The availability of whole-genome sequencing data for large cohorts is starting to allow the study of more refined partitions of rare variants and is showing that rare causal variants might be a main source of the variance remaining to be explained (Wainschtein et al. 2019 ) .\nIn addition to showing the heritability of regional volume diversity, our analyses also show an extensive pleiotropy across brain regions. The computation of genetic covariance for pairs of brain regions allowed us to estimate their genetic correlation. We observed an average genetic correlation of r G~0 .45.\nInterestingly, we observed that although genetic correlations were similar to phenotypic correlations across brain regions, if we compared the left and right aspects of the same brain region, their genetic correlations were close to 1 and systematically larger than phenotypic correlations. This could be an indication that the observed phenotypic asymmetries in regional brain volume are of environmental origin.\nTo confirm this result, we used an alternative way of analysing the genetic/environmental nature of regional asymmetry, by looking at the heritability of the differences in left/right volumes. These heritabilities were generally not statistically significantly >0, which again supports the idea of the environmental nature of regional brain asymmetries.\nThe analysis of genetic correlations also allows us to explore the link between neuroanatomical diversity and other anatomical parametres or even cognitive functions. Brain volume is correlated with body size, and in the recent years the polygenic architecture of height has been well described ) .\nIt could be argued that neuroanatomical diversity is simply determined by the same genetic factors that produce body size variability in general. The genetic correlation between brain volume and height was, however, relatively small (r G~0 .16), suggesting little overlap between their genetic causes (in Toro et al. 2015 we did not find a significant genetic correlation, most likely due to lack of statistical power). By contrast, the genetic correlation between brain volume and intelligence scores was of medium strength (r G~0 .34), suggesting a larger overlap. The difference between these two genetic correlations was not significant and the question deserves further study. The genetic correlation between height and intelligence scores was the smallest of all those we studied, r G <0.05, suggesting that their relationship with brain volume may be due to different genetic factors.\nOne important source of bias in our estimates of heritability and genetic correlation could be related to measurement error. In MRI data, for example, some brain regions are more clearly delimited than others, which makes them easier to segment accurately. Furthermore, there is an important variability in volume across brain regions. Segmentation errors would then be comparatively more important for small, poorly delimited regions such as the amygdala, than for large regions like the thalamus. We sought to take into account errors in automatic segmentation of brain regions by analysing data from the CoRR project (Zuo et al. 2014) , where the same subjects were scanned several times. For intelligence scores, we used the subset of UK Biobank where subjects passed the fluid intelligence test on multiple occasions. Our results remained for the most part unchanged after adjusting the estimates for phenotypic measurement errors. A limitation of this approach, however, is that we used MRI scans from a different project (although the processing pipeline was the same). Ideally, one would have preferred to have repeated scans for as subset of UK Biobank subjects, because segmentation quality depends on MRI quality which varies between datasets. The availability of repeated measurements in the same datasets from which genetic variance is estimated may allow to more precisely distinguish between the different sources of phenotypic variations.\nAnother possible source of bias could be the multi-centric nature of our data. The results presented here come from six different projects. Rather than combining our genetic raw data into a single dataset, we chose to estimate the part of phenotypic variance captured by SNPs independently in each dataset and then combine estimates in a meta-analysis. While our chosen solution helps to handle heterogeneity, it trades on statistical power. The reason for this is that the standard error of the GCTA GREML heritability estimate is approximately inversely proportional to the number of subjects (Visscher et al. 2014) (Fig.   S14 ). In the present analysis, the UK Biobank project accounted for~94% of the estimates, largely driving the results. Indeed, the inclusion of the other projects reduced the standard error of the estimates based on the UK Biobank project only by a factor of~1.03. If the raw genotyping data had been combined in a single mega-analysis instead of in a meta-analysis, the decrease in standard error would have been ~1.36 smaller than what we reported. The meta-analytical approach may however prove interesting in the future when large imaging genetics datasets other than UK Biobank will be available or in cases where raw genotyping data cannot be easily shared.\nOur analyses are also limited in their ability to provide information at the individual level. With the advent of large GWAS studies, genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) have become increasingly used to predict phenotypes from whole-genome genotyping data. GPSs are based on effect sizes estimated through GWAS in a large population. These estimates can then be used to predict the phenotype in an independent sample. We aimed at evaluating to which extent GWAS of the N~13k UK Biobank subjects used for our heritability analyses allowed us to predict the phenotypes of additional N~6k subjects. GPSs captured a very small, although statistically significant, proportion of the variance. For brain volume, for example, GPS captured~2.5% of the variance. This is the expected result in the presence of a strongly polygenic phenotype (Wray et al. 2013) . It is also expected that prediction accuracy will improve as the number of subjects used for effect size estimation increases (the UK Biobank project alone should provide data for N~100k in the years to come). We aimed at testing the potential increase in predictive power by computing a GPS for height. When effect sizes were estimated from N~13k subjects, GPS captured~3% of height variance, however, when effect sizes were estimated from N~277k subjects, the amount of variance explained increased to~27%. We expect that effect sizes for regional brain volume estimated from N~100k will allow us to compute GPSs capturing~12% of the variance (based on Wray et al. 2013 and Daetwyler, Villanueva, and Woolliams 2008) .\nThe detection of candidate genes of large effect is an appealing tool for gaining mechanistic insight on normal and pathological phenotypes. However, this approach is ill adapted to strongly polygenic architectures, where not only a few large-effect alleles are involved, but potentially hundreds of thousands of alleles of almost infinitesimal effect (Wray et al. 2018) . Neuroimaging endophenotypes such as those obtained using structural and functional MRI could provide an alternative source of mechanistic insight.\nThe brain imaging literature is rich in examples of associations between different brain regions and networks with normal and pathological cognitive phenotypes. The automatic mining of these associations could provide a layer of annotation for brain regions and networks similar to those available today for genome annotation. Further investigation of the genomic architecture of neuroimaging endophenotypes should prove an important tool to better understand the biological basis of brain diversity and evolution in humans, as well as the biological basis of the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders."}]
