[{"section_title": "| INTRODUCTION", "text": "Understanding how migratory species redistribute themselves across the annual cycle, known as migratory connectivity, is essential for understanding range dynamics, identifying key threats, and developing coordinated conservation actions. Satellite tracking has revolutionized migratory connectivity research for large-bodied species (>100 g) by enabling remote transmission of individual movements over broad spatial and temporal scales (Block et al., 2011). For species too small to carry these transmitters, morphological and chemical signatures of individual organisms or tissues, termed intrinsic markers, are essential tools for estimating migratory connectivity. Stable isotopes are arguably the most useful intrinsic marker for studying migratory connectivity because of their comparatively low cost and scale of inference (Hobson, 2008) and have supported important advances for numerous taxa, including birds (Rubenstein & Hobson, 2004), mammals (Sullivan, Bump, Kruger, & Peterson, 2012), and insects (Hobson, Soto, Paulson, Wassenaar, & Matthews, 2012;Hobson, Van Wilgenburg, Wassenaar, & Larson, 2012). Although stable isotopes offer lower spatial resolution compared to direct tracking, substantial progress has occurred by combining stable isotopes with other intrinsic markers such as genetic data (Kelly, Ruegg, & Smith, 2005;Rundel et al. 2013), morphometrics (Rushing, Ryder, Saracco, & Marra, 2014), and band recoveries (Hobson, Wunder, Van Wilgenburg, Clark, & Wassenaar, 2009;Van Wilgenburg & Hobson, 2011), or with information on abundance (Flockhart et al., 2013;Hallworth, Studds, Sillett, & Marra, 2013). Abundance is one of the most appealing data sources to include in migratory connectivity analyses because high-quality, range-wide data are often freely available. However, a recently noted problem with combing stable isotopes and abundance in migratory connectivity estimates is that many species have patchy breeding distributions. This causes centers of high abundance to be overrepresented and areas of low abundance to be underrepresented in assignments to origin (Hobson et al., 2014). Despite their wide use, there is no analytical method and no guidelines for optimizing the contribution of stable isotopes and abundance for inferring migratory connectivity. The first formal method to include breeding abundance and intrinsic markers in geographic assignments was outlined by Royle and Rubenstein (2004). In their model, stable isotopes are used to assign individuals to one of a finite number of discrete breeding populations, denoted by b = 1, 2, \u2026 B. Each population is defined by a probability distribution that describes the expected values of the marker for individuals originating in that population. From this distribution, it is straightforward to estimate the likelihood that each population is the origin of an individual with an observed marker value y*, denoted f(y*|b). Because areas differ with regard to relative abundance, it may be reasonable to assume that individuals are more likely to originate from high abundance populations than low abundance populations. Using Bayes rule, the relative abundance can be incorporated into the assignment model as a prior probability. This allows researchers to explicitly model the probability that an individual originated from each population, that is, f(b|y*), and to formally base assignments on both the isotope data (via the likelihood) and breeding abundance (via the prior). Although the original model outlined by Royle and Rubenstein (2004) was developed to make geographic assignments to a few discrete breeding regions, the increasing availability of global isoscape and abundance surfaces has enabled researchers to make assignments on nearly continuous landscapes (Hobson et al., 2009;Sullivan et al., 2012;Van Wilgenburg & Hobson, 2011). This introduces a critical complication that has gone largely unrecognized. The problem arises because most species are patchily distributed across their range, with a few areas of relatively high abundance and extensive areas of lower abundance. When abundance is included as a prior in assignments to continuous surfaces, the low abundance sites may receive low posterior support compared to high abundance locations. Although this outcome is consistent with the logic proposed by Royle and Rubenstein (2004), in practice, the posterior probabilities for each location may simply reflect relative abundance, thus limiting the contribution of the isotope data to assignments (see Gonz\u00e1lez-Prieto, Hobson, Bayly, & G\u00f3mez, 2011;Hobson et al., 2014). In extreme cases, the inclusion of breeding abundance may lead to inaccurate assignments and obscure estimates of migratory connectivity, the biological processes of interest. In this study, we describe a new quantitative method for making geographic assignments to origin that differentially weights stablehydrogen isotope and breeding abundance data to maximize assignment area and minimize assignment error. We performed Bayesian assignments of origin for six species of Neotropical-Nearctic migratory birds: Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Parula (Setophaga americana), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), Black-and-White Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). Using stable-hydrogen isotope data collected at known breeding sites across the breeding range of each species enabled us to assess the performance of different models. Using Pareto optimality, a method for multi-objective optimization, we show that weighting the isotope and abundance data can increase the performance of assignment models but that the distribution of breeding abundance plays a critical role in determining the proper weightings."}, {"section_title": "| MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Study species and feather sampling", "text": "To determine whether the inclusion of abundance data improved the performance of assignment models that rely on isotope data alone, we used stable-hydrogen isotope data from six species of Neotropical migratory birds collected at known breeding locations (Tables 1 and   S1-S6). The use of known-origin samples allowed us to test explicitly the performance of alternative assignment models. Feather samples were collected from 2009 to 2011 at six breeding sites in the eastern United States that span the geographic extent of the breeding range and include a wide range of breeding abundance for each species. Vegetation types included bottomland hardwoods, coastal plain forest, northern hardwoods, and spruce-fir forest at elevations from 5 to 1,000 m. Birds were captured using mist nets, aged and sexed using criteria from Pyle (1997), banded with a United States Geological Survey (USGS) aluminum leg band, and released. One tail feather was removed from each bird before release and stored in a paper envelope. Stablehydrogen isotope values in feathers grown on or near breeding sites are strongly correlated with stable-hydrogen isotope values in growingseason precipitation and therefore provide information about breeding origin (Hobson, & Wassenaar, 1997 (Wassenaar & Hobson, 2003)  Powder standard and duplicate samples run for one in five to eight feathers indicated that analytical error (\u00b11 SD) was <2\u2030. Due to the comparatively small number of samples for Ovenbird, Northern Parula, Black-and-White Warbler, and Prairie Warbler, we restricted our full analysis of assignment models to Wood Thrush and American Redstart. After determining the top assignment models for those two species, we used the remaining four species for independent validations."}, {"section_title": "| Stable isotope assignment model", "text": "To assign individuals to potential breeding locations, we first created base maps describing the variation in hydrogen isotope abundance and relative abundance across the breeding range of each species. To estimate the hydrogen isoscape, we converted a map of expected amount-weighted growing-season precipitation \u03b4 2 H values (\u03b4 2 H p ; Bowen et al. 2005) to expected feather \u03b4 2 H values (\u03b4 2 H f ) using published corrections for either ground foraging or nonground foraging long-distance migratory birds (Hobson, Van Wilgenburg, et al., 2012). In their analysis, Hobson, Van Wilgenburg, et al., 2012 found no support for age-based differences in hydrogen isotope discrimination, and therefore, we did not apply any age-specific correction to the \u03b4 2 H values. Next, we assigned each bird to potential breeding locations using isotope values only. To do this, we calculated the likelihood that each raster cell represented the breeding location for each individual using a normal probability density function: where f(y*|\u03bc i ,\u03c3) is the likelihood that an individual with \u03b4 2 H f = y * originated from cell i, \u03bc i is the predicted \u03b4 2 H f value for cell i, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of \u03b4 2 H f values within a single breeding site, which was assumed to be 12 \u2030 (Rushing et al., 2014). Next, we converted the likelihood values to a probability surface by dividing each likelihood by the sum of all of the likelihoods (Hobson et al., 2009;Van Wilgenburg & Hobson, 2011). We then sorted this probability surface from minimum to maximum and used a smoothing spline function to estimate the probability value (i.e., cutoff) that separated the upper 67% of the cumulative probabilities from the lower 33% (Chabot, Hobson, Van Wilgenburg, McQuat, & Lougheed, 2012;Hobson et al., 2009). Finally, we reclassified any cell with probability greater than the cutoff value as a likely (1) breeding origin and any cell with probability less than the cutoff as an unlikely (0) origin (Chabot et al., 2012;Hobson et al., 2009;Rushing et al., 2014). For each species and each sampling location, we then estimated the proportion of individuals that were misclassified (i.e., true breeding origin classified as unlikely; hereafter referred to as the error rate) and the mean proportion of raster cells classified as likely (referred to as the assignment area). Because the goal of assignments is to correctly classify the breeding locations while minimizing the assignment area, these two metrics provide quantitative and intuitive measures of model performance. ( T A B L E 1 Summary of sampling data. Abundance range indicates the minimum and maximum predicted breeding abundance at the sampling locations for each species.

(2005)  Abundance is expressed as the predicted number of birds per BBS route estimated through inverse distancing (Sauer et al., 2015)."}, {"section_title": "| Incorporating abundance", "text": "Initially, we incorporated breeding abundance into the assignment model following the method outlined in recent assignment studies (Hallworth et al., 2013;Hobson et al., 2014). We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to create base maps of breeding abundance for each species (Figures 1a, 2a and S1;Sauer et al., 2015). Raw abundance estimates were then converted into a probability surface by dividing each cell by the sum of all cells (Hallworth et al., 2013). These relative abundance estimates were incorporated into the assignment model using Bayes rule: where f(b i |y*) is the posterior probability that an individual with \u03b4 2 H f = y* originated from cell i, f(y*|b i ) is the likelihood of assignment to breeding cell i, and f(b i ) is the relative abundance (i.e., the prior probability) of cell i. Because the abundance data in equation 2 were unweighted (see below), we refer to this model as the \"naive-abundance\" model. As before, the posterior probabilities were converted to likely and unlikely origins using a 67% odds, and we quantified assignment performance using the assignment error rate and assignment area metrics described above."}, {"section_title": "| Data weighting and model comparison", "text": "As described above, the combination of isotope data and abundance data described by equation 2 may be problematic if the prior  (Censor, 1977;Steuer, 1986) but has also been applied to a number of optimization problems in ecology and evolution (Kennedy, Ford, Singleton, Finney, & Agee, 2008;Reynolds & Ford, 1999;Shoval et al., 2012 "}, {"section_title": "| Sampling location and multispecies validation", "text": "One concern with our approach is that the top models for Wood "}, {"section_title": "| RESULTS", "text": "For both Wood Thrush and American Redstart, the majority of the 442 assignment models performed poorly relative to the best models, indicating only a small range of weightings provided reasonable solutions for incorporating abundance into assignments (Figure 3). The isotope-only models had moderate rates for both species (Wood Thrush: 52%; American Redstart: 23%) but also relatively large assignment areas (Figures 1b and 2b; Wood Thrush: 35%; American Redstart: 22%; Table 2). In contrast, the naive-abundance models had low assignment areas (Figures 1c and 2c; Wood Thrush: 19%; American Redstart: 10%) but high error rates (Wood Thrush: 32%; American Redstart: 75%; Table 2). The use of Pareto optimality provided an efficient means of eliminating poorly performing models. For Wood Thrush, 405 models (92%) were not Pareto optimal, leaving 37 models along the frontier (Figure 3). Only 16 of the 37 Pareto optimal models (43%) outperformed the isotope-only model with regard to both assignment area and error rate (Figure 3). In general, the best performing Wood Thrush models tended to weight the isotope data by a power <1 (Table S7), indicating that assignments performed best when the likelihoods, but not the prior, were slightly flattened compared to their original distribution. The sampling location validation procedure revealed that the Wood Thrush isotope weights were sensitive to the inclusion of the North Carolina site (Figure 4). Previous analysis of these data indicated that the isotope data performed poorly for these individuals, with only 40% (13/32) of the individuals correctly assigned to their breeding site (Rushing et al., 2014). Downweighting the isotope data likely improved the assignment of these individuals by flattening the likelihood distribution relative to the prior, thus giving more weight to locations with higher abundance (and in this case, the true origin). As a result, including the North Carolina samples in the current analysis favored models that had lower isotope weights than when these individuals were not included (Figure 4). Aside from the influence of the North Carolina site, the cross-validation procedure indicated that the top Wood Thrush models were not highly sensitive to the sampling locations included in the analysis. For American Redstart, 395 models (90%) were not Pareto optimal, leaving 47 models along the frontier (Figure 3). In contrast to the Wood Thrush models, the isotope-only model was very close to the Pareto frontier and as a result, only two of the 46 Pareto optimal abundance models outperformed the isotope-only model with regard to both assignment area and error rate (Figure 3). Both models heavily downweighted abundance (weight range = 10 \u22121.0 -10 \u22120.9 ) and but did not weight the isotope data (Table S8). The isotope weights and the abundance weights were similar across all cross-validation models for American Redstart (Figure 4), indicating that the top Redstart models were unaffected by sample site location. In general, the multispecies validation indicated that the top models for Wood Thrush and American Redstart performed better than the isotope-only model for the four other species included in our analysis (  Figure S2) and Prairie Warbler (19.2, 18.3-20.1) are much larger than the parameters for Wood Thrush (8.4, 8.2-8.7), Ovenbird (8.2, 8.0-8.4), Northern Parula (12.3, 11.9-12.7), and Blackand-White Warbler (8.1, 7.8-8.3)."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "Given the low resolution of many intrinsic markers, including abundance in assignment models is appealing because it can often greatly increase the precision of assignments. However, in all assignment models that use intrinsic markers, there is an inherent trade-off between assignment error and precision. Using known-origin stable-hydrogen isotope samples of six Neotropical migratory bird species, we show that the increased precision of models that include abundance is often offset by a large increase in assignment error. We demonstrate that proper weighting of the abundance and isotope data can result in models with higher precision and, in some cases, lower error than models based on isotopes alone. These results confirm that breeding abundance can be an important source of information for studies investigating large-scale movements of migratory birds and potentially other taxa. Although our assignment models involved known-origin birds, their chief application will be estimating migratory connectivity to breeding areas for adult birds captured in the stationary nonbreeding period or while on migration. We emphasize that combining breeding abundance and stable isotopes in assignment models will yield valid estimates of migratory connectivity for adults but not for immature birds because breeding abundance can be a poor indicator of regional productivity (Van Horne, 1983). Studies aimed at determining the natal origins of immature birds could instead estimate range-wide variation in fecundity with data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survival (MAPS) program (Desante, Burton, Saracco, & Walker, 1995). The use of Pareto optimality allowed us to define explicitly the trade-off between precision and error and in that way focus only on models that provided potential solutions to the proper weighting of abundance and isotope data. For the four species with relatively even abundance distributions (Wood Thrush, Ovenbird, Black-and-White Warbler, and Northern Parula), several models along the Pareto frontier had both lower error and lower assignment area than models based on isotopes alone. Across these four species, models that weighted the isotope data by 10 \u22120.6 -10 \u22120.8 but left the abundance data unweighted provided the best performance. Further downweighting the isotope data resulted in a large increase in error rate for Northern Parula and Black-and-White Warbler, offsetting the improved assignment area for the other species. In contrast, including abundance did not provide an unequivocal improvement in assignment performance for the remaining two species (American Redstart and Prairie Warbler). For these species, the isotope-only model was close to the Pareto frontier. In general, this means that although including abundance in the model will decrease assignment area, it will also increase assignment error. Nevertheless, weighting abundance by 10 \u22121 but leaving the isotope data unweighted did provide a slight decrease in assignment area without substantial increase in error rate for these species. Therefore, this combination appears to provide a reasonable solution for these two species. These results indicate that the distribution of breeding abundance plays a critical role in the performance of assignment models. For species with breeding ranges that are characterized by large areas of very low abundance and a few small centers of high abundance, this patchy distribution likely magnifies the influence of abundance data in the assignment model, overwhelming the information provided by the isotope data and leading to high posterior probabilities for only the high abundance sites (Hobson et al., 2014). As a result, even models that heavily downweight the abundance data perform relatively poorly compared to the isotope-only model. For species with relatively even distributions, in contrast, downweighting of the abundance data was unnecessary to give appropriate weight to the isotope data. Thus, we suggest that including abundance in assignment models has the most potential to improve assignment of species with relatively less patchy and more even distribution of breeding abundance. One of the primary assumptions, often made implicitly, behind adding abundance to assignment models is that at any given winter site, individuals mix in frequencies relative to their breeding abundance (Gonz\u00e1lez-Prieto et al., 2011). In other words, the logic behind this approach assumes that there is no migratory connectivity. However, sev- weighted. Therefore, we recommend that researchers first characterize the patchiness of breeding distributions using the exponential curve-fitting approach described above. For species with patchy distributions (rate parameter > ~15-20), abundance data should only be included if it is heavily downweighted (10 \u22121 -10 \u22120.9 )."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "Moderately downweight isotope data for species with even abundance: For species with more even distributions of breeding abundance (rate parameter < 12), the best models tended to moderately downweight the isotope but not the abundance data. Therefore, we recommend for species with rate parameters < 12, isotope data should be weighted 10 \u22120.6 -10 \u22120.8 and abundance data should be unweighted. Even when researchers follow these guidelines, we recommend comparing the results of the abundance model to the results of assignments based on stable isotopes only. As we show here, the models along the Pareto frontier define the upper bound of assignment performance using abundance and stable-hydrogen isotopes and, in some cases, the performance of abundance models can be poor compared to the isotope-only model. As a result, large discrepancies between the two models should be investigated, reported, and carefully interpreted. Ultimately, however, including abundance in assignment models should be viewed as a preliminary step to improving estimates of migratory connectivity for any species. Occupancy probabilities calculated from species distribution models offer a potentially promising alternative to abundance (Fournier et al., 2016); in part, this approach could lessen the influence of areas with particularly high or low abundance. However, the largest improvements in assignments likely will come from incorporating multiple intrinsic markers (e.g., DNA, morphology, or other isotopes), each of which provides complimentary information about the origin of an individual. Given the low cost and large sample sizes associated with assaying intrinsic markers, assignment models based on these methods will continue to provide important insights into the migratory movements of many species.
