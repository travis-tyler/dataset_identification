The current medical focus is motivated by reported epidemiological linkages between hypoandrogenemia and muscle weakness, sarcopenia, osteopenia, diminished physical stamina, erectile dysfunction, systolic hypertension, carotid artery-wall thickness, abdominal visceral-fat mass, insulin resistance, low HDL concentrations, postprandial somnolence, impaired quality of life, depressive mood, diminished working memory, and decreased executive-cognitive function (Kenny et al. 2001;Moffat et al. 2002;Schroeder et al. 2004;Wang et al. 1996): Figure 1. Among such postulated relationships, low Te availability correlates with reduced grip strength, decreased lean-body mass and increased visceral adiposity in metaanalyses (Isidori et al. 2005). The same pathophysiological features are significantly reversed by Te supplementation (Liu et al. 2004;Liu et al. 2005a;Liverman and Blazer 2004). Impoverished Te production in older men has been documented by (i) direct sampling of the spermatic vein, (ii) metaanalysis of cross-sectional, and (iii) longitudinal investigations in healthy cohorts. A 15-yr prospective analysis in New Mexico reported that total Te concentrations fall by approximately 110 ng/dL per decade in men after the age of 60 yr; the Massachusetts Male Aging Cohort study forecast a 0.8-1.3% annual decrement in bioavailable (nonSHBG-bound) Te concentrations; and, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging predicted a yearly decline of 4.9 pmol Te/nmol SHBG (Harman et al. 2001;Liu et al. 2005a;Liu et al. 2004;Morley et al. 1997). In the last study, the age-related prevalence of hypogonadal serum Te/SHBG ratios according to young-adult normative criteria exceeded 20%, 30% and 50% at ages 60, 70 and 80 yr, respectively. In addition, medications, comorbidity and intercurrent illness in aging populations exacerbate androgen deficiency (Gray et al. 1991). Cross-sectional data collected in healthy men in Olmsted County, MN, verify age-associated decrements in Te concentrations measured by tandem mass spectrometry: Figure 2."}, {"section_title": "Need for mechanistic understanding of gonadal axis as a whole", "text": "As pointed out by the U.S.A. Institute of Medicine (Liverman and Blazer 2004), the primary mechanisms mediating gradual Te depletion in older men are unknown Available data point to presumptive multisite impairment; viz., reduced hypothalamic GnRH outflow, decreased testicular responsiveness to hCG/LH, and attenuated androgenic negative feedback (Keenan et al. 2006;: Figure 3. Which of these proposed mechanisms is primary is not known. Because of strong physiological connectivity among GnRH, LH and Te, definitive mechanistic assessment necessitates ensemble-level analyses of feedback (inhibitory) and feedforward (stimulatory) dose-response pathways interlinking these signals. The analytical formalism for this approach has been validated by analyses of hypothalamopituitary, jugular and spermatic-vein hormone release in 3 mammalian species (Keenan et al. 2006;. Clinical implications of determining definitive loci of impaired regulation are suggested in Table 1. (i) Aging attenuates testis responses to LH-Administration of the LH surrogate, hCG, in pharmacological amounts fails to stimulate maximal young-adult testosterone concentrations in many older men (Liu et al. 2005a). However, pharmacological hCG stimulation paradigms are difficult to interpret because: (i) baseline LH concentrations differ in young and older men; (ii) the half-life of hCG (24 hr) is much longer than that of LH (1 hr), resulting in nearly continuous stimulation of Leydig cells; (iii) hCG unlike LH rapidly downregulates Leydig-cell steroidogenesis even in young men (iv) the dose of hCG used clinically is multifold greater than the bioactivity contained in a normal pulse of LH (Liu et al. 2005a). Therefore, clinical hCG stimulation protocols, albeit utilized for 3 decades, are inadequate to evaluate the physiological basis for declining Te secretion in aging. A recent approach to quantify Leydig-cell Te secretion entails infusing fixed pulses of recombinant human (rh) LH after suppressing LH secretion overnight with a potent GnRH-receptor antagonist, ganirelix. In young men, 7 consecutive i.v. pulses of rhLH normalized ganirelix-suppressed LH and Te concentrations, thus validating the model. The stimulation regimen elevated unbound Te concentrations by 50% less in older than young men (Veldhuis et al. 2005g). Extending the ganirelix clamp and rhLH pulses for a full 2 days also failed to reconstitute young-adult bioavailable (nonSHBG-bound) and free (equilibrium-dialyzed) Te concentrations in aging individuals (Liu et al. 2005b). However, these studies used a single fixed LH dose. What remains unknown is how aging alters the LH\u2192Te dose-response function in healthy men. In corollary, given that LH/hCG can rapidly downregulate (desensitize) testicular responses, the query emerges, Do gradually rising LH concentrations in older men contribute to gonadal downregulation? If so, higher LH concentrations due to lower Te production in aging individuals could create a vicious cycle leading to progressive androgen deficiency. These hypotheses will be important to test given the implications underscored in Table 1. (ii) Age diminishes hypothalamic GnRH secretion-The nearly 3 decade-long intuition that hypothalamic outflow of GnRH is reduced in older men has been difficult to establish or refute (Winters and Troen 1982): Figure 3. The hypothesis is congruent with laboratory observations in the male rodent, which include: (i) attenuated postcastration, anesthesia and restraint stress-induced LH release with preserved acute responses to exogenous GnRH (Liu et al. 2005a); (ii) diminished LH pulse amplitude in vivo and GnRH release by hypothalamic tissue in vitro (Veldhuis et al. 2007b); (iii) fewer GnRH neuronal synapses (Witkin 1987); and (iv) restoration of sexual activity in the impotent aged male rat by implanting fetal hypothalamic tissue (Huang et al. 1987). Most clinical observations are consistent with an hypothesis of reduced GnRH secretion: Table 2. However, a few studies have inferred that older men have blunted gonadotrope responses to exogenous GnRH, increased LH pulse size and/or decreased in vitro LH bioactivity (Liu et al. 2005a;Veldhuis et al. 2007b). Discrepancies motivated the recent development of more compelling methods to appraise how age affects hypothalamic GnRH secretion. Among these, an ensemble-based analysis strongly predicts a significant (> 30%) fall in brain GnRH output to the pituitary in healthy older men (Keenan et al. 2006). (iii) Age impairs testosterone-mediated negative feedback on brain GnRH outflow and/or pituitary LH secretion-How age affects Te-dependent negative feedback has been controversial. Three studies described excessive suppression of LH concentrations in older men by short-term (4-day) i.v. infusion of Te and longer-term (11-day and 15-month) transscrotal administration of Te or transdermal delivery of 5 alpha-dihydroTe (DHT) (Liu et al. 2005a). Two other investigations reported less suppression of LH concentrations in older than young subjects following i.m. injections of Te. Five experimental paradigms suggest impaired feedback regulation of LH production by endogenous Te concentrations in elderly men. Three other noninvasive model-based analyses indicate that aging restricts negative feedback on GnRH/LH secretion by any given Te concentration. In contrast, only one study has assessed whether estrogen-dependent negative feedback changes in aging men (Veldhuis and Iranmanesh 2005). Histochemical studies 2 decades ago described reduced androgen-receptor (AR) expression in the brain, pituitary gland, prostate and penis of the aged rat and in genital fibroblasts of the older human (Haji et al. 1980;Roth and Heiss 1982): Figure 3. However, the generality and functional implications of these findings remain unclear. Although AR depletion in the hypothalamo-pituitary unit could decrease the feedback efficacy of Te, whether significant AR depletion occurs in critical neuroregulatory regions associated with GnRH secretion is uncertain. Moreover, how age affects local conversion of Te to E 2 or 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the human hypothalamus and pituitary gland is unknown. A limiting problem in addressing these issues has been that traditional studies based on administering Te, DHT, E 2 , 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors or aromatase blockers cannot discriminate between CNS and pituitary sites of AR-and ER-mediated feedback. The translational implications of understanding Te and E 2 feedback control in aging men are important: Table 1. Interventions may be envisioned that would enhance androgen or estrogen action selectively in the CNS or pituitary. A broader ensuant question would be whether age limits other effects of Te and E 2 on the brain, and whether CNS-selective androgens and estrogens would mitigate the consequences of impaired Te action."}, {"section_title": "Implications to elderly patients", "text": "Insidious androgen deprivation may adversely impact libido and sexual potency, psychological well being, mood and cognition, exercise tolerance, muscle strength, skeletal mineral content and fracture risk, intraabdominal adiposity, insulin sensitivity, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (Liu et al. 2004): Figure 1. Metaanalyses of Te supplementation studies in older men indicate that lean-body mass, grip strength and visceral adiposity specifically respond to short-term androgen repletion (Isidori et al. 2005;Liu et al. 2004). Nonetheless, because the 2004 Institute of Medicine report underscored major uncertainties about therapeutic indications, safety, dosing and benefits of Te treatment in older men, a recommended immediate research focus is to clarify the primary mechanistic bases for age-related Te depletion (Liverman and Blazer 2004). Further experimental and technical advances will be necessary to achieve this fundamental goal."}, {"section_title": "Concept of hypothalamo-pituitary-Leydig cell feedback system", "text": "Physiological regulation of the male gonadal axis proceeds via repeated incremental signaling adjustments among GnRH, LH and Te Liu et al. 2005a): Figure 4A. According to this thesis, none of GnRH, LH or Te acts alone or may be viewed alone. Analytical predictions based upon this ensemble perspective include impairment of all 3 of GnRH\u2192LH feedforward, LH\u2192Te feedforward and Te\u2192GnRH/LH feedback in older men (Keenan et al. 2006;Liu et al. 2005b;Veldhuis et al. 2004b;Veldhuis et al. 2005d). In such models, signaling connections among GnRH, LH and Te are represented by unknown biomathematical dose-response functions : Figure 4B. The resultant interlinked construct has utility both analytically and predictively. Analytical estimates disclose that healthy older men exhibit a tetralogy of low-amplitude, high-frequency and irregular LH pulses and hypoandrogenemia (Keenan et al. 2006;. Predictive simulations further reveal that combined deficits in LH action on the testis, hypothalamic GnRH outflow and Te-enforced negative feedback on GnRH/LH could explain this clinical tetrad . In particular, intensive and extended blood-sampling paradigms and newer analytical methods forecast 35% smaller and 50% more frequent LH pulses in older than young men, as corroborated using 4 mathematically distinct pulse-analysis methods, 3 independent LH assays and 5 cohorts of volunteers (Liu et al. 2005a). Given that insufficiently intensive bloodsampling regimens censor LH pulse number and inflate estimated LH pulse size, inadequate sampling regimens probably explain many earlier disparities in the literature. Viewed mechanistically, smaller incremental LH pulses in older men could denote: (i) less hypothalamic GnRH secretion per burst; (ii) greater hypothalamo-pituitary feedback inhibition by sex steroids; and/or (iii) impaired gonadotrope responses to GnRH. The third notion was excluded recently by demonstrating that age potentiates LH secretion stimulated by submaximal doses of exogenous GnRH (Veldhuis et al. 2005d). This outcome contrasts with some earlier studies using injected GnRH to stimulate LH acutely in young and older men (Liu et al. 2005a). The difference might be explained by our use of a five-fold strategy of: (a) deconvolution analysis of LH secretion; (b) high-specificity robotics-automated LH assay; (c) separate-morning randomly ordered single-bolus i.v. doses of GnRH spanning a 1000-fold range; (d) nonlinear (four-parameter logistic) regression analyses to quantify gonadotrope sensitivity (slope term), GnRH potency (ED 50 ) and GnRH efficacy (maximal LH secretory response); and (e) age comparisons in the eugonadal and Te-depleted state (Veldhuis et al. 2005d). The outcomes indicated that age: (i) does not alter GnRH efficacy; and (ii) increases gonadotrope sensitivity and GnRH potency but only in a low Te milieu. The inference that age and Te availability jointly govern GnRH dose-responsiveness could explain prior discrepancies, which failed to control for both Te concentrations and GnRH dose. In corroboration, infusion of GnRH pulses (100 ng/kg) i.v. every 90 min for 14 days in older and young men sustains age-equivalent LH pulse amplitude and frequency (Mulligan et al. 1999). Therefore, smaller endogenous LH pulses in older men could be explained logically by reduced hypothalamic GnRH secretion to the pituitary gland, rather than by impaired GnRH action on gonadotrope cells. This important inference directs focus to factors that govern neuronal GnRH secretion in the aging male. Available Te feedback data in healthy young men establish that Te and nonaromatizable androgens (e.g., 5 alpha-DHT or fluoxymesterone) suppress LH pulse frequency; and (ii) ketoconazole (which depletes Te) and flutamide (which inhibits androgen-receptor binding) accelerate LH pulse frequency (Veldhuis et al. 2001). Other studies indicate that frequent pulses of GnRH decrease LH peak increments. This means that the acceleration of LH pulse frequency due to low Te availability in aging might accentuate the reduction in LH pulse increments (Mulligan et al. 1999;Veldhuis et al. 1992). According to expected dose-response relationships, small LH pulses would further attenuate Leydig-cell Te secretion ."}, {"section_title": "Age-Associated Mechanisms of Hyposomatotropism", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I concentrations decline exponentially with age beginning in young adulthood, thus resulting in progressive biochemical hyposomatotropism . Whereas the causes of hyposomatotropism in aged individuals are not established, two powerful co-predictors of relative GH deficiency are age, sex-steroid depletion and increased abdominal visceral fat (Erickson et al. 2005;Iranmanesh et al. 1998;Veldhuis et al. 2005b;Weltman et al. 1994). Epidemiological data correlate hyposomatotropism with osteopenia, sarcopenia, intraabdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic risk and diminished quality of life. From a mechanistic perspective, the fall in systemic GH and IGF-I availability is due principally to decreased GH secretion. In particular, aging does not alter the elimination kinetics of GH, reduce hypoglycemia-stimulated GH release, or impair hepatic IGF-I production in response to exogenous GH (Arvat et al. 1998;Lissett and Shalet 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Role of estrogen depletion in aging-related hyposomatotropism", "text": "Estrogen is the primary sex-steroid agonist of GH secretion in both women and men. (Veldhuis et al. 2006;Veldhuis et al. 2005a). Estrogens are synthesized from androgen substrates via the aromatase enzyme expressed in the brain, pituitary gland, ovary, fat, muscle, liver, kidney, and other tissues. Actions of E 2 may be mediated in principle via ER-alpha, ER-beta, and membrane receptors; modified by prominent target cell-specific factors; and diversified by the negative impact of age and body fat and feedback by GH and IGF-I (Veldhuis et al. 2006). What remains unclear is how age, estrogen and visceral adiposity jointly regulate the secretion of GH. The proximate cause of diminished GH concentrations in aging individuals is small GH pulses, as quantified by less GH secreted per burst (defined as \u00b5g GH released per unit distribution volume per pulse). Age does not affect GH pulse frequency, GH half-life or basal (constitutive) GH release (Gentili et al. 2002;Iranmanesh et al. 1998;Shah et al. 1999). Impoverished pulsatile GH secretion has directed investigative focus to the core mechanisms that drive highamplitude GH pulses (Veldhuis et al. 2005a). Basic laboratory studies have helped in the dissection of regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, the species specificity of sex-steroid actions makes inferences gained in the rat, mouse, pig and sheep illustrative of, rather than definitive to, the human (Veldhuis et al. 2006). For example, estrogens repress and nonaromatizable androgens increase pulsatile GH secretion in the rat, but exert opposite effects in the human. Accurate clinical studies require specific high-sensitivity GH assays, frequent blood sampling, recombinant peptides, validated analytical methods and model-assisted formulations (Veldhuis et al. 2005a;Veldhuis et al. 2006). GH production doubles in the E 2 -enriched preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, and is higher in pre-than postmenopausal women or comparably aged men (Weltman et al. 1994). Acute and long-term estrogen administration to girls with Turner's syndrome, postmenopausal women, male-to-female transsexual patients and men with prostatic cancer elevates GH concentrations by 1.8 to 3.3-fold (Veldhuis et al. 2005a). The route is not critical to driving GH, since each of i.v., i.m., oral, intravaginal, intranasal and higher-dose transdermal E 2 stimulates GH secretion. However, oral estrogens result in momentarily higher hepatic concentrations of E 2 than transdermal estrogen due to the brief estrogen pulse and the absorptive pathway. Indeed, enterically delivered E 2 tends to suppress hepatic IGF-I production more and fat oxidation less, while elevating hepatic fibrinogen, angiotensinogen and IGFBP-1 concentrations more, than transdermally conveyed E 2 . However, equivalent serum E 2 concentrations derived from oral and transdermal administration amplify GH secretion comparably in postmenopausal women (Friend et al. 1996). A recent clinical model employs a transdermal estrogen clamp imposed by gonadotropin downregulation and E 2 addback to mimic steady-state physiology (Erickson et al. 2004;Erickson et al. 2005). One may thereby dissect age-dependent mechanisms of GH secretion at experimentally defined E 2 concentrations in young and older women. During controlled transdermal estrogen repletion, age contributed > 75% of the variability in pulsatile GH secretion both in the fasting state and after secretagogue infusion (Erickson et al. 2004;Erickson et al. 2005): Figure 5. Conversely, despite comparable estrogen depletion, premenopausal women maintained 2-fold higher GH and IGF-I concentrations than postmenopausal individuals (Veldhuis et al. 2005b). The attenuating effect of age may be altered by estrogen-independent factors like concomitant visceral adiposity, inflammatory cytokines, regulatory peptides, catecholamines, thyroxine, cortisol and free fatty acids (Veldhuis et al. 2006). Distinguishing E 2 -dependent and E 2 -independent mechanisms of impaired GH and IGF-I production constitutes a major step toward discerning new steroidal and nonsteroidal strategies to maintain GH and IGF-I availability in aging women. Nonsteroidal interventions would have particular relevance in elderly women with elevated risk for neoplastic, cerebro-and cardiovascular, thrombophlebitic or cholestatic disease."}, {"section_title": "Concept of ensemble-peptide control", "text": "The amount of GH secreted in pulses is significant for several basic reasons, viz.: (a) aging primarily reduces pulsatile GH production; (b) pulsatile (rather than basal time-invariant) GH secretion constitutes the majority (88-94%) of total daily GH output; and (c) the size of GH pulses is determined by a well articulated ensemble of key peptides; viz., growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and peptide (ghrelin, GHRP) feedforward and somatostatin (SS)mediated feedback by GH and IGF-I (Gentili et al. 2002;Shah et al. 1999;Veldhuis et al. 2006;Veldhuis et al. 2007a;Veldhuis et al. 2005b). Figure 6 schematizes key reciprocal connections among the foregoing primary peptidic signals. The reciprocal, time-delayed nature of network interactions necessitates novel analytical methods to reconstruct and quantify ensemble control objectively. To this end, several simplified biomathematical constructs embody consensus linkages among GHRH, SS and ghrelin (Farhy et al. 2007;Farhy and Veldhuis 2005). At present, such models permit simulation but not quantitation, which remains necessary to assist in the interpretation of experimental outcomes. Mechanistic clinical experiments document that age reduces the GH response to individual peptidic secretagogues (Veldhuis et al. 2005a). GH stimuli unaffected by aging are insulininduced hypoglycemia and combined GHRH, GHRP and L-arginine injection [the last, to limit SS outflow] (Arvat et al. 1998;Veldhuis et al. 2006). Recent clinical investigations demonstrate that short-term E 2 supplementation significantly, but not fully, overcomes attenuated secretagogue actions in postmenopausal women. In particular, estrogen repletion: (i) doubles the stimulatory potency of exogenous GHRH; (ii) halves the inhibitory potency of infused SS-14; (iii) potentiates submaximal feedforward by synthetic GHRP and native ghrelin; (iv) mutes negative feedback by injected GH; and (v) paradoxically accentuates feedback by recombinant human (rh) IGF-I: Figure 7. Thus, E 2 supplementation in elderly women primarily controls the physiological potency rather than pharmacological efficacy of GHRH, SS, ghrelin, GH and IGF-I. A pivotal mechanism of amplifying GH secretion is synergy between ghrelin and GHRH. Transgenic knockdown of the ghrelin-receptor gene in tyrosine hydoxylase-expressing neurons decreases GH and IGF-I concentrations and somatic growth by 30% in the female animal (Shuto et al. 2002). The mechanisms involve a reduction in the density of hypothalamic GHRHexpressing neurons and in GH pulse size. The data indicate that ghrelin normally is trophic to GHRH neurons and probably amplifies the amount of GHRH secreted. Missense mutations of the human ghrelin-receptor gene decrease cell-surface expression and constitutive signaling, and are associated with short stature (Pantel et al. 2006). One would predict that such patients have small GH pulses of normal frequency, according to a model in which brain ghrelin receptors mediate amplification of GHRH outflow (Farhy et al. 2007;Farhy and Veldhuis 2005;Veldhuis et al. 2006;Veldhuis et al. 2007a)."}, {"section_title": "Significance of GH outflow to target tissues", "text": "GH governs anabolism by inducing in situ IGF-I production and modifying IGFBP availability in local target tissues, stimulating lipolysis, prechondrocyte proliferation and growth of erythroid precursors, and driving hepatic and renal secretion of IGF-I and certain IGFBP's (Veldhuis et al. 2006). The trophic contribution of blood-borne IGF-I (somatomedin hypothesis) to peripheral tissues is not exclusive, since marked depletion of systemic IGF-I concentrations achieved transgenically in mice does not restrict somatic growth after birth, but impairs carbohydrate balance and reduces bone density in later adulthood (Sjogren et al. 2001;Yakar et al. 2001). Sex steroids regulate the effects of GH, IGF-I and IGFBP's in target tissues. For example, GH induces and E 2 potentiates brain IGF-I production, turnover and signaling, thereby putatively enhancing neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation and memory (Veldhuis et al. 2006). Estrogen stimulates expression of the GH-receptor gene in human osteoblastic cells and (via a female pattern of GH secretion) upregulates the LDL-receptor gene in liver cells (Slootweg et al. 1997). Conversely, E 2 blocks GH-induced IGF-I synthesis in liver by activating an autoinhibitory pathway, SOCS [suppressor of cytokine synthesis]. In the liver, > 850 genes are male-pattern selective and > 750 genes female-selective due to strong dependence on gender-defined GH pulse patterns. Certain of these gene transcripts are uniquely affected by the aging process.

Detailed bodycompositional and functional assessments in men revealed a decline in abdominal visceral fat (AVF), an increase in lean-body mass, and a decrease in stair-climbing and walking times: Figure 8. Concomitantly, GH and IGF-I concentrations rose by 1.8-2.1-fold. These outcomes are consistent with (but not proof of) the hypothesis that GHRH deficiency exists in the elderly and that amelioration of GHRH deficiency may have salutary effects. The implications of putatively impaired ghrelin drive in older adults were explored recently in a 1-mo trial of continuous s.c. GHRP-2 infusion. GHRP-2 is a synthetic hexapeptide analog of ghrelin. During the second and fourth wk of the intervention, GHRP-2 infusion stimulated 24-h GH secretion by 1.45-fold and elevated IGF-I concentrations by 1.65-fold : Figure 9. In absolute terms, responses were greater in women than men. What is not known is whether favorable body-compositional, biochemical and functional performance changes can be induced by such regimens. Preliminary investigations by Nagaya et al. reported trophic effects of ghrelin in cachectic patients with congestive heart failure (Nagaya et al. 2004). Beneficial effects included increases in cardiac ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption, skeletal muscle strength and Karnofsky performance score. A major unresolved issue is whether augmented GH and IGF-I availability in frail elderly individuals would be safe and beneficial. The consequences of diminished production of GH and IGF-I in aging adults might in theory be overcome by supplementation with recombinant GH. However, there are no safety data that justify long-term GH administration in healthy older individuals.

How the safety profiles of these 3 regimens differ is not yet known."}, {"section_title": "Mechanistic bases for impaired GH secretion in older men", "text": "Clinical studies establish that GH, IGF-I and Te concentrations begin to decline in early adulthood (Iranmanesh et al. 1998;Liu et al. 2005a;Veldhuis et al. 2007b;Weltman et al. 1994). Understanding the genesis of hyposomatotropism and hypoandrogenemia in aging is important, because both states correlate with intraabdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular mortality, sarcopenia, osteopenia, cognitive loss and diminished quality of life. In addition, sex-steroid depletion and visceral obesity are jointly correlated, and strongly predict GH and IGF-I deficiency (Gentili et al. 2002;Liu et al. 2005a;Shah et al. 1999;Veldhuis et al. 2005a;Veldhuis et al. 2006;Veldhuis et al. 2007b;Weltman et al. 1994). The relevance of relative Te deprivation in aging men is indicated by the fact that supplementation with Te for 2 wk or 6 mo stimulates GH production in older and hypogonadal individuals, but not in Te-replete young men (Gentili et al. 2002;Muniyappa et al. 2007): Figure 12. A prevailing view is that systemic aromatization of Te to estradiol (E 2 ) mediates androgenic drive of GH secretion in young adults. However, this inference may be too narrow, inasmuch as Te but not E 2 elevates IGF-I concentrations and blunts negative feedback by IGF-I (Brill et al. 2002;Gentili et al. 2002). Conversely, E 2 but not Te lowers IGF-I concentrations and abbreviates GH secretory bursts (Erickson et al. 2004;Erickson et al. 2005;Shah et al. 1999). Thus, the question arises whether certain products of Te metabolism modulate GH secretion in a manner distinct from that of E 2 . A central principle is that aging selectively reduces, whereas Te supplementation augments, pulsatile GH production by regulating the amount (mass) of GH secreted in each burst (Gentili et al. 2002;Iranmanesh et al. 1998;Muniyappa et al. 2007). In contradistinction, neither age nor Te availability determines GH pulse frequency, pharmacologically stimulated GH secretion, GH elimination kinetics or the hepatic action of GH to stimulate IGF-I production (Arvat et al. 1998;Gentili et al. 2002;Lissett and Shalet 2003;Muniyappa et al. 2007;Veldhuis et al. 2006). Therefore, a major investigative issue becomes, How do age and Te availability together control GH secretory-burst size? Clinical studies are needed to address this query, because estrogens suppress and nonaromatizable androgens augment GH pulse size in the rat, but exert opposite effects in the human. However, the size (mass) of GH secretory bursts is determined by species-independent peptidyl signals, which include GHRH, somatostatin (SS), ghrelin/GHRP, GH and IGF-I (Veldhuis et al. 2006): Figure 6. The 5 peptides interact by way of time-delayed, reciprocal, concentration-dependent, nonlinear dose-response interfaces, which are not observed directly (Farhy et al. 2007;Farhy and Veldhuis 2005). This ensemble can be simulated by simplified biomathematical constructs of key feedback and feedforward connections that are both necessary and sufficient to confer self-renewing, high-amplitude GH secretory bursts (Farhy et al. 2007;Farhy and Veldhuis 2005). What remains lacking are analytical capabilities to estimate unobserved interactions."}, {"section_title": "Investigative strategies", "text": "A necessary consequence of multisignal control is that a change in any one pathway alters output of all connecting loci. For example, suppose that Te (like E 2 ) potentiates a submaximal GHRH stimulus (Veldhuis et al. 2003). This outcome could signify that Te: (a) upregulates somatotrope GHRH receptors; (b) augments GHRH-releasable GH stores; (c) attenuates SSergic inhibition; (d) reduces negative feedback by GH or IGF-I; and/or (e) enhances stimulation by ghrelin, which synergizes with GHRH (Veldhuis et al. 2005a). To determine which mechanisms actually pertains requires not only accounting for all ensemble interactions correctly ( Figure 6), but also constructing relevant peptide-infusion paradigms to unmask endogenous signaling."}, {"section_title": "Insights from new analytical tools", "text": "The ensemble schema in Figure 6 incorporates recently discovered ghrelin (Farhy and Veldhuis 2005), which is both an appetitive stimulus and a potent activator of the GHRP receptor. Ghrelin and its cognate receptor are expressed primarily in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, stomach and vasculature (Kojima et al. 1999). Analyses of GH secretory bursts induced by a synthetic ghrelin analog, GHRP-2, has revealed that this class of peptides augments the mass of GH secreted per burst, and stimulates rapid exocytosis of GH stores, possibly by repressing SS outflow (Veldhuis et al.2005e). Increasing age in men reduces GHRP-2 efficacy in the presence or absence of imposed negative feedback by GH (Veldhuis et al. 2005c): Figure 13A. Age also attenuates percentage feedback inhibition by a pulse of GH, raising the possibility of decreased brain GH-receptor signaling (Veldhuis et al. 2005c): Figure 13B. Testosterone does not augment GHRP efficacy, but blunts feedback inhibition by both GH and IGF-I (Veldhuis et al. 2005e;Veldhuis et al. 2005c;Veldhuis et al. 2004a)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Te on the actions of GH and IGF-I", "text": "Sex steroids regulate tissue-specific effects of GH and IGF-I (Pons and Torres-Aleman 1993;Yu et al. 2003). Te potentiates selected anabolic actions of GH and IGF-I (Gibney et al. 2005), whereas E 2 can both antagonize and potentiate GH/IGF-I signaling depending upon the target tissue. Positive interactions suggest that combined GH and Te deficiencies would be especially detrimental to bone, muscle, brain and metabolic regulation in aging individuals."}, {"section_title": "Clinical implications", "text": "Androgen-deprivation therapy in men with prostatic cancer reduces concentrations of both Te and GH. Significant sequelae in such patients include osteopenia, sarcopenia, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, decreased physical stamina, hip and vertebral fractures and reduced quality of life (Chen et al. 2002). Nonetheless, no data establish the safety of GH or IGF-I administration in the setting of prior neoplasia. The concern reflects epidemiological linkages between GH/IGF-I availability and risk of colonic polyposis, breast-cancer growth and prostatic cancer."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Gradual age-related depletion of anabolic hormones (Te and GH/IGF-I) putatively contributes to frailty, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, osteopenia, sarcopenia and (possibly) impaired cognitive function.
