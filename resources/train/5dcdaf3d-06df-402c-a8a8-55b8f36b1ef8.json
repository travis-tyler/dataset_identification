[{"section_title": "", "text": "These tables present detailed data on (S&E) doctorates recipients, with some totals provided for broad non-S&E fields. Detailed data on non-S&E fields are published by the National Research Council and by other Federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates. The groupings of field specialties into broad fields may differ among the sponsoring agencies according to their missions. vii Approximately 93 percent of the annual cohort of doctorate recipients in 1996 responded to the questionnaire. Over the decade, though, the response rate ranged from 95 percent in 1987, then declined to 91 percent in 1989, then increased to 93 percent in 1996. Note that most of the numbers presented are actual self-reports, as there are no adjustments for nonresponse. For the nonrespondents, partial data from public sources are added to the file for nonrespondents; therefore, complete counts are presented for conferred doctorates by field of study and sex of recipient. Although some tables present data subject to nonresponse, the estimates represent the conservative known estimate for any data item. Therefore, small changes in numbers should be interpreted with caution, as numerical trends are affected by fluctuations in response rates and declines and increases may appear greater than they may be in reality.  (S&E) fields in the last 20 years. Much of this growth is due to increasing numbers of foreign citizens on temporary visas who come to the United States to earn doctorates in S&E. In 1977, they earned 18 percent of all S&E doctorates and by 1996, they accounted for 30 percent. However, there have also been increases in U.S. citizens and immigrants holding permanent residence visas earning S&E doctorates. Increases among this group have been due to growing numbers of women' and racial/ethnic minorities, mostly Asian-Americans. However, the number of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians awarded S&E doctorates also increased in the last 20 years, especially in the 5-year period from 1992-96 (Table A). Even with these increases, Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians remain severely underrepresented among S&E doctorates recipients where they comprised less than 8 percent of the total, compared with 13 percent of S&E bachelor's degrees recipients, for example.' Table B provides the doctoral award data for these groups in broad fields within science and engineering and non-S&E for 5-year periods from 1977-96.  Table B.
