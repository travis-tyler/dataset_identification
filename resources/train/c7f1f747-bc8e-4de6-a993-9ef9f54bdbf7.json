[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents selected findings about the employment and educational outcomes of bachelor's degree recipients 10 years after they completed their degrees. These findings are based on data from the 2008/18 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/18). B&B:08/18 is the third follow-up in a nationally representative longitudinal study of students who completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree during the 2007-08 academic year. The first follow-up, which was conducted in 2009, one year after their graduation, explored both undergraduate education experiences and early postbaccalaureate employment and enrollment. 1 The second follow-up, conducted in 2012, examined bachelor's degree recipients' labor market experiences and enrollment in additional degree programs through the 4th year after graduation. This third follow-up, conducted in 2018, explores labor market experiences, financial aid debt and repayment, and postbaccalaureate enrollment through the 10th year after graduation. The Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) series of data collections allows researchers to address questions regarding bachelor's degree recipients' undergraduate experiences, including their participation in various financial aid programs, student loan debt and repayment of that debt; entrance into and progress through postbaccalaureate education; and employment, particularly for graduates who became elementary or secondary teachers. B&B also includes items to help policymakers and researchers better understand the teacher pipeline and experiences and outcomes of teachers. This First Look focuses on a subset of topics that can be examined with the B&B:08/18 data: financial well-being, student loan borrowing and repayment, postbaccalaureate enrollment, employment outcomes, and teaching status. The purpose of this report is to illustrate the range of information available in B&B:08/18. The selected findings present a selection of the estimates that can be obtained from the data. Readers are cautioned not to infer causality from the estimates in this report. Many of the variables presented are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "were determined to be eligible for B&B:08/18. Eligible students were those who had enrolled at an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and was located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; and had completed requirements for a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008. These students represent the approximately 1.6 million students who completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008. The Selected Findings section of this report presents findings from the detailed estimate tables that are included in appendix A along with their standard error tables.

B&B is a follow-up to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and focuses exclusively on students who completed requirements for their baccalaureate degrees during the NPSAS academic year. B&B follows these students, first identified in NPSAS, to monitor their progress over a period of up to 10 years. B&B, therefore, focuses on issues relevant to bachelor's degree recipients, such as workforce participation and earnings, enrollment and persistence in additional education, and educational debt repayment. The 2008 Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B:08) cohort is the third cohort of bachelor's degree recipients to be tracked by NCES since the first cohort was selected in 1993. The 2008/09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09), conducted in 2009, was the first wave of data collection with this cohort, and the 2008/12 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12), in 2012, was the second wave. The 2008/18 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/18) is the third follow-up of the same cohort.

The weights adjust for unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:08 sample. The weights also adjust for multiplicity 3 at the student level and unknown student eligibility for NPSAS:08, as well as for subsampling of potential B&B:08/18-eligible students. Finally, the weights adjust for nonresponse and population coverage in B&B:08/18. Because some B&B:08/18 respondents were nonrespondents in NPSAS:08, B&B:08/09 PETS, B&B:08/09, and/or B&B:08/12, multiple analysis weights were constructed for B&B:08/18. The first weight (WTG000 4 ) is a cross-sectional weight and was used for the estimates in this report, but it can also be used as a bookend weight because all B&B:08/18 respondents also responded in NPSAS:08. The four other weights (WTH000 through WTK000) correspond to different combinations of prior-round response status. Missing data were imputed for all variables used in this report and many variables included in the related PowerStats and QuickStats applications. Additional details regarding the creation and use of weights and imputation procedures are available in the B&B:08/18 data file documentation (Cominole et al. forthcoming)."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates and Nonresponse Biases", "text": "As shown in table B-5, the B&B:08/18 weighted interview response rate was 78.9 percent overall and ranged from 70.3 percent for private for-profit institutions to 79.9 percent for public institutions. Because the response rates are below 85 percent, a student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within each category of institution control, as required by NCES statistical standards (Seastrom 2014). Bias due to interview nonresponse was estimated for characteristics known for most respondents and nonrespondents. These characteristics include institution-and student-level variables available from CPS and NPSAS:08, as well as updated NSLDS information. Bias was estimated before and after nonresponse weight adjustment to examine the impact of the nonresponse adjustment. The bias was estimated for each category of the institution-or student-level variable as the weighted difference between the means (proportions) of the respondents and the means of the full sample. The analyses found little evidence of nonresponse bias and that most statistically significant differences between the respondent mean and the full sample mean were eliminated by the nonresponse adjustment. Before the nonresponse weight adjustment, the median percent relative bias across characteristics ranged from 3 to 10 percent, and median effect size ranged from .04 to .11. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, the median percent relative bias across characteristics ranged from 0 to 8 percent, and median effect size ranged from .00 to .07. For more information on the student interview nonresponse bias analysis, refer to the B&B:08/18 data file documentation (Cominole et al. forthcoming). Of the 65 variables used in this report, item nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the 35 items that had a weighted response rate below 85 percent overall or in at least one control group. The analysis procedures were similar to those used in the unit bias analysis. The analyses found little evidence of bias. Before imputation, the median percent relative bias across characteristics for these items ranged from 4 to 24 percent, and median effect size ranged from .05 to .23. While bias after imputation is not directly measurable, differences in estimates before and after imputation generally indicate a reduction in bias after imputation, whereas no change suggests that bias was not reduced or was not present. Nineteen out of 35 variables had a statistically significant difference or at least one category-level Nonsampling errors are due to a number of issues, including but not limited to nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. A study like B&B:08/18 includes multiple sources of data for some variables (NSLDS, institution records, student interviews, etc.), and reporting differences can occur among data sources. To protect study respondents' confidentiality, data swapping and other forms of perturbation were implemented, which can also lead to inconsistencies."}, {"section_title": "Comparing B&B Estimates Across Time", "text": "Comparison of results with prior cohorts of B&B requires compensation for two changes in the design of the base-year NPSAS survey over time and also for several changes in variable definitions within B&B:08 over time. First, prior to NPSAS:04, institutions that only offered correspondence courses were not eligible for NPSAS. Beginning in 2004, NPSAS has included such institutions if they were eligible to distribute Title IV student aid. This change affects comparisons between the B&B:93 and B&B:2000 cohorts and the subsequent B&B:08 cohort. Second, as of NPSAS:2000, the survey was restricted to institutions participating in Title IV student aid programs. Based on NPSAS:96 data, only about 1 percent of sampled undergraduates were attending an institution that was not eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs. When students attending non-Title IV eligible institutions were excluded from the NPSAS:96 sample, the percentage of undergraduates who received financial aid increased by less than 1 percent. This small change primarily affects comparisons of students enrolled in less-than-2-year and private for-profit institutions. When comparing estimates from B&B:93 with those of the B&B:2000 and B&B:08 cohorts, analysts may want to exclude cases that were sampled from an institution that was not eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs (T4ELIG) in B&B:93. Within the B&B:08 cohort, B&B:08/18 data differ from prior rounds in a few ways. First, in B&B:08/18, the concept of primary job was updated to look at current employment only, regardless of the duration of the job. However, when respondents had more than one current job, rather than selecting the job with the greatest number of hours worked per week, the job held for the longest duration was selected as the respondent's current job. Second, only respondents who taught as regular classroom teachers at the kindergarten through 12th-grade level between the B&B:08/12 data collection and the B&B:08/18 data collection provided teaching experience details. Finally, B&B:08/18 updated the derivation of several debt and repayment variables in order to provide more comprehensive, accurate, and usable data. B&B:08/18 variables based on NSLDS data were derived without the filter that removed loans borrowed prior to July 1995. To account for scenarios where loans may be missing from the repayment table despite being in repayment or may be included in the repayment table despite existing arrangements to postpone payment, B&B:08/18 redefined a federal student loan to be in repayment if the loan had a remaining balance and was not in deferment or forbearance. B&B:08/18 also revised repayment status (B3PAYSTAT) to reflect the status of all of a respondent's federal and private loans. In addition, B&B:08/18 reclassified some repayment plan types based on similarities in repayment terms, amounts, and qualifications. Lastly, B&B:08/18 measures of private student loan borrowing (B3PRIVLN and B3PRIVCUM) may not align with their prior-round equivalents (B2PRIVLN and B2PRIVAMT) due to (1) reprioritization and use of alternate sources, (2) priorround editing, and (3) prior-round imputations.

PowerStats can use replicate weights produced with balanced repeated replication, jackknifing, or bootstrapping to generate the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences in the estimates. PowerStats also describes how each variable was created and includes question wording for variables based on a specific survey item. With PowerStats, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to producing percentages or means, PowerStats users can conduct linear or logistic regressions. Many options for output of regression results are available. For a description of these options, visit the PowerStats website at https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx.
