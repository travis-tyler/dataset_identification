In this review, we discuss the concept of healthy vascular aging (HVA) with regard to definition and contributing mechanisms, existing and promising HVA-enhancing lifestyle-and pharmacological-based strategies, and future directions. The focus will be primarily on data from observational and intervention studies in humans."}, {"section_title": "Components of HVA and Related Implications", "text": "Arterial stiffening and increases in BP occur with advancing age [4] [5] [6] [7] although population-based studies indicate that this is not an inevitable consequence of aging but rather results from an industrialized lifestyle. 12, 13 The prevalence of hypertension dramatically increases with advancing age, affecting approximately two thirds of Americans \u226560 years. 3 Hypertension is also highly prevalent in populations with chronic disease, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 14, 15 The most recent Joint National Commission 8 guidelines increased the BP treatment goal for individuals >60 years of age to <150/90 mm Hg with a goal of <140/90 mm Hg in adults 30 to 59 years of age, including individuals with diabetes mellitus and nondiabetic CKD. 16 However, the recently completed multicenter randomized controlled trial, SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), conducted nationwide in >9000 adults 17 challenged these guidelines. SPRINT was terminated early as a consequence of a 25% lower risk of the composite end point of CV events and death in individuals randomized to intensive BP lowering (systolic BP [SBP] <120 mm Hg) compared with standard treatment (SBP <140 mm Hg). Notably, this finding was persistent across subgroups, including CKD and older adults (\u226575 years of age). 18 Although the technique used for BP measurement in SPRINT has been discussed, 19 the results of the trial have been influential because a new report from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Task Force of Clinical Practice Guidelines now defines high BP as \u2265130/80 mm Hg for all ages. 20 Large elastic artery stiffening (ie, aorta and carotid arteries) also occurs with advancing age and is greater at any age in patients with chronic disease, including CKD, 21 diabetes mellitus, 22 and hypertension. 23 As a result, these and other clinical disorders featuring such CV changes can be viewed as states of accelerated vascular aging. Multiple techniques exist to assess arterial stiffness, including local distensibility (eg, ultrasound and tonometry-measured carotid artery compliance), the carotid or aortic augmentation index, aortic distensibility by magnetic resonance imaging, and pulse-wave velocity (PWV; assessed between 2 arterial segments), as reviewed elsewhere. [24] [25] [26] Of note, augmentation index is generally not considered an accurate marker of arterial stiffness because it is strongly influenced by heart rate, height, and contractility and decreases in older age. 24, 25 As a result, augmentation index has not been included in the present assessment of the literature. Carotid-femoral PWV (CFPWV) is considered the gold-standard technique, measuring stiffness of the aorta, 27 and can be measured by applanation tonometry or Doppler flow recordings. Unlike arterial BP, no formal medical guidelines or targets exist for CFPWV nor is CFPWV routinely measured clinically; however, both 12 and 10 m/s have been suggested as cutoffs for increased risk of CV events. 27, 28 Arterial stiffness and BP/hypertension are dynamically interconnected, with each factor influencing the other in a bidirectional manner. Although arterial stiffness was long considered to be a complication of hypertension, there is growing evidence that arterial stiffening can precede the increase in SBP and that an elevation of SBP further augments arterial stiffness. [29] [30] [31] Arterial stiffness increases in the aorta and carotid arteries with aging, with a lack of stiffening in the large peripheral muscular arteries, thus reducing peripheral impedance to the forward component of the arterial pulse-wave and increasing pulsatile energy transmission to the microcirculation. 32 This increased blood flow and pressure pulsatility can lead to damage of high flow, low impedance organs, including the kidneys and brain. 32 Indeed, increases in arterial stiffness are associated with declines in renal function 21, 33 and are considered a hallmark of end-stage renal disease. 34 CFPWV is also independently associated with cognitive decline, 35, 36 consistent with the concept of increased pulsatile energy transmission damaging the brain microcirculation and parenchymal tissues.\nIn addition, aortic stiffening-associated increases in pressure pulsatility and systolic load promote left ventricular remodeling featuring hypertrophy and dysfunction. 37, 38 Recently in this journal, Niiranen et al 39 demonstrated in a community-dwelling cohort of middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults from the Framingham Heart Study that HVA was independently associated with lower risk of incident CV events. HVA was defined as CFPWV <7.6 m/s (mean\u00b12 SD of a reference group of individuals <30 years of age) in combination with absence of hypertension (using the previous guideline SBP/diastolic BP cutoff of 140/90 mm Hg; Figure 1 ). These findings are consistent with evidence that increased CFPWV is an independent predictor of incident CV events and mortality 8, 9 and improves prediction over traditional risk factors alone, including BP. 8, 40 Building on the concept of HVA, this review will discuss mechanisms influencing HVA, as well as preventive strategies and therapeutic approaches for preserving/attaining HVA. Of note, few interventions have achieved HVA in individuals or groups that lack HVA status at baseline when applying the definition used in the Framingham Heart Study. 39 As such, we will include studies that achieved significant CFPWV lowering, with or without changes in BP, even if full restoration of HVA status was not attained. Last, although the Framingham Heart Study definition of HVA used SBP and diastolic BP to define BP component of this index, it should be emphasized that mean arterial pressure exerts an important physiological influence on arterial stiffness 41 and must be considered when assessing changes in CFPWV in response to the preventive and treatment strategies discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms Influencing HVA", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Modulation of BP With Aging", "text": "As the large elastic arteries become stiffer with aging, SBP increases, whereas diastolic BP decreases because of lessening of elastic recoil of the aorta 29, 42 ; as a result, pulse pressure widens with advancing age. 43 Isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in individuals \u226550 years. 44 Increases in large elastic artery stiffness are a major contributor to these changes in BP with aging, ultimately promoting the development of systolic hypertension. [29] [30] [31] Age-associated endothelial dysfunction featuring decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased endothelin-1 production, as well as dysregulated vascular tone, further contribute to increased SBP ( Figure 2) . 45, 46 These events are mediated, in part, by increased oxidative stress associated with excessive superoxide production. 47 An interaction between the immune system and hypertension also may be involved because immune activation and inflammation promoted by oxidative stress are implicated in the development of hypertension. 48 In addition, with advancing age, sympathetic nervous system activity increases, and the association between sympathetic nervous system activity and BP becomes stronger, particularly in women. 49 Furthermore, chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system promotes target organ damage, including the kidney and heart, because angiotensin II induces both increased BP and reactive oxygen species production."}, {"section_title": "50", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Modulation of Arterial Stiffness With Aging", "text": "Both functional and structural influences modulate arterial stiffness with aging. Functionally, arterial stiffness is modulated, in part, by the vasoconstrictor tone produced by the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells. 42 Ageassociated vascular endothelial dysfunction interacts closely with arterial stiffness 51 as endothelial NO synthase uncoupling can promote vascular remodeling and increased arterial stiffness via decreased NO bioavailability, 52, 53 which may be exacerbated by oxidative stress. 54, 55 Age-associated neurohumoral dysfunction, resulting from decreased sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity and increased sympathetic activation, also promotes arterial stiffness, and vice-versa. 56 Systemic inflammation, which also increases with aging, may contribute to arterial stiffness via immune activation and the development of hypertension. 57 Structurally, extracellular matrix remodeling alters the composition of elastin and collagen in the large elastic arteries with advancing age. The medial layer undergoes elastin fragmentation and degradation, 43, 58 which is mediated, in part, by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases. 59 Collagen deposition occurs, replacing the loss of elastin molecules, 43, 58 and accelerated formation of advanced glycation end products promotes cross-linking of structural proteins and exacerbates increases in arterial stiffness. 60 Oxidative stress and inflammation drive these structural changes via vascular damage, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and arterial remodeling. 61, 62 Angiotensin II may also modulate structural contributions to arterial stiffness by stimulating collagen formation, reducing elastin synthesis, and promoting matrix remodeling in addition to influencing NO signaling and reactive oxygen species production. 63 Not only do changes in the extracellular matrix contribute to arterial stiffness, but intrinsic stiffening of the vascular smooth muscle cells, as measured by atomic force microscopy, also occurs with aging as well as hypertension. 64, 65 Of note, intimal-medial thickening occurs with aging even in the absence of atherosclerotic plaques, mediated primarily by thickening of the intima, 10 and is positively correlated with CFPWV in older adults. 66, 67 Age-associated disease processes, including diabetes mellitus (via impaired glucose tolerance) 68 and CKD (via vascular calcification), 69 can further exacerbate arterial stiffness.\nIt is difficult to separate hypertension and arterial stiffness because of their bidirectional interaction, common mechanisms, and overlapping presence in aging and age-associated disease. Although hypertension can promote aortic stiffening, large elastic artery stiffening may precede and promote an increase in SBP. 29, 38 Large elastic artery stiffness is an independent predictor of incident hypertension in multiple longitudinal cohorts. 30, 70, 71 In addition, in rodents fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet, increased aortic PWV is evident before an elevation in SBP. 31 Notably, there are some interventions that have reduced arterial stiffness in a manner deemed at least partially BP independent. [72] [73] [74] [75] Although, in general, interventions with the most profound influence on CFPWV typically also demonstrate a large SBP-lowering effect, there are examples in which arterial stiffness is reduced without lowering SBP. Of note, most of these latter examples have tended to be in populations without hypertension. Arterial stiffness and BP may be even more tightly intertwined when BP is already elevated."}, {"section_title": "Lifestyle-Based Strategies to Maintain or", "text": "Restore HVA\nIn this section, we will focus on lifestyle-based strategies (aerobic exercise, caloric restriction-based weight loss, and changes in diet composition) with evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating a reduction in CFPWV with or without changes in SBP.

Subsequently, a similar observation was made in postmenopausal women with normal BP. 78 Consistent with these cross-sectional findings, intervention studies conducted in healthy MA/O adults have demonstrated a significant reduction in arterial stiffness with aerobic exercise training. This was first demonstrated as an improvement in carotid artery compliance after a 3-month walking program administered to men, 79 and later to postmenopausal women, 80 consistent with earlier evidence of reduced arterial stiffness with 4 weeks of exercise training in healthy young sedentary men. 81 Although a moderate intensity aerobic exercise intervention of similar duration was later shown to reduce CFPWV in healthy MA/O men 82 and women, 83 the reductions in CFPWV were small and not clearly independent of small decreases in BP. Moreover, no improvement in CFPWV with exercise was observed in a year-long study conducted in healthy older adults, 84 and similar findings were reported in a group of overweight MA/O adults. 85 In general, these trials on aerobic exercise and arterial stiffness in normotensive healthy adults reported little or no change in SBP.\nThe available evidence indicates a lack of efficacy of moderate intensity aerobic exercise for reducing CFPWV in MA/O adults with hypertension 86, 87 although exercise has been reported to reduce CFPWV in young to middle-aged prehypertensive and hypertensive adults. 88 A recent meta-analysis of 14 aerobic exercise trials conducted in prehypertensive and hypertensive adults concluded that aerobic exercise does not reduce arterial stiffness although various indices of arterial stiffness were combined in this analysis. 89 The efficacy of an aerobic exercise intervention to reduce arterial stiffness in the setting of age-associated disease is mixed. Although reductions in CFPWV and SBP have been observed with exercise training in adults with metabolic syndrome, 90 aerobic exercise has been reported to both lower and have no effect on CFPWV and SBP in MA/O adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 91, 92 Similarly, aerobic exercise does not seem to reduce CFPWV or SBP in patients with moderate to severe CKD 93, 94 although intradialytic exercise (ie, during a dialysis session) may be efficacious in chronic dialysis patients. 95 Overall, aerobic exercise seems to be an evidence-based public health strategy for maintaining or restoring HVA in the setting of healthy (nonhypertensive) aging and in some diseases associated with accelerated vascular aging although there are some inconsistencies across studies. The improvements in CFPWV seem at times to be independent of any change in BP, particularly in healthy MA/O adults who are free from hypertension. Of note, in contrast to aerobic exercise, resistance exercise training does not seem to reduce arterial stiffness, 96 and intensive resistance exercise training performed without complementary aerobic exercise activities may actually increase CFPWV in young healthy individuals, 97 consistent with earlier cross-sectional observations. 98 Of note to public health translation, however, are data indicating limited adherence to aerobic exercise in long-term trials 99 and in accordance with federal activity guidelines."}, {"section_title": "100", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Weight Loss and Total Energy Intake", "text": "Short-term (ie, \u22643 months) caloric restriction-based weight loss administered in MA/O healthy overweight and obese adults significantly reduces CFPWV.

Caloric restriction-based weight loss is also efficacious for reducing CFPWV when administered in conjunction with other lifestyle interventions. Weight loss from an energy-restricted diet plus exercise reduces CFPWV and slightly decreases SBP in young overweight and obese adults. 105 In overweight and obese adults with moderately elevated SBP, caloric restriction-based weight loss in conjunction with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet reduces both CFPWV and SBP. 106 Of note, these improvements may have been mediated, at least in part, by the 30% reduction in sodium intake associated with the diet rather than by weight loss alone. The combination of reduction in total energy intake, exercise, and sodium restriction also has a significant CFPWVand SBP-lowering effect in young to middle-aged, normotensive, overweight and obese adults. 105, 107 Similarly, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the combination of weight loss via energy restriction, exercise, and the weight loss medication Orlistat promotes a profound lowering of CFPWV. 108 In contrast to a shorter-term caloric restriction-based weight loss intervention, lifelong caloric restriction is challenging in humans because of adherence and has risk of negative side effects (such as loss of bone density and lean muscle mass observed in the recent 2-year CALERIE [Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy] trial of 25% caloric restriction in nonobese, healthy, younger adults). 109 Nevertheless, lifelong caloric restriction in mice (40% reduction) prevents age-related increases in both aortic PWV and SBP. 110 In addition, in a case-control study in MA/O humans, those self-practicing caloric restriction (n=18) for an average of 6 years had substantially lower SBP than age-matched healthy controls consuming a typical American diet, 111 and preliminary "}, {"section_title": "Dietary Components and Dietary Patterns", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dietary Sodium Restriction", "text": "The first observation linking dietary sodium intake to arterial stiffness is a case-control study from 1986, which compared CFPWV in normotensive adults who voluntarily followed a low-sodium diet (mean intake 44 mmol/d) for an average of 2 years to controls with the same mean arterial pressure. CFPWV was substantially lower in MA/O adults who practiced dietary sodium restriction. 114 Subsequently, 5 trials of dietary sodium restriction have been conducted with CFPWV as an end point in MA/O, healthy adults of varying SBP (normotensive to hypertensive). 87, [115] [116] [117] [118] CFPWV was significantly reduced in 4 of these trials, 87, [116] [117] [118] and SBP was lowered in all 5. Of note, in 2 of these trials, individuals lacking HVA by the Framingham definition at baseline were restored to HVA status by dietary sodium restriction (Figure 4) . 87, 118 The efficacy of this intervention for restoring HVA is further supported by evidence that dietary sodium restriction rapidly improves carotid artery compliance, another index of arterial stiffness, in MA/O adults with moderately elevated SBP. 119 Trials of dietary sodium restriction in populations of accelerated aging diseases are lacking. One crossover trial of dietary sodium restriction has been conducted in hypertensive patients with stages 3 to 4 CKD, which demonstrated a nonsignificant reduction of CFPWV with a strong SBP-lowering effect. 120 It also merits mention that sodium intake interacts closely with dietary potassium intake to influence CV risk. 121 Evidence on the effect of potassium supplementation on CFPWV in healthy adults is mixed, 72, 122 and the interactions of dietary sodium and potassium intake on CFPWV warrant additional research. Overall, dietary sodium restriction has a consistent SBP-lowering effect and significantly reduces CFPWV in healthy MA/O adults. Thus, dietary sodium restriction represents an important public health strategy to maintain or restore HVA although further research is needed in populations with clinical disorders. Despite challenges in adhering to a low-sodium diet, policy changes implemented at a national level in Finland support that population-level reductions in dietary sodium intake are possible. 123 "}, {"section_title": "Flavonoids", "text": "Flavonoids are low molecular weight compounds composed of a 3-ring structure with various substitutions and are found in abundance in citrus fruits, seeds, olive oil, tea, and red wine. 124 Isoflavones are 1 class of flavonoids, found most often in legumes, including soybeans. 125 Administration of isoflavones or an isoflavone metabolite reduces CFPWV in healthy MA/O men and postmenopausal women with or without altering SBP. 74, 126 Flavanones, flavanols, and anthocyanins are other classes of flavonoids 124 with evidence of reducing CFPWV. 73, [127] [128] [129] Grapefruit juice with high flavanones reduces CFPWV without lowering SBP in postmenopausal women with a large abdominal circumference. 73 Similarly, cocoa flavanols reduce CFPWV in healthy MA/O men, 127 as well as young healthy adults, 128 and postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 129 along with possible reductions in SBP. 127, 128 Finally, cranberry juice with anthocyanins and polyphenols reduces CFPWV without changing SBP in MA/O adults with coronary artery disease. 75 Thus, there is evidence that flavonoids may reduce CFPWV with or without changes in SBP.

The reduction in arterial stiffness is consistent with evidence that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin reduces aortic PWV in old mice (although without obviously changing BP). 157 However, rapamycin has notable side effects, including the potential for metabolic dysregulation, which may limit its CV health-promoting effects. 158 Consequently, safer analogs of rapamycin (rapalogs) are being developed as alternate therapies. 159 The AMPK activator metformin is another potential novel therapy to maintain or restore HVA. As proof of concept, metformin reduces CFPWV and BP in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome and is also well tolerated, 160 thus may also reduce arterial stiffness in other states of impaired AMPK activation, including aging. Finally, sirtuin activators, including resveratrol and NAD + precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside, are other potential strategies to reduce age-associated arterial stiffness.

Functional influences on arterial stiffness, including NO production, may be mediated in part by reductions in circulating insulin or changes in other hormones, such as leptin. 183 Reductions in arterial stiffness with caloric restriction-based weight loss may also be influenced by changes in diet composition, including dietary sodium restriction. Dietary sodium restriction rapidly improves carotid artery compliance, again suggesting a larger contribution of functional versus structural changes. 119 Indeed, dietary sodium restriction both reduces vascular oxidative stress and increases NO bioavailability in humans, 184 and rising sodium concentrations increase endothelial cell stiffness measured by atomic force microscopy, while downregulating NO production. 185 Reductions in the endogenous Na + /K + ATPase inhibitor marinobufagenin may also modulate the reductions in CFPWV with dietary sodium restriction. 118 At least with shorter-term administration, flavonoids seem to also modulate functional components of arterial stiffness. Isoflavones are vasodilatory, reducing endothelin-1, increasing NO bioavailability, and improving vascular endothelial function. 186 Flavanones may also increase NO bioavailability. 187 Finally, intake of fruits and vegetables may modulate arterial stiffness via the effects of individual bioactive nutrients and phytochemicals, as well as via reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance."}, {"section_title": "188,189", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pharmacological-Based Strategies", "text": "Pharmacological-based strategies to maintain or restore HVA may modulate functional or structural components of arterial stiffness. Antihypertensive agents primarily target the functional (vasoconstrictive) component of arterial stiffness through a direct modulation of BP. 142 However angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ARBs may be particularly effective at reducing arterial stiffness and indeed are more efficacious in the long term than other antihypertensive agents because they also have antifibrotic effects. 190 Statins also modulate smooth muscle tone via increased NO bioavailability, 191 as well as reduced sympathetic neural activity 192 and oxidative stress. 193 Metformin promotes endothelial NO synthase activation by activating AMPK in the endothelium 194 and additionally inhibits nuclear factor \u03baB signaling and decreases inflammation. 149 Metformin may also modify arterial stiffness and lower BP by promoting weight loss. 160 Additional agents modulating functional regulation of arterial stiffness are rapamycin, which activates arterial AMPK and decreases oxidative stress, 157 and resveratrol, which increases endothelial NO synthase activity, reduces superoxide generation by NAD(P)H oxidases, and reduces nuclear factor \u03baB-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress. 161, 195, 196 Further research is needed regarding underlying mechanisms by which NAD + precursor may reduce BP and aortic stiffness, but sirtuin-1 activation may be involved. 164 Anti-proinflammatory cytokine therapies likely lower arterial stiffness via anti-inflammatory effects, 167, 168 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 activation also reduces circulating markers of inflammation. 170, 171 Pharmacological agents may also target structural components of arterial stiffness, in particular antifibrotic agents. 142 Rapamycin also decreases collagen and advanced glycation end products in the aorta, suggesting reduced cross-linking of collagens by advanced glycation end products with treatment."}, {"section_title": "157", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Future Directions", "text": "In this review, we have discussed the concept of HVA and contributing mechanisms while also summarizing lifestyle-and pharmacological-based strategies to maintain or restore HVA in both healthy adults and patients with accelerated CV agingrelated clinical disorders. There are notable gaps in the currently available research literature on this topic and practical challenges to implementing these interventions ( Figure 6 ). In Figure 6 . Current gaps in knowledge and challenges related to establishing evidence-based strategies for healthy vascular aging. particular, there remains an unmet need to translate effective strategies to maintain or restore HVA in the clinic and at the public health level. An example of this is the ongoing effort to reduce sodium intake at a population level through policy statements, 197 including government-industry partnerships to reduce sodium intake in several countries, including Japan, Finland, and the United Kingdom. 198 At the same time, preclinical models should continue to be used to discern the mechanisms modulating HVA in both healthy aging and diseased populations (reverse translation). 199 Indeed, the combination of forward and reverse translational physiological approaches has been used effectively to better understand the mechanisms by which prevention and treatment strategies, such as dietary sodium restriction, modulate BP and vascular health. 199 Novel strategies to maintain or restore HVA continue to be developed and tested. Examples of promising lifestyle interventions include inspiratory muscle strength training (breathing against a resistive load), which lowers SBP in both normotensive adults and patients with sleep apnea, 200, 201 passive heat therapy, which lowers mean arterial BP and CFPWV even in young healthy adults, 202 and novel dietary interventions that may mimic the beneficial effects of long-term caloric restriction, including different forms of intermittent fasting. 155 New pharmacological agents also continue to be developed, including anti-proinflammatory cytokine therapeutics and antisenescence drugs. In addition, in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor (empaglifozin) was recently shown to influence properties related to arterial stiffness while lowering SBP, thus may hold promise to maintain or restore HVA. 203 Notably, in the Framingham Heart study, only \u22481% of individuals >70 years of age met the criteria for HVA. 39 This observation highlights that it is difficult to maintain HVA into older age and that trials testing the efficacy of novel strategies are particularly needed for older adults. The recent SPRINT trial results indicate that this age group can indeed be responsive to an intervention, contrary to what may have been thought previously. 17 This was also the case for populations at high CV risk, including individuals with CKD. Thus, testing of novel interventions to restore HVA is also critically needed in diseases of accelerated CV aging, such as CKD and diabetes mellitus. An increased number of cardiovascular risk factors is also associated with a greater annual increase in CFPWV, thus likely contributing to the progressive reduction in the prevalence of HVA with advancing age. 204 Ultimately, shifting the distribution to a higher number of individuals with HVA status will reduce the burden of CV events and mortality in the population."}]
