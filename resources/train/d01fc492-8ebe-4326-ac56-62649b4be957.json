[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Singaporean elementary-school students (N \u00bc 299) completed Child Implicit Association Tests (Child IAT) as well as explicit measures of gender identity, mathegender stereotypes, and math self-concepts. Students also completed a standardized math achievement test. Three new findings emerged. First, implicit, but not explicit, math self-concepts (math \u00bc me) were positively related to math achievement on a standardized test. Second, as expected, stronger mathegender stereotypes (math \u00bc boys) significantly correlated with stronger math self-concepts for boys and weaker math self-concepts for girls, on both implicit and explicit measures. Third, implicit mathegender stereotypes were significantly related to math achievement. These findings show that non-academic factors such as implicit math self-concepts and stereotypes are linked to students' actual math achievement. The findings suggest that measuring individual differences in non-academic factors may be a useful tool for educators in assessing students' academic outcomes."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "In many Western and the Eastern cultures, there is a prevalent stereotype among adults linking mathematics with males (Guiso, Monte, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2008; Nosek et al., 2009 ). This gender stereotype that \"math is for males\" may be one of the complex factors contributing to the underrepresentation of girls in science technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and influence children's educational interests and choices (e.g., Ceci, Williams, & Barnett, 2009; Cheryan, Master, & Meltzoff, 2015) .\nOne conjecture is that this societal stereotype about gender influences boys and girls differential identification with math at early ages (Cvencek, Meltzoff, & Greenwald, 2011) . Gender stereotypes may potentially mediate learning and performance in specific academic subjects by influencing students' level of anxiety, interest, and effort they put into learning that domain (Beilock, Gunderson, Ramirez, & Levine, 2010; Steffens, Jelenec, & Noack, 2010) . This, in turn, may influence how well students perform in the subject, and their interest in pursuing a career in the STEM disciplines (Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Liben, Bigler, & Krogh, 2001 ).\nHowever, when one looks beyond stereotypes to actual math achievement, boys do not consistently outperform girls. In the U.S., there is older research reporting that high-school girls score lower than boys on standardized math assessments (Dwyer & Johnson, 1997; Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002) ; but newer findings indicate that gap is narrowing or non-existent, at least up to the final years of high school (Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, & Williams, 2008; Hyde & Mertz, 2009 ). On the other hand, if one looks at achievement on international standardized math achievement tests, a gender gap favoring boys still exists among U.S. elementaryschool students (Provasnik et al., 2012) . In Asian countries (e.g., Japan, Singapore, and China), there is no gender gap in mathematical achievement at any age (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], 2011) .\nSingapore is a compelling example. The mathematical achievement of students from Singaporedboth male and femaledis outstanding. Singapore consistently scores as one of the topachieving countries on the international assessments of standardized math achievement, such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) or the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA; OECD, 2011). The country's math curriculum is celebrated for its effectiveness and emulated world-wide (Bybee & Kennedy, 2005) . On the most recent TIMSS assessment, the maleefemale difference in average math scores of Singaporean boys and girls in Grade 4 was not measurably different (Provasnik et al., 2012) . Contrary to what one might expect given these data, however, Cvencek, Meltzoff, and Kapur (2014) found that: (a) Singaporean elementary-school students hold the mathegender stereotype, and (b) Singaporean boys identify more strongly with math than do girls.\nStudying the relationship between math achievement, mathe gender stereotypes and self-concepts in Singaporean children presents an interesting opportunity for at least two reasons. From a theoretical viewpoint, it is not apparent whydin the absence of any detectable boy superiority in mathdSingaporean children would hold the stereotype that \"math \u00bc boys,\" nor why Singaporean boys would identify with math more strongly than girls. From a more methodological viewpoint, a centralized common curriculum for Singaporean Ke12 students enables testing of the relationship between students' beliefs and actual math achievement (on which past research has remained silent), by allowing researchers to use standardized math achievement scores for each grade."}, {"section_title": "Role of non-academic factors in math achievement", "text": "When examining students' beliefs about math and their math achievement, it is useful to distinguish three interrelated constructs. One is gender identity, that is, how strongly a child identifies with being either boy or girl. A second is the child's belief about the link between math and gender (i.e., a belief about a social group and \"who does math\"), which can be called a mathegender stereotype. The third is how strongly the child connects me and math (a belief about the self; whether \"I identify with math\"), which can be called a math self-concept.\nThe current research is motivated by the concept of cognitive balance or consistency in social psychology and developmental psychology. The general idea is that the child and adult usually tend towards a state of psychological equilibrium and minimize dissonance (Festinger, 1957; Gawronski & Strack, 2012; Greenwald et al., 2002; Heider, 1946) da process related to what Piaget called psychological \"equilibration\" in human development and education (Piaget, 1970) . These general ideas about cognitive consistency and balance can be operationalized and made more precise, particularly about issues of identity (Greenwald et al., 2002) . To be fully \"in balance\" a child who thinks me \u00bc boy, and boy \u00bc math, should experience a psychological pressure (conscious or unconscious) towards me \u00bc math. Such a pressure toward cognitive balance has been hypothesized to operate in young children and to motivate behavioral change and strivings even during elementary-school years (Cvencek et al., 2011 (Cvencek et al., , 2014 .\nAs part of investigating cognitive balance in the current study, we specifically examine the role of gender identity and its relation to gender stereotypes and math self-concepts. Gender identity is an early developing aspect of a child's sense of self (Ruble, Martin, & Berenbaum, 2006; Stipek, Gralinski, & Kopp, 1990) . We believe that the strength of gender identity (me \u00bc boy or me \u00bc girl) could be one factor that works to strengthen (in case of boys) or weaken (in case of girls) a child's identification with mathematics. If me \u00bc girl, and girls s math (according to cultural stereotypes), then cognitive balance may pressure girls in a direction away from math (me s math), by changing interest, motivation, choice, and so forth. Of course, in the real-world there are also many other issues that will come into play, but according to social-developmental theory, cognitive balance may be of interest."}, {"section_title": "Stereotypes, self-concepts, and math achievement", "text": "When stereotypes are measured in socially sensitive domains, such as gender stereotypes, both implicit and explicit measurement methods have been used. This distinction is based on the idea that human behavior is not only guided by deliberative, conscious processes, but also by more automatic, non-deliberate, and faster processes, which can be captured by two corresponding types of measures, termed explicit versus implicit measures (Fazio, 1990; Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Jacoby, 1991; Strack & Deutsch, 2004) .\nIn explicit measures, participants are often asked to provide verbal self-reports and are aware of what is being assessed. For example, this can correspond to an explicit belief about the group with regard to a particular academic ability (e.g., selecting answers on a questionnaire about how much \"I believe that boys like math more than girls do?\"). In contrast, implicit measures require no selfreport and participants are not necessarily informed about what is being assessed. For example, this can correspond to a more unconscious math \u00bc boy association (e.g., using the same response key to sort stimuli belonging to categories math and boys in a computerized categorization task that requires fast responses). Few studies have examined both implicit and explicit mathegender stereotypes in the same students, and fewer still have related this to the students' actual math achievement. Three studies and their limitations will be mentioned.\nAmbady, Shih, Kim, and Pittinsky (2001) showed that 5-year-old Asian-American girls performed significantly worse on a math test, when their gender identity was activated (by being asked to color a picture of a girl holding a doll) relative to a control group. These girls demonstrated mathegender stereotypes on implicit, but not on explicit measures, suggesting that the implicit mathegender stereotypes may have contributed to the observed math performance decrements.\nGaldi, Cadinu, and Tomasetto (2014) activated a negative ingroup stereotype for 6-year-old Italian girls by asking them to color a picture of a boy who correctly solves a math problem on a blackboard (while a girl fails to respond). Six-year-old Italian girls already possessed implicit mathegender stereotypes (without explicitly endorsing them) and the activation of such stereotypes lead to performance deficits. However, it would be desirable to evaluate the relationship between mathegender stereotypes and math achievement in the absence of experimentally activated identities and without experimentally activating the stereotypes themselves immediately before the math test. This would show that pervasive cultural stereotypes can impact math achievement without salient activation within the test situation. Steffens et al. (2010) used adolescents to examine the relationship between implicit and explicit mathegender stereotypes and math achievement. In their study of German students (Grades 7 and 9), implicit mathegender stereotypes predicted self-reported math grades above and beyond explicit mathegender stereotypes. Potentially, however, the children's self-reports of their latest class test and grades in math (Steffens et al., 2010) are susceptible to inaccuracies in memory, and the social relationship between teacher and student and other factors are known to influence students' grades (Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2005) .\nSo far we have discussed the relation between mathegender stereotypes and math achievement. Such stereotypes are a belief about math and a social group (math \u00bc boys), but we can also examine beliefs about math and the self (math \u00bc me)di.e., children's math self-concepts. It is well established using explicit measures that, during elementary school, girls rate themselves lower than boys in mathematics (Herbert & Stipek, 2005) , but not in reading or writing (Pajares, Miller, & Johnson, 1999) .\nWhat is known about the interrelationship between math selfconcepts and math-related outcomes? The emerging evidence can be summarized as follows: First, gender differences in math self-concepts can be independent from actual math achievement, which is often found to be comparable between male and female"}]
