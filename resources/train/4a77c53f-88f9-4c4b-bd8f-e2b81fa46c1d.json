By clinical, cognitive, and functional criteria, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered an intermediate state between individuals who are cognitively normal and those with a clinical diagnosis of dementia [1, 2] . Impairment of episodic memory, that is, the ability to acquire and retain new information about life events, that is greater than expected for a person's age is most commonly observed in subjects with MCI who progress to AD and has been used to define a subtype of MCI called amnestic MCI [3] . Quantitative studies of autopsied brains from well-characterized patients at this phase of AD have demonstrated a substantial loss of neurons in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) [4] [5] [6] . A broad consensus now exists on this locus for early neurodegeneration and the subsequent spread of pathology along connectional pathways as disease progresses causing further symptomatic worsening through the stages of dementia.\nAgainst this background, localized anatomic change in the medial temporal lobe observed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided an indirect measure of neuronal injury [7, 8] . In particular, entorhinal cortical atrophy has been identified as one of the MRI measures that predicts longitudinal progression among symptomatic cases, with greater atrophy associated with greater clinical disease severity [9] [10] [11] [12] (also see recent review [13] ). ERC atrophy detected by MRI has also been predictive of progression from normal cognition to MCI [14] . Such atrophy has been associated with impairment on multiple memory tests confirming that this atrophy has clinical relevance for patients [15] .\nThe field of computational anatomy [16] has been working toward addressing the need for quantitative, well-researched, standardized structural imaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease. Patterns of atrophy at the population and individual level are described quantitatively by constructing smooth mappings (diffeomorphisms) that identify correspondences between a well-characterized template image and a given patient image. Properties of these mappings, such as how much they expand or contract, are used to give a quantitative description of biological change. These tools have been previously applied to a study of the medial temporal lobe [17] , where significant atrophy was found present in the most lateral portion of the ERC. In this study, we use structural MRI to investigate the cortical region further lateral, the transentorhinal cortex (TEC), which is one of the sites of the earliest detected pathology as reported by Braak and Braak [18] .\nBecause of its proximity to meninges and the oculomotor nerve, as well as the fact that its definition is specified by distant landmarks rather than local contrast changes [19] , this area is difficult for automatic segmentation techniques. Although some techniques [20] are addressing these concerns, we choose to use manual segmentations in this study. In this context, one important source of variability is the consistency of segmentations over time.\nOur approach to overcoming this limitation is to develop a longitudinal filtering procedure, passing a template segmentation through each time point along a continuous trajectory. This allows data to be shared between various time points, removing noise associated with variable structure definition over time. The trajectory we choose is modeled by two geodesics through the space of diffeomorphisms, one from template to baseline and other from baseline through each follow up. This leads to a procedure that is essentially linear regression through the high-dimensional space of images.\nWe study a sample of subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) who are cognitively normal or have MCI by clinical and cognitive criteria at baseline. We measure volume changes over time to compute volumetric atrophy rate due to MCI, and we measure local volume and thickness over time to compute the spatial distribution of these changes. Regions where atrophy is significantly different between groups are identified using permutation testing, controlling for multiple comparisons using the maximum statistic."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). MRI scans from subjects who met ADNI criteria for MCI at baseline were selected for analysis. Inclusion criteria for subjects with MCI included evidence of impaired performance on Logical Memory Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (based on age and education adjusted norms), a score of clinical dementia rating (CDR) !0.5, and a clinical diagnosis of MCI. The MCI subjects were all selected to be amyloid b positive based on cerebrospinal fluid cutoff values established by the ADNI Biospecimen Core (i.e., less than a cutoff score of 192 pg/mL) [21] and age between 55 and 85 years.\nThe criteria for control status in ADNI included evidence of performance within the normal range on the Logical Memory Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (based on age and education adjusted norms), a score of CDR 5 0, and the absence of a clinical diagnosis of MCI or dementia. Control subjects were included only if they were amyloid b negative (greater than a cutoff of 192 pg/mL). In total, 36 subjects with amnestic MCI and 16 control subjects were selected.

Most subjects examined were found to have this anatomic variant on the left side, but many had alternative variants on the right. Only subjects scanned for at least three time points for more than 2 years were included. Most were scanned at 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline. Data for one subject is shown in Fig. 1 left panel. We denote the ith subject's jth scan time as t ij .\nERC and TEC were segmented manually, using anatomic boundaries described in [19] . As seen in the coronal plane, the boundaries can be described by Rostral: 4 mm rostral to hippocampal head Caudal: 2 mm caudal to gyrus intralimbicus Medial: As far as visible gray/white boundary Lateral: Deepest part of collateral sulcus Segmentations were performed in Seg3D version 1 [24] . One example is shown in the coronal plane in Fig. 1 panel, together with nearby medial temporal lobe structures. Note that the region we consider extends laterally into the collateral sulcus, beyond the ERC region that has been studied previously. Within subject images were aligned rigidly to baseline by minimizing sum of square difference between T1 voxel intensities. All segmentations were aligned to a template using four landmarks placed automatically at the corners of the ERC and TEC.

Smoothness criteria for vector fields in the space V to generate diffeomorphic transformations are discussed in [25] .\nWe choose to parametrize v t by a function p 0 supported on the boundary of an atlas surface as in [26] .

The surface f is represented as a discrete triangulated surface by specifying a list of vertices and faces. For a further reduction in complexity, we restrict ourselves to modeling p 0 , the initial condition to a geodesic flow given by [27] . Here D v denotes the matrix of partial derivatives whose ith row is the gradient vector of the ith component of v, and T denotes the transpose.\nThe binary segmentation images to be matched are deformed using functional composition with the inverse I t 5I 0 \u00f04 21 t \u00de. The template image I 0 and corresponding triangulated surface f 0 are estimated from the population in a Bayesian setting as originally described in [28, 29] with details discussed in [30] . Our initial guess (hypertemplate) used as an input to the template estimation algorithm was created by (1) computing the voxel-by-voxel average of each baseline rigidly aligned segmentation, (2) constructing a smooth triangulated surface contouring this average image, and (3) constructing a binary image from this surface by setting inside voxels to 1 and outside voxels to 0. The resulting template used is a deformation of this initial guess that is close to each member of the population (a population average in the Riemannian sense).\nTo summarize, in this work we use binary images (I) for our cost function's matching term, and we use a surface (f) to parameterize their deformation. The two are related because this surface contours the deforming atlas image. Unlike discrete images, our surface provides smoothness and welldefined normals, allowing it to be used as an interpretable and parsimonious representation."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal mapping", "text": "We overcome variability in anatomic definitions over time by mapping our template simultaneously onto each scan in a time series.

This measure is interpolated from faces to vertices by assigning to each vertex the sum of 1/3 of the value at its neighboring faces. This choice of interpolation preserves the total area."}, {"section_title": "Mixed-effects modeling", "text": "We estimate the atrophy rate using a log-linear mixedeffects model, treating gender as a fixed effect and patientto-patient variability as a random effect.

Here e i is the patient-specific random effect with expected value to be estimated and \u03b5 ij is the measurement noise. Both are assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean, and variance to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Here MCI i is a binary variable indicating whether subject i has MCI or is a control.

Details of this procedure are also described in [35] .\nNote that the nomenclature in this region is used differently by different authors. Our high field partition contains a region referred to the sulcal subfield of the ERC in [34] , which is referred to as the TEC in [19] and throughout our work.\nThese results are mapped, using the same techniques described previously but with only one time point, onto our high field atlas partition and are shown in Fig. 6 . With this technique, it can be seen that most of the significant changes are localized to the TEC (referred to by some authors as the sulcal region of the ERC). Some changes are also located more medially in the lateral subfield and the intermediate caudal subfield. The local volume change measure also shows some changes in the intermediate superior subfield."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Manual segmentations and longitudinal filtering", "text": "Examples of the anatomic structures used in our analysis are shown in Fig. 3 .

Measuring atrophy in this specific region at the population level may be useful for determining efficacy of disease-modifying interventions before cognitive changes occur. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that imaging biomarkers in the entorhinal region can be sensitive to changes in early AD. The quantitative nature of this work overcomes some criticisms of structural neuroimaging as a biomarker for AD as described in [36] .\nAn important consideration that arises when using this filtering method is whether the variability being removed is because of manual segmentation noise or because of true biological variability. Filtering techniques should be considered in the context of this bias variance trade-off. We have attempted to address this by resegmenting and refiltering eight scans. From repeated segmentations we estimate a median Dice overlap (volume of intersection divided by average volume) of 0.801 for manual segmentations and 0.861 for filtered segmentations, the second being significantly improved (P 5 .0078, signed rank test). These numbers are significant given that this is a laminar structure with thickness of only a few voxels, and the large majority of errors are within one voxel. This improvement in reproducibility, together with good overall mapping accuracy, demonstrates that the procedure is likely removing noise and not the biological signal of interest. This is consistent with earlier work [37] , where the cross-sectional version of this filtering procedure was shown to improve reproducibility across repeated scans and visits.\nThis study used two approaches to be sensitive to early structural changes in AD. First, motivated by histologic evidence, we focus our analysis on the entorhinal and transentorhinal region. Although many authors have studied the ERC, our region includes tissue lateral to most definitions of the ERC. A review of publications based on the ADNI dataset [38] describes the involvement of the ERC volume and thickness in disease progression, whereas the transentorhinal region is not discussed. Second, our method considers a detailed spatial distribution of structural changes, as opposed to analyzing thickness or volume averaged over larger regions. Although more recent work has been honing in on the transentorhinal region, such as [39] that quantifies changes in Broadman's area 35, our analysis can detect more localized patterns of atrophy.\nThis work follows a trend in shape analysis in medical imaging to account for longitudinal changes explicitly. Similar approaches (known as geodesic regression) have been described in a very general setting in [40] and have been extended to hierarchical models in [41] and to aligning one time series to another [42] . In [43] , several different approaches to parametrizing the trajectory in longitudinal mapping are outlined, including the two geodesic techniques used here, the piecewise geodesic technique used in [42] and higher order spline techniques. Longitudinal Freesurfer [44] provides an alternative approach to managing longitudinal data, where each scan in a time series is analyzed using a common subject-specific initialization to an optimization process. Many of these approaches are designed to allow sudden changes in the time course of the trajectory. The technique used here was designed specifically to avoid sudden changes, which in our application were likely a source of noise.\nOne limitation of this study is the exclusion of anatomic variants of the collateral sulcus, and our future work will expand to a larger number of subjects. However, only 16% of subjects examined did not have the type I variant on the left side."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
