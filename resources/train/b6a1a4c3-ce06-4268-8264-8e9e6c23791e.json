For the purpose of this review, large artery stiffness is defined as increased conducted wave velocity or changes in the passive mechanical properties of the artery that reduce its compliance. Longitudinal studies have shown a progressive increase in large elastic artery stiffness with aging ( Figure 1 ) that contributes to CVD risk and is associated with pathophysiological conditions, such as hypertension, stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, subendocardial ischemia, September 14, 2018 and cardiac fibrosis. 10 Large artery stiffening is postulated to impact CVDs in several ways. First, an important function of large elastic arteries (such as the aorta) is to act as a capacitance vessel to dampen the increase in pressure caused by the ejection of blood from the left ventricle during systole. The elasticity of the aorta allows it to distend as blood is pumped into it during systole, then to recoil, facilitating continuous blood flow and maintaining pressure during diastole. In this way, the elasticity of the aorta helps it to act as a secondary pump of blood during elastic recoil and to prevent large pulse pressures from being conducted to the smaller blood vessels-the socalled Windkessel effect. As we age, the aorta loses elasticity through multiple mechanisms, becoming stiffer, and the capacitance function becomes impaired, increasing the SBP per unit blood ejected from the left ventricle. Second, increased large artery stiffness leads to a greater velocity of the incident, systolic pressure waveform down the arterial tree, resulting in a quicker return of its reflected waveform. 11 In stiff arteries, the reflected waveform superimposes on the incident waveform, thereby augmenting systolic pressure and aortic impedance, 12 which increase the work imposed on the left ventricle during systole. Lastly, large artery stiffening leads to higher systolic pressure, a reduction in diastolic pressure, and a concomitant widening of pulse pressure. 13 The widening of pulse pressure has also been hypothesized to augment transmission of pulsatility along the arterial tree. This has been measured in midsized and smaller conduit arteries, and pulsatility and higher pressure have been measured directly from the capillaries in the skin of"}, {"section_title": "Nonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4E-BP1", "text": "eukaryotic translation factor-binding protein 13 carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), 305 maximal forearm blood flow to acetylcholine (FBF), 306 and brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD). [307] [308] [309] older adults. 14 Increased pulsatility in muscular and resistance arteries with advancing age will deleteriously affect their ability to distribute blood flow and appropriately alter vascular resistance-a function necessary to reduce pressure in the microcirculation. These alterations could contribute to peripheral organ damage and dysfunction with aging, 15 particularly in vulnerable regions like the cerebral [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and renal circulations. 10 The most commonly used method to measure large elastic artery stiffness in long-term epidemiological studies is carotidto-femoral PWV, because of its ease of use and high reproducibility. 21 Other techniques, like augmentation index and direct measurements of arterial distensibility, have also been used, depending on the questions of interest. 22 Higher carotid-to-femoral PWV is indicative of greater large elastic artery stiffness and is a strong predictor of several age-related CVD outcomes 23, 24 and cognitive impairment. 25 Many of the factors that alter aortic stiffness with age are plastic, such as modulators of arterial tone (ie, vasodilators versus vasoconstrictors), and can rapidly induce changes in arterial stiffness in different physiological states, such as in response to acute stress. 26 Other factors that affect aortic stiffness are less plastic and require more time (months to years). These include accumulation of advanced glycation end products, alterations to collagen and elastin content or arrangement, remodeling, and structural changes in the extracellular matrix. Importantly, changes in large artery stiffness with age not only affect end-organ systems but also modulate the cells within the vasculature, such as the endothelium, which in turn can further exacerbate large artery stiffness and subsequent global vascular dysfunction in older adults."}, {"section_title": "Endothelial Dysfunction", "text": "The arterial endothelium is extremely dynamic, performing many vital functions that vary from one segment of the arterial tree to another, as well as from one organ system to another. 27, 28 The vascular endothelium releases molecules that act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to regulate the function and health of the vascular network. These functions include the maintenance of blood in a fluid state, exchange of fluid and molecules between the blood and surrounding tissues, creation of new vascular networks, participation and facilitation of the immune response, and the control of vascular resistance in response to changes in blood flow through the regulation of arterial tone in resistance vessels. 27, 28 A healthy vascular endothelium must constantly maintain a balance between oxidants and antioxidants, vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules, and prothrombotic and antithrombotic signals. A dysfunctional endothelium has lost this tightly regulated balance and displays oxidant, vasoconstrictor, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties. Age-related dysfunction of the vascular endothelium is defined in this review as an age-associated impairment in flow-or agonist-induced vasodilation or a reduction in the critical endothelium-derived vasodilator, NO. One hallmark of vascular endothelial dysfunction is impaired EDD, which is predictive of future CVD events. 3, 4 Increased age is the strongest independent correlate of EDD, 29 and the age-related decline in endothelial function in both the microcirculation and larger arteries (Figure 1 ) contributes to a host of hemodynamic changes. These include augmented large and resistance arterial tone, induction of greater oscillatory shear stress, and further elevations in large artery stiffness. 3, 30 By altering hemodynamics, EDD contributes to increases in the prevalence of hypertension 13 and atherosclerosis 4 with advancing age."}, {"section_title": "Interaction of Arterial Stiffness and Endothelial Dysfunction", "text": "Although endothelial dysfunction and large artery stiffening are independent predictors of CVD, each of these can exacerbate the other, producing a cycle of damage and dysfunction in advanced age. For example, in vitro evidence suggests that increased matrix stiffness may impair flow-induced dilation by reducing the ability of the endothelium to effect a response to laminar shear stress. 31 Impaired EDD can also contribute to arterial stiffening by increasing the active tone in arteries, 32 and it may share common underlying mechanisms like oxidative stress and inflammation. As such, the mechanisms that underlie age-related arterial dysfunction provide an opportunity to develop and test interventions that may restore arterial function, prevent CVD, and improve health span in middle-aged and older adults."}, {"section_title": "Goals of the Review", "text": "Having considered the importance of age-related arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction on CVD, the goals of this review are as follows: first, we review 2 macromechanistic processes, oxidative stress and inflammation, that contribute to endothelial dysfunction in healthy older adults and animal models. Next, we discuss some of the cellular and molecular events that induce and contribute to the sustained cycle of inflammation and oxidative stress in the aged vasculature. We also review mechanistic insight gained from studies of calorie restriction (CR) and their relevance and how traditional aging and longevity pathways also seem to modulate arterial function with advancing age. Furthermore, we highlight important signaling and genomic changes with aging that impact cellular and tissue processes, ultimately leading to the functional vascular aging phenotype ( Figure 2 ). Lastly, we describe the role of the vasculature in the aging process (life span, health span), together with examples of noncanonical age-associated CVDs, specifically metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer disease (AD)/dementia."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms of Vascular Dysfunction With Aging and Their Prevention by CR", "text": "Reductions in EDD and increases in arterial stiffness can be reversed by lifestyle interventions, such as CR, habitual exercise, 33, 34 sodium restriction, 35, 36 and weight loss. 37 Among these interventions, CR is the most consistently associated with increases in life span. As such, insight from studies aimed at elucidating the molecular and cellular mediators of the beneficial effects of CR on life span may provide novel targets for pharmacological intervention in the setting of CVD. In animal studies, CR is typically a lifelong intervention, initiated after sexual maturity, in which caloric intake is restricted by 40% of ad libitum intake without inducing malnutrition. CR improves maximal and median life span, as well as physiological function in rodents and nonhuman primates. 38 It has September 14, 2018\nbeen associated with a dramatic reduction in CVD in nonhuman primates 39 and protection against cardiac ischemia. 40 In addition, there is recent evidence for a vasoprotective effect of CR such that EDD and NO bioavailability are preserved 41, 42 and increases in large artery stiffness are prevented 43 in aged rodents. Although the translatability of CR to humans has often come into question, the results of the CALERIE trial (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy), in which nonobese young and middle-aged (21-51 years) adults were randomized to 25% CR for 2 years, indicated that CR was able to slow biological aging 44 and reduce CVD risk factors. 45 Although the mechanisms underlying age-related arterial dysfunction and their prevention by CR are still being elucidated, the most widely explored mechanisms are oxidative stress and inflammation with modulation of autophagy emerging as a potential candidate mechanism."}, {"section_title": "Oxidative Stress", "text": "Elevations in plasma markers of oxidative stress in older adults 46 suggest that aging is a state of chronic, systemic oxidative stress 47 -a condition that ensues when the bioavailability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increased relative to antioxidant defenses. 48, 49 Oxidative stress in the vasculature is a primary mechanism underlying age-associated reductions in EDD and NO bioavailability, 46, 50, 51 as well as increases in large artery stiffness, 46, 50 [55] [56] [57] Increased abundance of arterial nitrotyrosine has been demonstrated in both animal models 34, 58, 59 and endothelial cells (ECs) of humans. 60 In addition, markers of lipid peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenal or malondialdehyde, and other oxidative stress markers, such as glutathionylation, at cysteine residues are also observed in aged arteries. 61, 62 Functionally, greater superoxide-mediated suppression of NO bioavailability leads to reductions in EDD 34, 46, 50, 59 and contributes to arterial stiffening in rodent models 63, 64 and older women 65 ( Figure 3 ). CR attenuates age-related elevations in arterial O 2 \u2212 production, [41] [42] [43] 52 which contributes to reduced vascular oxidative stress, as evidenced by lower arterial nitrotyrosine abundance after CR compared with age-matched ad libitum controls. 42, 43 O 2 \u2212 is produced by oxidant enzyme systems, such as NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-p67 phox, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450 2C9, and uncoupled eNOS (endothelial NO synthase). 48, 49, 66 This O 2 \u2212 acts to reduce NO bioavailability and impair EDD. With aging, there is an increased production of O 2 \u2212 that is associated with both elevated expression and activity of NADPH oxidase, 34 as well as with increased eNOS uncoupling. 67 NADPH oxidase-derived O 2 \u2212 directly contributes to age-associated endothelial dysfunction, as evidenced by the restoration of EDD and NO after in Figure 2 . Hallmarks of vascular aging. In addition to increases in genomic instability that are associated with increases in DNA damage, an inadequate DNA damage response (DDR) and telomere dysfunction, dysregulation of signaling pathways, including the growth factor signaling pathway, klotho, and the nutrient-sensing pathways, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), AMPK (AMP protein kinase), and SIRT (sirtuin)-1 will induce increases in cellular senescence and the dysregulation of autophagy that contribute to increased tissue oxidative stress and inflammation that ultimately result in the age-related arterial phenotype characterized by endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening (illustration credit: Ben Smith).\nvitro inhibition of this enzyme by apocynin in arteries from aged mice. 34 Likewise, eNOS uncoupling seems to play a role in agerelated arterial dysfunction because tetrahydrobiopterin treatment, which reduces eNOS uncoupling, leads to improvements in EDD in older adults that are associated with a reduction in the oxidative stress-mediated suppression of EDD 68 ( Figure 3 ). Further supporting a role for eNOS uncoupling in age-related elevations in arterial O 2 \u2212 , it has been demonstrated that ex vivo administration of tetrahydrobiopterin reduces O 2 \u2212 in arterioles from old rats. 69 In contrast to NADPH oxidase, other oxidant enzyme systems may be less critical to age-related arterial oxidative stress. Indeed, a preponderance of the data examining vascular function in National Institute on Aging supported models of aged mice, rats (Fisher 344), and humans have found no age-related increase in expression or activity of xanthine oxidase or cytochrome P450, 34, 60, 70, 71 nor has pharmacological inhibition of xanthine oxidase or cytochrome P450 2C9 been found to be effective in improving EDD in older adults. 70, 72 Still, there is a single study that has suggested that xanthine oxidase is a source of augmented O 2 \u2212 in aged Sprague Dawley rats, 73 and there is also evidence for a critical role of xanthine oxidase in pathological settings, such as heart failure. 74, 75 In summary, it is likely that NADPH oxidase and uncoupled eNOS are the major enzymatic sources of O 2 \u2212 in aged arteries and ECs. Reductions in O 2 \u2212 seem to be an important mechanism underlying the functional benefits of CR because treatment of arteries with the superoxide scavenger TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) improves EDD and NO bioavailability in old ad libitum-fed mice, 34 but not in old mice after CR, 43, 52 indicating that CR attenuates the superoxide-mediated suppression of EDD and NO. 42, 43, 52 This CR-mediated reduction in O 2 \u2212 may result from reduced production because CR is also associated with reductions in NADPH oxidase expression and activity. 43, 52, 76 Although there is no direct evidence for a role of reduced eNOS uncoupling in the vascular benefits afforded by CR, association has been made between eNOS uncoupling and reductions in SIRT (sirtuin)-1-a deacetylase closely associated with CRmediated life span extension. 77 Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether reductions in eNOS uncoupling or other oxidant enzymes play a role in the beneficial effects of CR.\nIn addition to the enzymatic production of O 2 \u2212 , mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 is another important source of arterial ROS in aging. Although O 2 \u2212 can be produced in abundance in the mitochondria at complexes 1 and 3, 78 it may be confined to the mitochondria. Mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 produced at complexes 1 and 3 is released into the mitochondrial matrix or intermembrane space, respectively, and because of its highly reactive nature, O 2 \u2212 is unlikely to migrate to the cytosol or extracellular space without being transformed to a less-reactive form of ROS, such as H 2 O 2 . Nevertheless, mitochondrial ROS, in the form of H 2 O 2 , 79 contributes to the ROS production/spillover in arteries from old rodents and likely contributes to age-associated endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, genetic or pharmacological targeting of mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 reduces arterial O 2 \u2212 and leads to improvements in NO and EDD. 80, 81 Furthermore, reducing mitochondrial ROS may also underlie the vasoprotective effects of CR because elevations in mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 production are not present in aged primary cerebral microvascular ECs from aged mice after lifelong CR. 76 To maintain an appropriate redox balance, elevations in superoxide production with aging should signal an increase in antioxidant defenses. However, total antioxidant capacity is reduced, 82 and the expression and activity of critical antioxidant enzymes do not increase in arteries of old rodents. 34 Combined with the enhanced oxidant production, inadequate antioxidant defenses also contribute to age-related arterial oxidative stress. Reductions in critical antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase and glutathione (GSH), are implicated in age-associated arterial oxidative stress.\nSODs are critical antioxidant enzymes that convert superoxide to H 2 O 2 and thus play a primary role in ROS removal. 83 In the face of elevated superoxide production with aging, neither copper, zinc SOD-the intracellular isoform-nor manganese SOD (MnSOD)-the mitochondrial isoform 34, 43, 52 -increase in arteries of old mice. 34, 43 Although the expression of extracellular SOD has been shown to be either unchanged 43, 84 or increased, 34 there is no increase in activity of any of these SOD isoforms in arteries with advancing age. 34, 43, 52 Interestingly, there is experimental evidence that a lack of appropriate SOD response to O 2 \u2212 overproduction may have clinical significance because these antioxidants play a critical role in the setting of CVD. For example, MnSOD may play a cardioprotective role. Evidence for this derives from genetic models in which deletion of MnSOD results in cardiomyopathy and heart failure, 85 whereas overexpression of extracellular SOD improves endothelial function in the setting of hypertension. 86 Likewise, old MnSOD haploinsufficient mice have impaired EDD compared with old wild-type mice, 87 further supporting the importance of this antioxidant and mitochondrial O 2 \u2212 in the function of aged arteries. Interestingly, the inadequate response in SOD expression and activity with aging may contribute not only to the excess O 2 \u2212 that quenches NO bioavailability but may also contribute to impaired vasodilation via reduced H 2 O 2 production. 88 While at high concentrations, H 2 O 2 is itself a ROS that can impair vascular function. 89 H 2 O 2 produced through the actions of SOD also promotes vasodilation via direct actions as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, 88 as well as by indirectly inducing eNOS expression-the enzyme responsible for the production of NO. 90 Interestingly, the importance of H 2 O 2 as a vasodilator differs across the life span and with the emergence of coronary artery disease, such that the primary mediator of flow-induced dilation in coronary arteries shifts from prostacyclin in youth to NO in healthy adulthood and is again altered in the presence of coronary artery disease to favor H 2 O 2 . 91 Like SODs, aortic expression of catalase-the enzyme responsible for the reduction of H 2 O 2 to oxygen and water-also fails to increase with advancing age in mice. 43 In advanced age, the lack of an increase in catalase combined with increased superoxide production may lead to excess accumulation of H 2 O 2 and contribute to the impairments in vasodilation. 89 Still, another antioxidant implicated in age-associated oxidative stress is GSH-an intracellular thiol that reduces disulfide bonds and acts as an electron donor, the expression of which is reduced in aortic lysates of old rats. 41 Although exogenous treatment with a GSH-depleting drug was without effect on EDD in aged rats, 92 evidence for deleterious effects of inadequate GSH expression can be found in disease states. Indeed, impaired GSH-related antioxidant effects are associated with CVD, such that atherosclerotic plaques demonstrate depressed antioxidant GSH effects, 93 and low serum GSH is associated with family history of CVD. 94 Furthermore, there is evidence that GSH supplementation can improve EDD in patients with atherosclerosis. 95 In addition to lowering ROS production, reductions in oxidative stress after CR are also associated with improvements in antioxidant defenses. In contrast to ad libitum aging, total antioxidant capacity in the serum of old CR rats does not differ from that of young rats, 82 and arterial expression of the antioxidants, MnSOD, copper, zinc SOD, and extracellular SOD, 43, 52 and the activity of total SOD 52 and catalase 43 are all increased in aged mice after CR. Likewise, CR has also been demonstrated to increase GSH activity in human subjects. 96 Although it is not known whether CR alters the reliance on H 2 O 2 as a vasodilator, it does appear that a reduction in oxidative stress, which is mediated by both decreased oxidant production and improved antioxidant defenses, is a primary mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of CR on the vasculature."}, {"section_title": "Inflammation", "text": "Chronic, low-grade inflammation has been implicated in ageassociated impairments in endothelial function and increases in large artery stiffness. Age-associated sterile inflammation is characterized by increases in circulating CRP (C-reactive protein), as well as proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, including TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), IL (interleukin)-6, and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). 60, 71 These circulating markers of inflammation, in particular CRP and IL-6, have been positively related to aortic stiffness 97 and inversely related to EDD in older adults. 98 Although some inflammatory mediators are derived from vascular cells per se, including endothelial-derived TNF-\u03b1, 99 immune cells infiltrating the arterial adventitia may also be an important source of both inflammatory cytokines and ROS production. 100 This is supported by data demonstrating increased accumulation of both macrophages and lymphocytes in the adventitia of aged arteries 101 and a role for adventitialderived ROS in arterial inflammation in the setting of CVDs. 102 Activation of the ROS-sensitive, proinflammatory transcription factor, NF\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB), is believed to play a critical role in age-related vascular inflammation, with increased expression of NF\u03baB observed in ECs from older human subjects. 60, 71 Through its interaction with the inhibitory protein, I\u03baB-\u03b1, NF\u03baB resides in the cytoplasm. 103 In response to ROS 104 or other inflammatory stimuli, 103 I\u03baB-\u03b1 is phosphorylated by the IKK\u03b2 (inhibitor of NF\u03baB kinase subunit-\u03b2) that will then release its inhibition on NF\u03baB, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB and the activation of gene transcription of proinflammatory target genes, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. 103 Age-associated increases in NF\u03baB activity have been directly implicated in arterial dysfunction in older rodents and humans because NF\u03baB inhibition by salicylate (salsalate in humans) improves EDD in aged mice 105 and in overweight/obese middle-aged and older adults. 106 Furthermore, both salsalate treatment 107 and inhibition of the NF\u03baB-target TNF-\u03b1 108 improve aortic stiffness in older adults.\nBoth vascular inflammation, via the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and oxidative stress influence the primary mechanisms of extracellular matrix changes in the vessel wall with aging ( Figure 4 ). Implicated in age-related arterial remodeling is an imbalance between MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) and their inhibitors, MMP-mediated arterial remodeling, elastin breakdown and fragmentation, differential changes in isoform expression and glycation of collagens, TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2)-associated collagen accumulation, 109 and VSMC (vascular smooth muscle cell) migration, proliferation, and senescence (a more complete discussion of the specific role of the VSMC in arterial aging can be found in a recent review 110 ). Although the VSMCs of large arteries also directly impact arterial structure and stiffness by synthesizing and secreting extracellular matrix proteins, the interaction of the VSMCs and extracellular matrix components play a critical role in determining arterial stiffness. In addition to the VSMC per se, plasma MMP-9 is also associated with increased large elastic artery stiffness in both healthy individuals and individuals with isolated systolic hypertension. 111 MMP-9 can be transcribed directly via NF\u03baB 112 or indirectly via ROS-mediated activation of NF\u03baB. 113 Interestingly, our group has demonstrated a substantial increase in MMP-9 in aortic tissue in ad libitum-fed mice, but old mice undergoing lifelong CR have aortic MMP-9 similar to young values. 43 Experimentally, the simple viral overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 is sufficient to induce fibrosis. 114 With aging, arterial expression of TGF-\u03b2 is elevated in aortas of mice, and this is associated with greater collagen I and III content in the adventitia and reduced medial elastin content in the aorta, as well as increased arterial superoxide. 115 In addition to modulation by oxidative stress and inflammation, both MMPs and TGF-\u03b2 also appear to be influenced by NO bioavailability. For example, inhibition of NO via in vivo treatment with the NOS (NO synthase) inhibitor, L-NAME, increased both markers of inflammation in the heart and coronary arteries of rats. 116 Likewise, it was demonstrated that shear stress-induced NO downregulates MMP-2 expression in cultured ECs and further that treatment of ECs with an NO donor under static culture conditions will mimic this shear stress-induced reduction in MMP-2. 117 In addition, iNOS (inducible NOS)-associated NO inhibits MMP-9, as activity of this MMP is induced after iNOS inhibition and inhibited by SMC-produced NO. 118 Conversely, Figure 4 . Mechanisms of age-associated arterial dysfunction. The vascular aging phenotype is characterized by increased large artery stiffness and pulse pressure and reduced endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) and NO bioavailability. Oxidative stress, caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the absence of an adequate antioxidant defense, and inflammation are 2 interconnected mechanisms that underlie arterial dysfunction in advanced age. Increases in oxidant production with aging are associated with increased NOX (NADPH oxidase) \u2212 and mitochondrial-produced ROS, such as O 2 \u2212 and H 2 O 2 . These ROS act to (1) quench bioavailable NO, thus limiting EDD; (2) induce inflammatory signaling through NF\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB) activation; and (3) induce MMP (matrix metalloproteinase)-9 and TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) that contribute to alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM), including increases in collagen content and decreases or fragmentation of elastin that contribute to increases in arterial stiffening. In a vicious cycle, increased NF\u03baB activation also exacerbates both oxidative stress and inflammation by transcribing oxidant enzymes, such as NOX, proinflammatory cytokines, and adhesion molecules, such as TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), and this contributes to downstream increases in MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b2 expression. Increased adhesion molecule expression contributes to the infiltration of immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages (M\u03c6), to the perivascular tissues, and these immune cells further exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress through the production of cytokines, such as INF (interferon)-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as O 2 \u2212 (illustration credit: Ben Smith).\nNO derived from macrophages can suppress TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of MMP-1), leading to increased MMP-9 and VSMC migration when assessed in an in vitro wound healing assay, 119 supporting a role of immune cell-derived ROS in vascular remodeling. Thus, increases in oxidative stress and inflammation and decreases in NO bioavailability with aging may act in concert to alter both TGF-\u03b2 and MMPs-important determinants of the structural components of the artery-thereby influencing arterial stiffness. Thus, all of the 3 major layers of the artery, the in-tima, media, and adventitia, contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation that impair vascular function (in-depth reviews of each of these vascular components are available 110, 120, 121 ). Interestingly, oxidative stress and inflammation act in a vicious cycle to negatively impact arterial function with aging. Although ROS will act on NF\u03baB to stimulate proinflammatory signaling, proinflammatory signaling itself can stimulate the local production of O 2 \u2212 by inducing transcription of redoxsensitive genes, such as those encoding subunits of NADPH oxidase, 122 and through the local recruitment of immune cells, which exacerbate the presence of inflammatory cytokines and also produce ROS to further promote a pro-oxidant environment. Indeed, advancing age is associated with increases in T and B cells, as well as macrophages in the perivascular adipose tissue of both the aorta and mesenteric vascular arcade. Furthermore, aged splenic immune cells from these same mice demonstrate increased proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with cells isolated from young mice. Importantly, both the elevations in immune cell infiltration and the proinflammatory immune cell phenotype are prevented by CR. 123 Interestingly, both gene expression and activity of NF\u03baB are also reduced in nuclear extracts of arteries and ECs from CR compared with ad libitum-fed old mice. 41, 76 Likewise, although the activity of the NF\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 is decreased with aging, 105, 124 this disinhibition of NF\u03baB is attenuated after CR. 124 Thus, a reduction in NF\u03baB-associated inflammatory signaling may also contribute to improved vascular dysfunction in aged mice after CR. Taken together, it seems that inflammatory and oxidative pathways interact with advancing age to induce and perpetuate arterial dysfunction in a vicious cycle that can be broken by CR."}, {"section_title": "Autophagy", "text": "Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping mechanism that helps to maintain homeostasis. Basal levels of autophagy are necessary to protect tissues from oxidative stress and inflammation by promoting the destruction of damaged proteins and organelles. 125 However, inadequate autophagy will lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and promote further oxidative stress and inflammation. Flux through autophagic processes is stimulated by intracellular and extracellular cues and is aimed at promoting survival and minimizing destruction of required proteins and organelles. Intriguingly, autophagy is reduced in animal models of aging 126 and has recently been implicated as a modulator of longevity, with overexpression of Atg5 leading to the induction of autophagy and an increased life span in mice. 127 Furthermore, nutrient deprivation is a well-established stressor that stimulates autophagy, 128 leading to the speculation that the effects of CR may be mediated by an induction of autophagy. This idea is supported by the finding that there is a lack of life span extension in response to dietary restriction in autophagy-deficient beclin-1 knockdown nematodes. 129 Thus, there seems to be a critical role for autophagy in CR-mediated life span extension, although the role of autophagy in age-related vascular dysfunction or in the vasoprotection afforded by CR has only recently begun to be explored.\nWithin the vasculature, autophagy has been implicated in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including angiogenesis, paracrine responses in the endothelium, vascular wall calcification, and atherosclerosis (reviewed in Nussenzeig et al 130 ). In autophagy-deficient, Atg3 knockdown ECs, there is a blunting of shear-induced eNOS activation and NO production that is associated with increases in both oxidative stress and inflammation, 131 providing evidence for a direct link between autophagy and endothelial function. Pharmacological evidence also supports this link because inhibition of autophagy reduces, and activation enhances, the expression of eNOS in ECs. 132 Autophagy has also been associated with the modulation of eNOS uncoupling, 133 and NO appears to regulate EC mitophagy (mitochondria-specific autophagy). 128 Markers of autophagic flux are lower in both ECs of older adults and arteries of aged mice. 134 Induction of autophagy after treatment with trehalose restores autophagic flux and is associated with improvements in EDD and NO bioavailability, as well as reductions in markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the arteries of aged mice. 134 Likewise, induction of autophagy with spermidine reduces arterial stiffness and improves EDD and NO bioavailability in aged mice. These vascular benefits are associated with a reduction in arterial O 2 \u2212 . 135 Although far from definitive, indirect evidence of a role for increased autophagy after CR comes from a study in cultured ECs. It was found that ECs treated with the CR mimetic, resveratrol, were protected against TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammation through the induction of autophagy. 136 Although it remains unknown whether the vasoprotection afforded by CR is dependent on increases in autophagy, there is growing evidence that impaired autophagic flux plays a critical role in age-related vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation."}, {"section_title": "Countermeasures to Vascular Aging mTOR", "text": "Rapamycin originally was discovered in a soil sample from Easter Island and used as an antifungal metabolite. 137 Through its inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), rapamycin also has antiproliferative and immunosuppressant properties.\n138 mTOR is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that responds to changes in energy balance and regulates many cellular functions, including translation, transcription, protein turnover, metabolism, and stress responses. 139 There are currently 2 known mTOR-signaling complexes: the rapamycin sensitive mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2); the latter is less sensitive to rapamycin and less studied within the vasculature. As such, in this review, we refer to either mTORC1 signaling or general mTOR activity. 140 mTOR inhibition reduces mRNA translation and protein synthesis by activating ribosomal S6K1 (S6 protein kinase) and inhibiting 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic translation factor-binding protein). 137, 141 In early studies, yeast, flies, and nematodes demonstrated life span extension through genetic manipulation or rapamycin treatment that inhibited TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling. 142 Harrison et al 143 reported similar findings in mammals, with rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition leading to life span extension and a delay in age-associated phenotypes. These findings were further supported by a genetic model in which S6K1 knockout led to increased maximal life span and resistance to age-associated pathologies in mice. 144 Taken together, these studies implicate mTOR signaling in aging and its associated diseases.\nAlthough traditionally used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplant patients, rapamycin was recently found to act as a tumor suppressant in certain cancers 145 and appears to have cardioprotective benefits. [146] [147] [148] [149] To the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of rapamycin's cardioprotective benefits in humans was found in kidney transplant patients, in which a lower incidence of hypertension has been reported in patients treated with rapamycin for immunosuppression. 146, 147 In a subsequent study, endothelial function, assessed by radial artery flow-mediated dilation, was also found to be greater in transplant patients treated with rapamycin. 148 In the setting of advancing age, our group has found increased mTOR activation in arteries of old mice that is accompanied by impaired EDD and reduced NO bioavailability 43, 84 and that this can be reversed by 6 weeks of dietary rapamycin treatment. 84 We also observed reductions in superoxide production and NADPH oxidase expression after rapamycin treatment in arteries of old mice. 84 Thus, mTOR inhibition may exert some endothelial-protective effects by altering redox balance or inflammation in advanced age. Indeed, rapamycin treatment has also been shown to reduce liver mitochondrial ROS production in middle-aged mice, 150 as well as increased oxidative stress response gene expression of the antioxidants copper, zinc SOD, MnSOD, and GSH reductase. 151 Moreover, in a rat model of Parkinson disease, rapamycin treatment was shown to be associated with lower oxidative stress and increased GSH peroxidase activity. 152 Lastly, rapamycin reduced the ratio of reduced/oxidized GSH in type 2 diabetic rat hearts, indicative of an improvement in oxidative stress after mTOR inhibition. 153 In addition to its favorable effects on redox balance, rapamycin treatment also results in downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1. 151 These findings were further supported by pathway analysis that revealed an upregulation of free radical scavenging genes and a downregulation of NF\u03baB-signaling genes after rapamycin treatment. 151 Thus, it appears that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin can impact both oxidative stress and inflammation, which may be one mechanism underlying greater NO bioavailability and EDD in rapamycin-treated old mice ( Figure 5) . mTOR inhibition via rapamycin treatment also exerts a beneficial effect on central arterial stiffness. Rapamycin treatment in kidney transplant patients results in lower central arterial stiffness, assessed by PWV and carotid augmentation index, compared with patients who receive cyclosporine treatment for immunosuppression. 149 Lower central arterial stiffness in these patients was also accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure in the peripheral (brachial) and central (carotid) arteries. 149 In old mice, we have shown that age-related aortic stiffening is attenuated after 6 weeks of dietary rapamycin treatment. 84 In contrast to human data, rapamycinmediated reductions in aortic stiffness in old mice were independent of blood pressure changes. 84 The reductions in aortic stiffness after mTOR inhibition in mice are likely related to structural changes in the aorta that are independent of blood pressure because reductions in aortic stiffness in old mice following 6 weeks of rapamycin treatment were accompanied by lower aortic collagen and advanced glycation end products content, although no difference in aortic elastin content was present between groups. 84 Additionally, there may be other cardiac benefits associated with mTOR inhibition that may influence arterial stiffness because rapamycin is a potential therapy for cardiac hypertrophy 154 and vascular restenosis. 155 Although the results of studies utilizing mTOR inhibition to improve vascular aging phenotypes are promising, studies that directly target mTOR in the vasculature are scarce. Further study is warranted to determine whether chronic inhibition of the mTOR pathway via rapamycin or other rapamycin analog treatments systemically and/or whether more direct targeting of mTOR signaling in vascular cell types will be efficacious to improve cardiovascular health in older adults."}, {"section_title": "AMPK", "text": "AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a highly conserved heterotrimeric serine-threonine kinase that is an important energy-sensing signaling protein that integrates energy balance, metabolism, and stress resistance. 156 AMPK is made up of a catalytic \u03b1-subunit, a structural \u03b2-subunit, and the AMPK-binding site containing \u03b3-subunit.\n157 AMPK activation requires phosphorylation of its \u03b1-subunit and occurs in response to increased AMP:ATP ratio, as well as physiological stimuli, such as shear stress, heat shock, exercise, and hypoxia. 157 Interestingly, blunting age-related physiological dysfunction after mTOR inactivation also results in increased AMPK activity, 144 whereas AMPK activation results in direct mTOR inhibition via phosphorylation of raptor-a critical mTOR adaptor protein. 158, 159 Additionally, AMPK signaling has been shown to be upregulated in S6K1 knockout mice that have reduced mTOR signaling. 144 Pharmacological AMPK activation can be achieved by aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) or metformin. 157 AICAR is a direct activator of AMPK via phosphorylation at the \u03b12 subunit, 157 whereas metformin inhibits complex I of the respiratory chain, 160 indirectly elevating the AMP:ATP ratio. 161 Importantly, indirect activation of AMPK by metformin also stimulates glycolysis, which may result in numerous AMPK-independent effects that impact the transcription factors and kinases involved in other cell cycle and metabolic pathways (p53 [tumor suppressor protein p53], p38, MAPK [mitogen-activated protein kinase], PKC [protein kinase C], and Akt [RAC-alpha serine/threonineprotein kinase]). [162] [163] [164] Therefore, metformin-mediated effects cannot solely be attributed to AMPK. Importantly, increased AMPK and decreased mTOR signaling are implicated in the longevity and physiological benefits associated with long-term CR in mammals 143, 144 and thus may be efficacious therapeutic targets to improve arterial function in advanced age.\nAMPK activity has been shown to be reduced in the aorta 165 and cerebral arteries 166 of old rodents ( Figure 5 ). In cultured ECs, AMPK is an activator of eNOS 167, 168 that contributes to NO production via direct phosphorylation of eNOS, 169, 170 as well as through Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) and Akt signaling. 168, 171 Using metformin treatment, AMPK activation has been shown to augment endothelial function in type 1 and 2 diabetic rodents. 172, 173 Similarly, AICAR treatment in old mice increases EDD, although this improvement is not mediated by increased NO bioavailability. 165 An NO-independent effect of AICAR was also found after acute in vitro administration to isolated aortic rings. 174 AMPK activators may impact endothelial function through transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in inflammation, mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, glucose metabolism, cell growth, and oxidative stress signaling. 157 Indeed, after AMPK activation, there is a reduction in inflammatory cytokines that is associated with blunted NF\u03baB signaling in ECs. 175, 176 Thus, AMPK activators seem to improve endothelial function but likely do so in an NO-independent mechanism. There are few studies that have investigated the beneficial effects of AMPK activation on central arterial stiffness. In response to enhanced AMPK activity after metformin treatment, reductions in aortic PWV were observed in premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome. 177 Although the effects of directly augmenting AMPK activity in old mice are unknown, accelerated high-fat diet-induced arterial stiffening and elevated collagen I expression are attenuated by AICAR in a mouse model deficient in the putative antiaging gene, Klotho. 178 Taken together, these findings suggest that augmenting AMPK signaling increases bioavailability of NO and vasodilatory responses, 168 ,171,179 and although there is less direct evidence to suggest that increased AMPK activity lowers central arterial stiffness in advanced age, further study is warranted ( Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "SIRT", "text": "SIRTs are a family of transcriptional regulators that play a major role in longevity 129 and inflammation. 180 SIRTs were originally discovered in a screen for gene-silencing factors in yeast and, therefore, given the name Sir2 (silent information regulator 2). Little research was conducted on the Sir2 family until these proteins were identified as critical regulators of longevity. 181 Thereafter, the mammalian Sir2 homologues, SIRTs 1 to 7, were quickly identified as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylases 182 and ADP ribosyltransferases. SIRTs 1 to 4 have been implicated in the control of cellular metabolism with SIRT-2, 3, and 4 expressed in the mitochondria and SIRT-1 expressed predominately in the nucleus with some cytoplasmic expression. 183 The majority of the physiological benefits of CR on longevity can be attributed to the SIRT family and, specifically, SIRT-1.\n183,184 SIRT-1 acts by deacetylating histone and nonhistone proteins 185 to modify nuclear transcription factors, coregulators, and proteins to adapt gene expression in response to the cellular energy state and provide stress resistance by modulation of proinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways via deacetylating histone and nonhistone proteins. 180, 185 Evidence for a critical role of SIRT-1 on longevity comes from studies in genetic models in which sirt-1 deletion abolishes the life span extension afforded by CR, 186 whereas sirt-1 overexpression recapitulates the CR phenotype.\n187 Figure 5 .

AICAR indicates aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NMN, nicotamide mononucleotide; SIRT, sirtuin; and STAC, sirtuin-activating compound.\nThese longevity-associated properties of SIRTs can also be ascribed to SIRT-6, which is also an NAD-dependent nuclear deacetylase that regulates life span 188 and has been shown to be elevated in rats after CR. 189 Although emerging evidence suggests SIRT-6 seems to play a role in endothelial function, 190 the majority of vascular aging studies have focused on SIRT-1, which will be discussed further.\nSIRT-1 activity has been associated with reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation, and proapoptotic signaling, as well as improvements in insulin sensitivity, DNA damage repair, and telomere stability. 191 Age-related decreases in SIRT-1 expression are present in a multitude of tissues, 192 and our group has demonstrated age-related reductions in SIRT-1 expression and activity in the vasculature of humans and mice, 43, 52, 192, 193 which are associated with endothelial dysfunction in old mice. 43, 192 However, reduced SIRT-1 expression and endothelial dysfunction can be prevented by short-and long-term CR. 41, 43, 52 Additionally, lifelong transgenic wholebody overexpression of sirt-1 prevents the age-related decline in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. 194 SIRT-1 has been reported to modulate NO and endothelial function in small and large arteries directly via deacetylation and subsequent activation of eNOS. 192, 195 To investigate mechanisms for which activation of SIRT-1 prevents/ameliorates age-related vascular dysfunction, several SIRT-1 activators have been investigated, with the majority of studies utilizing the naturally occurring polyphenol, resveratrol. 196 Extremely high doses of resveratrol (2400 mg/kg of food) have been reported to improve EDD in isolated arteries from middle-aged animals after 1 year of treatment. 197 Although there seems to be an improvement in the vascular aging phenotype after resveratrol treatment, 198 there was no effect on life span. 197, 199, 200 Additionally, resveratrol activates \u226415 other unique pathways and is a potent antioxidant and phytoestrogen. 196, 201, 202 Therefore, as with metformin, the pleiotropic resveratrol and other nonspecific agents are not optimal to investigate mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of SIRT-1, but these agents do afford insights as potential therapeutic agents.\nSupplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotidea key NAD + intermediate-has also been shown to increase SIRT-1 activation, 203 resulting in reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction in advanced age. 204 In old mice, chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation increases SIRT-1 activity and reverses age-related endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress 205 and has also recently been shown to increase skeletal muscle angiogenesis and blood flow leading to augmented endurance exercise capacity. 206 However, in middle-aged and older adult humans, augmented NAD + activity via 6 weeks of supplementation with the NAD + precursor, nicotinamide riboside, was not effective in improving EDD, as determined by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. 207 In addition, direct activation of SIRT-1 can be achieved by treatment with the small molecule, SRT-1720, which has been shown to increase life span and preserve glucose tolerance in aged rodents. 208 In addition, our group has demonstrated that 4 weeks of SRT-1720 treatment restores SIRT-1 activity and reduces age-related NF\u03baB acetylation, arterial inflammation, and oxidative stress in old mice. 193 Yet surprisingly, SRT-1720 improvements in EDD are mediated not by increases in NO but by increased reliance on COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) vasodilators. 193 Therefore, despite age-related reductions in vascular SIRT-1 that accompany reduced NO bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction, increased activation of SIRT-1 with SRT-1720 improves endothelial function and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, but these effects are not associated with a restoration of NO.\nSIRT-1 also plays a role in central arterial stiffness because age-related reductions in aortic SIRT-1 expression are accompanied by elevated aortic stiffness in old mice ( Figure 5) . 43, 192 Moreover, transgenic whole-body overexpression of sirt-1 prevents aortic stiffening in old mice, 194 and, recently, our laboratory has observed lower aortic stiffness in all age groups (ie, aged 3-24 months), as well as a slower rate of aortic stiffening with advancing age in transgenic sirt-1 overexpressing mice. 209 We also observed that a youthful aortic elastin:collagen ratio is maintained in 24-month-old transgenic sirt-1 overexpressing mice, indicating that sirt-1 overexpression prevents adverse structural changes in arteries, possibly through its negative regulation of MMP-9 or a positive regulation of TIMP-1. 210, 211 Age-related reductions in aortic SIRT-1 expression and the associated aortic stiffness 43, 192 can be prevented by CR. 41, 43, 52 Pharmacological SIRT-1 activation has also been shown to be beneficial for aortic stiffening. In nonhuman primates, high-fat and high-sucrose diet-induced increases in aortic stiffness can be prevented by resveratrol. 212 Nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementationmediated increases in arterial SIRT-1 activity can reverse agerelated aortic stiffening and normalize aortic collagen and elastin content in old mice. 205 Importantly, reductions in aortic stiffness, as well as blood pressure, have been reported in middle-aged and older adults after 6 weeks of nicotinamide riboside supplementation. 207 Taken together, these data suggest that SIRT-1 activation may hold significant promise for ameliorating endothelial dysfunction and aortic stiffening with aging or CVD. Future studies utilizing small molecule activators of SIRTs are needed to determine whether they can ameliorate age-related CVD pathologies."}, {"section_title": "Klotho", "text": "The Klotho gene was discovered in 1997 and named after Clotho-1 of the 3 Fate sisters who was responsible for spinning the thread of human life in ancient Greek mythology. In the initial study, Kuro-o et al 213 demonstrated that inactivation of klotho resulted in a prematurely aged phenotype in mice characterized by infertility, arteriosclerosis, skin atrophy, osteoporosis, emphysema, as well as a short life span, with homozygous Klotho knockout (Klotho \u2212/\u2212 ) mice dying at 8 to 9 weeks of age. Importantly, Klotho \u2212/\u2212 mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice until 3 to 4 weeks of age, indicating that Klotho deletion-related effects were not because of incomplete development. 213 In follow-up studies, transgenic overexpression of Klotho was shown to extend life span in mice by 20% to 30%, 214 promote cardioprotection, 215 and reduce oxidative stress. 216 The klotho protein appears to exist in 2 forms: as a transmembrane protein that is bound to fibroblast growth factor receptor and as a circulating protein following cleavage from its transmembrane form. 217 As a circulating protein, klotho seems to exert antiaging effects by suppressing growth factor signaling and oxidative stress. 214, 216 In general, klotho declines with advancing age, 218 resulting in a 2-fold reduction in circulating klotho concentrations from the age of 40 to 70 years in September 14, 2018 humans. 219 Additionally, genetic variants of Klotho can affect its secretion because heterozygous expression of the KL-VERSUS Klotho variant results in greater klotho secretion 220 and is associated with longevity and cardiovascular health. 221, 222 However, for unknown reasons, homozygous KL-VERSUS Klotho variant results in lower klotho secretion 223 and is inversely associated with longevity and risk of CVD. 221, 222, 224 Still, other Klotho genetic variants are associated with a greater risk of CVD. 225 Although Klotho variants are common and seem to have some relevance in aging and CVD by altering klotho secretion, further discussion on the intricacies of functional Klotho variants is beyond the scope of this review.\nWhether Klotho is expressed within the arterial vasculature remains a highly controversial topic, 226 but there are reports that Klotho is expressed in both human and mouse arteries. [227] [228] [229] Despite the controversy on arterial Klotho expression, wholebody Klotho haplodeficiency (Klotho +/\u2212 ), which results in lower circulating klotho protein, 230 reduces aortic eNOS expression 230 and impairs aortic and resistance arterial endothelial function in mice 231 ( Figure 5 ). Accordingly, Klotho deficiency-associated endothelial dysfunction can be reversed by parabiosis between wild-type and Klotho +/\u2212 mice. 231 Additionally, in OLETF (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokshuma fatty) rats-a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity-adenovirus-mediated Klotho gene delivery reverses aortic endothelium-mediated vasorelaxation and augments NO production. 232 In addition to its endothelial-protective role, klotho seems to also exert hypotensive effects, as Klotho gene delivery in OLETF rats led to a lower SBP and prevented medial hypertrophy in the aorta. 232 Although this blood pressure-lowering effect was not consistent between rodent models, because no reduction in blood pressure was observed after Klotho gene delivery in spontaneously hypertensive rats, 233 the underlying physiological mechanisms for elevated blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat may limit the generalizability of findings from that model. Nevertheless, there is an apparent inverse relationship between klotho and aortic stiffness because serum Klotho concentrations are \u224845% lower in patients with elevated arterial stiffness and hypertension. 230 In mice, Klotho +/\u2212 results in greater aortic stiffness and blood pressure that are accompanied by a reduced elastin:collagen ratio, as well as elevated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. 230, 234 Despite equivocal findings on the ability of Klotho gene delivery to lower blood pressure, augmenting klotho does seem to increase antioxidant defenses in rats and mice, and this is a likely mechanism underlying the improvements in endothelial function. 233 In previous reviews, we have commented on the interdependence of mTOR, AMPK, and SIRT-1 because they relate to the aging vasculature, 235 illustrating that decreased AMPK activity reduces SIRT-1 responses to low energy states, 236 whereas SIRT-1 directly interacts with the mTORC1 and SIRT-1 inhibition via nicotinamide-increased mTOR activation. 237 We now expand on those interactions, update with recent findings, and also include a discussion of Klotho because it seems to have some interaction with or governance over these pathways ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, Klotho +/\u2212 mice have reduced aortic SIRT-1 and AMPK expression. 230 Consequently, high-fat diet-induced arterial stiffening and elevated collagen I expression are attenuated by AICAR in Klotho +/\u2212 mice, 178 whereas Klotho deficiency-induced aortic stiffness and hypertension are ameliorated after SRT-1720 treatment in Klotho +/\u2212 mice. 230 Moreover, vascular calcification, associated with increased mTOR activation, results in lower Klotho expression that can be reversed by rapamycin treatment. 229 Alternatively, rapamycin treatment is ineffective at reducing vascular calcification when klotho is deleted in Klotho \u2212/\u2212 mice. 229 Collectively, these studies suggest that Klotho deficiency downregulates AMPK and SIRT-1 expression, which may contribute to age-related arterial stiffening. 230 Further, they suggest that although Klotho is required for some of the vascular benefits afforded by mTOR inhibition, mTOR activity also impacts klotho expression."}, {"section_title": "Cellular Senescence in Vascular Aging", "text": "Cellular senescence is defined as irreversible cell cycle arrest and occurs in response to critically short telomeres, excessive mitogenic signals, 238 increases in extracellular or intracellular stressors like oxidative stress, 239 chromatin disruptions, 240 and DNA damage. 241 First described by Leonard Hayflick as an in vitro serial passage phenomenon in human fibroblasts, it is hypothesized that senescence develops to provide a critical tumor suppressive mechanism that prevents passing damaged DNA to daughter cells. 242, 243 Senescence is induced by the 2 major tumor suppressor pathways, known as p53/p21 (cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1A) and pRB (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A p16/retinoblastoma-like protein-1) pathways. 244 The preference toward one pathway versus another seems to be cell type specific 244, 245 with variation across species. 246 Currently, a preponderance of data suggests that senescence via the p53/p21 pathway is activated primarily by DNA damage and telomere dysfunction, whereas the p16/ pRB pathway is linked primarily to mitogenic stress, chromatin disruptions, or general cellular stress, 244, 245, 247 although exceptions can be found. Senescent cells are characterized by a proinflammatory, oxidant SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) 242 that occurs within a few days of senescence induction and seems to be irreversible because of stable chromatin modifications around clusters of SASP genes. 248, 249 The release of classical SASP inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), as well as ROS production occurs when vascular cells are passaged to senescence 250, 251 and can be found in ECs sampled from older adults. 43 The SASP likely reinforces cell cycle arrest in an autocrine fashion and activates immune cell surveillance of senescent cells. 242, 252 Furthermore, several studies support a major role for elevated NF\u03baB activation in the induction and maintenance of the SASP in human and rodent cells, which, as mentioned previously, is a major inflammatory hub in age-related inflammation. 253, 254 Within the vascular compartment, senescent cells have been associated with a host of CVD states, such as atherosclerotic plaque, 255 abdominal aortic aneurysm, 256 and hypertension. 257 Furthermore, we and others have recently shown that senescent cells accumulate in normal arterial tissue during the life span of humans. 258, 259 We demonstrated that markers of senescence are increased in ECs taken from arteries and veins of older healthy adults. Importantly, there was a strong negative correlation between a marker of endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16, such that higher expression of endothelial Taken together, it is clear that vascular cell senescence is sufficient to blunt vascular function with advancing age. Conceptually, vascular cell senescence likely contributes to the spread of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress from senescent cells to healthy nonsenescent neighboring cells via the SASP (Figure 6 ). Thus, promoting chronic low-grade inflammation and subsequent oxidative stress in nonsenescent vascular cells. In summation, these alterations blunt NO and endothelial function and could lead to elevations in large artery stiffness through chronic matrix remodeling. Lastly, this chronic inflammation and oxidative stress could persist and accumulate indefinitely in the vasculature until removal of the senescent cells. Therefore, until clear mechanisms of age-related vascular senescence are elucidated, therapeutic options targeting senescence-mediated dysfunction will be limited to senolytics or to the chronic treatment of the associated inflammation or oxidative stress pathways. Although the precise mechanisms of cellular senescence induction are still unclear, several proof-of-concept hypotheses have been tested in relation to genomic instability, which will be discussed further in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Age-Related Genomic Instability: Inducer of Vascular Senescence and Dysfunction", "text": "One emerging molecular mechanism that explains the occurrence of senescent vascular smooth muscle cells and ECs in older adults is genomic instability. Genomic instability, or DNA damage acquired over time, is an important mechanism that may underlie the age-related accumulation of senescent cells reported in arterial tissues. 258, 259 Age-related genomic instability in vascular cells can occur from a variety of genotoxic insults, including oxidative stress 261, 262 and mechanical stress, 263 resulting in potentially harmful mutations or chromosomal instability. It has been well described that augmented DNA damage via ionizing radiation leads to a succession of events, including vascular apoptosis, cellular senescence, vascular dysfunction, and subsequent end-organ damage . In recent years, numerous studies have highlighted the role of dysregulated DNA damage repair pathways in the development of vascular cell senescence, dysfunction, and pathology. Specifically, reduced expression of a major double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) break repair protein, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein kinase, via haploinsufficiency, accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis in an ApoE (apolipoprotein E) model. 265 This atheroprone phenotype is associated with elevated mitochondrial ROS production, highlighting the interplay between genomic damage and mitochondrial function. 265 Furthermore, mutations in 2 other DNA damage repair factors result in more subtle phenotypes typical of those seen in aged mice. Deficiency of the ERCC (DNA excision repair protein) 1 and 2 and advanced age in mice both result in profound increases in senescent cells within vasculature, increases in large artery stiffening, SBP, and endothelial dysfunction. 266 Interestingly, the emergence of these phenotypes only occurs with chronological aging of the mice, evidence that it likely takes time for the DNA mutations and damage to accumulate, and it is through their accumulation that senescence and subsequent vascular dysfunction is induced. Similarly, mutations in mitochondrial DNA can influence vascular function. Accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage in mice that lack a critical enzyme, POLG (mitochondrial polymerase-\u03b3)-a catalytic unit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase-accelerates atherogenesis in comparison with wild-type POLG/APOE-deficient mice. 267 This finding has been supported by human studies in which atheromas are more severe in arteries that display greater amounts of mitochondrial DNA damage. 267 Taken together, these data suggest that DNA damage is associated with vascular aging and associated CVDs and that inducing DNA damage in rodent models is sufficient to produce an arterial aging phenotype.\nLastly, telomere dysfunction is another form of genomic instability that may lead to cellular senescence with advancing age. Telomere dysfunction, defined here as dsDNA damage response occurring at the telomere, can occur in several ways and will end in repair (if possible) or cell cycle arrest. First, telomere dysfunction can occur in response to critically short telomeres that are generated by numerous divisions, extensive genotoxic damage to the telomere, or by the cell being formed with short telomeres. Some investigators estimate the critically short telomere length to be around 300 to 400 bp. 268, 269 A critically short telomere will elicit a dsDNA damage signal because of the substantially shortened telomere being unable to form the T-loop structure at the end of the chromosome. Breakdown of the T-loop structure gives the appearance of a dsDNA break, which in turn elicits a response from the DNA damage machinery. 270 This is the mechanism hypothesized to induce senescence in primary cells that are serially passaged. 271 A second mechanism of telomere dysfunction is the occurrence of true dsDNA breaks at the telomeric DNA. Telomeric DNA is particularly guanine rich, making it particularly susceptible to oxidation. 272 Therefore, it is feasible that this may directly promote dsDNA breaks and the subsequent response. Lastly, alterations in the shelterin proteins that form and maintain the T loop may be damaged, dysfunctional, or present in insufficient amounts. This would also result in uncapping of the T loop and a dsDNA response at the telomeric DNA. Importantly, we do not define shortening of telomeres per se as dysfunctional. Telomere length may provide important information about the proliferation status of immune cells with aging or possibly vascular cells in atherogenesis, but it provides little information on the status of the canonical signaling pathway necessary to induce cellular senescence. Furthermore, data suggest that mean telomere length in the vasculature is not associated with classic cellular senescence signaling via p53 and p21. 259 Therefore, when examining mechanistic determinants of cellular senescence via telomere dysfunction, telomere length alone is not sufficient, and a secondary measure of DNA damage at the telomere (IF-FISH [immunofluorescent-fluorescent in situ hybridization], ChIP [chromatin immunoprecipitation] assay, etc) is likely necessary to capture the complete picture of telomere dysfunction within a cell or tissue.\nCurrently, while several studies have demonstrated telomere attrition in the vasculature with aging and age-related diseases, only one has shown that healthy aging results in age-related telomere dysfunction with dsDNA breaks localized to telomeric DNA. 259 Furthermore, in arteries from hypertensive patients, telomere length was similar to normotensive patients, but the arteries of hypertensive patients demonstrated greater telomeric dsDNA damage. Recent proof-of-concept studies suggest that telomere dysfunction is sufficient to induce arterial dysfunction because critically short telomeres may induce endothelial dysfunction. 273 However, these effects may be confounded by the established beneficial effects of telomerase on vascular function that is mediated through reductions in mitochondrial ROS, rather than through direct effects on telomere length. 274 Furthermore, a recent study that utilized inducible deletion of the shelterin protein, TRF2 (telomeric repeat-binding factor 2), suggests that telomere dysfunction and subsequent vascular senescence is sufficient to induce large and small artery endothelial dysfunction, loss of NO, and increases in SBP. 275 Similarly, an atherogenic mouse model of TRF2 loss of function in vascular smooth muscle cells demonstrated increased atherosclerotic plaque formation and markers of senescence. 276 Therefore, induction of telomere dysfunction is sufficient to promote atherogenesis and age-related arterial phenotypes.\nTaken together, mouse models of augmented DNA damage, blunted DNA damage repair (genomic or mitochondrial), and dysfunctional telomeres demonstrate age like vascular phenotypes, which include senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, large artery stiffness, and elevated blood pressure. Although this is promising, these animal models still do not provide mechanistic proof that these genomic changes are responsible for arterial changes seen in older animals or humans. Future studies need to provide data to demonstrate that manipulation of these pathways can attenuate or reverse age-related changes."}, {"section_title": "Role of the Vasculature in the Rate of Biological Aging", "text": "While age-related arterial dysfunction is heavily tied to CVD, emerging research is also interested in elucidating the role of aging in different vascular cells types (eg, ECs and vascular smooth muscle cells) in diseases beyond traditional CVDs. The potential for vascular cells to influence age-related nonCVDs and life span can be appreciated by realizing that the human vasculature is expansive, residing in nearly every tissue of the body. It is also estimated that ECs represent 2.1% of the total cell number (6\u00d710 11 total number of ECs) in the human body, making it one of the highest of the noncirculating cell types. For comparison, adipocytes are estimated at 0.2%, hepatocytes at 0.8%, and red blood cells at \u224884% of the total cells in the body. 277 Therefore, it is reasonable that the phenotype of ECs may independently influence the surrounding tissue, via alterations in blood flow, nutrient delivery, immune cell infiltration, permeability, etc, and through their function as a secretory tissue, releasing bioactive molecules that could then alter the cellular homeostasis of the surrounding tissues. The latter is an interesting concept that we will explore in the next paragraphs.\nSupporting a vascular-centric theory of biological aging, Hasegawa et al 278 reported reduced markers of cellular senescence (ie, \u03b2-galalactosidase staining) after reducing the proinflammatory NF\u03baB pathway in ECs using the endothelial-specific (Tie2 Cre) dominant-negative I\u03baB\u03b1 (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha) in normal chow-fed old mice. The mice also demonstrated blunted adhesion molecule expression and greater systemic NO bioavailability and prevention of age-related increases in blood pressure. Interestingly, life span also increased, and although the group size was small (n=21-25) for a life span cohort study, these are promising data that should stimulate future studies to better understand the role of endothelial inflammation, senescence, and NO in life span. An increased life span in this animal model is particularly compelling because the cause of death in aged rodents is not typically cardiovascular in nature, therefore, implying that this manipulation may alter cancer and kidney diseases, which are the major causes of death in laboratory rodents. 279 Hasegawa et al 278 also examined the role of attenuated endothelial NF\u03baB signaling in high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance-an expression of metabolic dysfunction that is similar to that which occurs as a consequence of aging in mouse models."}, {"section_title": "Role of Vascular Aging in Metabolic Dysfunction", "text": "Genetic blockade of proinflammatory signaling in the endothelium prevented obesity-and age-associated systemic insulin resistance and adipose inflammation and was associated with increases in skeletal muscle blood flow. 278 These studies provide direct evidence of a role of endothelial function in the control of metabolic homeostasis and add to the evidence that dysfunction of the arteries contributes to age-associated metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases with advancing age, is associated with peripheral insulin resistance, 280 and increases patient risk for diabetes mellitus, as well as CVD and all-cause mortality. 281 In the setting of metabolic syndrome 282 and aging, 283 the adipose is a metabolically important endocrine organ, contributing significantly to systemic inflammation. With aging and obesity, immune cells infiltrate adipose tissue and become important sources of circulating cytokines and adipokines that alter systemic insulin sensitivity. Because the endothelium is the site of immune cell adhesion and is itself a source of inflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecules, the vascular endothelium plays a critical role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis via modulation of tissue inflammation. 284 In the setting of aging, reduced EDD and impaired angiogenic sprouting in adipose tissue have been associated with metabolic dysfunction and adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative stress, 285 suggesting that endothelial function in the adipose tissue may be an important determinant of metabolic homeostasis with advancing age.\nAdipose tissue blood flow also influences metabolic and endocrine dysfunction in insulin-resistant states. Both fasted and postprandial blood flow to adipose tissue is impaired in obesity and may contribute to altered lipid metabolism and increased CVD risk. 286 There is also tight coupling between the vascular and metabolic functions in the adipose tissue, with adipose tissue blood flow and lipolysis increasing in response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and vasoconstriction and suppression of lipolysis in response to \u03b1-adrenergic stimulation. 287 Thus, adrenergic modulation of vascular tone and lipolysis has an important role in the normal control of metabolism. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that systemic metabolic homeostasis is importantly modulated by vascular control of tissue blood flow and by inflammation."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Vascular Aging on AD and Cognitive Function", "text": "AD pathology is another condition in which the role of vascular dysfunction is becoming increasingly appreciated. The pathology of AD has been well characterized with the accumulation of both A\u03b2 (\u03b2-amyloid) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of Tau), and inflammation in neurons and in the neurovascular unit. 288 Although the vascular contribution to nonfamilial AD progression was overlooked for a long time, it is now clear that the vasculature and CVD risk factors influence the pathological progression of AD. 289 A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that AD risk is increased in patients who have had a prior stroke, 290 but stroke alone may not completely explain vascular links to AD. For example, autopsies performed on deceased patients in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging revealed that intracranial atherosclerosis increased dementia risk that was independent of the presence of AD-related pathologies or cerebral infarcts. 291 Furthermore, age-related elevations in large elastic artery stiffness are associated with greater cerebral artery pulse pressure, cognitive impairments, and AD diagnosis. [292] [293] [294] Taken together, these studies suggest that 2 of the major age-related arterial changes, large artery stiffness and cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction, may play a critical role in the development of cognitive impairment and AD, both through increased stroke risk, as well as through other, as of yet unknown, factors.\nEmerging data that support the role of age-related large elastic artery stiffness and enhanced pulsatility in the development of cerebrovascular dysfunction and subsequent cognitive impairment and AD pathology have recently been reviewed in detail. 295 Briefly, increased large artery stiffness may propagate pulsatility to the cerebral circulation, disturbing autoregulation via impaired myogenic tone, 296 with subsequent September 14, 2018 alterations in regional cerebral perfusion and impaired neurovascular coupling. 297 Other consequences include endothelial dysfunction, impairments in blood-brain barrier function, altered angiogenesis, and perfusion-related outcomes. 298, 299 Age-related changes in moment-to-moment cerebral blood flow regulation have been associated with altered neuronal activity, 297 and abnormal neurovascular coupling is associated with cognitive decline with aging. 300 Furthermore, a direct link between impaired neurovascular coupling, functional hyperemia, and measures of spatial and recognition memory has been shown in a mouse model. 301 Although all of these changes may underlie increasing neurovascular inflammation and neuronal damage, small artery cerebral endothelial dysfunction in particular may be involved in many etiologies involved in cognitive decline and AD. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction in the small cerebral arteries likely influences inflammatory/oxidative stress in the neurovascular unit, blood flow regulation via altered resistance artery tone, blood-brain barrier function, and adhesion or infiltration of immune cells. Additionally, cerebral artery endothelial function may directly influence the A\u03b2 precursor protein processing and the activity of critical A\u03b2 production enzymes via endothelial NO production. 302 Thus, age-related impairments in cerebral vascular function, because of enhanced large artery stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, are a likely initiation site for increased Tau and A\u03b2 accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, thereby contributing to future progression of cognitive impairment and AD.\nTaking the evidence from metabolic syndrome and AD together, vascular dysfunction seems to be an important component of some chronic, age-related disease states in addition to those more traditionally thought of as CVDs. Gaining a better appreciation of the underlying mechanisms and regional differences in age-related vascular dysfunction may lead to improvements in treatments for these disorders with concomitant improvements in health span."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, we have described the role of arterial aging in the progression of clinical CVD, which has a major societal impact via morbidity and mortality in the United States, as well as the vast majority of developed nations. Also presented were several poignant examples of how the vasculature impacts non-CVD states, as well as evidence that the vasculature not only plays a role in mammalian health span but in life span as well. However, the role of the vasculature in non-CVD agerelated diseases and life span is insufficiently understood, reinforcing the importance of research on the biological aging processes in this dynamic tissue. Age-related oxidative stress and inflammation in arteries interact to suppress vascular function, but this state can be prevented by lifestyle intervention to ultimately extend health span and life span. Emerging evidence suggests several promising pathways, such as Klotho or energy-sensing pathways, for example, SIRTs, mTOR, and AMPK, that are attractive pharmacological targets for interventions, the manipulation of which has been demonstrated, in some cases, to restore normal youthful pathway activity in older mammals (Figures 2 and 5) . Although antiaging therapies per se were not a sole focus of the present review, the reader is directed to a recent review expanding on this area of research. 303 Unfortunately, we as a research community still do not understand the critical initiating event(s) that alter the cellular machinery to induce the well-described vicious cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation. Although some focus on the effects of acute alterations in circulating lipids, glucose, or circulating factors associated with sedentary aging, others seek to define the role of molecular events as potential key initiators, as we described in detail with genomic instability and cellular senescence. Importantly, it is likely that these areas are related, suggesting the necessity for strong cross-field collaborations to best answer this critical question. Finally, treating older adults with prescription drugs to ameliorate age-related vascular dysfunction to prevent future CVD is not currently accepted in the absence of clinical disease. Although clinical guidelines continue to be altered to allow earlier treatment (most recently, the hypertensive cutoff for SBP being reduced from 140 to 130 mm Hg 304 ), the ethical and moral obligations to society to treat arterial dysfunction are complicated because a single drug treatment or lifestyle intervention may not always be effective in reversing this state. Overall, despite impressive advancements in understanding the biology of the aging vasculature, as aging researchers, we must strive to better elucidate pathways to identify and develop appropriate countermeasures against age-related arterial dysfunction. Ultimately, to quote the phrase popularized by Sir William Osler in the late 19th century, you are only as old as your arteries."}]
