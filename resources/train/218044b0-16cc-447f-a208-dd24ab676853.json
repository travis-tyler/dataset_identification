[{"section_title": "", "text": "T he number of Americans addicted to and dying from prescription opioids has reached an epidemic level. [1] [2] [3] This crisis has stimulated growing public awareness and regulations, including expansion of prescription drug monitoring programs, prescriber education in opioid use and safe prescribing, and new state and federal laws and policies. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In October 2014, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reclassified all hydrocodone products from schedule III to schedule II, 16, 17 with a prescription limit of a 30-day supply and no refills allowed.\nSeveral single-center studies showed a decrease in opioid prescribing rates after the rescheduling. [18] [19] [20] [21] A national study using data from U.S. pharmacies also reported a decrease in prescribing rates for hydrocodone and prescription opioids overall from 2011 to 2015. 22 In our previous study using national commercial health insurance data for individuals aged 18 to 64, we reported a 26% relative decrease in hydrocodone prescribing and an 11% relative decrease in total opioid prescribing from 2013 to 2015. 23 No previous studies have focused on the effect of the hydrocodone rescheduling on the older Medicare population. Medicare enrollees are at least 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with opioid abuse as commercial health insurance enrollees. 24 Older adults are particularly susceptible to toxicity and adverse effects from opioid use. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Understanding the effect of regulating opioid accessibility for Medicare enrollees, particularly those with prolonged prescriptions, is critical to the development of effective public health interventions.\nThe current study examined the association between the hydrocodone rescheduling policy and changes in opioid prescribing rates and related outcomes from 2013 to 2015 for older Medicare Part D beneficiaries. We hypothesized that the 2014 rescheduling would be associated with declines in opioid prescriptions. We also hypothesized that hospitalizations from opioid overdoses would decrease. Our primary focus was to assess prescriptions for prolonged use-defined as at least 90 days supply in a year-but we also report on prescriptions for any opioid and for high-dose opioids."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Source of Data", "text": "This was a retrospective cohort study using enrollment and claims data for a 20% "}, {"section_title": "Establishment of the Study Cohorts", "text": "We constructed different study cohorts for different outcomes.

Opioids given by injection were not included in the study.\nWe categorized opioid users as enrollees who had at least one opioid prescription in the study year. Prolonged opioid prescription was defined as having a 90-day supply or longer in a study year. To determine high-dose prescriptions, we calculated the daily morphine milligram equivalent dose (MME), which summarizes opioids with different ingredients and strengths to estimate the daily opioid level. 31 The formula for MME is [(strength per unit) x (quantity prescribed) x (MME conversion factor)] / (daily supply).\nWe classified enrollees who had an opioid supply of 100 MME or more per day for longer than 30 days in 1 year as high-dose users. For example, a 100 MME is equivalent to approximately 100 mg of hydrocodone per day."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes of Opioid Use", "text": "Acute hospitalization related to potential overdose was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnoses at any position listed in the claim, including opioid-related poisoning (965, E850.1, E950.0, E980.0) or opioid-specific adverse event (E935.0, E935.1, E935.2) plus an overdose diagnosis (276.4, 292.1, 292.8, 486, 496, 518.81, 518.82, E950-E959) from the same admission. 28 "}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary and Regional Characteristics", "text": "Medicare enrollment files provided information on beneficiary age, sex, race and ethnicity, and original entitlement.

Beneficiaries who had at least 1 day of opioid supply available in the month under study contributed to the numerator of the prevalence estimate for that month. We then analyzed the monthly trend of any opioid prescription using an interrupted time-series model. In this analysis, we examined the change in trend across three time periods: preimplementation (2013), implementation (2014), and postimplementation (2015) .\nWe also calculated the proportion of beneficiaries receiving any opioid prescriptions, prolonged opioid prescriptions, and high-dose prescriptions in 2013 and 2015. These were further stratified according to participant and regional characteristics for each study year. Modified Poisson regression models-adjusted for the fixed effect of states, participant and regional characteristics, months of follow-up, and clustering effect within beneficiaries-were constructed to evaluate the prevalence ratio in these prescriptions measured and hospitalizations for opioid toxicity between 2013 and 2015. For beneficiaries with overdose hospitalizations, we calculated and compared the proportion of those who did not receive an opioid prescription preceding at least 1 day's supply in the 6 months before their first hospitalization using logistic regression.

The final rule was published in August 2014 and implemented in October 2014. Figure 1 shows the monthly rate of hydrocodone, schedule II (excluding hydrocodone), schedule III (excluding hydrocodone), and tramadol prescriptions from January 2013 through December 2015. For hydrocodone prescription and prescriptions of any opioid, the rates appear stable in 2013 and the first half of 2014, followed by a decrease in rate in September through November, followed by a stable rate in 2015. With the interrupted time series analysis applied to the preimplementation (2013), implementation (2014), and postimplementation (2015) periods, the slope of the monthly rate in 2013 and 2015 did not differ significantly from 0. In 2014, the slope was 20.079% per month (95% confidence interval (CI)520.102 to 20.055, p<.001).\nAll subsequent analyses compared rates in 2013 and 2015. Supplementary Appendix 2 shows the change between 2013 and 2015 in rates of prescriptions for the different types of opioids. The hydrocodone prescribing rate decreased from 21.9% in 2013 to 18.3% in 2015. There were small but significant increases in nonhydrocodone schedule II and III prescribing (from 10.2% to 10.6% for schedule II, from 3.3% to 4.0% for schedule III, each p<.001). The tramadol prescribing rate was unchanged. Prescriptions for any opioid decreased from the hydrocodone reschedule. The colors of the maps divide states according to quintile of the 2013 rates of prolonged opioid prescribing. In 2013, the lowest rate was in Hawaii (3.6%), and the highest rate was in Alabama (20.0%). By 2015, only 4 states remained in the top quintile, whereas 26 were in the bottom 2 quintiles.

The great majority of those who received prolonged or high-dose prescriptions in 2013 continued to receive prolonged or high-dose prescriptions in 2015, and only a small proportion discontinued opioid use entirely in 2015. The relative decreases between 2013 and 2015 that we observed were somewhat smaller than previously reported in other populations. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Using pharmacy data, one study 22 reported a 22% fewer dispensed hydrocodone combination product prescriptions in the 12 months after than the 12 months before rescheduling. We have previously reported a 26% relative decrease in hydrocodone prescriptions from a monthly rate of 2.7% in 2013 to 2.0% in 2015 in a commercially insured population aged 18 to 64. 23 This compares with a 18.7% relative decrease in monthly rate of hydrocodone prescription from 7.2% in 2013 to 5.8% in 2015 that we found in the older Medicare population. When comparing populations, assessing absolute and relative change is important. Younger populations have lower rates of opioid prescription use, so smaller absolute decreases can result in large relative changes.\nAlthough some single centers reported an increase in tramadol prescribing after the rescheduling, [18] [19] [20] our findings of no change in tramadol prescribing are similar to our previous nationwide study in a younger, commercially insured population. 23 A number of other national efforts to reduce opioid abuse accompanied the hydrocodone rescheduling. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The continued opioid epidemic despite these federal and state actions underscores the need for continuing communitywide education on the risks and limitations of opioids for chronic noncancer pain and prescriber education, starting in medical and nursing schools, on safe opioid prescribing and recognition of individuals at high risk of opioid use disorder. 4, 5, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] According to the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for safe opioid prescribing for individuals without cancer, prescribers should keep opioid duration to less than 7-day use and consider discontinuation in long-term users. 35 It is important for prescribers to understand who these individuals are and why their opioid use persists.\nOne example from our study of a population at risk of prolonged use is disability-entitled beneficiaries, who experienced smaller decreases in prolonged or high-dose prescriptions received after the rescheduling of hydrocodone. These enrollees were aged 65 and older but had originally become eligible for Medicare before age 65 because of disability. Among Medicare enrollees aged 65 and older, the 10% who have disability as an original entitlement comprised 25% of prolonged opioid users and 40% of high-dose users in 2015. One explanation for the high rate of risky opioid use among disability-entitled enrollees is the clustering of known risk factors-mood disorders, cognitive disability, and back pain-related disorders-associated with opioid misuse. 40, 41 A recent study reported that over half of all opioids prescribed in the United States were given to individuals with mental health disorders. 41 High rates of chronic pain and heightened pain perception in this population, especially in the context of depression and addiction, suggest the need for a biopsychosocial interdisciplinary management approach to pain management, including case management and monitoring. 29, 36, [42] [43] [44] Such an approach would need to address not only the pain syndrome, but also the myriad coexisting cognitive, emotional, physical, social, economic, and environmental drivers of high-risk opioid-related behaviors. This approach would also require substantial increases in funding from federal and commercial insurance to address current needs.\nThe 2014 hydrocodone rescheduling was associated with a small increase in high-dose opioids in the Medicaid-eligible Medicare population. This population tends to have low income and poor health status. It is possible that high-dose opioid prescriptions may serve economic and coping purposes. [42] [43] [44] [45] An economic purpose may relate to monetary gains from diversion and sale to others. Using prescription opioids may represent potentially pathological coping attempts to palliate despair and hopelessness associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, poor physical and mental health, and inability to work.\nThe introduction of the FDA regulations restricting extended-release and long-acting opioids and stateinitiated programs of expanding access to opioid antidotes without prescription may lead to decreases in opioidrelated hospitalizations, 46 ,47 but our study did not find a significant decrease in opioid-related hospitalizations from 2013 to 2015, although there was a nonsignificant 6% decrease in the adjusted PR. In a subgroup analysis, the proportion of those hospitalizations in which the beneficiary did not have a documented opioid prescription increased by 24% in the same period. It is important for prescribers to understand that their elderly Medicare beneficiaries might be obtaining opioids from sources that are not documented in their medical records. There is a need for additional research on why, where, and how these Medicare enrollees are obtaining opioids. 36, 48 The study has limitations. First, Medicare Part D data do not contain information on whether beneficiaries took their prescribed opioids. Second, the indication for the opioid prescription is not available in Part D data. Third, information on severity of pain was not available. Although we doubt that overall pain prevalence changed substantially between 2013 and 2015 in the Medicare population, information about pain severity would allow investigators to better identify situations in which opioids are clearly not indicated. Fourth, we excluded beneficiaries with health maintenance organization enrollment and those without Part D coverage. Our results may not be generalizable to other Medicare populations. Also, the number of Medicare Part D enrollees has increased over time. 49 The 2013 and 2015 cohorts differed according to beneficiary characteristics (Supplementary Appendix 3) .\nWe controlled for these differences in our multivariable analyses. Fifth, states vary considerably in the stringency of regulations on opioid prescribing, 50 but we included states as a fixed effect in our multivariable analyses. Sixth, we did not include prescriber-level factors in this study. Providers play the ultimate role in opioid prescribing. This topic will require extensive additional analyses in further studies. Last, it is likely that our study underestimated total use of opioids because of the exclusion of opioid injections and lack of information on opioids obtained from sources other than prescriptions."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The 2014 hydrocodone rescheduling was associated with modest decreases in hydrocodone and overall opioid prescribing rates, but opioid-related hospitalizations did not decrease significantly. Also, high-risk groups such as disabled individuals did not experience decreases in opioid rates. As policy experts and clinicians move forward in their search for the proper balance between pain control and opioid overprescribing, refining public policy and clinical practice to target high-risk groups will be critical to reducing opioid overuse and adverse events."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank Sarah Toombs Smith, PhD, Science Editor in the Sealy Center on Aging, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, for providing editorial assistance in manuscript preparation.\nFinancial Disclosure: This work was supported by grants R01-DA039192 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse; UL1TR000071 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, P30AG024832 from the National Institute on Aging; and R24-HS022134 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Kuo, Raji, Goodwin.
