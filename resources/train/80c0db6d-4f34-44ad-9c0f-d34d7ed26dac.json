The American Academy of Pediatrics further encourages breastfeeding, with other foods, for at least the first year of life and beyond. 2 Despite these recommendations, the national rates of breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity still fall short of the Healthy People 2010 breastfeeding objectives. 5, 6 Work-related issues have been repeatedly noted as a major reason for noninitiation [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and early cessation of breastfeeding. 7, 8, 13 Lack of supportive work environments, such as provision of lactational facilities and paid maternity leave, have been cited as barriers to breastfeeding initiation and prolonged duration. 14- 21 The United States does not mandate paid maternity leave for any employee. [22] [23] [24] The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, which provides for unpaid time away from work for perinatal care, childbirth, newborn care, or the care of a newly adopted child, [23] [24] [25] [26] is limited to 12 weeks and only applies to relatively large employers. 25, 27 Only 5 states (CA, HI, NJ, NY, and RI) have gone beyond the FMLA requirement by offering partial wage compensation for women unable to work because of pregnancy, birth, or bonding with a new child. 28, 29 Several smaller studies have shown that the length of maternity leave is positively associated with breastfeeding initiation 28, 30 and duration. 30, 31 Analysis on a subset of women in the Infant Feeding Practices Survey-that is, those who initiated breastfeeding (n \u03ed 712)-revealed that each week of work leave increased breastfeeding duration by \u03f30.5 week. 31 In a review of breastfeeding practices among physician-mothers in the United States, maternity leave length was shown to be a positive factor in breastfeeding maintenance. 32 In 1 of the articles reviewed, maternity leave length was positively associated with breastfeeding duration for first-and second-born children but not for subsequent children. However, a study exploring personal breastfeeding practices of physicians in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, did not find maternity leave length to be a significant predictor of duration among physician-mothers. 33 When compared with women not working, women with maternity leave lengths \u03fd6 weeks breastfeed for a shorter duration. 34 There is also no association between maternity leave lengths \u03fd6 weeks and breastfeeding initiation. 34 Maternity leave remuneration is positively associated with breastfeeding duration. 35 Early return to full-time or part-time work has been found to be associated with decreased rates of breastfeeding initiation, 36, 37 duration, 31, 37, 38 and predominance. 38 Returns within 6 weeks 30, 36, 37 and 12 weeks 31, 37 are associated with poorer breastfeeding behaviors.\nPrevious studies examining the relationship between maternity leave length/time of return to work and breastfeeding initiation and duration had limitations of small sample sizes 28, 31 and limited generalizability due to sample characteristics. 13, 28, 31 The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of 3 slightly different but related factors (total maBiological mother is not the respondent at 9 months (150)\nBiological mother is the respondent at 9 months (10 550)"}, {"section_title": "ECLS-B data Total Sample (10 700)", "text": "Singleton births ternity leave length, paid maternity leave length, and time of return to work) on breastfeeding initiation and duration using a longitudinal, nationally representative sample and racially diverse data."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "Data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics.

We imputed predominant breastfeeding duration values for observations where any breastfeeding values were less than predominant breastfeeding values (unweighted n \u03ed 300). We refer to predominant rather than exclusive breastfeeding because there was no ascertainment in the survey of the time of introduction of water or water-based fluids.\nDuration of any and predominant breastfeeding was set at 0.5 month for those with duration of \u03fd1 month. For analytical purposes, breastfeeding duration was dichotomized: \u05456 or \u03fe6 months (any breastfeeding) and \u05453 or \u03fe3 months (predominant breastfeeding).

For total maternity leave, respondents who took maternity leave were asked: \"In total, how many weeks of maternity leave, paid or unpaid, did you take?\" For paid maternity leave, they were asked: \"In total, how many weeks of paid maternity leave did you receive from your job while you were on maternity leave?\" For the time of return to work variable, women who had started work by the 9-month interview were asked: 'How old was child when you first went to work at a job?'

Our results indicate that women returning later to work are more likely to initiate breastfeeding and continue predominant and any breastfeeding beyond 3 months. Maternity leave length (total/paid) was not associated with any of the 3 breastfeeding outcomes in adjusted analyses.\nGuendelman et al 28 previously found a positive association of maternity leave length and breastfeeding establishment/duration in a study on the basis of a cohort of 770 full-time working mothers in California. The present study, which was based on a nationally representative sample, did not find this association. This variance may be due to the select nature and sample size of the previous study. Thus, findings derived from a very small spectrum of women may not reflect the experience of all women in the United States. In our study, the associations that were found in the crude models for maternity leave length disappeared in adjusted analysis. A possible explanation for this occurrence is that maternity leave length may not be an independent factor for breastfeeding initiation or duration. Its effect may be explained by adjusting for other variables such as mother's age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. The positive effect of later return to work on breastfeeding initiation and duration of predominant breastfeeding persisted in full models and has been supported by a number of other studies. 35, 36, 38, 44, 45 The 12 weeks provided by the FMLA need not be taken consecutively, 46 potentially creating a disparity between time of first return to work and total maternity leave length. In our study population, total maternity leave length did not always coincide with time of return to work, so we postulate that the ideal variable to explain the relationship between time away from work (leave) and breastfeeding behavior may actually be the time of first return to work as used in this study.\nHowever, to the extent that the maternity leave length is positively associated with time of return to work, as observed in our posthoc bivariable analysis of maternity leave length and time of return to work, leave policies (unpaid/paid maternity leave) should be instituted at all governmental and organizational levels to enable women to take sufficient time off work after delivery to properly nurture their infants. Studies in Canada 47 and the United States 46 support the notion that an increase in maternity leave length mandates in the United States would likely result in a greater proportion of women staying at home longer after delivery. Job security may also play an important role in delaying the time of first return to work postpartum. Informal arrangements between employers and employees that enable women to delay their time of return to work after delivery should be encouraged.\nSome of the strengths of this study include the generalizability of the findings; the ability to adjust for several potential confounders; and the ability Weight variable is W1R0. Percentages are row percentages. a Sample restricted to singletons whose biological mothers were the respondent at the 9-month wave and who initiated breastfeeding and worked in the 12 months before delivery (n \u03ed 4200). b The country of birth variable has a large number of missing observations because this was a variable ascertained at the 2-year interview by which time some participants had been lost to follow-up. The missing category is included in the analysis by applying the 9-month weight (W1R0 to properly examine breastfeeding duration given the longitudinality of the data. A limitation of this study is the unavailability of a measure on breastfeeding intent. In addition, because of the time lag between the interviews and actual breastfeeding practice, there may have been some reporting errors that resulted in an overestimation or underestimation of the actual duration of breastfeeding or the main independent variables of interests. However, this possibility could not be tested.\nA recent amendment to the FMLA, which allows relatives of members of the armed forces who are undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave to care for them, 48 could be studied for its impact on breastfeeding in the armed forces population. Positive effects, if found, may buttress the need for the extension of the FMLA for all workers. In addition, providing women with some form of monetary compensation during their time off work may encourage more women to take the leave that is provided. 49 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "If new mothers delay their time of return to work, then duration of breastfeeding among US mothers may lengthen."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Center for Education Statistics, Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education for conducting the ECLS-B study and making the data available for research purposes.
