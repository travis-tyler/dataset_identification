The largest increases in scientific and engineering manpower employed on Federal R&D projects occurred in the electrical equipment and aircraft and missiles industries-2,800 and 2,400, respectively. Together these two industries accounted for over three-quarters of the total number of FTE R&D scientists and engineers engaged on Federal projects.

These were electrical equipment, 2,800; and motor vehicles, 1,700. The relationship between R&D scientists and engineers and total employment in each industry is of particular interest. For all industries combined this ratio has been a constant 26 scientists and engineers per 1,000 employees between 1968 and 1971. For 1972 however, the ratio declined slightly to 25. Examination of this measure for the leading R&D-performing industries, however, reflects a considerable variation. The aircraft and missiles industry has been in a continuous state of change for the last decade or more, with its ratio ranging from a high of 113 in 1965 to a low of 72 in 1958the first year for which these data are available. In 1972 this industry continued to increase slightly from the 1970 total of 73 R&D scientists and engineers per 1,000 employees to 75. The electrical equipment and chemicals industries were the only two among the five leading industries to reflect a 1971-72 decrease in this ratio. Two other R&D-performing industries reporting decreases between 1971 and 1972 were fabricated metal products and scientific instruments.

The remainder was divided between materials and supplies-18 percent; and other costs-33 percent. These ratios were derived from the responses of companies accounting for 84 percent of all industrial R&D performance. The responses reflected little change over 1971. Of the five leading R&D-performing industries, the chemicals industry reported the highest allocation to professional salaries-36 percent. The largest share of R&D funds devoted to supporting personnel costs, 31 percent, was reported by the motor vehicles industrya sharp contrast to the 19-percent all-industry average.

Chemical companies were the leading performers of company-sponsored basic research, allocating $201 million or 12 percent of their own R&D funds to basic research. This relatively large allocation of their R&D funds to basic research reflects an intensive commitment to basic research by pharmaceutical companies. Electrical equipment firms were the second largest performers of company-sponsored basic research, devoting $98 million or 4 percent of their own R&D funds on basic research in 1972. The Federal Government allocated less than 2 percent of its R&D support in industry to basic research. This amounted to $131 million, or 5 percent of all Federal basic research spending in the economy.

California, with $3.5 billion in 1972, led in industrial R&D performance, but its share in industrial R&D total decreased from a high of 28 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 1972. This decrease in industrial R&D expenditure resulted primarily from substantial cutbacks on the part of NASA and DOD which brought about retrenchment in the R&D effort of defense and space industries. Industrial R&D dollars increased between 1971 and 1972 in all geographic divisions, ranging from 11 percent in the South Atlantic division to 3 percent in the Pacific. Florida was the leading gainer during this period, where R&D funds showed a 30-percent increase. Of the nine geographic divisions, fiveWest North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, Mountain, and Pacifichad more than one-half of their R&D activities supported by the Federal Government. Pacific States financed 71 percent of their R&D activities with Federal funds. Among the States, California received the largest Federal support in 1972, accounting for $2.6 billion or 32 percent of all the Federal funds. New York followed with $7J2 million. Michigan led in company-funded R&D work, with $1.5 billion in 1972: this was 95 percent of its total. About one-third of all company-funded R&D was conducted in Michigan, New York, New Jersey, and California. Total R&D/net sales ratio of R&D-performing manufacturing companies continued to decline to 3,4 percent in 1972 from a high of 4.6 percent in 1964. The aircraft industry had the highest R&D/net sales ratio in 1972-16.3 percent. This is up from 15.9 percent in 1971 but down from the 1964 high of 28.9 percent. All of this decrease was due to the leveling in Federal R&D support to -this industry. All other industries' .R&D/net sales ratios remained at their 1971 levels or showed decreases. The all-industry ratio of company R&D funds to net sales declined slightly from 21 percent in 1971 to 2.0 percent in 1972.

Total R&r., funds per employee amounted to $1,380 in 1972, an increase of 6 percent over the 1971 ratio of $1,304. Company R&D funds per employee increased 7 percent between 1971 and 1972 to a level of $810.

Social and Economic Statistics Admintgration, the collecting and compiling agent for the ntaponal Science Foundation in this survey, 20 known on the basis of earlier, more detailed samples to conduct or to finance research and development. The sampling unit for the survey was the company, defined as a business organization consisting of one or more establishments under common ownership or control. All manufacturing companies with 1,000 or more employees in 1967, as determined from the 1967 Economic Censuses Enterprise Statistics' multi-unit file, were included in the sample with certainty. Manufacturing companies with fewer than 1,000 employees were sampled at rates depending upon their industry and employment size, based upon the 1967 Economic Censuses Enterprise Statistics multi-unit file and the 1967 Census of Manufactures universe file. For selected nonmanufacturing industries (SIC 7391,7392,7397,and 8911)  Questionnaires were mailed to approximately 1,400 of these. About 1,200 of the companies included are certainty companies which accounted for over 90percent of the total R&D performance funds. Appendix table A-1 shows the probabilities of selection applied for each industry-size stratum. The probabilities of being selected in the survey range from one chance in 200 (.005) to certainty (1.000). Each year the annual Department of Defense (DOD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) lists of R&D contractors are reviewed to ensure the inclusion of large contractors in the sample. For the 1972 survey, the 80 largest companies from DOD list and the 50 largest NASA contractors were included in the sample with certainty regardless of their industry class and employment size. The 80 largest companies from the DOD list accounted for 92 percent of the total contract awards of all companies included on the DOD list. The 50 largest companies from the NASA list accounted for 84 percent of the total contract awards of all companies included on the NASA list. The particular :ample selected is one of a large number of samples of the same type and size that, by chance, might have been selected. Estimates from each of the different samples ,ould differ somewhat from each other, and from the results of a complete canvass conducted under essentially the same conditions as the survey. This variation among the possible estimates is defined b) the sampling error, measured in standard error units. The complete canvass total would be included in the range-1. From one standard error below to one standard error above the derived estimate for about two-thirds of a!! possible samples. 2. From two standard errors below to two standard errors above the derived estimate for about 95 percent of all possible samples. 3. From three standard errors below to three standard errors above the derived estimate, almost always. These values may be interpreted as defining approximate probabilities that the estimate shown would differ from a complete canvass total by as much as one, two, or three standard errors, respectively. For example, if an estimate is shown as 400, with an associated relative standard error of 2 percent, the chances are roughly two out of three that the complete canvass total would lie between 392 and 408; the chances are roughly 19 out of 20 that the complete canvass total would lie between 384 and 416; and it is almost certain that the complete canvass total would lie between 376 and 424. As stated, the standard error refers only to sampling variations. In addition to the sampling errors as measured by the standard error, the estimates are subject to errors in response, coding, processing, and imputation for nonresponse. These nonsampling errors would also occur if a complete canvass were to be conducted under the same conditions as the survey. The 1972 standard errors of estimates for each industry, for all companies and for those with fewer than 1,000 employees, are shown in appendix table A-2. The forms for the survey were mailed in March 1973, and nonrespondents were followed up by mail. The basic forms used were Form RD-1 and RD-11, but since total R&D performance funds and total Federal funds expended by industry for research and development are included in the Census Bureau's mandatory statistical program, the few large companies that did not reply were mailed the Census Form MA-121, which collects total R&D and Federal R&D funds. Less than 1 percent of total R&D funds were obtained in this way and included in this report.

The SIC classifications for individual companies for 1963-67 were originally determined by data reported in the 1963 Economic Censuses. Between 1963 and 1967, the SIC code for a company generally remained fixed and reflected that company's principal activity in 1963. However, under certain circumstancessuch as the merger 21 of two or more companies; the acquisition of one company by another; or the formation of \"conglomerates\"the 1963 SIC code for a company could have changed. Most industry groups were characterized by relatively minor changes in the SIC codes for companies classified in those groups, and the tabulated data for such groups remained substantially comparable between 1963 and 1967. However, some industry groups were characterized by significant changes in the SIC codes for companies originally classified in those groups in 1963. The effect of these changes became most noticeable toward the end of the 4-year intercensal period, with the result that revisions to industry totals resulting from these code changes tended to reflect disproportionately large fluctuations between the data for 1967 and the year immediately preceding. To remedy these apparent discrepancies, the data for affected industries were adjusted in the following manner. For companies changing industry codes between 1963 and 1967, the industry data for each of the four years affected (1964 through 1967) were estimated to have changed at the constant rate of 25 percent per year. Accordingly, the data for the industry in which such a company had been classified in 1963 were deflated by 25 percent per year for each of the years 1964-67. Similarly, the data for the industry in which such a company was classified in 1967 were inflated by 25 percent per year for each of the years 1964-67. The industry code assigned to a company for 1967 is also used to classify that company's activities for the years 1968-72. The following measures were adjusted in this manner: Number of scientists and engineers; funds for research and developmenttotal, Federal, and company; net sales; cost per R&D scientist and engineer; and basic research expenditures. These historical data appear, for example, in selected tables of the 1972 NSF publication on research and development in industry. (See appendix tables 8 -3, B -7, B-10, B-25, 13-31, 13-313, 13-39, and 8-45.)

These annual surveys are conduct ed to better understand and strengthen the overall national effort in research and development. Your participation and that of other companies enable the Foundation to present current and historical data on research and development in industry. This information is useful to Government officials in for mulating public policies to encourage and strengthen scientific and technological development in the United States. Individual companies have also found the aggregate data valuable in analyzing and planning their own research and development programs. The United States Bureau of the Census serves as the collecting and compiling agent for the Foundation. Inquiries regarding the survey should be directed to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. We appreciate your cooperation in furnishing the data for this survey, and will be pleased to send your company a copy of the published report upon your request. We thank you for filing reports with the C look forward to your continued cooperation ter from the National Science Foundation r importance of the survey results. If you this report, please write to the Industry Washington, D. t. 20233   whether or not the search has reference to a specific application. 2. Apply existing knowledge to problems involved in the creation of a new product or process, including work required to evaluate possible uses. 3. Apply existing knowledge to problems involved in the improvement of a present product or process. Research and development includes the activities described above whether assigned to separate research and devglopment organizational units of the company or carried on by company laboratories and technical groups nor part of a research and development organization. We recognize that the reporting activities of such latter groups will require the use of estimates for some of the questions. Activities to be Excluded from Research and Develop-  As in the past, the figure cm R&D scientists and ent'neers will be obtained primarily from two sources: 1. Records on the number of scientists and engineers assigned to research and development. This source is satisfactory so long as the scientists and engineers of the unit are assigned to research and development on a full-time basis (i.e., no more than 5 percent of their time is spent on non-research and development). For example, for company lobotomies performing only research and development, report the number of scientists and engineers on the rolls in January. For other units, use Source 2. ;here research and development work for the Government and for the company is performed by the same group of scift-ists and engineers, it will be necessary to distribute the total number of such scientists and engineers according to the program, Federal or company, for which the reseatch and development  Types of Research Breakdown the total reported in Item 5 into the categories shown below: Item 5A"}, {"section_title": "Basic Research", "text": "Include the cost of research projects which represent original investigation for the advancement of scientific knowledge and which do not have specific commercial objectives, although they may be in the fields of present or potential interest to the reporting company."}, {"section_title": "Item 5131", "text": "Applied Research Include the cost of research projects which represent investigation directed to discovery of new scientific knowledge and which have specific commercial objectives with respect to either products or processes. Note that this definition of applied research differs from the definition of basic research chiefly in terms of the objectives of the reporting company. Item 5132 Development Include the cost of projects which represent technical activity concerned with nonroutine problems which are encountered in translating research findings or other general scientific knowledge into products or processes. Do not include routine technical services to customers or other items excluded from definition of research development above."}, {"section_title": "Methods of Estimating Research and Development", "text": "Expenditures by Type Many of the companies in this survey have accounts they believe substantially YOPU no.' ,..S.TOLIC meet the definitions used in this survey for basic research, applied research, and development. In most cases, companies have found it possible to allocate their own accounts to these categories. If your company does not keep records that meet or can be allocated to these specific categories, there are two principal ways to reduce the task of providing the data requested. 1. Isolate the projects that clearly fall in the development category. If your company fabricates products, such development activity will include the design, construction, and testing of prototypes and models. Some defense contracts typically call for several test models. If your company's research and development frequently involves the development of a \"process\" as in chemicals and petroleum, such development activity would include operations beyond the bench scale, primarily the design and operations cf pilot plants ce semiworks. 2. Isolate the organizational units whose reseal:di and development can be readily classified. If a con.pany has two or more laboratories, the expenditures of some of these laboratories may be all classified in one or another type of research and development on the basis of the function assigned to the laboratory. There are laboratories assigned only development type work. There are others engaged only in applied or basic research. If research and development work is done in production units as well as in various laboratories, the research and development work in the production units will generally be of a development type."}, {"section_title": "Page 4", "text": "The separate classification of clearly identified development operations, particularly in the industries producing expensive prototypes, will greatly reduce the balance to be distributed. The distribution will have to be estimated on the basis of a review of individual projects or on the basis of other summaries of the work. Please use the definitions for basic, applied, and development, as given above. If, despite these instructions, you feel that you are unable to distribute your research and development expenditures into groupings approximating the categories requested, please write to the Census Bureau describing your accounts and indicating your special problems. The Bureau may be able to make or obtain some suggestions that will be helpful in completing the report form. Types of Activity Included in Development The design and operation of pilot plants or semi-works plants so long as the principal purposes are to obtain experience and to compile engineering and other data to be used in evaluating hypotheses, in writing product formulas or in establishing finished product specifications, in designing special equipment and structures required by a process, and in preparing operating instructions or manuals. The engineering activity required to advance the design of a product or a process to the point where it meets specific functional and economic requirements and can be turned over to manufacturing units. The design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models and \"engineering follow-through\" in the early production phase is included. The development of designs for special manufacturing equipMent and tools is included but tool making and tool tryout are not included. The preparation of reports, drawings, formulas, specifications, standard practice instructions or operating manuals, and other media for transmitting to operating units information obtained from the above activities is included. However. the production of detailed construction drawings Of manufacturing blueprints is not included. The question, \"When does development end and production begin?\" is often asked. If the primary objective is to make further improvements on the product or process, then the work comes within the definition of research and development. If, on the other hand, the product or process is substantially \"se t,\" and the primary objective is to develop markers or to do preproduction planning, or to get the production process going smoothly, then the work is no longer research and development. In Item SE, report the expected or estimated cost of company-sponsored research and development that will be performed within that company during 1973. For wages and salaries report the gross earnings paid in calendar year 1972 to employees engaged in research and development, including dismissal pay, paid bonuses, vacation and sick-leave pay, and compensation in kind, and prior to such deductions as employees' Social Security contributions, withholding taxes, group insurance, and savings bonds.
