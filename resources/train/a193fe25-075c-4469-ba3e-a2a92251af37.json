[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The world continues to struggle in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic that was initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . This resulted in international travel bans in March 2020 in an attempt to dampen viral spread, a measure that affected over 90% of the world's population [2] . This, accompanied by social distancing measures, resulted in an overnight global crisis for both tourism and hospitality sectors, crucial pillars of national economies [3] . The measures were effective in dampening the pandemic, may have delayed many millions of infections and averted the deaths of millions more [4, 5] .\nCOVID-19 is a beta coronavirus not an influenza virus but its transmission epidemiology is similar to influenza and it is therefore constructive to review the progression of historical influenza pandemics. These have followed wave patterns, with a peak usually succeeded by a second wave a few months later [6] .\nVirtually all countries commenced easement out of social distancing measures and travel bans in June-July 2020, hoping to step into a \"new normal\" that still includes public health prevention measures in an attempt to slowly restart national economies [3] . This naturally invoked the risk of viral resurgence [7] , a veritable balancing act between stimulating economies and morbidity/mortality from COVID-19 [2] .\nFor COVID-19, it was speculated that as lockdowns were lifted, infections would rise again, followed by declines as lockdowns (in various degrees) are once more imposed, potentially leading to successive wave/s whose length/s and amplitude/s are determined by herd immunity and the stringency of applied lockdowns [8] . Resurgences are expected to further take tolls not only on pandemic morbidity and mortality but also on affected countries' economies [9] . This paper will outline the global and continental development of a second wave of COVID-19 cases relating to the easing of lockdowns in almost all countries in June -July 2020 and the short-term aftermath vis-\u00e0-vis death rates. "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Publically available data at global and at continental level for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to September 2020 was obtained from \"Our World In Data\" website [10] . Data is naturally only available for confirmed cases as it is estimated that there are many asymptomatic or mild cases that are undocumented and that some cases may simply never be recorded, even if death ensues, simply due to the absence of sufficient testing capacity (e.g. developing countries).\nData was analysed with Pearson correlation in Excel using bespoke spreadsheets [11] . Graphs are also depicted using 14 day moving averages. In statistics, a moving average (rolling average or running average) calculates a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. The first value of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial set of datapoints (here 14 days) of the series. The subset is modified by shifting forward; excluding the first number of the series and including the next value. This calculation is used in time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends/cycles. A p-value \u2264 0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant result."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "At global level, both datasets exhibited three distinct time periods. Daily new COVID-19 cases rose to mid-April, plateaued till mid-May then rose again (figure 1). Almost all of the slopes in these three time periods were statistically significant (table 1) . Deaths followed a similar threepart pattern, albeit more pronounced, with values lagging circa one week after new cases and a middle time period when numbers (of deaths) actually decreased, with all periods exhibiting significant slopes ( figure 2 and table 1 ).\nAt continent level, for new cases, Asia rose steadily, Europe plateaued and is increasing again, the Americas and Africa are declining ( figure 3 ). Deaths are stabilising or falling everywhere except in Asia (figure 4).\nDue to smaller numbers, Oceania is plotted separately, and this shows a bimodal pattern, with a first and second wave of cases shortly followed by deaths in a similar pattern ( figure 5 ).\nThe ratio of detected cases to deaths (case fatality ratio) initially rose to 0.08, then fell to 0.02 (table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "As anticipated, once lockdowns and restrictions were eased, cases of COVID-19 rose rapidly worldwide. The world is clearly in the grip of a second wave of COVID-19, with no imminent vaccine in sight. However, the case fatality ratio has fallen, a puzzling but fortunate finding [12, 13] . Some pharmacological treatments may be modifying the natural history of the disease and these include remdesivir, dexamethasone and convalescent plasma, with improved outcomes [14] . Furthermore, healthcare workers have gained and shared their now voluminous experiences in treating affected patients [15] . However, while these advances seemed to have stemmed the tide of deaths in Europe and North America, with a stable mortality despite more cases, this is not the case in much of the rest of the world.\nThe true toll of this pandemic may never quite be established as cases in developing countries may not be recorded [16] . Even in developed countries, for various reasons, the true toll may only be estimated by calculating excess deaths when compared to similar time periods in recent years [17] .\nCountries are desperate to restart economies and have opened up to travel and are also competing with a variety of incentives in order to lure visitors. However, public health measures must be maintained: social distancing, hygiene and the rigorous use of face masks in public areas: 'my mask protects you, your mask protects me' [18] . Countries may also be able to avoid viral resurgence or dampen it by releasing restrictions slowly, as per WHO criteria [19] :\n4. Workplace preventive measures are established, including physical distancing, handwashing facilities and respiratory etiquette; 5. Importation risks can be managed; and 6. Communities have a voice and are aware, engaged and participating in the transition.\nIt is vital for all countries to remain vigilant and act swiftly so as to instantly arrest/dampen COVID-19 case spikes. Health issues are particularly relevant as in the developed countries, it has been estimated that if Gross Domestic Product (GDP) were to drop by 6% or more, more years of life would be lost due to recession than would be gained through lives saved, as affluent countries would be able to spend less on healthcare, safety and the environment [20] . The resuscitation of economies must therefore literally constitute a \"a risk balancing act -tourism competition using health leverage in the COVID-19 era\" This is proving to be very difficult with countries (such as the UK and Malta and indeed all countries without draconian measures) experiencing high infection rates as restrictions are eased [21, 22] . The only solution will be an effective vaccine becomes available, [23] and even then, if vaccine uptake is poor [24] , or the vaccine only partially effective (as is for example the influenza vaccine) [25] , restrictions of sorts may still need to be imposed for years to come until a measure of herd immunity from vaccination or natural infection is attained.
