[{"section_title": "", "text": "Hong Kong, the first 2 COVID-19 cases were confirmed on 23 January 2020 [2] . At that time, a number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) protocols were already available so that we were more prepared than Wuhan for tracing and controlling circulation of this virus. Nevertheless, we cannot predict when and where the next coronavirus spillover will take place. Perhaps what we can do is to be well prepared based on accumulating knowledge on this virus family and well utilize state-of-the-art tools to facilitate early identification and timely containment. On the other hand, owing to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, periodic surveillance on emerging variants of key virus components is essential to combat the viruses. Through studying their functional characteristics and evolution pattern, we can monitor and evaluate the impact of emerging variants on the efficacy of antiviral drugs, diagnostic assays and vaccines.\nTo control the spread of a highly contagious, unknown virus, rapid and accurate characterization of virus genome is crucial for developing sensitive screening assays. Metagenomic sequencing is a useful tool for rapid reconstruction of virus genomes, as evident by discovery and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 [3] [4] [5] . Successful retrieval of a complete virus genome from complex clinical specimens requires very deep sequencing to compensate contamination by host and commensal reads, with sequencing data processed by high performance computers and analyzed by bioinformatics expertise. As these are luxurious for most clinical laboratories, identification and characterization of unknown viruses are usually confined to reference laboratories. As a result, there is a lapse between initial presentation of a patient/ patients infected by unknown coronavirus, clueless microbiological investigations in frontline laboratories, and finally referral to reference laboratories for etiologic investigation. The duration of this lapse may determine the controllability of an outbreak. Compared with metagenomic sequencing, characterization of partial virus genome involves simpler workflow which is more implementable as a part of etiologic investigation in frontline laboratories, providing hint for more timely follow-up actions. This pan-coronavirus approach was also adopted for initial investigation of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 outbreaks [4] [5] [6] .\nIn the first part of this study, we evaluated the feasibility of characterizing coronaviruses directly from clinical specimens. We selected partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRP) as the amplification target, as it has been commonly used for coronavirus classification and phylogenetic analysis [7, 8] . We sequenced the amplicons using Nanopore technology, which is the fastest and most scalable option in current massivelyparallel sequencing market, and assessed its consensus accuracy with Sanger's method. As COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, every piece of genetic information about the causative agent may save lives. Therefore, in the second part of this study, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequences from our laboratory with genomes worldwide and looked for mutations which might alter the function of this key virus component. An overview of this study is shown in Fig. 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Specimens", "text": "A total of 61 clinical specimens were tested, among which 57 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, NL63, HKU1 or OC43 and 4 were negative controls ( "}, {"section_title": "RNA extraction", "text": "Standard laboratory practices were applied to minimize risk of infection and contamination.

"}, {"section_title": "Partial RdRP sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "We analyzed 19 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Specimen 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25) collected from the first to third waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, and they were identical to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1. We further analyzed 22,173 GISAID genomes contributed by 86 countries. SNVs were present in 961 sequences (4.33%), with majority (947/961, 98.54%) possessing a single SNV, 13 (1.35%) possessing 2 SNVs, and 1 (0.10%) harbouring 3 SNVs. These nucleotide variants comprised 3.00-4.87% of sequences from each month (Jan-May 2020), and 3.77-34.64% from 5 geographical regions (Table 4) . A total of 125 SNV types involved 114 bases of RdRP gene (NC_045512.2:15315-15696), with more than half being missense mutations (71/125, 56.8%). For synonymous mutations, 15324C > T was the most common and present in 553 genomes. The frequencies of missense mutations were the highest at bases 15327 (n = 16), 15380 (n = 47), 15406 (n = 18) and 15438 (n = 34) with different geographical patterns (15327: Asia/ Middle East > Europe; 15380: Europe > Oceania > America; 15406: America > > Europe; 15438: Europe > Asia/ Middle East > America), and majority of these sequences were collected in March and April, 2020 (Fig. 2) . Table 5 lists the missense mutations and corresponding amino acid changes, using SARS-CoV-2 RdRP protein sequence YP_009725307.1 as reference. The 71 missense mutations affected rear part of RdRP (amino acid 627-752), with 9 SNVs found on 4 conserved domains, leading to amino acid changes at polymerase motif A (P627S), zinc binding site (H642N), non-structural protein 8 (nsp8) interaction site (M666I) and polymerase motif B (G683V, D684G, A699S, V700I, V700A and N705D). The frequency of M666I (15438G > T) was the highest (n = 34)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We successfully characterized coronaviruses directly from majority of clinical specimens. For SARS-CoV-2, full-length RdRP sequences could be retrieved from specimens with Ct values of 31.68 (N gene) or less, suggesting that this method may be best used right after symptom onset when viral load is at its maximum [15] . Our data showed that highly accurate consensus sequences could be built from error-prone Nanopore reads if coverage depth was sufficient (> 30\u00d7). Considering the reference sequence of an unknown coronavirus is not readily available, we repeated consensus building for selected specimens without SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, and the consensus accuracy was not compromised.\nFrom our experience, the universal primers used in this study amplified human and commensal sequences occasionally. As the non-specific band(s) was very close to the target, gel purification is required to obtain clean Sanger chromatograms. In this regard, Nanopore sequencing facilitates a simpler workflow as sequencing reads can be analyzed independently without gel purification. It may therefore provide better resolution for mixed coronavirus infection, which comprised about 4.3% of SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic patients [16] . Nanopore sequencing is also a faster option as the time from amplicons to sequence data is about half of the Sanger's method. Compared with direct metagenomic sequencing, our method involved target enrichment by PCR and less complicated data processing, and consensus sequences were typically built in minutes. Using Flongle flow cells, reagent cost may be as low as 12 USD per sample for a 24-plex run [17] , which is comparable to Sanger sequencing. In general, the proportion of genomes possessing SNVs by geographical area (America, Asia/ Middle East, Europe and Oceania) and by month of collection (Jan-May 2020) were similar, ranging from 3.00 to 6.22% (Table 4 ) with the exception of Africa (34.64%). As 153 genomes were retrieved from Africa which was at least 8 times lower than other areas, this relatively high proportion of genomes with SNVs may require confirmation by more representative sampling.\nThe partial RdRP gene we targeted encompasses parts of conserved domains which are important to polymerase functionality (Fig. 3) . Our data displayed the diversity of SNVs involving 114 bases (28.93%) in a short segment of 394 bp, and missense mutations generally occurred at low frequencies (ranged from 1 to 47 genomes) compared to 15324C > T synonymous mutation (n = 553). Among the missense mutations found on conserved domains, the frequency of 15438G > T was the highest (n = 34) which changes the last residue of cofactor nsp8 interaction site from methionine to isoleucine (M666I) and was predominantly found in Europe. As mutation is a two-edged sword, the effect of these missense mutations on the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 awaits further investigation, and added knowledge in this area is important for development of antiviral drugs, vaccines and diagnostic assays.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the variety of HCoVs might not be sufficient for thorough evaluation of a 'pan-coronavirus' assay, and further studies with more comprehensive sample collection is warranted. As a portion of MinION flow cells possessed suboptimal number of active pores, the sequencing time of some specimens might be overestimated. As Nanopore consensus sequences were built by majority rule, minority SNVs present in the specimens might not be detected. In addition, as GISAID EpiCoV \u2122 database is expanding continuously, there may be changes in geographical and temporal SNV patterns after accumulation of more SARS-CoV-2 genome data."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We developed and evaluated a method for direct characterization of coronaviruses from respiratory specimens, based on pan-coronavirus amplification and sequencing of partial RdRP gene. It provides a viable option for first-line etiologic investigation of suspected infection by unknown coronavirus, which may lead to more timely follow-up actions. The SNV data shed light on global distribution and frequencies of missense mutations in partial RdRP gene of SARS-CoV-2, providing valuable information for surveillance of this important antiviral drug and diagnostic target.
