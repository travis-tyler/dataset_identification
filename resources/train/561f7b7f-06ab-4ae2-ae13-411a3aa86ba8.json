INTRODUCTION", "text": "Livestock systems serve significant roles for many regions across the world, yet past outbreaks of disease have demonstrated that they can possess a number of vulnerabilities [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . The livestock systems of the United States (US), though strictly regulated, may yet be found susceptible to foreign diseases such as Rift Valley Fever [7] . The successful modeling and analysis of livestock epidemics for any region relies heavily on an understanding of the underlying system components. The three most critical elements in a practical epidemic model are the disease progression model, the geo-spatial characterization of the susceptible populations, and the spatial-temporal description of the interactions of individuals within the system [8] , [9] , [10] . The models of disease progression are several and often independent of the region studied [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] . Data-driven, spatial characterizations of populations are available through regularly conducted censuses (censi) [16] , [17] . The third element, the interactions of individuals within the system, represents the set of spatial movements of individuals. When considering system-wide outbreaks of disease, the impact of movement parameters has been shown to be as significant as that of epidemic parameters in metapopulation models [18] , [19] . Domestic livestock systems fit well in such metapopulation models as the movements of livestock are controlled and the individuals are restricted to reside within populations rarely defined by their choice. Within the US, livestock movements are controlled by the cattle industries, primarily beef, dairy, breeding, and showmanship.\nWithin Europe, motivated by outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease, a number of governments have designed and implemented animal tracking systems even to the resolution of individuals' daily movements. The databases created by these studies have generated very detailed characterizations of livestock movements for a number of European nations [4] , [5] , [6] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] . No similar program has yet to be implemented for the United States, although some have long been in preparation [36] . In the US, a cultural appreciation of personal privacy from the government, strong competition between meat production companies, and a U.S. Federal privacy protection law restrict the ability of the government to collect and release livestock data at a finer spatial resolution than is currently done through the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Census of Agriculture [17] . To address this challenge, a number of survey-based methods have been used to study livestock movements across small regions [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] , [42] . However, the national scale of US cattle trade and the potential for livestock diseases to impact the entire country necessitate movement data, models, or estimates to be determined for larger regions. Recently a study has been published of a nation-wide movement estimation based on a 10% sample of veterinary records from State border-crossing cattle shipments [43] . This impressive study, although the first of its magnitude, only captured shipments of cattle that crossed state borders. Although it offers a picture of state-to-state shipment counts, the method used is unable to capture the livestock movements within each state. [44] . Each blue dot represents 10, 000 head of cattle.\nIn this paper, we formulate a large, convex optimization problem to estimate parameters describing the movements of cattle within 10 Central States of the United States. We collect cattle population and aggregated movement data from the United States Department of Agriculture's database and optimally estimate anonymous data points to construct a database of inputs for an estimation of cattle movement parameters. We design the estimation method to produce a high resolution of cattle demographic and movement parameters and to include the minimal set of assumptions. Our results produce county-to-county movement probabilities among stratified subpopulations as well as birth, slaughter, and expiration rates of cattle for 1034 US counties. In section II, we describe the USDA data structures and challenges present in the database. We estimate non-disclosed data points and discuss the mapping of USDA data to inputs for our estimation formulation. In section III, we formulate the estimation problem and describe the maximum-entropy objective and the flexible set of linear constraints with parameters sculpted to the USDA data set and as few assumptions as possible. We solve the optimal estimation problem and display a subset of the results in section IV. Section V summarizes this paper with a discussion of the results, a series of questions for future agricultural census distributions, and a calculation of critical movement thresholds that demonstrate the potential for a disease outbreak in the cattle of this region."}, {"section_title": "II. DATA COLLECTION AND STRUCTURE", "text": "Every five years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts the United States Census of Agriculture [17] . The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of USDA then summarizes and publishes a large set of data covering livestock, crops, operator demographics, and much more [44] . As the most comprehensive and clean database of US livestock statistics, the Census of Agriculture as presented in the NASS database is used for our estimation of cattle movement parameters. In particular, we use data from the 2007 Agricultural Census as the 2012 data was not published at the time of this study. The data of interest to this work comes from section 13, titled \"Cattle and Calves\", on page 10 of the 2007 Agricultural Census. Section 13 also has a set of related instructions located on page 2 of the instruction sheet appended to the Agricultural Census [17] . From the U.S. Census Bureau and their 2010 Census (of humans) in the United States, we use the centers of human population for each county [16] . We include these geographical points to consider a basic quantification of distance for the cattle movement estimation. Adding this geography to the data from the NASS database, we estimate sets of parameters to characterize cattle movements in the States of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas [45] , [46] . The US beef production feedlot structure produces more frequent and larger flows of cattle than the typical grazing structure, and notably, these 10 Central States form the core of the US feedlot industry [38] , [43] . As outlined in figure 1, these States contain 1034 US counties with more than 51 million head of cattle of the 96.3 million head reported in the 2007 Agricultural Census [44] .\nA. Data structure of USDA NASS From section 13 of the 2007 Agricultural Census, we are primarily interested in the responses to questions concerning the populations and movements of cattle. For cattle populations, the Agricultural Census identifies the total number of cattle (Question 3), the number of dairy cows kept for production of milk (Question 2.b), and the number of cattle, including calves, who were in a preslaughter feed program (Question 5) on December 31, 2007. For the movements of cattle, composed of all sales and shipments, the Agricultural Census captures the total number of cattle \"sold or moved\" during 2007 (Question 4) and the total number of cattle shipped directly to a slaughter market from a preslaughter feed program during 2007 (Question 6) [17] . Although these data are collected for each individual operation, the statistics of the cattle populations are reported only through aggregated distributions that are delineated by the operation's county, the type of cattle, and the number cattle of a particular type. The sizes of populations are sorted into seven standard ranges: 1 \u2212 9 cattle, 10 \u2212 19 cattle, 20 \u2212 49 cattle, 50 \u2212 99 cattle, 100 \u2212 199 cattle, 200 \u2212 499 cattle, and 500 or more cattle. The statistics of the cattle movements sort the responses by the total yearly movements (or slaughter) across the same 7 standard ranges, the type of cattle, and the county of the originating operation. It is worth noting that the total dairy cattle population and the total preslaughter population of a given county are subpopulations of the total cattle population for that county. Similarly, the total number of cattle shipped to slaughter from a preslaughter feed program is a fraction of the total cattle movements (sales and shipments) for each county.\nAccording to appendix A of the 2007 Agricultural Census Summary and State Data report, the data presented in the NASS database has undergone some initial processing and systematic error correction [47] . This results in a very consistent database and the potential errors induced by these methods have been quantified in the same appendix. Even with these diligent efforts, there remain two significant challenges in utilizing the data to characterize the movements of cattle. The first concerns the resolution of the timescale of the data. As a summary of the entire year 2007, these data fail to capture any seasonal fluctuations in the cattle populations and movements [48] . This challenge arises from the administration process of the Agricultural Census and we acknowledge its significance; however, we find no comprehensive, data-driven solution to the seasonality challenge and consider only mean-field probabilities in our estimation. The second challenge is posed by the direct sorting of the census responses into the 7 standard ranges rather than preserving any operation-based connections between data points. Therefore, a population of 50 dairy cattle might belong to any operation having a total number of cattle greater than or equal to 50 (4 possible size ranges) without having any connection to the size of its entire operation. Similarly, the sizes of shipments have no direct connections to the size of the originating operations besides a few loose feasibility restrictions.\nThe data, as it comes from NASS, has been released in such a way that the information of individual farms and cattle operations is not revealed. This is done intentionally by USDA to comply with Title 7 of the U.S. Code [47] . To maintain this anonymity, critically selected elements of the data have not been disclosed. We will estimate these non-disclosed data points through a pair of tightly-constrained convex problems and then include them in the inputs for our main problem, the estimation of cattle movement parameters across the 10 Central States."}, {"section_title": "B. Data structure for estimation problem", "text": "To estimate the non-disclosed entries in the original data, we construct a pair of optimization problems, one for the population data and a second for the movement and slaughter data. The objective of both formulations is a maximum entropy function. For the population distributions and by each State, we maximize the entropy of the distributions of each cattle type given by T ype A = {Dairy, P reslaughter, All Cattle}, where the distributions are normalized by their respective State totals. Likewise, the entropy of the normalized distributions describing the totals of cattle slaughter shipments and cattle movements is maximized across shipment type, ShipT ype = {All Shipments, Slaughter}, shipment size, Size A = {z1 9, z10 19, z20 49, z50 99, z100 199, z200 499, z500 up}, and county. We present the formulations of these problems in appendix A. These problems are solved for each of the 10 States, filling in all non-disclosed data entries. We quantify the dependence of our inputs on these estimations with both the fraction of cattle and the fraction of populations estimated for each State in Appendix B.\nWe would prefer to represent the system of cattle through three subpopulations rather than the two subpopulations and total population of T ype A . The mapping of the first set T ype A to a set of three cattle subpopulation types is not trivial as is requires the expression of a relationship among the 3 cattle types of T ype A . For the county totals of these three types, the relationship T c \u00b7,c represents the respective county total for county c and x indicates that this is a variable to be estimated. However, the relationship is not guaranteed if we consider the stratification of the populations by size as P op Dairy,c,i + P op P reslaughter,c,i \u2264 P op AllCattle,c,i \u2200 (c \u2208 County, i \u2208 Size A ) ,\nwhere P op \u00b7,c,i represents the respective population total for operations with size i and in county c. Rather, Broomfield County in the State of Colorado, as do a number of other counties, reports data in violation of this relationship. Broomfield County is a irregularly cut county on the north side of Denver, Colorado and has 2 dairy farms with total populations in the range z100 199. The county, however, reports 2 populations of Dairy cattle in the size range z50 99 and no total (All Cattle) populations in the size range z50 99. Thus the left-hand side of inequality 1 would be non-zero while the right-hand side is identically 0 for i = z50 99, c = Broomf ield Colorado. This discrepancy arises from other cattle residing at both of these operations that raise the total operation populations into the next size range. We find that through an aggregation of the sizes into 3 ranges, Size B = {z1 19, z20 199, z200 up}, it becomes feasible to assume the relationship of inequality 1 for each size j in Size B .\nLet us define a new cattle type Beef , representing all cattle that are not serving as dairy cattle nor in a preslaughter feed program, as the difference between the total population All Cattle and the two subpopulation types, Dairy and P reslaughter. The Beef type represents a diverse set of cattle operations including grazing, backgrounding, and breeding services. The name Beef is chosen for simplicity with the assumption that this is the majority role served by cattle in this type. At this point, we describe the cattle subpopulations P op t,c,j by cattle type t in T ype B = {Dairy, P reslaughter, Beef }, county c, and size j in Size B = {z1 19, z20 199, z200 up}. The set of subpopulations {P op R t,c,j } results from the solution of the first of the data-patching optimization formulations and represents an aggregation of all cattle type-based subpopulations fitting the subpopulation descriptors, yielding only 9 subpopulations per county.

Problem formulation", "text": "The central portion of this paper revolves around the formulation to estimate the cattle movement parameter p x t1,j1,t2,j2,dist , which is a probability that represents the movement process from an origin subpopulation of type t 1 and size j 1 to a destination subpopulation of type t 2 and size j 2 with a distance falling in a discrete distance range dist between the origin and destination counties. We mark the decision variables of this formulation with a superscript x to distinguish them from the parameters of the problem. This formulation also estimates the birth bt x c1,t1,j1 , expiration of utility (cull) dt x c1,t1,j1 , and slaughter sl x c1,t1,j1 probabilities for each sub-population of each county. The three types of cattle are now rearranged into the set T ype B as {Dairy, P reslaughter, Beef }, with size ranges defined by Size B = {z1 19, z20 199, z200 up}. The set of discrete distance ranges used in this formulation is called Distance and is defined as {d0, d100, d200, d500, d1000, d toof ar }. The number noted in each distance range between two county centers should be read as the maximum distance in miles of the range with the minimum defined by the previous level, for example, d500 indicates a distance between the two county centers falling between 200 and 500 miles. The closest range, d0, is assigned for any pair of counties with centers less than 10 miles apart, as well as each county with itself. The formulation has an objective to maximize the entropy of the outgoing distributions of all sub-populations as follows.\nThe out-going probability distribution for the cattle of each subpopulation is completed through the inclusion of a probability to remain or stay, st x c1,t1,j1 , in the origin subpopulation. The sum of the entropy of these distributions composes our objective function. We have implemented industrial constraints with a set of parameters {f t1,j1,t2,j2,dist } described in the following constraints which forces a subset of the movement probabilities p x t1,j1,t2,j2,dist to zero. We account for this by introducing a complimentary (1.0 \u2212 f t1,j1,t2,j2,dist ) in the logarithm of p x t1,j1,t2,j2,dist to avoid the computation of the natural logarithm of zero."}, {"section_title": "Subject to", "text": "Constraints on Statistical rules\nInequality 3 serves to restrict the probabilities of movement, p x t1,j1,t2,j2,dist , to be less or equal to 1 as f t1,j1,t2,j2,dist takes on a value of 1 in the general case. By taking a value of 0, it further prevents the movement of cattle from Dairy subpopulations to P reslaughter subpopulations (t 1 = Dairy and t 2 = P reslaughter \u21d2 f t1,j1,t2,j2,dist = 0) and the out-going shipments of cattle from preslaughter subpopulations (t 1 = P reslaughter \u21d2 f t1,j1,t2,j2,dist = 0).

This discrepancy is permitted due to data challenges discussed in section II. The scaling term, R C = 52.0 weeks/year, converts the timescale of the estimation problem from a yearly to weekly basis for the estimated probabilities. Equality constraint 6 equates the total slaughter from preslaughter feed subpopulations in each county c 1 to the respective, scaled data value from USDA NASS, again with a discrepancy term for each county P N slt (c 1 ). Inequality 7 ensures that the largest yearly slaughter counts (500 or more head) are accredited to the largest (200 or more head) preslaughter subpopulations. This inequality requires a discrepancy term P N slt500 (c 1 ) due to seasonality challenges in the USDA NASS data set. The discrepancy terms are collected in equality 8. Although we represent equality 8 here with absolute value operators, the actual implementation linearizes the terms through a two-variable decomposition of the unrestricted variable that allows us to minimize the resulting value as if it were an absolute value [50] .

Cattle movement parameters", "text": "As the focus of this study, the cattle movement parameters p x t1,j1,t2,j2,dist express the probability that, within a week's duration, an individual in a subpopulation of type t 1 and size j 1 will move or be shipped to a subpopulation of type t 2 and size j 2 at a (county-to-county) distance of dist. Table I presents a subset of these probabilities that express the movement of cattle from Dairy subpopulations to Beef subpopulations for 5 ranges of distance. A complete table of the cattle movement probabilities is provided in appendix B along with tables that partially present the birth, expiration, and slaughter probabilities of the 9 subpopulations of each county. The entire results are too large for this document as we are studying 1034 counties. The tables in appendix B present results for a sample of 10 counties from each State. Once having obtained the solution, we revisited the movement data released by the USDA NASS. A significant difference exists between the NASS movement data and these movement parameters we've estimated, namely, that the movements of NASS are summarized from individual premises, but our parameters describe movements from and to collections of premises. We simulated 30 years of virtual cattle movements and shipments for slaughter and summarized the movements into the 3 size ranges of Size B . We compare these results for individual counties, considering that shipments originating from aggregated subpopulations ought to usually be larger than shipments from individual operations. This means that the subpopulation-based results should over represent for larger sizes and perhaps under represent for smaller sizes of shipments. For Ellis County in the State of Kansas, figure 2 presents a comparison of our subpopulation based distributions of shipments in blue against the NASS reported yearly totals in red. The three size categories represent the three ranges of Size B , with the smallest range on the left and the largest on the right side. Trego County, also in the State of Kansas, demonstrates one way in which the year-long resolution of the Agricultural Census is insufficient to express the seasonality of the cattle system. At the time of the 2007 census, Trego County reported no large P reslaughter populations of cattle. On the year, however, Trego County was responsible for several large shipments of cattle for slaughter. The census happened to catch the finishing yards at a point in time in which they were empty and thus neither the true capacity nor typical population levels of P reslaughter cattle are represented in the NASS database. Figure 3 .B displays the dramatic mismatch that occurs for the largest slaughter shipment size category."}, {"section_title": "V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have designed and solved a large-scale optimal estimation problem in an attempt to address the privacy challenges and the need for livestock movement data in the United States. Given the resolution limitations of the data available, we do not try to estimate very detailed parameters, but rather adopt a stratified metapopulation approach where we shape the structure of our variables around the structure of the NASS data. Our approach is limited by the timescale resolution of the census report. This leads to several seasonal challenges that include correctly quantifying populations, identifying periods of higher and lower movement rates, and capturing birthing and slaughtering seasons. The demographic bounds used in our formulation depend on advice from industry experts and are flexibly open to further insights. We simulated and compared subpopulation-based movement distributions with operation-based movements, however this is not a rigorous method of validation. Our problem design includes an assumption on the relationships of cattle types and sizes that proved to not hold true for all counties as demonstrated by Broomfield County in the State of Colorado. Lastly, the parameters we estimate fail to consider individual State laws and Veterinary practices as well as the role of wildlife in the interfacing of subpopulations.\nA close examination of the results in table B.1 of appendix B reveals a relatively unrealistic fraction of probabilities that are estimated to take on a value of 0. We believe this to be an artifact that has arisen from the design of the formulation and the nature of the optimization. Without a sufficiently diverse set of constraints, the dimensionality of an optimal solution for the problem will be limited. The objective to maximize entropy would prefer to diversify the results, making as many nonzero as possible, yet it seems too tightly restricted in some way as to allow that to occur in the solution. If we had to select a constraint which would most likely be the cause for these probabilities taking on a value of 0, we would first suspect the tight error limit of inequality 13. All other constraints allow a reasonable amount of flexibility in the set of parameters that would satisfy them. As the objective strives to diversify the distributions, we predict that loosening the error limits would result in fewer movement probabilities taking on a value of 0.\nFrom the challenges that this problem held, a few insights were discovered that might improve the success of a future version of these livestock movement estimation methods without posing any threat to the confidentiality of the data. Having examined the design limitations of this study, we would like to propose 3 new questions to be considered for addition to future versions of the US Census of Agriculture. Those being Large-scale livestock disease analysis and control is the most immediate use for the parameters estimated by this method. The threat of an livestock epidemic spreading across the region under consideration can be examined using a global epidemic invasion threshold for this system of cattle populations [18] , [19] . A recent work has extended this global invasion threshold to directed livestock movements among many populations [52] . This work has derived two global epidemic invasion thresholds, where the first describes the emergence of the disease at a regional scale (p c ) and the second describes the spreading of the disease into the preslaughter locations p"}, {"section_title": "T S c", "text": ". We compute a rough approximation of the critical movement rates p c and p\nfrom the estimated data for the 10 Central States. The computation of the average movement rate p across the 10 States and the comparison of these values to the critical movement rates reveal the potential for epidemics to break out across these States when considering the current movement rates. We use the same disease parameters for the theoretical comparison: infection rate \u03b2 = \u00b5R 0 , recovery rate \u00b5 = 1(week) \u22121 , and basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.2. From our estimated parameters we determined the approximate average population size N approx = 5483.8 head and the average death rate \u03b4 = 0.01516(week) \u22121 . We simulated 30 years of cattle movements and captured the weekly average outward movement p for all Beef and Dairy subpopulations. Concurrently, we measured the resulting network parameters (\u03b7 in , \u03b7 out , k in i , k out i ) for networks representing the weekly movements. We have considered the dynamic network measurements as produced by the realized movements. We have ignored the potential existence of any degree correlations in the resulting networks from the movement-based network construction. Having collected this approximate set of parameters, we computed the critical movement rates p c and p\nand list them in comparison to the system average movement rate p of the estimated cattle movement parameters in table II. This first approximation of the incorporation of these two components suggests that the US cattle systems are at a significant level of risk. The average cattle movement rates are roughly 2 magnitudes larger than the thresholds defined by the critical movement rates. This result suggests that an epidemic with parameters similar to the ones implemented would easily invade US cattle populations and reach the cattle's final destinations, possibly compromising the security of the beef supply chain. To impede the progress of this epidemic, a reduction in cattle movement rates of more than 99% would be required. For human influenza-like illnesses, a reduction in mobility rates of one order of magnitude has also been proposed [9] . This amount of reduction is based on an approximated comparison, and further work should be completed to better quantify the risk to US livestock systems."}, {"section_title": "VI.

The lower and upper limits are set by the limits of the size ranges (l t,z1 9 = 1, u t,z1 9 = 9, ...), with the exception of the upper limits on the largest size range, z500 up. The largest upper limit u t,z500 up is set to T z r t,z500 up if datT z t,z500 up = 1, else we set u t,z500 up = P \nThe objective function maximizes the entropy of the three (by cattle type) population distributions and includes additional terms in the logarithm argument similar to the objective function of the formulation of section III.

For the objectives of this paper, there is not a need to add any assumptions to the relationship between the slaughter shipments and the total shipments beyond the assumption-less relationship of inequality 51.

APPENDIX B: RESULTS OF OPTIMIZATION", "text": "In appendix A, we described the formulations of two optimization problems that estimate all non-disclosed elements of the particular USDA NASS data sets which are used in this chapter. We quantify the amount of estimated data for each State in tables III and IV. Table III presents the numbers of populations estimated for each State by count and percentage as well as the number (head) of cattle assigned across these populations. The populations are counted by summing over all three types of T ype A = {Dairy, P reslaughter, All Cattle}. This method of counting induces double counting since cattle in the first two types also belong to the third type, but offers a systematic quantification of the amount of data estimated. The percentage of cattle assigned through the estimation demonstrates that in situations where many populations are estimated the significance of these populations is less < 7%. The States of Kansas and Texas are exceptions to the trend of small fractions of the total cattle being assigned through estimation. These two States appear to have relatively similar percentages of estimated populations when compared to the other States, yet they assign larger percentages of the cattle totals. These larger numbers of cattle suggest that a higher number of counties in these States possess only a few large cattle operations, where the sparsity and the size of the operations necessitate the non-disclosure of their data elements. t1,j1,t2,j2,dist sorted by the origin and destination pairs in the left column and the distances between the county centers in the rows.
