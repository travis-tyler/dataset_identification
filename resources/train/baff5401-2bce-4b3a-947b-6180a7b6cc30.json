This report has three main goals: 1) To describe the representation of women in high school physics enrollment, physics and astronomy degree completions, and faculty employment. Data are graphically displayed over many years, but the emphasis in our discussion is placed on changes in the most recent decade. In addition, we will examine the representation of minority women at these levels. 2) To compare employment outcomes for men and women with physics and astronomy degrees by exploring potential gender differences in salary, job satisfaction, career opportunities, career resources, and family influences. 3) To identify points of attrition for women in physics and astronomy between postsecondary education and faculty employment. For example, we will examine the percentage of attrition at the faculty member level based on women's past doctorate degree production. In this report, we used physics and astronomy data collected by the Statistical Research Center at the American Institute of Physics. We obtained data on students from the Enrollments and Degrees Survey and data on faculty members from the Academic Workforce Survey and the Faculty Member Survey. Data on other academic fields were obtained from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2016), and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (National Science Foundation [NSF], 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Students and Degrees", "text": "High school students. In 2013, we estimate that 1.38 million students were enrolled in high school physics courses. While the number of young women enrolled in high school physics courses has grown, so has the number of young men. Thus, the percentage of young women in physics courses has remained stable around 46% since 1997 ( Figure 2; White and Tesfaye, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "During high school, many young women participated in Advanced Placement (AP) physics programs. The AP Program offered four physics exams in 2017: Physics 1, Physics 2, Physics C: Mechanics, and Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Physics 1 and 2 are algebra-based courses, and Physics C courses are calculus-based. Figure 3 shows the number and percentage of young women who participated in the four AP physics exams. Around 160,000 students participated in Physics 1 exams, and 40% of test-takers were young women (The College Board, 2017). Around 90,000 students participated in the other three exams, and between 24-28% of Physics 2 and Physics C test-takers were young women. Although the representation of young women among Physics 1 exam-takers was higher than the other exams, the percentage earning a \"passing\" score (3 or higher) was lower (Figure 4). 30% of young women passed the Physics 1 exam, compared to 48% of young men. However, in the other exams, there was a smaller difference between the percentage of young women and young men who passed the exams.  Bachelor's degrees. Women remain under-represented among physics bachelor's degree recipients. According to our 2017 Enrollments and Degrees Survey, over 8,500 students were awarded bachelor's degrees in physics, and 21% of degrees were earned by women. Although the number of women earning physics bachelor's degrees has steadily increased over the last decade (Figure 5), the percentage of women has not increased ( Figure 6). Since the percentage of women has shown little change between 2007-2017, bachelor's degree completion is increasing at similar rates for men and women.  The representation of women in astronomy is higher than in physics. In 2017, over 500 astronomy undergraduates were awarded bachelor's degrees, and 33% of these degrees were earned by women (Figure 7). While the number of women earning astronomy degrees has steadily increased between 2007-2017 (Figure 8), the number of men earning degrees has shown greater increases. Therefore, the total percentage of women earning astronomy bachelor's degrees has decreased in recent years (33% in 2017 compared to 40% in 2007).  Doctoral programs and degrees. The percentage of women earning physics doctorates and enrolling in doctoral programs has increased in recent years. In 2017, over 1,800 doctorates were awarded in physics ( Figure 9) and 20% of these were earned by women (compared to 18% in 2007; Figure 6).

Women are under-represented in physics and astronomy, but this is not true for all fields in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). Figures 13 and 14 show the percentage of women who earned bachelor's and doctoral degrees across STEM fields between 1984 and 2016. At both degree levels, biological science and chemistry have the highest percentage of women, while physics, computer science, and engineering fields have the lowest (NCES, 2016;NSF, 2016). Astronomy has a higher percentage than physics, but still has a lower percentage compared to biological science, chemistry, and, at the bachelor's level, mathematics. Overall, this demonstrates a gap in women's representation between physics, astronomy, and many other STEM fields, and this gap has not changed in recent years.  Physics departments. Some physics departments in the United States award more physics degrees to women than others. Table 1 lists the 21 physics departments at four-year institutions that awarded 40% or more of their bachelor's degrees to women between 2013 and 2017. These departments were mostly located at small private colleges, liberal arts colleges, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

About 27,000 high school teachers taught at least one physics course in 2013 (White & Tesfaye, 2014), and about 37% of teachers were women (compared to 29% in 2001). The 2014 Academic Workforce Survey found that there were over 9,000 faculty members working in physics departments and 600 in astronomy departments. Overall, women were 16% of faculty members in physics departments (compared to 10% in 2002) and 19% of faculty members in astronomy departments (compared to 14% in 2003; Tables 4 and 5). Academic rank. There is a steady increase in the percentage of women at different academic ranks in both physics and astronomy departments ( Tables 4 and 5). In physics departments, more women were represented at adjunct and assistant ranks in 2014, and in astronomy departments, more women were represented at assistant and associate ranks. Although a smaller percentage of women were full professors in both fields, this is likely due to fewer women earning physics and astronomy doctorates in the past. It takes a number of years to transition from assistant to full professor status. Based on the percentage of women among assistant professors in 2014, we expect the percentage of women among full professors to increase over time as junior faculty gain experience and progress through the ranks. We take a closer look at these expectations in \"The Pipeline\" section of this report. Table 4  Table 5 Physics departments. The number and representation of women has increased across all physics departments between 2002 and 2014 ( Table 6). When examining departments based on the highest physics degree granted in 2014, PhD departments had the lowest percentage of women, but had the largest number of women. Over 700 women were faculty members in PhD departments, and 14% of faculty members in these departments were women. Departments that offer a bachelor's degree as the highest physics degree had the highest overall percentage of women. These departments employed over 600 women, and 20% of faculty members were women.

Instead of solely focusing on women employed in academia, we wanted to examine career outcomes for women working across all employment sectors, which includes four-year institutions, two-year colleges, K-12 education, government, and private industry. We analyzed gender differences in salary, job satisfaction, career opportunities, doctoral advisor ratings, and family influences. Linear or logistic regression analyses were used to analyze gender differences. In the analyses, we controlled for several employment factors, so any results are attributable to gender differences and not to other factors. Our models controlled for: age, time since receiving a degree, job sector, full or part-time job status, 9 or 12-month salary schedule, and postdoc completion (doctorate analyses only).

However, the statistics in this report are from a small window of time (2013-2017), and to properly assess attrition or \"leaks\" in the pipeline, we must compare recent data with appropriate points in the past.

In 2013, 46% of high school physics students were young women, and in 2017, women earned 21% of bachelor's degrees. Although enrolling in high school physics does not necessarily indicate an interest in becoming a physics major in college, the low percentage of physics bachelor's degrees earned by women indicates a drop-off point for women between high school physics and college graduation. We need more data to understand whether this drop occurs before or during undergraduate education. Bachelor's degrees to doctoral programs. Next, we will examine the transition between earning a physics bachelor's degree and enrolling in a physics doctoral program. Since over 90% of women who earned bachelor's degrees were US citizens, we only compared women with US citizenship. According to our first-year graduate student survey, most students took no break or a one-year break between undergraduate and graduate education. In the 2016-17 academic year, women with US citizenship earned 20% of bachelor's degrees in physics. In the Fall of 2017, 21% of first year doctoral students with US citizenship were women.

Foreign women accounted for about 50% of the women enrolled in 2010-12 doctoral programs and about 50% of women earning doctoral degrees in 2017. Neither women with US citizenship or women with foreign citizenship showed any attrition during graduate school. Doctorate degrees to faculty positions. Lastly, we will examine the transition between earning a physics doctorate and becoming a physics professor (Table 12). Based on results from our 2014 Faculty Member Survey, we examined the length of time since doctoral completion for all women who were assistant, associate, and full professors. There was a wide range of graduation years for women who were full professors. The middle 50% of women graduated between 1980 and 1994. During those years, women earned 8% of physics doctorates.

There are several potential explanations for this. First, past research shows that physics departments may be aware of the under-representation of women among faculty members and make efforts to hire more women. In 2003, although 14% of physics doctorates were women, 20% of job offers went to women (National Research Council of the National Academies, 2010). Second, in our 2011 PhD Plus 10 survey data, a significantly greater percentage of men with physics doctorates worked in industry settings compared to women. If more men transition into industry after graduating, this might explain why the representation of women in academia is higher than expected. Limitations. There is one limitation to our faculty member pipeline analysis. The analysis assumes that men and women take the same amount of time to obtain professorship positions. However, men and women may not advance at the same rate. We conducted a linear regression analysis comparing the years until professorship positions between men and women, controlling for their postdoc experience and the type of academic department (Table  13). There were no gender differences in the time it took to become an assistant or associate professor. However, the time to promotion to full professor for women was, on average, one year longer than for men. This suggests that women may stay at the associate professor level longer than men, and future research should investigate potential explanations for this finding."}, {"section_title": "Table 13", "text": "Attrition in astronomy. In astronomy, we examined women's transitions between earning bachelor's degrees, entering graduate school, and doctoral completion.

It is possible that a greater percentage of students entering astronomy doctoral programs are women, but this comparison is not exact because most astronomy graduate students earn a bachelor's degree outside astronomy. Based on our 2015-16 Follow-up Survey of Astronomy PhDs, around 60% of women in astronomy graduate programs received their bachelor's degree in other STEM majors. Therefore, comparisons made between the percent of bachelor's recipients and graduate students in astronomy should be interpreted with caution. In astronomy graduate programs, the middle 50% of students took 6-7 years to graduate. In 2010-12, 37% of first year graduate students were women, and women earned 40% of doctoral degrees in 2017.

The representation of women in astronomy is still higher than physics. In 2017, women earned 33% of astronomy bachelors' degrees and 40% of astronomy doctorates. In the last decade, the percentage of women earning doctoral degrees in physics and astronomy has continued to grow, while the percentage of women earning bachelor's degrees has changed very little. Fortunately, women are not leaving physics between completing their undergraduate education and obtaining faculty employment. Based on our pipeline analysis, the percentage of women employed in faculty positions matches the percentage of women who received doctorates in the past. If this pattern remains consistent, we predict that the representation of women among physics and astronomy faculty should increase over time since more women are receiving doctorates in recent years. Women may still experience attrition between high school physics enrollment and bachelor's degree completion; however, more data is needed to determine whether this attrition occurs before or during undergraduate education. When we examined employment outcomes of women with physics and astronomy degrees, we found several gender differences in mid-career employment. In early stages of physics careers, men and women have similar salaries and levels of job satisfaction. However, in later stages of physics careers, men receive a 10% higher salary than women, and women report having fewer career resources and career opportunities. In addition, women with children report slower career progression and make more career compromises for family reasons (e.g. relocating, working fewer hours, leaving their jobs). The challenges women experience with career resources, opportunities, and family responsibilities seem to negatively impact their career potential. Lower representation and participation of women, minorities, and other groups in education and employment can impact progress in physics and astronomy fields. Research suggests that diverse teams can lead to increased creativity and productivity (Smith-Doerr, Alegria, & Sacco, 2017) because there can be more exchanges of unique ideas and experiences and increased access to diverse social networks for information gathering and dissemination. Therefore, physics and astronomy should continue to encourage the representation and participation of women and other groups who can offer unique and diverse perspectives within the scientific community."}]
