However, evidence on the association between SUA and arterial stiffness is limited to contradicting crosssectional studies. In this analysis, we examined the longitudinal relationship between SUA and pulse wave velocity, a measure of arterial stiffness, in a community-dwelling population. We studied 446 women and 427 men participating in the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), with 1409 and 1434 observations, respectively, over an average period of 6 years. At baseline, mean ages of women and men were 65\u00b113 and 68\u00b113 years; mean SUA, 4.6\u00b11.1 and 5.7\u00b11.3 mg/dL; mean pulse wave velocity, 8.1\u00b11.7 and 8.6\u00b11.9 m/s, respectively (P<0.0001). In gender-stratified models accounting for age, blood pressure, renal function, metabolic measures, and medications, there was a significant interaction between SUA and follow-up time in men (\u03b2=0.69; P=0.0002) but not in women. Men, but not women, in the highest gender-specific SUA tertile at baseline (SUA\u22656.2 mg/dL in men and SUA\u22654.9 mg/dL in women) had a greater rate of pulse wave velocity increase over time than those in the lowest tertiles (\u03b2=0.997; P=0.012). This gender difference was lost when the distribution of SUA in men and women was made comparable by excluding hyperuricemic men (SUA\u22656.2 mg/dL). In conclusion, higher SUA was associated with greater increase in pulse wave velocity in men but not women; this association was lost when men with SUA\u22656.2 mg/dL were not included, suggesting a threshold for SUA association with arterial stiffness, which is more frequently reached in men.

At each study visit, SUA was measured from a blood sample usually drawn in the morning of the first day, whereas PWV was measured within the next few days of study visit, according to the patient-specific schedule.

Linear mixed-effect models were implemented to assess the longitudinal association between SUA and PWV, after accounting for confounders. A linear mixed-effects regression model easily accommodates unbalanced, unequally spaced observations and, consequently, is an ideal tool for analyzing longitudinal changes in data from this observational study. 18 Age was introduced in the model as entry age and follow-up time (time) to allow the detection of nonlinear changes in PWV with aging (see online-only Data Supplement for further details). Because of the well-known differences in PWV and SUA between women and men, all models were stratified by gender. To test for the longitudinal association between SUA and PWV, SUA and its interactions with entry age and time were introduced into a multivariate model accounting for established determinants of SUA and PWV. These covariates were chosen based on both their clinical and their statistical associations with the predictor (ie, SUA) and the outcome (ie, PWV) demonstrated in previous literature 2, 6, 19, 20 and their availability at each study visit. Thus, the final full models, beyond SUA and its interactions with entry age and time, also included nonwhite race, systolic blood pressure and heart rate, eGFR, waist circumference, glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, antihypertensive medications, and lipid-lowering medications. 6 Main determinants of PWV (ie, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and waist circumference) and SUA (ie, systolic blood pressure, eGFR, and waist circumference) were forced into each model, then backward elimination of the remaining terms with P value >0.10 was performed. To further assess the differences in longitudinal changes in PWV with age at different SUA level, linear mixed-effect models with gender-specific baseline tertiles of SUA were also built using the lowest gender-specific SUA tertile as the reference group. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Characteristics of the study population at baseline are presented in Table 1 . The final analyses included 446 women (51%) and 427 men (49%), with 1409 and 1434 prospective observations, respectively (median number of observations per participant 3, range 2-10), over a median follow-up period of 6 years (range 1-11). At first study visit, compared with women, men were older, were more likely to be white and to smoke, and had higher PWV, SUA, and blood pressure values but a lower heart rate. Men also had higher plasma glucose but lower total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than women and also more frequently took antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications than women. Men were more frequently diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus than women. Fewer than 1% of study participants had an eGFR of <60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 , with no significant difference between genders. There was also no significant difference between genders in diuretic medications that could potentially modify SUA levels, including thiazide or potassium-sparing agents (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical C03A and C03D, 15% in women versus14% in men; P=0.75). Three men (0.7%) but no women were taking anti-gout medication at baseline (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical M04A; P=0.09).\nAs expected, the distribution of SUA significantly differed between genders at study entry, with men showing higher SUA than women ( Figure S1 ). When analyzing the correlation between SUA and age at study entry, women showed increasing levels of SUA with age, particularly before the seventh decade, whereas men did not. Nonetheless, at each 5-year entry age group, men displayed higher SUA than did women ( Figure S2) .\nWe tested the longitudinal association between SUA and PWV in fully adjusted gender-specific models, 6 including the interaction of SUA with entry age and time (Table 2 , model 1). The coefficients of the time main term, along with the interaction terms that included it, quantify the longitudinal change in PWV and how SUA modified the magnitude of these changes. In women, we found no longitudinal association between PWV and SUA; however, there was a significant SUA\u00d7entry age interaction, indicating that higher SUA was associated with higher PWV at older entry age. In contrast, in men, we found a significant SUA\u00d7time interaction, suggesting that higher SUA was associated with an accelerated increase in PWV with aging. After performing backward elimination, these associations were found to be independent of other covariates, particularly systolic blood pressure, heart rate, eGFR, and waist circumference (Table 2, model 2). A table with raw coefficients is provided in the online-only Data Supplement (Table S2) .\nTo further dissect this differential contribution of SUA to the increase in PWV with aging in the 2 genders, we stratified the study population in gender-specific tertiles of SUA at study entry. When investigating the interactions of the middle and the highest SUA tertile with entry age and time (using the lowest tertile as reference) in gender-stratified linear mixed-effects models, we found a significant interaction of the highest but not of the middle SUA tertile with entry age in women, and with time in men, suggesting a threshold effect (Table 3 , model 1). Accordingly, participants in the lowest and in the middle tertile were combined in a unique reference group (Table 3 , model 2). Women in the highest SUA tertile had higher PWV at older entry age than those in the reference group, as evidenced by a significant entry age\u00d7highest SUA tertile interaction, but no significant differences in the rate of PWV change over time. On the contrary, men in the highest SUA tertile had an accelerated rate of PWV increase over time when compared to those in the reference group, as evidenced by a significant time\u00d7highest SUA tertile interaction, but no significant differences in PWV at entry age (Table 3 , model 2).\nFigure shows predicted longitudinal trajectories of PWV increase over time in women versus men belonging to the lowest and the middle gender-specific SUA tertiles ( Figure, left) and to the highest gender-specific SUA tertile (Figure, right) . Although there was no differential contribution of SUA to the longitudinal increase in PWV between women and men with low SUA, men with high SUA had an accelerated rate of PWV increase over time compared with women with higher SUA (Figure) , suggesting a gender-specific independent causative role of SUA in the longitudinal increase in PWV only in men.\nWe, therefore, performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate whether the higher SUA thresholds generally reached by men as compared with women could explain this gender difference. We selected a sample including only men in the lowest-middle SUA tertiles at baseline (SUA <6.2 mg/ dL) and women in the middle-highest SUA tertiles at baseline (SUA \u22654 mg/dL). This sample included 294 women with 940 prospective observations and 279 men with 952 prospective observations, with women having significantly higher mean baseline SUA values than men (5.1\u00b10.9 versus 4.9\u00b10.8; P=0.03). The longitudinal association between SUA and PWV became not statistically significant in men (SUA\u00d7time \u03b2=0.46; P=0.11) and remained not statistically significant in women (SUA\u00d7time \u03b2=0.23; P=0.34). In addition, to further substantiate the potential cause-effect relationship between hyperuricemia and arterial stiffness, we repeated the analysis using lagged independent variables (ie, correlating prior-visit SUA and covariates with next-visit PWV), and the results remained substantially unchanged (see Table S4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first analysis investigating the longitudinal association between SUA and PWV in a community-dwelling population of elderly and mostly white individuals. We disclosed a significant independent relationship between increased SUA and increased PWV over time. This association was restricted to men and, possibly, explained by the higher SUA levels in men than in women throughout their lifespan, rather than gender-specific susceptibility to the effects of SUA.\nThese data further expand the growing body of literature investigating a potential independent contribution of SUA to the progressive stiffening of the arterial tree observed with aging. Some previous cross-sectional analyses showed no association between SUA and PWV after adjusting for measures of renal function and body fat, 10-13 whereas others showed a positive independent association. [7] [8] [9] To date, it remains unclear whether hyperuricemia has a causal effect or is simply a marker for other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. 2 Yet, our present findings demonstrate an accelerated increase in PWV with aging in male individuals with higher SUA values, which was independent of major confounders, including age, blood pressure, renal function, and metabolic measures. Interestingly, 2 recent large cross-sectional studies, despite intrinsic limitations, also found a significant independent relationship between SUA and PWV only in men. 14, 15 Men have SUA levels higher than women at all ages, 21 a finding that we confirmed in our study population ( Figure S2 ).

February 2017 and excess production of uric acid in male patients, especially in the presence of visceral fat obesity or metabolic syndrome, 23 the pathophysiology and clinical meaning of this finding has never been clearly elucidated. 24 The gender-specific and time-dependent effect of SUA on PWV we report here might be because of the higher levels of SUA in men. In fact, when we selected a sample of men with baseline SUA levels comparable to those reported in women (ie, <6.2 mg/dL), the significance of the longitudinal association with PWV was lost.\nConsistent with the results of the continuous analysis, higher SUA levels at baseline were associated with an increased longitudinal rate of change in PWV in men. Interestingly, this result did not apply to male participants with baseline SUA values <6 mg/dL, which corresponds to the highest limit of the mid SUA tertile in men (<6.2 mg/dL) and is commonly considered a cutoff criterion for definition of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. 25 Thus, it seems as if there is a threshold effect for SUA on arterial stiffness, and men cross that threshold more frequently and, hence, the high The value 0 indicates the reference group. Models were adjusted for variables shown, plus race, glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, smoking, and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs; results are reported for terms with P value <0.10 after backward selection; SBP, HR, eGFR, and WC were forced into the reduced models, see text for details.

Note in the right panel the faster increase in PWV (ie, steeper slope) with aging in men compared with that in women in the highest gender-specific SUA tertile. In contrast, note in the left panel that the rate of change did not significantly differ (ie, lines are parallel) in men and women in the lowest and mid gender-specific SUA tertile.\nPWV acceleration. In addition, this finding suggests that it is likely the long-term exposure to high levels of SUA that matters, even in the absence of symptoms. Accordingly, the 2-step process proposed by Feig 26 seems to fit well with recently reported findings in children, 27 which suggest that time exposure to elevated SUA may lead to vascular remodeling and persistent hypertension as a long time consequence of functional and transient vasoconstriction.\nArterial stiffness is the consequence of a complex interaction between structural and geometric properties of the arterial wall and dynamic effects of the distending pressure. Its main determinants are aging and blood pressure. 6, 20 The healthy properties of the vascular wall rely on the dynamic interplay of production and degradation of collagen and elastin. Deregulation of this balance may be stimulated by an inflammatory milieu, leading to increased arterial stiffness, 28 and contribute to the increase of blood pressure. 4, 5 Several possible pathophysiological mechanisms linking uric acid and arterial stiffness have been proposed, including that uric acid may stimulate the inflammatory pathways 29 and promote vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation by entering cells. 30 In particular, SUA has been shown to induce vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and oxidative stress by stimulating the vascular renin-angiotensin system. 31 Uric acid also promotes endothelial dysfunction through inactivation of NO and impairment of endothelial cells proliferation. 32 In addition to these molecular and animal models that support a direct metabolic effect of soluble urate, many recent studies have shown that hyperuricemia predict the development of hypertension. 19 Furthermore, some preliminary data in children suggest that urate-lowering treatment might reduce and normalize blood pressure. 33, 34 Thus, the vascular damage our findings suggest to be induced by hyperuricemia may be a novel mechanism contributing to the development of essential hypertension. In resume, known biological mechanisms linking SUA to increased arterial stiffness might justify our findings of an increased baseline PWV in older female with higher SUA levels and of a steeper increase in PWV over time in men in the highest SUA tertile. Our data provide the first human model suggesting a robust pathogenetic mechanism linking SUA to the increase of blood pressure (or to the onset of hypertension).\nOur findings supply some insight into the mechanism relating SUA to cardiovascular disease and the growing evidence of possible benefit from reducing asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Several large observational studies have demonstrated an independent association between SUA and cardiovascular outcomes. 2, 21, 35 Although reducing SUA in humans using hypouricemic drugs has not been found to independently improve cardiovascular outcomes, 36 recently published large-scale studies show a favorable effect of reducing SUA production by pharmacological inhibition of xanthineoxidase on all-cause mortality and cerebrovascular events. 37, 38 In addition, preliminary data suggest that xanthine-oxidase inhibitors might induce relative reversibility of uric acidrelated target organ damage. 39 Our study has some limitations and several strengths that should be mentioned. First, as a population-based study, the results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution in terms of implications on the direction of causality and applicability to individual patients. The purpose of this study is to reveal whether there is a longitudinal association between SUA and PWV and guide future studies to further examine this association. However, the effect size, using standardized coefficients, suggest that the effect of SUA in men is noticeable, with the effect of one standard deviation of SUA on the acceleration in the longitudinal increase in PWV being even greater than the effect of additional 10 years of age at study entry (\u03b2=0.615 versus \u03b2=0.557, respectively; see Table 2 , model 2). The relatively large effect size might suggest a potential role for interventions targeting SUA in the future. Second, the relatively small sample size (especially when categorizing SUA subgroups) and the relatively healthy population of our cohort prevented stratifying the analysis by health conditions, which limits the generalizability of this cohort to other nonhealthy populations. Another limitation is that, in accordance with the recommendation available at the beginning of the study, PWV was measured after at least 30-minute abstention from caffeine intake; to minimize biases to the longitudinal trends, we did not alter the protocol to accommodate the more recent recommended abstention period of 3 hours. However, PWV examinations are performed on BLSA participants during their 2-to 3-day stay in the hospital unit, within a controlled and comfortable environment, and far from habitual coffee time (breakfast or lunch).\nAmong the strengths, the wide age distribution and the similar number of observations and follow-up time between the 2 genders allowed us to perform the necessary gender-stratified analysis. In addition, the relatively low cardiovascular risk profile of our sample (ie, only few participants with chronic kidney disease and low prevalence of diabetes mellitus and central obesity) likely permitted the isolation of the potential independent causal effect of a single molecule, such as SUA on PWV. More importantly, it is very unlikely that this effect may be due or mediated by treatments, with <15% of the sample taking medications that could potentially affect SUA."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "Our study, showing that subclinical SUA levels might affect the worsening of PWV over time, provides the first demonstration of a relationship between increased SUA levels and vascular damage, namely arterial stiffness, in a longitudinal setting. To better elucidate the role of uric acid-lowering treatment in the context of cardiovascular risk factors, our findings should be further tested for the effect of lowering SUA on PWV in randomized controlled trials."}]
