As a psychological factor, self-determination, learning goal-orientation, self-efficacy, belief of intelligence, and self-regulated learning strategy were examined. The difference in psychological factors between the gifted with high achievement and the gifted with low achievement was to explored. For the study 128 gifted students' data from second-year data of Korean Education Longitudinal Study (KELS) were selected and analyzed. The findings indicate that the predictors of gifted students' achievement are extrinsic regulation, identified regulation, mastery-approach goal, self-efficacy, elaboration, and meta-cognition factor. Especially, the factor of elaboration and identified regulation are the strongest predictors. The findings from t-test analysis indicate that the gifted with low achievement show the low level in self-determination, mastery-approach, self-efficacy, elaboration, meta-cognition, place management and seeking social assistance from teacher. Therefore the developing elaboration, one of regulation learning strategy, is essential to improve the achievement of the gifted students with low scores. Key Words: Self-determination, Learning goal-orientation, Implicit theory of intelligence, Self-efficacy, Self-regulated learning strategy. "}]
