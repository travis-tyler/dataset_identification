[{"section_title": "", "text": "The quality and accessibility of college-focused school counseling vary greatly in U.S. secondary schools, thus offering a partial explanation for persistent higher education achievement disparities affecting low-income students, first-generation students, and/or students of color. School counselors can play critical roles in helping these historically marginalized students prepare for and apply to college (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014;Engberg & Wolniak, 2010Hill, 2008;McKillip et al., 2012;Perna et al., 2008;Poynton & Lapan, 2017;Robinson & Roksa, 2016). That said, research varies on the extent to which schoolbased counseling enhances college access for underrepresented students. In this study, we sought to improve our understanding regarding (a) the extent to which and (b) how collegespecific high school counseling broadens access for traditionally marginalized students. We achieved this by extending Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) typology of schools based on their counseling opportunity structures (COS) framework. COS draws upon McDonough's application of habitus (a school's culture and climate) to the college-going culture of schools and emphasizes the importance of school contexts (McDonough, 1997(McDonough, , 2005. Engberg and Gilbert (2014) argued that high schools create or limit collegegoing opportunities for students through the norms they cultivate and the resources they provide (Cabrera & La Nasa, 2001;Hill, 2008;McDonough, 1997). The COS framework defines college-going norms as the value or importance schools and counselors place on collegespecific counseling supports relative to the other demands on school counselors' time. COS also defines college-going resources as the specific practices high schools use to support students' college going. Consistent with the work of Engberg and Gilbert and others, we posited that schools moderate student outcomes by placing students on trajectories they might not otherwise achieve or by precluding their access to opportunity pathways. We extended existing work by including new student-level college-going behaviors made available through more recent waves of data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009(HSLS:2009, a nationally representative data set created and maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The study used a three-step approach to estimate the typology and was guided by the following three research questions: 1. Is there a typology of schools based on Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) COS framework, and how similar is that typology to Engberg and Gilbert's original typology? 2. To what extent do school characteristics help predict school types? 3. To what extent does the school typology help explain graduation and enrollment rates? The COS framework defines college-going norms as the value or importance schools and counselors place on college-specific counseling supports relative to the other demands on school counselors' time. COS also defines college-going resources as the specific practices high schools use to support students' college going."}, {"section_title": "School Counselors' Influence on College Going", "text": "The extant literature documents myriad ways school counselors shape college-going student behaviors (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014;McDonough, 2005;Plank & Jordan, 2001). For example, counselors shape a school's college-going culture (McDonough, 1997), aid in the cultivation of college aspirations, usher students through the academic preparation necessary to succeed in college (Abrego & Gonzales, 2010;Plank & Jordan, 2001), and enhance students' social capital by facilitating access to college-going information (Bryan et al., 2011;Robinson & Roksa, 2016;Wolniak & Engberg, 2007). They communicate directly with colleges about potential matriculants (Hill, 2008), assist with admissions and financial aid applications (Hill, 2008;Poynton & Lapan, 2017), and empower marginalized students (Hipolito-Delgado & Lee, 2007;Padilla, 2013). Although school counselors have the potential to play an essential role in college-going processes, they often lack the preparation to support students. For example, Savitz-Romer (2012) documented that practicing school counselors felt unprepared to support students in the college-going process: They recounted that their professional preparation programs maintained a predominantly clinical focus, did not prepare them for the complexity of working in \"urban\" and under-resourced schools, and did not offer coursework in college readiness (p. 107). Savitz-Romer (2015) also argued that current school counselors receive insufficient in-service professional development and support from their schools or districts. Furthermore, White school counselors, who still comprise the majority of counselors in schools today (College Board Advocacy & Policy Center, 2012), reported feeling unprepared to support the college-going processes of African American students in particular (Harris et al., 2016). In response to evidence from the field, accrediting bodies have strengthened language around preparation for college and career readiness (Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Access to School Counselors and College-Going Information", "text": "Access to counselors and information about college is not distributed equitably. Systemic inequities persist concerning access to college counseling, college preparatory curricula, postsecondary social connections, college visits, and college recruiters (Venezia, 2005). Access to college counseling is inequitable across schools and districts. For example, students who attend private schools enjoy greater access to collegegoing information than those who attend public schools, due in large part to caseload differences (Cholewa et al., 2015;Clinedinst, 2015). Students who attend schools with larger populations of low-income students also have less access to college-focused school counselors relative to schools with larger high-income and White student populations (Jacquette & Salazar, 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Impact on College-Going Behaviors", "text": "Existing research on the impact of school counselors on college-going behaviors varies to some degree. Cholewa and colleagues (2015) found that underrepresented students, including African American and first-generation students, were more likely than White and continuing-generation students to report that counselors had the most influence on their thinking about postsecondary education. Research also suggests that students who interacted with a school-based college counselor were more likely to aspire to attend college (S\u00e1enz et al., 2018), receive the information they needed to pay for college (Ballysingh, 2016), apply to college (Bryan et al., 2011;McDonough, 2005;Poynton & Lapan, 2017;Robinson & Roksa, 2016), and enroll in college (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014). What's more, visiting with a counselor earlier and more frequently in one's high school career may increase students' probability of applying to a 4-year institution (Ballysingh et al., in press;Bryan et al., 2011Bryan et al., , 2017Robinson & Roksa, 2016). Attending a high school with stronger counseling norms also helped predict higher college-going rates to 4-year institutions (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014). Finally, low-income students who met with school counselors were more likely to enroll in affordable 4-year colleges, persist once enrolled, and graduate (Castleman & Goodman, 2017). Other research has produced more contradictory findings. School counselors have been found to act as gatekeepers who dispense or withhold information, dissuade certain students from pursuing college, or direct them toward specific institutional types and away from others (Ballysingh, 2019;Gonzalez et al., 2003;Rosenbaum et al., 1996;Welton & Mart\u00ednez, 2014). As a result, underrepresented students may be less likely to turn to school counselors for information about or for help with college-going processes (G\u00e1ndara, 2002;Holland, 2015;Person & Rosenbaum, 2006). For some underrepresented students who do visit a counselor about college, there is evidence they are less likely to apply to college (Ballysingh et al., in press;Bryan et al., 2011;Farmer-Hinton & Adams, 2006;Gast, 2016). Similarly, interacting with a counselor may be positively related to college enrollment for Latinas but not Latinos, implicating complex gender dynamics and outcomes for one of the most underrepresented groups in higher education (Zarate & Gallimore, 2005). Given the complexity of college opportunity structures, school counselors' role as school leaders (American School Counselor Association [ASCA], 2012), and their power as institutional agents who are well-positioned to support or neglect students, this study seeks to further illuminate our understanding of these complex processes."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Sample", "text": "For this study, we used secure data from the HSLS:2009. The data set was obtained from NCES after a data license was approved. HSLS:2009 comprises a nationally representative sample of students who were in ninth grade in 2009 and follows them through and out of high school to enable researchers to study student high school and postsecondary trajectories and the factors that shape them (Ingels et al., 2015). Engberg and Gilbert (2014) also used this data set, but used school-level data from only the base year (2009); these were the only data available at that time. In contrast, our analyses relied on more recent data collected in spring 2012, when most students would have been in their junior year of high school, and fall 2013, when most of the students had graduated from high school and their transcripts could be collected. The 2013 update also asked students about their postsecondary activities, including whether they were enrolled in college (Ingels et al., 2015). Our analytic sample included approximately 900 high schools that participated in the 2013 data collection and had complete data on the dependent variables and indicators. On average, the high schools included in the study had 1,200 students, 3.5 full-time school counselors, and 0.5 part-time counselors. Disaggregating these figures further, we see that schools at the 25th percentile had approximately 530 students and two full-time counselors, schools at the 50th percentile had 1,100 students and three full-time counselors, and schools at the 75th percentile had 1,700 students, five full-time counselors, and one part-time counselor. In terms of school size, 30% of schools fell into the bottom quartile, 24% were in the second quartile, 23% were in the third quartile, and 23% were in the top quartile. Almost 40% of the schools in the sample were in the South, 17% were in the Northeast, 27% were in the Midwest, and just under 17% were in the West. All states are represented in the sample, but NCES oversampled schools from California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington to produce state-representative samples. No weights were applied in the analysis because there is no school-level weight past the base year, and we did not use base-year data in this analysis. As a result, the final sample of schools cannot be considered nationally representative. Tables 1 and 2 provide descriptive statistics for schools in the sample, including indicators of the normality (skewness and kurtosis) of the two dependent variables."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Indicators. Working with the original COS framework, we incorporated additional variables into our analysis that were not captured in the base year but were collected in 2012 and 2013. We measured school counseling norms using the same three school-level variables used in the original analysis: (a) Whether college is the counselors' primary goal, (b) whether school counselors spend more than 20% of their time on college counseling, and (c) whether school counselors' caseload is higher than the load recommended by the ASCA of 250 students per counselor (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014). We also added a fourth variable: Whether the school had designated a counselor to help students with college applications. We measured school counseling resources with additional variables selected from six broad categories relating to the ways the literature suggests that schools and counselors can support students' college going and that extend Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) work. Those categories were as follows: (a) support for financing college (whether the school assists students with completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); whether the school provides a computer to complete the FAFSA), (b) support for taking a college entrance exam (whether the school assists with college entry exams), (c) school contact with colleges (whether the school receives feedback from colleges on the need for remediation with students), (d) support for a college-going culture (whether it offers any college preparatory programs, such as gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduate programs [GEAR UP] or advancement via individual determination [AVID]), (e) college preparatory courses (whether students can take dual-credit courses), and (f) school dissemination of college-going information (whether the school holds or participates in college fairs). We limited the total number of indicators to 11 to mitigate concerns relating to statistical power (Dziak et al., 2014). We chose these specific variables because of their relatively high variance within each category, which enhances the model's ability to differentiate among schools and classes. Covariates. We used the same covariates as Engberg and Gilbert (2014) and added several new ones. Replicate covariates include the percentage of students receiving free and reduced lunch, school control (public vs. private) and type (the reference group was traditional public school vs. charter, school with a special program, career and technical education [CTE]-focused school, and alternative school), and the percentage of seniors in 2013 who took advanced placement (AP) courses. Original covariates also included two composite measures created by NCES from items completed by school administrators. One addressed school problems (a variable created from the following items: student tardiness, absenteeism, cutting class, dropping out of school, apathy toward school, lack of parental involvement, students coming to school unprepared to learn, poor student health, and a lack of resources and materials for the teachers) and a second considered school climate (a variable created from the following items: physical conflict between students, robbery or theft, vandalism, student use of illegal drugs while at school, student use of alcohol while at school, drugs being sold near or on school grounds, student possession of weapons, physical abuse of teachers, student racial tensions, cyberbullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, student in-class misbehavior, student acts of disrespect for teachers, and student gang activity; Ingels et al., 2015). Finally, we included school urbanicity (the reference category was suburban vs. urban, town, and rural). We followed Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) recommendation to control for schools' average composite scholastic aptitude test and American college testing scores for the 2013 graduating class. We also added as a covariate their dependent variable, the percentage of seniors in 2010-2011 who enrolled in a bachelor's degree program. Distal outcomes. We included two distal outcomes in the model: The percentage of students who graduated with a regular diploma in spring 2013 and the percentage of students who enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in fall 2013. We created the distal outcomes by aggregating the number of students in each category, as reported in the 2013 follow-up, to create a percentage at the school level."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "Latent class analysis (LCA) is a person-centered or unitcentered approach that enables us to test for a single pattern or mixture of patterns (latent classes) within a distribution (Bowers & Sprott, 2012;Goodman, 2002). We used the three-step approach to LCA (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2014Masyn, 2013;Vermunt, 2010) in which the measurement or class model is estimated together with the relationship among the classes, covariates, and distal outcomes. We tested the model using Mplus Version 7 and the R3STEP and BCH functions to perform the analysis of covariates and the distal outcomes (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2014;Nylund-Gibson et al., 2019). The estimation process is iterative and lets the researcher compare model fit, interpretability, and classification quality. Model fit for the number of latent classes is assessed using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC;Nylund et al., 2007) and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) adjusted likelihood test (Jung & Wickrama, 2008). The model with the smaller BIC value would be considered the one that best balances model fit and parsimony (Collins & Lanza, 2010). The LMR is also used to compare nested or neighboring models (k \u00c0 1 and k class models). Finally, higher entropy values (i.e., approaching 1) indicate less classification error and better latent class separation (Collins & Lanza, 2010). We used full information maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus to impute missing data among the covariates (Cox et al., 2014;Graham et al., 2003). We did not include in the analysis cases with missing data on the indicators or the distal outcomes, but this only accounted for approximately 30 cases. The imputation included the covariates only."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Typology of Schools", "text": "We estimated up to the five-class model (see Table 3) and then used the LMR test and BIC to select the three-class model as the best fit. The three-class model had the following fit statistics: BIC \u00bc 10,839.84, adjusted BIC \u00bc 10,728.69, a negative log-likelihood of 5,300.61, LMR \u00bc 89.00, p \u00bc .00, and an entropy of .70. Table 4 presents the average latent class probabilities for the most likely class membership and indicates good class structure with some slight overlap for Classes 2 and 3. Using the results depicted in Table 5, we identified three classes of schools that were somewhat different from Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) classes of schools. Schools in Class 1, which we labeled \"norm-driven,\" had strong norms but relatively weaker resources. They were the most likely to have school counselors reporting college as their primary goal and were the least likely to have caseloads exceeding 250:1. They also were the most likely to have school counselors who spent at least 20% of their time on college going and to have a counselor designated for college applications. Norm-driven schools, however, were less likely to offer college-going resources and were the least likely to offer students the opportunity to take dual-credit courses, offer a college preparatory program, hold or participate in college fairs, or receive feedback from colleges regarding the need for student remediation. They were somewhat more likely than \"divergent\" schools to assist with FAFSA applications (though they were still unlikely to do so) and to assist with college entrance exams. Just over   9% of schools fell into this category, making it the smallest. The norm-driven schools were not similar to any of Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) classes. Schools in Class 2, which we labeled \"resource-rich,\" had relatively weak norms but were quite likely to offer students several college-going resources. Schools in this class were as likely as not to report their counselors' primary goal was college going and were less likely to do so than schools in the other two classes. They were highly likely to have school counselors with caseloads above the ASCA recommendation of 250:1. They also were relatively unlikely to have school counselors who spent more than 20% of their time on college going (and less likely than schools in the other two classes) or to have a counselor designated to work on college applications. In terms of resources, resource-rich schools were very likely to offer students assistance to complete the FAFSA, to hold or participate in college fairs, and to help with college entrance exams. They also were more likely than not to allow their students to take courses at a 4-year college and were the most likely to offer a college preparatory program such as AVID or GEAR UP. Finally, there was an even chance they received feedback from colleges on students' need for remediation. Most schools (63.2%) fell into this category. These schools were most similar to Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) \"emergent\" schools, which had relatively weak norms but offered several useful resources to students. Finally, schools in Class 3, which we labeled \"divergent,\" had relatively weak college-going norms and were the least likely to provide access to college-going resources. Divergent schools were more likely than not to have school counselors whose primary goal was college going, although they were still less likely than norm-driven schools to do so. Divergent schools were very likely to have counselors with caseloads exceeding the recommended 250:1. They were somewhat unlikely to have school counselors spend more than 20% of their time on college going and were very unlikely to have a counselor designated for college application completion. These schools also were unlikely to provide access to college-going resources, including assistance with the FAFSA application, to provide college preparatory programs, or to receive feedback from colleges regarding remediation needs for students. Divergent schools were the least likely to assist with college entrance exams, although the probabilities were still very high. Finally, divergent schools were the most likely to allow students to take courses in a dual-enrollment program. Of the schools, 27.2% fell into this category. Schools in this class are somewhat similar to Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) \"divergent\" schools."}, {"section_title": "Predictors of Class Membership", "text": "Schools in the three classes were significantly different in terms of the types of students most likely to attend them and the contexts in which they were embedded (see Table 6). Schools with larger proportions of students receiving free and reduced lunch were 8% less likely to be in the norm-driven class and 5% less likely to be divergent relative to schools in the resource-rich class, the reference group. Norm-driven schools were 89% less likely to be urban schools compared to suburban schools. In terms of school type, norm-driven schools were more than 100 times more likely to be CTE- focused and 58 times as likely to be an alternative school relative to a traditional school."}, {"section_title": "Explaining Distal Outcomes", "text": "The distal outcomes yielded several significant relationships (see Table 7). Resource-rich schools had significantly lower proportions of students graduate from high school with a regular diploma (75.38%) relative to divergent (83.33%) and norm-driven (87.13%) schools, although the difference between the divergent and norm-driven schools was not significant. Significantly lower percentages of students at resourcerich schools (17.23%) enrolled in bachelor's programs relative to those at divergent (31.0%) and norm-driven (44.97%) schools."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings provide additional evidence for the validity and utility of Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) COS framework and the importance of school counselors as key institutional agents in college-going processes. As our results suggest, the original framework comprising counseling norms and resources distinguishes three types of high schools, and these types are related to the variability in high school graduation rates and collegegoing behaviors. The classes that emerged from our analyses were somewhat different from the classes Engberg and Gilbert (2014) found. Both current and preceding analyses uncovered a \"divergent\" class that offered students neither strong counseling norms nor resources, but our divergent class comprised different schools. In particular, we found divergent schools were more likely to be public and serve proportionately fewer low-income students. This finding is inconsistent with prior literature that suggested schools serving students from families with higher socioeconomic statuses benefit from better counseling resources. Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) second class of schools was labeled \"emergent\" because they held some college-going norms and offered some resources; however, we did not find this class. Instead, we found a class of schools with relatively strong norms but few resources (\"norm-driven\") and a class of schools with relatively weak norms but more resources (\"resource-rich\"). We also did not find a class of schools similar to their \"convergent\" class, which had relatively strong norms and more resources. Three key explanations might account for the discrepancies between the school classes we found and those set forth by Engberg and Gilbert (2014). First, using the three-step approach to estimate our model may have produced more accurate (e.g., less class-shifting) results than if we had estimated classes separately from the covariate and the distal outcomes (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2014Masyn, 2013;Vermunt, 2010). Second, because we used a more recent version of the HSLS:09, we were able to include additional indicators and covariates, and we were able to incorporate distal outcomes for the students who experienced the resources and norms we measured. This difference is particularly significant in the case of the class indicators, which are instrumental in the formation of the classes. A third and final potential explanation for our differential results is that the schools in our analytic sample may have been somewhat different from those in Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) analysis. Although the data set and most of the schools included in our analysis were the same as in the original analysis, our final sample may have been somewhat different because we excluded approximately 30 cases that lacked complete data for the indicators and distal outcomes and because the variables we utilized were measured more recently. In other words, the schools themselves may have changed between 2009 and 2012. As an example, schools may have made changes to their resources and norms in response to policy changes at the federal or state levels, or they may have made budget cuts or changes to college-related programming in response to the financial crisis and recession. A critical follow-up question pertains to what these new indicators tell us about how schools structure college-going opportunities that we did not learn from the original Engberg and Gilbert's (2014) analysis. On their own, the additional indicators allow for further differentiation among schools because they comprise new dimensions along which schools can vary. Moreover, when we examine the content of the new indicators, we see that they are likely to differentiate among schools with an eye toward equity. Beginning with counseling norms, a school designating a counselor for college application helps to address the challenges of applying to college (Cabrera & La Nasa, 2001;Hill, 2008;McDonough, 2005;Poynton & Lapan, 2017) by attempting to provide the social capital needed to navigate the process at school (Ballysingh et al., in press;Bryan et al., 2011;Robinson & Roksa, 2016;Wolniak & Engberg, 2007). Unfortunately, but perhaps not surprisingly, our results suggest that norm-driven schools, which are most likely to have a counselor designated for college applications, serve the lowest proportions of low-income students, on average, of all three school types. In terms of the resources that schools offer students, our addition of the variable measuring whether schools offer a college preparatory program such as Upward Bound focuses explicitly on underrepresented students because they are the target recipients of these programs. We found these programs most likely to be offered in the resource-rich class of schools, which have the highest proportion of low-income students relative to the other two classes. Finally, whether schools receive feedback about the need for remediation among students speaks specifically to those students who struggle academically and socially when they arrive in college. Research suggests that marginalized students are more likely to struggle in the transition to college and to require academic remediation (e.g., Howell, 2011). The schools that are most likely to receive feedback about remediation are most likely to be in the resource-rich class, which has the highest proportion of lowincome students, the lowest percentage of students taking AP courses, and the lowest percentage of previous graduates enrolling in higher education. This finding suggests that the resource-rich schools recognize their students have the steepest hill to climb when it comes to learning about and applying to college, and they offer resources to level the playing field. At the same time, resource-rich schools do not have strong norms and, therefore, may not be able to dedicate the necessary time to college-going due to high school counselor caseloads, may have competing counseling priorities, and may have school counselors who lack professional preparation focused on fostering college readiness (Savitz-Romer, 2012). The resource-rich schools recognize their students have the steepest hill to climb when it comes to learning about and applying to college, and they offer resources to level the playing field. At the same time, resource-rich schools do not have strong norms and, therefore, may not be able to dedicate the necessary time to college going due to high school counselor caseloads. This study also adds to our empirical understanding of how schools moderate the college-going process by further documenting how counseling varies systematically across schools. Previous research has pointed to the inequitable distribution of school counselors and other college-going resources (Engberg & Gilbert, 2014;Engberg & Wolniak, 2010Hill, 2008;McKillip et al., 2012;Poynton & Lapan, 2017;Robinson & Roksa, 2016). Our findings demonstrate that schools serving proportionally more low-income students have both weaker college-going norms and stronger resources. Schools with strong norms were more likely to serve socioeconomically privileged students, less likely to be in urban areas, less likely to have a CTE program, and less likely to be an alternative school. Finally, our results also speak to how schools' opportunity structures are related to a student's high school and collegegoing behaviors. The results of our analysis suggest that schools with the most robust norms-but not resources-had the highest proportions of regular high school graduates and students enrolling in 4-year colleges. Conversely, schools with the most robust resources but the weakest norms had the lowest proportions of high school graduates and students enrolling in 4-year colleges. For both of these outcomes, the divergent schools, which had weak resources and weak norms, were in the middle. This finding may say more about the students they serve (fewer low-income students and more high-achieving students) than their resources and norms, but that is only speculation."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Policy and Practice", "text": "Several implications for policy and school counselor practice emerged from our findings. Schools that serve marginalized students must be equipped with financial resources to support their caseloads. However, professionals within schools must collectively embrace the norms that support a school-wide college-going culture. Norms underpin a high school's habitus around college-going that can make the difference between resource allocation and college matriculation. Too often, school counselors function as gatekeepers who decide which students should pursue postsecondary education and at which institutional type. Schools that serve marginalized students must be equipped with financial resources to support their caseloads. However, professionals within schools must collectively embrace the norms that support a school-wide college-going culture. Norms underpin a high school's habitus around college going that can make the difference between resource allocation and college matriculation. Furthermore, school counselors often selectively withhold or dispense college-going information as they deem fit (Acevedo-Gil, 2019; Ballysingh, 2019;Martinez & Huerta, 2018;Welton & Mart\u00ednez, 2014). Many likewise do not cultivate college-going norms in schools populated with lowincome students. School counselors could lead to systemic change (Parikh et al., 2011) if preservice professional preparation required courses in critical consciousness, in college-going and college access (Savitz-Romer, 2012), and cultural competence (Harris et al., 2016;Welton & Mart\u00ednez, 2014). School counselors also need support in using school data to improve decision making (ASCA, 2016) and to increase their collaboration with multiple internal and external school stakeholders (ASCA, 2019;Betters-Bubon & Schultz, 2018). One way to better develop K-12 school counselors who are informed about college readiness and cultivate robust college-going cultures could be through collaboration between graduate programs in school counseling and higher education. Shared coursework between higher education and counseling students could promise mutual benefits for both fields. Indeed, topics such as college access, inequality, and postsecondary readiness may be best addressed through a P-16 and interdisciplinary lens. Regardless of training norms, school counselors cannot do this work alone; they require support from their schools. Of the four norms included in our model, two falls under the purview of schools, including (a) designating a school counselor to help students with college applications and (b) ensuring a studentto-school-counselor ratio that meets ASCA guidelines. District and school leaders must ensure that schools, particularly those that serve marginalized students, have enough school counselors to address students' multiple needs and that those counselors have both the preparation and time to focus on college-going. Finally, research suggests that school counselors, particularly those working in urban schools and with African American students (Harris et al., 2016), lack the preparation to support the college-going needs of marginalized students (Savitz-Romer, 2012). We therefore recommend that districts invest in ongoing training and support so that inservice school counselors can learn how to promote their students' college-going aspirations. Given the financial climate of many public schools and the federal government's decreased emphasis on college-going (Kreighbaum, 2017), districts and schools may consider leveraging external partnerships to meet their college-going goals. For example, the Houston Independent School District and neighboring districts have partnered with the nonprofit EMERGE to ensure high school campuses have dedicated college counselors (https://www.emergefellowship.org/). Funded by local foundations, EMERGE enhances district capacity to provide the necessary resources for college going and works to cultivate college-going norms that encourage marginalized but high-achieving students to consider even the most selective institutions of higher education. Various organizations fill this role in other geographic contexts and likely will continue to be instrumental partners to improve college-going norms and resources across schools and districts. Finally, schools can also improve college-going norms in ways that do not require additional financial resources. They can adopt proactive, collaborative, asset-based, critically conscious, and culturally responsive approaches to overcoming obstacles and promoting college readiness for marginalized students. Schools can seek to hire counselors who have participated in cultural immersion through their educational certification (Shannonhouse et al., 2018), and they can cultivate stronger and more positive relationships with families and community leaders that transcend traditional academic preparedness (Ozuna et al., 2016;Yamamura et al., 2010). Last, input from community stakeholders can help schools and districts expand college readiness definitions to encompass collective rather than individual responsibility by tapping into the cultural wealth inherent within communities (Yamamura et al., 2010). Schools can also improve college-going norms in ways that do not require additional financial resources. They can adopt proactive, collaborative, asset-based, critically conscious, and culturally responsive approaches to overcoming obstacles and promoting college readiness for marginalized students."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Research", "text": "As with any research, this study had its limitations. First, it is a single, school-level analysis, rather than a two-level analysis. For this reason, the typology can only explain school-level student outcomes rather than within-school variability in achievement and graduation outcomes. Future research could use a two-level approach to allow for the estimation of a typology of college-going students and COSs and to illuminate how well different school types serve different students. Second, the typology only describes school-level resources and norms and cannot describe within-school variability regarding how resources are distributed and how norms are put into practice. Future research might apply the typology to identify schools for more in-depth, qualitative inquiry regarding how resources and norms manifest in practice. The typology also only considers structures and norms. Although necessary for creating opportunities for students, research suggests they are insufficient (e.g., McDonough, 1997). Missing from this analysis are school counselors' attitudes about students they are assigned to support and students' attitudes toward counselors and college. Regarding the outcomes we examined based on Engberg and Gilbert's 2014 study, our focus on enrollment may have led us to miss a critical, intermediate outcome: applying to college. As Robinson and Roksa (2016) noted, numerous intervening variables explain why students accepted to college ultimately may not enroll, and college counselors have the most impact on whether students apply to college. Another limitation was that, although HSLS:09 is a nationally representative data set at the student level, it is not nationally representative at the school level beyond the base year. For this reason, we are limited in our ability to generalize. Finally, because this study uses a correlational design, we cannot attribute causality to the typology. Specifically, we cannot report with certainty that attending one type of school will lead to better student outcomes because the design does not allow us to untangle whether resources and norms are producing specific outcomes, or whether certain outcomes have led to the development and deployment of certain resources and norms."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests", "text": "The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}]
