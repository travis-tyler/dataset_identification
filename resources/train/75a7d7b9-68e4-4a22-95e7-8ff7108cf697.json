It may cause a variety of functional and structural changes in human brain [2, 3] and is associated with greater amyloid-(A ) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles than 3 [4] . It already shows a subtle decline in episodic memory many years before the development of dementia [5] . As there is no effective treatment of AD now, looking for sensitive and reliable biomarkers in earliest stages is very important.\nImaging technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offered an opportunity to detect the effects of gene on the brain function by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD). Nowadays, emerging computational tools made it possible to study brain networks instead of single brain region in a stereo vision. Specific cortical regions which are spatially separated from brain functional networks to complete cognitive task [6] and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD target specific large-scale brain networks [7] . It has been suggested that two resting-state networks (RSNs), salience network (SN) and the default mode network (DMN) [8] , where the atrophy caused by dementia is largely concentrated, play an essential role in AD. A few previous studies have suggested ApoE 4 allele may affect the activity of DMN and SN [9] [10] [11] .\nPrevious studies mainly examined resting-state fMRI activities in the frequency between 0 and 0.08 Hz as this frequency band was thought to be associated with neuronal fluctuations [12] , but more and more researchers suggested that functional connectivity may be frequency specific [13] . Complex activities in human brain produce different neuronal firing rate; different frequency may correspond to different cognitive courses [14] . A fMRI combined electroencephalography (EEG) study suggested that each resting-state network corresponds to a specific frequency rhythm [15] . Values are mean \u00b1 standard deviation or numbers of participants. The differences in demographics and neuropsychological scores between the two groups were tested for significance with two-sample -tests. The value for gender distribution in the two groups was obtained using a Chi-square test. * * * < 0.01.\nMMSE, Mini-Mental Status Examination; RAVLT, Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test.\nAlthough abnormal resting-state networks were observed in both normal aging and ApoE 4 carriers [9, [16] [17] [18] , whether the abnormalities are frequency specific is still unknown. Han et al. used 0.027 Hz as dividing level of the low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and found that the ALFF abnormalities showed disparate spatial patterns in each frequency band [19] . Many studies also have reported the fMRI signals at both lower and higher frequencies contain important physiological significance; they may lose information if they are considered as a whole [20, 21] .\nIn the present study, we aimed to utilize resting-state fMRI to examine the ApoE 4 allele effects on functional connectivity of DMN and SN. Considering the frequency specific effects of functional connectivity, we decomposed the brain network time courses into two bands: 0.01-0.027 Hz and 0.027-0.08 Hz. We sought to determine (1) whether the ApoE 4 carriers show abnormal resting-state network functional connectivity; (2) whether the functional connectivity abnormalities are frequency specific."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects.", "text": "All data used in this current study were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

The first 10 volumes of the rest scans of each subject were removed for the signal equilibrium and for subject's adaptation to the scanning noise.

We followed the literature [23] to define seed regions of interest (ROI) of the DMN and SN; 15 ROIs were derived as a 6 mm sphere around the coordinates in MNI space (Table 2) . Within the DMN, nine regions were investigated: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left lateral parietal (lLP), right lateral parietal (rLP), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left inferior temporal (liTmp), right inferior temporal (riTmp), medial thalamus (mdThal), left posterior cerebellum (lpCBLM), and right posterior cerebellum (rpCBLM).

Figure 1 shows the RSNs ROIs and the two-sample -test results of the connectivity maps of the two networks in each frequency band, respectively. We found some functional connectivities were sensitive to specific frequency band. In the DMN, the functional connectivity between the PCC and lLP, as well as the liTmp and rpCBLM connectivity, showed no significant group differences in the typical frequency band of 0.01-0.08 Hz but significant differences in the lower frequency band of 0.01-0.027 Hz (Table 3 ).

Generally, the DMN functional connectivities were decreased while the SN connectivities were increased in the ApoE 4 carriers compared with noncarriers. Importantly, we found that many Possession of 4 allele disrupts the cognition, especially episodic memory at an early time [24] . We also found a significant decline of the general cognitive ability and episodic memory in 4 carriers, which illustrated that the 4 allele may affect the cognition long before the conversion to AD. More and more studies proved that brain cognitive functions were performed on the base of specific resting-state networks such as DMN and SN [25] . RSNs and their functional connectivity patterns have already shown a potential power of disease diagnosis and prediction [10, 26] .\nDMN and SN abnormalities were widely found in AD studies, implying that early detection of RSNs changes can offer opportunities to distinguish AD patients from healthy people in early stage [27, 28] . Comparing to the 4 noncarriers, our results showed that several functional connectivities in DMN, such as PCC-lLP connectivity, were significantly reduced in the 4 carriers. Meanwhile, the SN showed widely increased functional connectivity between regions like lPG-ACC and rSG-ACC. These changing trends of functional connectivity we found in the 4 carriers were consistent with the results of early AD [8, 29] . Functional connectivity describes the degree of the dynamic and synchronized oscillations between brain regions. These imaging biomarkers may help a better understanding of early disease pathogenesis and measuring genetic effects on brain, indicated by the significant correlations between the frequency specific functional connectivity and RAVLT scores in our results.\nExploring the high risk genotypes of diseases like AD may reveal the early disease-causing effects. With the development of novel algorithms and theories, nowadays we can correlate the neuroimaging data with the genetic data and discover how genotype affecting brain function and connectivity just as the phonotype, and to identify risks for neurological and psychiatric diseases [30] . The frequency characteristics of functional connectivity may be distinct for different brain networks [13] . The typical range of 0.01-0.08 Hz has its limitations. More and more researches indicate that the fMRI signals contain important physiological significance at specific frequency bands [21, 31, 32] . Moreover, these studies suggested that different frequency bands may play different role in the low-frequency fluctuations [33] . It is important to note that each frequency bands of neuronal oscillations are produced by different oscillators with distinct physiological functions and properties [6] .\nIn the current study, we took advantages of the frequency characteristics of the resting-state fMRI signals to investigate the 4 allele effects on the DMN and SN. We found that some functional connectivities were not sensitive to the typical frequency band of 0.01-0.08 Hz, but when we segmented the frequency band into 0.01-0.027 Hz and 0.027-0.08 Hz group differences emerged. The results indicated that the abnormalities of brain functional connectivity in ApoE 4 carriers are associated with the choice of specific frequency bands. Our result supported that the RSNs functional connectivity can be modulated by frequency band. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the frequency specific effect of the ApoE 4 allele on the RSNs functional connectivity.\nThere are also some limitations in our study. Although we found a frequency specific effect on the RSNs functional connectivity, the nature of these effects remains unclear. Future studies are necessary to investigate the physiological significance of the frequency specific effects."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, we used genetic neuroimaging methods and found alterations of both DMN and SN functional connectivity in ApoE 4 allele carriers.
