Rather, individuals are found forming groups, the size of which depends on many factors (Bonabeau et al., 1999) . For instance, environmental gradients in habitat quality can generate variations in density due to differences in carrying capacity (Doebeli and Dieckmann, 2003; Kirkpatrick and Barton 1997) . The benefi ts of aggregation include reduction of predation rates (Morgan, 1988) , increased foraging effi ciency (Mogilner et al., 2003) , and reproduction success (Warburton and Lazarus 1991) , to mention just a few. In any case, the tendency to crowd is a widespread pattern of nature, and has interested ecologists for a long time (e.g., Bonabeau et al., 1999; Flierl et al., 1999; Gueron and Levin, 1995; Higashi and Yamamura, 1993; Niwa, 1994 Niwa, , 1996 Okubo, 1986; Okubo and Levins, 2001 ).\nAny given species has an associated probability distribution that summarizes the spectrum of abundances attained at different locations (e.g. Bonabeau et al., 1999 , McGill et al. 2007 . A comprehensive description of the statistical pattern of local abundances is key for understanding the evolution of species crowdedness (Niwa, 1994; Okubo, 1986) . For instance, the existence of a typical density may suggest that such a density yields an optimal balance between the cost of living closer to conspecifics, and the benefit of assuring reproductive success (Bonabeau et al., 1999; Higashi and Yamamura, 1993) . This optimality notion, however, becomes useless when we attempt to describe the large array of populations that comprise the full geographic extent of a species (Niwa, 1996 , 1998 , 2004 , Pascual et al., 2002 Roy et al., 2003) . This occurs because local densities may vary so widely from place to place that the very notion of a typical density becomes problematic. Furthermore, when the maximum density at a few locations is large, as compared to the background abundance, the resulting probability distribution may exhibit a long tail, a possibility that has been overlooked in most population studies (Bonabeau et al., 1999) .\nIn fact, it has been recently argued that several quantities of ecological interest may present a power-law form in frequency or probability distributions (e.g., Marquet et al., 2005; Niwa, 2003) .\nIn this report we are concerned with the patterns of variation in the local abundance observed across the geographical range of species. Questions about the distribution of ecological attributes across geographic space have usually been addressed in the context of macroecological theory (e.g., Brown, 1995; Gaston and Blackburn, 2000; Marquet 2002; Maurer, 1999) by using average density, and thus implicitly assuming that the probability distributions describing them possess a characteristic scale (i.e., a typical density) and shorttails. Nevertheless, a growing amount of evidence suggests that this may not always be the case, and that long-tailed abundance distributions could be more the rule than the exception in nature (Bonabeau et al., 1999; Gueron and Levin 1995; Higashi and Yamamura 1993; Marquet 2000; Marquet et al., 2005; Sornette, 2000; Stauffer 2000) . This postulate is far from trivial, because some long-tailed distributions may show divergence in one or more of its statistical moments. In particular, for the case of power-law distributions, unbounded variance can take place when the second and upper moments diverge. Sometimes even the fi rst moment diverges, and a typical size value and characteristic scale is absent (Sornette, 2000; Stanley, 1987) .\nFrom a methodological point of view, it is always convenient to explore the statistical distribution of abundances and check whether or not they present signatures of power-law. Besides pure methodological interest, power-law distributions are also important from a more theoretical perspective. There is growing evidence that some ecological scaling may be the outcome of an underlying critical organization, either in the form of self-organized criticality or as found in second order phase transitions (Bonabeau at al., 1999; Keitt and Marquet, 1996; Keitt and Stanley, 1998; Milne et al., 1996; Niwa, 2003; Pascual et al., 2002; Rhodes et al., 1997; Roy et al., 2003) . This is an interesting conjecture, because critical scaling behavior is connected to the notion of universality classes, a powerful concept used in statistical physics to systematically compare and recognize as similar (based on the value of their critical exponents), systems that would otherwise be considered as different, if the attention were put in the nature of their components or microscopic details (Bonabeau and Dagorn 1995; Mantegna & Stanley, 2000; Stanley, 1995; Stanley et al., 2000; Vicsek, 2001; Yeomans 1992) . More specifi cally, the term universality is used by physicists to highlight the idea that near a critical point of organization (i.e., a continuous phase transition), systems composed of multiple elements show spontaneous order that is not attributable to the details of the individual particles that constitute the system, or the specifi c details of the rules that govern the relationships among them. Rather, other macroscopic features of the system become relevant, such as its dimensionality (Gisiger, 2001) . Thus, universality complies with the very defi nition of a complex systems.\nOur study system will be a set of species taken from the North American breeding bird survey. This system is ideally suited for this type of analyses as it represents one of the few continental-scale censuses available for a large ensemble of species. We hypothesize that conspecific breeding bird individuals self-organize in space by forming aggregates in demand of suitable habitats for reproduction (Gueron and Levin, 1995; Higashi and Yamamura, 1993; Maurer, 2005; Niwa, 1994 Niwa, , 1996 . In addition, we propose testing for the existence of a specifi c type of statistical distribution, the Bose-Einstein distribution. This is a suitable null statistical distribution as it assumes that the elements that are being arranged into distinctive classes are identical. Thus, Bose-Einstein statistics (hereafter B-E) postulate that each distinguishable combination of r elements (e.g., individuals) in n groups (e.g., abundance classes) has equal probability of occurrence. The resulting probability distribution shows a truncated power-law behavior, which is in contrast to the expected exponential distribution (i.e. Gibbs-Boltzmann) that arises under the distinguishable assumption of microstates (Ijiri & Simon, 1975) . It turns out to be an appropriate null model under a neutral scenario as has been postulated by Hubbell (2001) , where individuals of different species are assumed to be equivalent on a per capita basis. Accordingly, if breeding places across the geographical range are considered a limited resource for individuals seeking to breed, an intraspecifi c B-E distribution should be verifi ed. Interestingly, and in analogy with animal behavior, particles obeying B-E distribution are believed to exert attraction on other particles, by exciting a particular energy state, producing a quantum effect named Bose-Einstein condensation (hereafter, BEC). In an ecological context, this biosocial contagion mechanism is ethologically justifi ed, and, in analogy to BEC phenomena, is expected to be responsible for producing an exponentially truncated power-law frequency distribution of local abundances, similar to those observed in other ecological aggregates (Majumdar and Sire, 1993; Mogilner et al., 2003; Rajesh and Majumdar, 2001; Takayasu et al., 1988 Takayasu et al., , 1989 Takayasu, 1989, Taylor and Taylor, 1977; Vicsek et al., 1985) . Borrowing some thermal physics jargon (Gould et al., 2006; Stanley, 1987; Yeomans, 1992) , we may say that abundance undergoes a type of phase transition from a high temperature regime (where abundance classes are occupied according to the Gibbs law, see Okubo, 1986) , to a more cooled phase (where spatial coalescence tends to favor a scale invariant occupation of abundance classes). We leave the problem of characterizing ecological phase transitions to a forthcoming report and point the interested reader to Pascual et al. (2002) , Pascual and Guichard (2005) and Roy et al. (2003) . Instead, in this report we will address the question of characterizing the frequency distribution of local abundances within the geographic range of species, and test whether universality underlies abundance scaling."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database", "text": "We analyzed the statistical distribution of local abundance across the geographical range of bird species using the North American Breeding Bird Survey database. This survey has been conducted by the United States Geological Survey since 1966 to the present, and consists of the permanent census of about 2,500 routes visited yearly by volunteer ornithologists during the breeding season (Peterjohn and Sauer, 1999) . The sampling grid has a spatial coverage extending over all the continental territory of the United States and southern Canada. In every route, ornithologists have identified resident species and obtained an estimate of their local abundance, based on visual or sound recordings. From this database, we selected a random set of 67 species whose geographical ranges were totally or mostly contained inside the boundaries of the sampling region. We used data from years 1980 to 2002, and performed our analysis on a yearly basis. Except for size effects (see below), we treated these selected species as being fundamentally equivalent, hence, we did not keep track of their specifi c taxonomic identity in the remainder of this report. However, chosen species differ in many respects, encompassing at least three orders of magnitude in body mass, overlapping in geographic extent in various degrees, differing in habitat use and diet, not to mention the many differences in abundance levels and degrees of spatial occurrence. The only similitude criteria used to select the current set of species from the whole BBS database was that they were permanent resident species, so as to avoid effects of inter-year long-distance migration on the patterns of abundance observed across space."}, {"section_title": "Power law distributions and data collapse", "text": "Power-law distributions take the form N(s)~ S -\u03b2 , where N(s) is the frequency of sites having S individuals, and \u03b2 is the power-law exponent that governs slow frequency decay (Marquet et al., 2005 , Niwa, 2003 , 2005 Stanley, 1995) . For |\u03b2|> 2 the distribution has infinite variance (Sornette, 2000) . In practical terms, infi nite variance refers to the idea that, no matter how much we increase the sampling effort, variance will always increase. For |\u03b2|> 1 the mean diverges to infi nity (Sornette, 2000) . However, empirical power-laws are necessarily truncated at a maximum cut-off value (Bonabeau et al., 1999; Chave and Levin, 2003; Niwa, 2005) , because the total number of individuals of one species is fi nite. We incorporated fi nite size effects into our analysis by assuming the ansatz\nwhere L is a term representing the size of the system under study, considered here as the total abundance of each species, while \u03b1 and \u03b3 are suitable powers used to correct system size effects. According to eq. 1, size effects are introduced by a truncation point modulated by L -\u03b3 , and a normalizing effect through L \u03b1 (Sornette, 2000; Stauffer and Aharony, 1992) . A strong fi nite size effect can create bending in the probability curve, reinforcing the B-E exponential truncation. Thus the powers coeffi cients \u03b1 and \u03b3 contain information about the intrinsic truncation present in B-E distributions and deviations generated by fi nite size effects. The latter bending effect also interferes with the expression of the power-law behavior present in B-E below the exponential cut-off. In order to remove these effects, and recover the asymptotic distributional form, we performed a fi nite size scaling (FSS) analysis (Fisher and Barber, 1972; Niwa, 2005) . First, we defi ned the scaled variables\nThen, estimates of \u03b1 and \u03b3 were obtained by data collapse (Niwa, 2003 (Niwa, , 2004 (Niwa, , 2005 . We iteratively searched the values for both parameters that placed all species frequency plots on a single curve (if it existed). Our best collapse was achieved by minimizing the mean of the two-dimensional variance (Cont and Bouchard, 2000) . To do this, we defi ned the twodimensional variance as (4) where x and y are the mean of eq. (2) and eq. (3) respectively, while \u03c3 is their standard deviation. These values were calculated on every \u03b5 i block defi ned after suitably binning the x-axis with boxes of regular size (Niwa, 2004) . The mean value of \u03b5 i was used as the quantity to be minimized, and as a measure for the goodness of fi t for data collapse (Cont and Bouchard, 2000) . The analysis outlined above was done on every species, using bird counts at the level of routes to describe the statistical behavior local abundances. We constructed histograms of abundance by the method of exponential binning, as suggested in Marquet et al. (2005) and Pueyo (2006) . Afterwards, we made the FSS analysis on a yearly basis, and acquired estimates of \u03b2 for the power-law range of the collapsed curves. The resulting time series of \u03b2 was used to investigate whether FSS was consistent over time.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 1 shows the local abundance frequency plots for all the species under analysis. We only plotted data for 2002 in order to illustrate differences among curves. It is clear that species differ in the relative frequency of different abundant classes, and degree of curvature. Besides those apparent discrepancies, it is possible to discern a power-law regime in the middle range of the plot (note the double logarithmic scale).\nFor FSS we found that minimization of the two-dimensional variance was attained at \u03b1= 0.28 and \u03b3= 0.46. Figure 2 shows the plane of numerical solutions for different combinations of both parameters. The cross mark indicates the global minimum for which data collapse was attained. Note that there are two other local minima, corresponding to values that result in a good collapse either around the cut-off region or around N(1). Using eqns. 3 and 4, we calculated the scaled variables x and y, resulting in the data collapse shown in Figure 3 . All curves collapsed well into a unique universal fi nite-size scaling curve (UFSS). These results are in qualitative agreement with similar analysis conducted on fi sh school sizes (Bonabeau and Dagorn, 1995; Bonabeau et al., 1999; Niwa 1998 Niwa , 2004 Rinaldo et al., 2002) , although exponent values were different in all cases. This similarity is worth noting, because our data resulted from processes occurring at much larger spatial and temporal scales than in those studies, and yet, results qualitatively agreed. Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of \u03b2 values for the period 1980-2002. This sequence did not show any temporal trends, but does present oscillations with a 5-6 year periodicity, suggesting that UFSS is robust over time, and that robustness may be achieved by compensating deviations around a long-term asymptotic value. Note that despite the observed fl uctuations, \u03b2 never reached values outside the region where the fi rst statistical moment is well-defi ned, suggesting that the UFSS curve has a well located theoretical mean, but its estimation will always be obscured by fl uctuations associated with the divergence of the variance.\nSo far we have provided a pure phenomenological approach that accounted for the existence of universal behavior in the system under study. It has been shown that there is an underlying truncated power-law with exponent |\u03b2|= 1.19, which is in agreement with exponents reported for avalanche-like statistics (Turcotte, 1999) . This UFSS curve can be regarded as the master curve from which every species is a particular realization that has been distorted by fi nite size effects. Thus, it is natural to ask: What are the factors responsible for such deviations? We cannot provide a comprehensive response to this question at this point. However, we can sketch out an explanation resorting to the implications of being governed by a B-E distribution, briefl y reviewed in the following paragraph.\nIn B-E formalism, the leading process is competition for empty energy states. Imagine an energy state as the amount of energy required to sustain a given number of individuals (note that in this transformation we are changing from a continuous version of energy to a discrete version, where energy is shaped into the boundaries of a single individual, therefore the analogy with quantum mechanics becomes useful). This notion assumes two things: i) an energy state is proportional to the number of organisms it can sustain and, ii) competition for energy takes place before competition among individuals. In addition, assume competition is taking place over a fi nite energy landscape, so resources are limited. Given that energy is limited, its depletion by one species not only reduces the number of new individuals that can be allowed in a given energy state, but most importantly, the number of possible energy states is also reduced. This occurs because a lesser amount of energy can be partitioned in fewer ways than a larger amount. Thus, whereas energy is exhausted, larger energy states progressively disappear, and the potential remaining energy states will only allow for a lesser number, and size, of incoming individuals. This scenario resembles the macroecological stage, where resources are known to be fi nite and species, although different in size, tend to be equivalent in the amount of energy they use within ecosystems (Brown et al., 1993; Brown, 1995) , at the cost of achieving different densities. Accordingly, it is likely that species will interfere among them by affecting the size of energy states related to the universal B-E abundance distribution, and, as a consequence, distortions are accrued on it. Figure 5 graphically explains our argument. Whether this phenomenology holds true, and concurs with observed macroecological size scaling patterns, remains to be tested.\nThe relationship between FSS and allometric scaling remains to be explored. If FSS in abundance could be linked to energetic constraints through body mass, it would pose an interesting scenario, in which one set of scaling rules may deviate or even suppress the validity of another. We considered only two species, Sp 1 and Sp 2 with different body sizes, such that m 1 < m 2 . These species attempt to use energy by partitioning E into i-1 energy states e i within which individuals will reside forming groups of size g i = e i /m i . Species Sp 1 has w(N,i) forms to combine N individuals into i -t equally sized partitions. This is represented in (b) by groups of size g 1 , g 2 and g 4 , indicated by big white squares. Small squares represent individuals whose size m i allows them to fi t into g i . In (c) we repeat the process of partitioning for species Sp 2 , twice as large as Sp 1 . For any one species, all possible combinations between N and i, are represented in (d) as the product between all possible g i states.\nThe solution for this generating process has been shown to have the form of a truncated power-law probability distribution (e). For an infi nite value of E, curves for Sp 1 and Sp 2 should converge. For fi nite but very large values of E, probability functions would be identical in shape, but displaced in some amount related to body size (solid versus dotted lines in (e)). In (f) we show the imaginary situation in which one species (e.g. Sp 1 ) took over a fraction of energy E Sp1 from a limited energy stick E. This leaves a reduced portion E Sp2 = E -E Sp1 of energy available to species E Sp2 for converting it into individuals. We sketch this situation in (f), by showing the displacement induced by this fi nite size constraint upon the asymptotic abundance frequency distribution of Sp 2 (i.e., change from dotted to thin solid line). The displacement may occur in any direction, depending on the size of Sp 2 . In this case we have assumed m 1 < m 2 , making a shift along the direction of arrows more likely."}]
