Farm sector net cash farm income is a measure of the proftability of farming and, hence, the ability of farmers to meet their loan obligations, inves in new machinery, remain in production, expand their operations, and provide for family living expenses. Beginning in 2010, infation-adjused farm sector net cash income rose to record highs, peaking in 2012. Much of this growth was due to commodity cash receipts, which increased 34 percent ($113.2 billion) from 2009 to 2014. This change in receipts was driven largely by higher commodity prices, refecting increased domesic demand for biofuels and increased foreign demand for agricultural commodities, as well as higher corn and soybean prices due to a drought in the Midwes and Great Plains in 2012."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Download higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 1957, 300 dpi)", "text": "Following the high incomes in 2012 and 2013, the sector's net cash farm income sarted to decline in 2014, fell more sharply in 2015, and continued to decline in 2016.

Slowing global demand, a srengthening dollar, and large inventories depressed crop as well as animal and animal product prices and contributed to the decline in 2016 net cash farm income. Incomes in 2017 and 2018 are forecas to remain near or jus below 2016 levels. From 2012 to 2016, farm sector net cash income fell 34 percent ($50.9 billion) to $97.5 billion, after adjusing for infation. This is the larges multiyear decline since the 1970s in both absolute and percentage terms.

Farms that fail to earn positive returns because of crop failure, low commodity prices, or high production coss will be more susceptible to bankruptcy. Using the mos recent data available from USDA's Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS), ERS analyzed the share of farms reporting negative farm income throughout the 10-year period 2007-16. Diferent farms tend to be surveyed in ARMS each year, but the data indicate that, in aggregate, 56 percent of all farms reported negative net cash farm income across the period, with the share increasing slightly since 2014. As expected, farm businesses (the roughly 40 percent of farms with gross cash farm income greater than $350,000 in a given year as well as farms in which the principal operator reports his/her primary occupation as farming) regisered lower rates of negative income than did farms as a whole. Across the 10 years of data, 42 percent of farm businesses reported negative income. Farms with diferent commodity specializations may fare diferently when the overall farming sector srengthens or weakens. ERS examined more detailed ARMS data to determine the farm specializations more likely to have negative farm incomes overall and to identify any apparent patterns in 2016, compared to the average across 2007-16. The data show considerable variability across farm specializations over time, compared to the average for \"all farms.\" \"Other crops or livesock\" farms, where no commodity is the dominant contributor to the total value of production, had the highes rates of negative incomes. Beef cattle farms and poultry farms had the next highes rates. Dairy farms had the lowes rate of negative incomes across all farm types. Some of the variation across specialization categories semmed from idiosyncratic trends in commodity prices-some commodities saw prices increase or decrease more than others over the sudy period. And some of the variation was attributed to diferences in farm sructure-larger operations are more likely to earn high and positive farm income than smaller operations because they are able to spread the fxed coss of machinery and other inputs over a larger amount of production. For farm businesses, the rates of negative farm income follow the same relative ranking as with all farms, though the rates were generally lower, refecting the fact that farm businesses are larger operations."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Download higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 3213, 300 dpi)", "text": "Despite the recent sharp decline in farm income, the share of farms with negative income in 2016 remained about the same as the average share in 2007-16.

Overall, the share of all farms with negative income was about 3 percentage points lower in 2016 than the 10-year average.

In the 1970s, farmers increased their borrowing to purchase land, equipment, and other inputs in order to take advantage of high commodity prices. At the same time, the economy was experiencing high infation rates and rising interes rates. High levels of debt and rising interes rates caused the farm sector's debt and interes expenses to reach record levels by 1980. In the decade that followed, commodity and farmland prices fell, and many farmers who were heavily in debt went out of business. Do recent trends in debt and interes payments sugges the farm sector may soon face another pending farm crisis? Farm sector debt has reached levels near the peak levels of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From 1994 to 2016, infation-adjused farm debt increased by 79 percent, or 3 percent per year on average. ERS forecass farm debt to increase 1 percent in 2017 and then decline 1 percent in 2018.

From 1994 to 2016, interes expenses decreased 2 percent, or 0.2 percent per year on average in real (infation-adjused) terms. However, in recent years, interes expenses have trended upward as interes rates have increased. Between 2014 and 2018, interes expenses are forecas to increase 24 percent in real terms. Interes expenses are now above their average levels but well below levels reached in the 1980s. Interes expenses in 2018 are forecas to be 9 percent above the 30-year average, 13 percent above the 10year average, but 58 percent below the peak in 1982. The debt-to-asset ratio-total farm debt divided by total farm assets-is another indicator of the fnancial health of the agricultural sector. The debt-to-asset ratio is a measure of a farm business's leverage and is considered an indicator of bankruptcy risk. Farms with a high debt-to-asset ratio are generally more highly leveraged and have less ability to cover potential fnancial liabilities through the sale of assets, leading to a greater risk of default. In the 1970s, farms borrowed heavily to expand production in response to rising commodity prices. Beginning in the early 1980s, higher interes rates, which raised borrowing coss, and lower commodity prices led to a large number of farm bankruptcies. Farm real esate, which accounts for over 80 percent of farm sector asset values, fell over 40 percent in infation-adjused value between 1981 and 1987. The high levels of farm debt combined with falling land values caused the debt-toasset ratio to spike during the mid-1980s. The high debt-to-asset ratio during this period indicates that many farmers were fnancially sressed."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Download higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 1957, 300 dpi)", "text": "In contras to the 1980s, recent decades have seen farm assets appreciate more rapidly than debt. From 1994 to 2016, farm sector assets grew in value by 110 percent, or 5 percent annually, driven by srong growth in land values up to around 2014. As a result, the farm sector's debt-to-asset ratio has fallen since the mid-1980s and reached a hisoric low in 2012. Since then, the debt-to-asset ratio has trended upward and is now above its 10-year average, though, it remains low by hisoric sandards. In 2018, the debt-to-asset ratio is forecas to remain below the 1970-2016 average. While the farm sector as a whole has a debt-to-asset level in line with hisoric norms, the aggregate satisics mask subsantial variation in leverage across commodity specializations. Data on operations specializing in cotton, corn, soybean, and poultry reveal that an increasing share of farms are forecas to be highly leveraged (a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 40 percent) between 2013 and 2018. Among these farm types, poultry operations have the greates share of operations that are fnancial vulnerable-with almos a third forecas to be highly leveraged in 2017 and 2018. In contras, less than an eighth of operations specializing in corn or soybeans will be highly leveraged.

Beginning in December 2015, the Federal Reserve changed its policy course on interes rates and began to gradually increase the Federal funds rate. If interes rates increase, farmers will pay more for new loans and for variable rate credit. Higher interes coss and lower commodity prices could make it difcult for some borrowers to service their debt, which could result in higher loan delinquency and default rates."}, {"section_title": "Embed this chart", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Download higher resolution chart (2538 pixels by 1957, 300 dpi)", "text": "The ratio of interes expenses to earnings before interes, taxes, and capital consumption (interes-to-EBITC) is a measure of a farm business's ability to pay its interes expenses on its outsanding debt out of its earnings. High interes rates and low farm income caused the interes-to-EBITC ratio to peak at 36 percent in 1983. This coincided with higher rates of farm bankruptcies and loan defaults. After 1983, the interes-to-EBITC ratio fell below the 1970-2016 average level of 16 percent and reached a low of 8 percent in 2013. Since then, falling income and rising interes rates have again caused the ratio to climb, though the 2018 forecas of 15 percent remains below the long-run average. A 15-percent EBITC means that 15 percent of net farm earnings are spent on interes payments. A recent ERS sudy examined the ability of the farm sector to repay debt by analyzing projections of the interes-to-EBITC ratio under various interes rate and cash fow assumptions. Findings show that if the current cash fow was assumed to remain consant but interes rates were assumed to gradually increase at a consensus forecas rate, the predicted interes-to-EBITC ratio would increase to about 18 percent by 2019. This indicates an increase in fnancial sress but at levels well below those during the farm crisis of the 1980s. The results of the analysis sugges the expected interes rate increases will not result in large increases in fnancial sress if cash fows remain near current levels. However, a decline in farm income could lead to greater fnancial sress. Future reductions in commodity prices or increases in farm input expenses would lower farm proftability and exacerbate debt repayment challenges. The analysis esimated that if cash fows declined by 30 percent relative to those in 2016, the interes-to-EBITC could reach 25-26 percent by 2019, depending on the degree to which interes rates increase."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Since 2013, commodity prices have fallen from record highs. With the drop in farm income, land prices have sopped climbing and have even fallen in some regions of the country. In addition, interes rates have recently begun to increase, raising borrowing coss for new and variable rate loans. These trends indicate that U.S. agriculture is entering a less prosperous and potentially vulnerable period. However, current indicators of farm fnancial health do not sugges that the downturn is as severe as the farm crisis of the 1980s. Net cash farm income for the farm sector has fallen by one-third since 2013, but it is currently not far below the average pos-2000 levels. While the share of farm businesses with negative net cash farm income varies subsantially across commodity specialization categories, the share with negative net farm income in 2016 was similar to the average share in 2007-16. And even though infation-adjused farm debt increased 79 percent from 1994 to 2016, interes expenses have remained relatively sable due to declining interes rates. In contras to the 1980s, recent decades have seen farm assets appreciate more rapidly than debt, so the farm sector's debt-to-asset ratio remains low by hisoric sandards. If farm income remains near current levels and interes rates increase as currently forecas, projected interes expense-to-farm earnings ratios sugges that the farm sector is unlikely to face extensive debt repayment challenges by 2019. However, if farm income falls subsantially, more farmers will fnd it difcult to meet their debt obligations.
