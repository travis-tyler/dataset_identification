[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Infectious diseases caused 10.4 million deaths worldwide in 2017, according to Hanna Ritchie and Max Roser in Our world in data [1] . The WHO reckons that vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent infectious diseases [2] . Vaccines help the body to recognize pathogens and protect the body against infectious diseases. Nevertheless, vaccines are not available against all infectious diseases, e.g., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), Zika virus, or vaccines require improvement to be more effective (e.g., influenza, polio). Therefore, further vaccine development is required.\nThe development of vaccines is often tight on timelines, hence established techniques are frequently chosen for analysis because methods can be developed quickly. However, these established techniques may lack resolution, throughput and overall method performance. Implementation of modern techniques requires good fundamental understanding and experience of the technology and its best practice, as well as of the analytes and the application field, and thus decrease method development lead times and improve the overall method performance and robustness.\nAn example of an application that improved method development lead times and method performance is the automated monoclonal antibody (mAb) analysis by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) . Commercialized off-the-shelf products have been developed to replace the manual SDS-PAGE [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The use of the off-the-shelf CE-SDS products and applications are well established and are, nowadays, often part of the standard mAb product release testing. The CE-SDS application is also frequently used for non-mAb proteins such as viral proteins [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, the off-the-shelf CE-SDS products cannot always be applied directly for the analysis of non-mAb pharmaceutical proteins.\nAdjustment and optimization of the CE-SDS application is often required to be able to fulfill pharmaceutical requirements, as captured in the analytical target profile (ATP) [20, 21] . Adjustment and optimization of Off-the-shelf applications can be difficult due to the proprietary nature of offthe-shelf applications. Thus, this report focuses on identifying the most important (critical) method Electrophoresis This article is protected by copyright.

In both techniques the proteins in a sample are denatured with SDS and get a uniform charge-over-size ratio. The sample is loaded onto either a crosslinked polymer slab-gel or injected into a capillary, that is filled with a linear non-crosslinked gel buffer. A voltage is applied, and the proteins migrate through the gel. The gel functions as a sieve and the proteins are separated based on their size. This results in an electropherogram with peaks of which the migration time correlates with the protein size and the peak area with the protein concentration.

All rights reserved.\nThe CE-SDS kit was developed for monoclonal antibodies [5, 6] and can also be used to analyze viral proteins in vaccine development samples [12, 20, 28, 29] . Nonetheless, optimization of the different steps in the method (sample preparation, CGE separation and detection) is needed to establish a method that meets the assay requirements as listed in the analytical target profile (ATP) [26] . Each of the different steps in the method contain many parameters, e.g., incubation and separation temperatures, reagent concentrations, etc. To be able to design a method that meets the assay requirements, it is key to understand which are the critical method parameters (CMPs), i.e., the parameters that have most effect on the method performance. The CMPs require optimization and/or will be controlled [30] .\nThe CMPs for sample preparation and detection were thoroughly studied previously [5, 6, 20, [31] [32] [33] [34] .\nDilution, desalting [5, 6] , reduction, alkylation [31, 32] and deglycosylation [20, 33, 34] impact separation and the selectivity of the method. The use and need for sample preparation is dependent on the nature of the sample and the proteins of interest [26, 33] , as well as on the purpose of the method. The sample preparation CMPs to optimize the selectivity and sensitivity of the method were the incubation temperature(s) and time(s), pH, and reagent(s) concentration(s) [26] . The sample preparation and detection procedures used in this study were based on the studies performed by Van Tricht et al [20] .\nDetection can be performed with UV or LIF. LIF is frequently used to increase the sensitivity of the method and to reduce baseline noise, but requires an additional derivatization step [35] [36] [37] . An additional derivatization step would add another source of variance to the method, therefore we decided to use UV detection. Detection wavelength is an important CMP for sensitivity, and was set to 214 nm.\nFor the CE-SDS kit, there has been ample attention to sample preparation, however, there are few papers on the separation optimization of the dextran-glycerol gel buffer [3, 20, 29, 32, [38] [39] [40] . Electrophoresis This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Therefore, the focus of the first part of this study was to determine the CMPs for the CE-SDS separation.\nThe CE-SDS separation takes place inside a bare fused silica (BFS) capillary, typically 30 -33 cm total length. Capillaries with an internal diameter larger than 50 \u00b5m were tested and resulted in increased sensitivities. However, use of larger capillary diameters is limited by increased currents resulting in excessive Joule heating. Capillaries longer than 33 cm did not significantly increase the resolution, however, the run time increased substantially. Therefore, a 50 \u03bcm BFS capillary of 33 cm total length was used during all our experiments. An effective length of 8.5 cm resulted in similar resolution compared to an effective length of 24.5 cm for the analysis of inactivated virus bulk influenza samples, and the analysis time decreased by a factor 3. Others reported loss of resolutions when using short-end injection [41] . Therefore, the capillary effective length was added to the set of key steps for fast method development.\nReceived: 29/04/2020; Revised: 17/06/2020; Accepted: 30/06/2020 This article has been accepted for publication and undergone full peer review but has not been through the copyediting, typesetting, pagination and proofreading process, which may lead to differences between this version and the Version of Record.

The gel buffer composition was studied previously and optimized for the analysis of mAbs [42] . Interestingly, dilution of the gel buffer resulted in better separation, sensitivity and shorter analysis times for the analysis of haemagglutinin (HA) in influenza virus and virosome [20] . The gel buffer contains dextran, tris, borate, glycerol, SDS and EDTA, each added for different reasons as mentioned in the patent application [43] . Dextran is a non-crosslinked linear polymer with low UV-absorbance that forms an entangled network with dynamic pores for sieving [43] . The gel pore size depends on the polymer concentration and has an impact on the sieving nature of the gel buffer. Gel buffer dilution was expected to increase the gel polymer pore size and to decrease resolution [27, 38, 44] , which is contradictory to the influenza protein analysis results [20] .\nDilution of the gel buffer decreases the viscosity as well as decreases the ionic strength of the buffer. figure 1B) . Gel buffer dilution from 100% to 70% w/w decreased the conductivity with approximately 10%, independent of the temperature. Hence, the ionic strength decrease had a stronger effect on the conductivity than the decrease in viscosity.\nAs the conductivity change was dominant, diluting the gel buffer affected electrokinetic injection or hydrodynamic injection differently (Figure 2) . During electrokinetic injection, the amount of protein injected depends on the applied voltage and the relative conductivity of the gel buffer and of the sample. When the gel buffer was diluted and the conductivity decreased, the sample local electric field strength decreased, hence a lower amount of proteins were electrokinetically injected. This was confirmed by injecting inactivated virus bulk influenza samples electrokinetically into different gel buffers with concentrations of 70 -90%. At 70% w/w gel buffer, the corrected peak areas of the inactivated virus bulk influenza proteins were 2 times lower compared to 90% w/w gel buffer (data not shown).\nGenerally, we prefer hydrodynamic injection over electrokinetic injection for quantitative analysis [8, 26] , as it is generally more precise, non-selective, and matrix independent, whereas electrokinetic injection is selective and matrix dependent [45, 46] . In hydrodynamic injections, where the injected volume depends on the viscosity and not on the conductivity, gel buffer dilution decreased the viscosity and increased the injected volume, as demonstrated by injecting NIBSC B/Brisbane influenza samples in a capillary filled with gel buffer concentrations between 70% and 100% w/w. Electrophoresis This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\nThe difference in viscosity at 32.5\u00b0C between the 70% and the 100% gel buffer was about 2.6 times.\nThe corrected peak areas of the NIBSC B/Brisbane proteins was 2.6 times higher for a 70% gel buffer concentration than a 100% gel buffer concentration (data not shown).\nAlthough conductivity does not affect hydrodynamic injection, it does affect sample stacking. The conductivity change of diluted gel buffer decreased the conductivity difference with the sample plug and hence reduced stacking capacity, while a larger sample plug was injected. Indeed, the peak efficiency decreased when hydrodynamically injecting NIBSC B/Brisbane influenza samples in 70% gel buffer. The plate numbers reduced in average with a factor 2.4 from 7.3 x 10 4 -1.0 x 10 5 in 100% gel buffer to 1.8 x 10 4 -5.0 x 10 4 in 70% gel buffer. In total, gel buffer dilution increased the hydrodynamically injected plug length, caused broader peaks and lower peak efficiencies, and decreased the stacking capacity. A decrease in efficiency can reduce both the sensitivity and resolution of the method. Naturally, the injection settings could be adjusted to avoid overloading. Figure 2 summarizes the effects of gel buffer dilution of the Sciex CE-SDS gel buffer with water on the ionic strength, the viscosity, and the conductivity of the gel buffer, and their impact on the analysis time, stacking, separation, and sensitivity. The magnitude of these effects also depends on the capillary temperature. Consequently, the gel buffer dilution, the capillary temperature, and the capillary effective length were considered CMPs that need to be optimized for each analyte and method. An overview of the CMPs and actions required to develop and validate a CE-SDS method for vaccine protein analysis is depicted in figure 3A .\nAfter identification of the CMPs, we defined a set of four steps to quickly develop a CE-SDS viral protein analysis method ( Figure 3B) . First, the feasibility of the default conditions as proposed by SCIEX [5] was assessed and the sample stability and the need for sample preparation and separation optimization evaluated.

All rights reserved.\nThe sample preparation was optimized in the second experiment, and the CGE separation was optimized in the third experiment. Both the optimization of the sample preparation and the separation were performed with multivariate DoE approaches. The CMPs to be optimized for sample preparation were the reagent(s) concentration(s), and incubation temperature(s), and incubation time(s). The CMPs to be optimized for separation were the gel buffer concentration, the capillary temperature, and the separation length.\nThe proposed set of key experiments was applied for the development of CE-SDS methods for two different viral vaccine protein applications, i) the determination of influenza group 1 minihaemagglutinin mini-HA(universal influenza vaccine) glycoprotein, and ii) the determination of polio virus particle proteins from an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)."}, {"section_title": "Mini-haemagglutinin", "text": "A Group 1 mini-HA glycoprotein was developed as part of a universal influenza vaccine [47, 48] .\nMini-HA is a homo-trimeric protein and has multiple deglycosylation sites with a high degree of variability in the glycosylation composition. The feasibility experiment resulted in a protein peak levels where the responses of interest were migration time, peak height, resolution, and deglycosylation efficiency. An I-optimal response surface DoE consisting of a total of 43 experimental runs was used (Supporting Information Table 1 ). Each experimental run corresponded to a unique combination of the levels of the seven factors and the runs were grouped into three random blocks each executed with a maximum of 15 samples a day.\nThe factors studied for the separation optimization DoE were gel buffer concentration, capillary temperature, and injection volume, each at three levels, and effective length at two levels. The responses of interest for the separation optimization were peak height, resolution, migration time, and corrected peak area. An I-optimal response surface DoE consisting of 20 experimental runs was used (Support Information Table 2 ). The 20 runs were grouped into 5 random blocks where the factor capillary temperature was held constant within a block, because randomization of the capillary temperature would result in time-out errors of the instrument. Therefore, this DoE is a split-plot design with the whole plots defined by the levels of the capillary temperature.\nThe described I-optimal response surface designs allowed for the estimation of the main effects, quadratic effects and 2-way interactions between the factors as well as the random block-to-block variation per optimization step. Prediction profiles and surface response plots were used to identify the factor settings leading to the most optimal results jointly for all the responses per optimization step. The optimal sample preparation conditions for mini-HA were 0.45% w/v SDS, 4.5% v/v 2-ME, and incubation for 10 min at 70\u00b0C, followed by 0.66% v/v Triton X-100, 6.6% v/v of deglycosylation enzymes, and incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and addition of 0.32% w/v SDS and 1.6% v/v 10 kDa internal standard.\nGel buffer dilution only showed limited improvement on the resolution. As it is easier to work with off-the-shelf solutions, undiluted gel buffer was selected. An effective length of 8.5 cm was selected since it resulted in a 3x lower migration time compared to an effective length of 24.5 cm, and did not significantly impact the resolution nor the corrected peak area.

With these conditions, a single mini-HA peak was obtained that was separated from in-process sample matrix components and mini-HA degradation products. The method was successfully validated for (i) quantitative purity determination of mini-HA for process development support, and (ii) quantitative purity measurements of mini-HA protein for product characterization and stability determination purposes. The corrected peak area repeatability was 0.8% RSD (n = 9), in a concentration range of 0.50 -3.13 mg/mL and the determined purities were 98 -99% (n = 27). Because the determined purities determined in the concentration range were between 98 -99% the method was linear and accurate. The LOQ for the method was defined as the lowest level of the required range, and as such was 0.50 mg/mL mini-HA. However, lower concentrations are certainly achievable if required."}, {"section_title": "Inactivated Polio Vaccine", "text": "The IPV consists of inactivated polio virions of 3 different wild-type strains, i.e., MEF-1, Saukett and Mahony.

A strain-specific identity method was needed for IPV vaccine development.\nDisulfide scrambling in the polio virus proteins can result in tertiary structure heterogeneity and hence in broad peaks. This was confirmed in the feasibility experiment. The the back calculated molecular weights based on the MW-markerof the individual proteins were as expected and depending on the strain, around 38 kDa (VP1), 31 kDa (VP2), 28 kDa (VP3), and 7 kDa (VP4). The proteins were not well separated with the method as described by SCIEX [5] , as peaks were tailing, sample analysis times were long, and the sensitivity was low, indicating the need for protein reduction and separation optimization. The IPV sample preparation optimization experiment included the reduction temperature, the reduction time, the 2-mercaptoethanol concentration, and the SDS concentration, while the separation optimization experiment comprised the injection volume, the gel buffer concentration and the effective length.

The mini-HA CE-SDS method required quantitative purity determination of a single glycoprotein in process intermediate sample matrices and during stability studies. The same method development approach resulting in significantly different conditions for these two test cases underlines the general applicability of the approach. The four key experiments can be further tailored whenever needed. For example, sample preparation steps such as derivatization for fluorescence detection, could be added. Additionally, electrokinetic injection instead of hydrodynamic injection could be evaluated. A water plug could be implemented to change the local field strength difference and improve stacking [20, 29, 45, 49] . In the presented approach, the gel buffer was diluted with water, thus diluting all components equally. To improve the separation optimization further, rather than maintaining the relative concentrations constant, the concentration of each gel buffer component could be studied. In general, a good understanding of the effects of the CMPs increases the robustness of a method and leads to an efficient approach in method development.\nThe four steps can be performed within week(s), given the materials are present, instruments available and operators trained. Altogether, for the presented cases, the total lead time from specifying the need for a vaccine protein analysis method until sample testing with an optimal performing method took considerably shorter than the average lead time for vaccine method development. In the light of the current COVID-19 outbreak and earlier Zika virus and Ebola virus outbreaks, short analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development lead times contribute to fast responses to reduce the impact of outbreaks.

In the case of diluting the Sciex CE-SDS gel buffer with water, the total effect was that the conductivity was decreased (see text). The decreases in viscosity and in conductivity ultimately affect the sample injection, band broadening and sample stacking.
