Estimations of survey are dependent by many factors .Some factors are with the images and others with its methods. There are different forms of analysis of brain such as Singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT), Computed tomography (CT), positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ,in which it is widely used for analysis. These are used to detect abnormality localization in patients. They are subjected to noise while segmentation. The major difficulty in brain change detection is to model change in terms of deformation at region boundaries from the boundary-based method. Morphometry of whole brain to detect abnormalities has approaches like Voxel-based to quantify mass-univariate or multivariate analyses and Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM) [1] obtained from registration to measure the amount of deformation to measure the anatomical features of the subject. The TBM deals with the sensitivity and specificity with reference to the brain changes. Deformation varies in different ways (i.e.) the amount of deformation depends on the morphology of the subject."}, {"section_title": "Fig-1", "text": "Six regions present in brain image usually used for morphometric analysis.\nIn this paper we will exploit a new technique Pattern-Based Morphometry (PBM) which a data driven technique.

By using TBM we can find the volume changes typically that appear at tissue [1] . Brain registration is also one of the tools used for studying morphometry. Registration can be difficult depending on anatomical variability and complexity in structures. Log-jacobian images of such warps should be uniformly close to zero [1] .\nMultiple atlases of brain MRI is collected across subjects and computed. For atlases OASIS (Open Access series of Imaging Studies) database is used that range from 18 to 96 [15] ."}, {"section_title": "Fig-2", "text": "Atlases across different ages for subjects in the OASIS data set.\nThe atlases compute sharpness and features of image to higher degree. A method to overlay the images from their source and the manipulation of their transparency attributes or by assigning them to different color channels Image fusion can be performed at three different levels 1.Pixel/data level, 2.Feature/attribute level and 3.Symbol/decision level. These are done to serve for different purposes. Fusion rule is being used here to determine the fusion results [12] ."}, {"section_title": "Fig-3", "text": "Overlaying monochrome images using different color channels.\nMultistructure deffeomorphic registration approach to approve accuracy and robustness [2] . Many Group-based Neuroanatomical studies is the extraction of morphometric features that can be used for characterization of anatomical variability across or within groups .This study has approaches like voxel-based and tensor-based. Voxel-based morphometry computes the changes in volume due to registration [6] . It generates specific hypothesis about brain changes overtime. It is a automated technique that has grown in popularity .It uses statistics to identify difference in brain anatomy between collections of subjects, which in turn can be used to assume the presence of atrophy or, less normally, tissue development in subjects with disease.
