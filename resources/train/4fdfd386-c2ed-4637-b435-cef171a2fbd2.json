[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Multilevel modeling (MLM) is frequently used to detect group differences, such as an intervention effect in a pre-test-post-test cluster-randomized design. Group differences on the post-test scores are detected by controlling for pre-test scores as a proxy variable for unobserved factors that predict future attributes. The pre-test and post-test scores that are most often used in MLM are summed item responses (or total scores). In prior research, there have been concerns regarding measurement error in the use of total scores in using MLM. To correct for measurement error in the covariate and outcome, a theoretical justification for the use of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) has been established. However, MSEM for binary responses has not been widely applied to detect intervention effects (group differences) in intervention studies. In this article, the use of MSEM for intervention studies is demonstrated and the performance of MSEM is evaluated via a simulation study. Furthermore, the consequences of using MLM instead of MSEM are shown in detecting group differences. Results of the simulation study showed that MSEM performed adequately as the number of clusters, cluster size, and intraclass correlation increased and outperformed MLM for the detection of group differences."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The cluster-randomized trial design is one of the more common designs in education (Raudenbush, 1997) . 1 In the cluster-randomized design, clusters of persons rather than individual persons are assigned at random to treatments. Because many educational and psychological attributes are unobservable as outcomes for an intervention, multiple indicators (or items) are often collected to infer the unobserved attributes. There are many circumstances in which items Breukelen, & Berger, 2008) . Due to space considerations, MLM is specified in the online supplementary material."}, {"section_title": "Assessing Group Differences in MSEM", "text": "In this section, MSEM is described. To frame this data structure within the multilevel literature (e.g., Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992) , item responses are at Level 1, with individuals and items cross-classified at Level 2. Individuals are nested within clusters at Level 3. In the following model, a measurement model for the pre-test is specified as a covariate and a measurement model for the post-test is specified as an outcome (e.g., Battauz, Bellio, & Gori, 2011; RabeHesketh et al., 2004, Equation 18 ). A treatment condition variable is a Level 3 covariate because the intervention is applied equally to all individuals within a cluster in a clusterrandomized design. In the specification, it is assumed that the same construct is being measured in a control group and a treatment group to detect the group difference (i.e., measurement invariance between the two groups; Bejar, 1980) . Furthermore, the authors also assume that each individual answers several items and the same items are administered to all individuals.\nThe measurement model in MSEM for binary responses can be called a multilevel item response model. In most multilevel item response models, it is assumed that item discrimination over Level 2 and Level 3 are the same and constant (often 1) in Rasch multilevel item response models (e.g., Kamata, 2001) and are the same in two-parameter multilevel item response models (e.g., Fox, 2010; Jeon & Rabe-Hesketh, 2012) . The model formulation having the same item discriminations over levels can be considered a variance component factor model (RabeHesketh et al., 2004) . Unlike these previous specifications of the multilevel item response model, in this study's specification, the different item discriminations over Level 2 and Level 3 were specified in the measurement model of MSEM as a general two-level factor model. A path diagram is presented to depict an MSEM in the online supplementary material.\nItem responses for pre-test (denoted by the subscript 1) are specified as \u00bdy 1jk1 , . . . , y 1jki , . . . , y 1jkI 0 and item responses for post-test (denoted by the subscript 2) are specified as \u00bdy 2jk1 , . . . , y 2jki , . . . , y 2jkI 0 for an individual j \u00f0j \u00bc 1; :::; J \u00de; a cluster k \u00f0k \u00bc 1; :::; K\u00de; and an item i \u00f0i \u00bc 1; :::; I\u00de. At pre-test, dependency in item responses is explained by two latent variables, u 1jk and u 1k , for individual level and cluster level, respectively. The measurement model for the pre-test is as follows:\nwhere F denotes the normal cumulative distribution function, y 1jki is an item response at pretest, a 1i, W is an item discrimination parameter at Level 2 for pre-test, a 1i, B is an item discrimination parameter at Level 3 for pre-test, b 1i is an item location parameter for pre-test, u 1jk is a latent variable at Level 2, and u 1k is a latent variable at Level 3. The measurement model for the post-test is as follows:\nwhere a 2i, W is an item discrimination parameter at Level 2 for post-test, a 2i, B is an item discrimination parameter at Level 3 for post-test, b 2i is an item location parameter for post-test, u 2jk is a latent variable at Level 2, and u 2k is a latent variable at Level 3.\nCovariates are introduced for the latent variables, u. A structural model for the latent variable at Level 2 (e.g., the student level) is as follows:\nwhere q 00 is an intercept at Level 2, q 10 is the effect of the pre-test latent score at Level 2, and e 2jk is the residual of post-test latent scores at Level 2.\nThe structural model for the latent variable at Level 3 (e.g., the teacher level) is as follows:\nwhere TRT k is a covariate for treatment condition with a value of 0 for members of the control group and a value of 1 for members of the treatment group, d 00 is the intercept at Level 3, d 10 is the effect of the pre-test latent score at Level 3, d 20 is the effect of TRT k at Level 3, and e 2k is the residual of post-test latent score at Level 3.\nIn the structural models (Equations 3 and 4), pre-test covariates (u 1jk and u 1k ) are latent covariates. As explained earlier, a pre-test covariate is a proxy variable for unobserved factors that is used to predict post-test scores. Adding the two structural models (Equations 3 and 4) to the measurement model for the post-test (Equation 2), the combined model leads to the following:\nTo identify the model, the following constraints are set as indicated by asterisks:\n, and e 2k ;N(0 \u00c3 , 1 \u00c3 ). Alternatively, the item discrimination for one of the items (e.g., the first item) can be set to 1 instead of setting variances to 1: a 21, W = 1, a 21, B = 1, a 11, W = 1, and a 11, B = 1, to identify the scale unit of parameters."}, {"section_title": "Parameter Estimation", "text": "The authors chose Bayesian estimation to deal with the high-dimensional structure inherent in MSEMs for binary responses. Maximum likelihood estimation of models for binary data is challenging because the marginal likelihood does not have a closed form so that maximum likelihood estimation requires numerical or Monte Carlo integration. In Bayesian analysis, it is possible to sample complex and high-dimensional posterior densities by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods through sampling from the conditional distributions of parameters without numerical integration. Mplus version 7.11 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2014 was chosen to model the MSEMs. The algorithm used for MCMC in Mplus is GIBBS(PX1). In addition to the constraints needed to identify MSEMs, residual variances in the Mplus item response theory (IRT) model specification (see Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2013 , for IRT specification in Mplus) were set to 1 to identify the model and also to provide parameters specified in Equation 5.\nFor the specified MSEM, the joint posterior distribution for the parameters,\n, e 2jk , e 2k g, can be rewritten as\nwhere P(y 1jki jY) and P(y 2jki jY) are likelihood functions, probabilities within the first braces indicate prior distributions of item parameters, probabilities within the second braces indicate prior distributions of regression coefficients, and probabilities within the third braces indicate prior and hyper-prior distributions of latent variables or residuals. In the current study, item discrimination parameters were given a mildly informative prior, N (0, 1), as used in many IRT applications to have stable item discrimination parameter estimates (e.g., B\u00e9guin & Glas, 2001; Patz & Junker, 1999) and item location parameter and regression coefficients were given noninformative priors, N(0, 5). The prior distributions of latent variables or residuals were set as constraints (noted by asterisks) as follows:\nThe hyper-prior distribution on the mean was set as m;N (0, 5). The posterior median and standard deviation of sample values were reported as posterior moments. To ensure that stable parameter estimates are obtained, Gelman and Rubin's (1992) method was implemented in Mplus."}, {"section_title": "Characterizing Multilevel Structure: ICC", "text": "With the measurement models (Equations 1 and 2), an ICC can be specified for each item to indicate the proportion of variance that is attributable to clusters. ICC is the correlation coefficient (Corr) among probabilities of item responses on the probit scale 2 (P 0 (y jki )) for the same cluster k, but different persons j and j 0 , and can be defined as follows 3 :\nCharacterizing Measurement Error in Scores: Reliability\nIn this section, reliability is presented using measurement models for pre-test and post-test results. One of the advantages of using MSEM is the ability to cope with measurement error for each individual and each cluster. In Bayesian analysis, standard errors, SE u jk and SE u k , are produced automatically from the MCMC simulations as standard deviations of sampled values. It is also possible to present a test-level reliability, within-reliability, and between-reliability in MSEM. Within-reliability represents the ratio of within-cluster true score variance to total within-cluster variance, whereas between-reliability represents the ratio of the between-cluster true score variance to total between-cluster variance (Geldhof, Preacher, & Zyphur, 2014; Muth\u00e9n, 1991) . Applying these definitions of reliability for the specified MSEM leads to a within-reliability (r W ) estimate as follows 4 :\nwhere b u jk is the estimate of u jk and b u 1 is the mean of b u jk across individuals. Between-reliability (r B ) can be defined as follows:\nwhere b u k is the estimate of u k and b u 2 is the mean of b u k across clusters."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Study", "text": "The data used in this study were collected in an efficacy trial of Enhanced Anchored Instruction (EAI). EAI aims to raise math achievement in middle and high school students. Next, a brief description of EAI is given; interested readers may find additional details in Bottge, Ma, Gassaway, Butler, and Toland (2014) . The design of the efficacy trial was a pre-test-post-test cluster-randomized design. Schools, rather than classes or students, were randomly assigned to EAI and business as usual (BAU) because the research team did not have control over students' class assignment. The research question was as follows: Do group (EAI vs. BAU) differences emerge for computation?"}, {"section_title": "Teacher and Student Samples", "text": "Twenty-four urban and rural middle schools in the Southeast United States participated in the study. Half were randomly assigned to EAI and BAU. Each school had one participating inclusive math classroom, although one school had two participating classrooms.

The cluster size ranged from 7 to 28 students, with an average of 17.84. Students were comparable across instructional conditions in terms of gender, ethnicity, subsidized lunch, and disability area, based on chi-square tests of equal proportions. In the study, one inclusive math class from each school was sampled, with the exception of one school that had two inclusive math classes.

There were no missing item responses in the final sample of 446 students for analyses."}, {"section_title": "Analysis and Results", "text": "The authors chose a Bayesian analysis using Mplus 7.11 to fit the MLM specified for comparability of results with MSEM. Mplus code to fit MLM is available in the online supplementary material. The same precision in prior distributions as used in MLM was used for fixed effects, N (0, 5). An inverse-gamma distribution was used for variances of random effects in MLM, IG(\u00c01, 0) in the Mplus specification. In MLM, the group difference effect between BAU and EAI groups is coded with a value of 0 for members of the BAU group and a value of 1 for members of the EAI group. Based on a Gelman-Rubin statistic with 2 chains, a conservative burn-in of 1,000 iterations was used followed by 8,000 post-burn-in iterations. The ICC obtained from the unconditional MLM was :23 for pre-test and :24 for post-test, indicating 23% and 24% of the total variance of total scores was explained at the teacher level for pre-test and post-test, respectively. Analysis steps and results of MSEM are described below.\nStep 1. Determining the number of dimensions at the individual level. To determine the number of dimensions at the individual level for MSEM, the authors first compared a set of exploratory factor analyses (polychoric correlations with limited information robust weighted least squares estimation with Oblimin rotation) at each time point. Mplus version 7.11 was used for exploratory factor analysis. Step 2. Fitting a multilevel measurement model. The multilevel measurement model of MSEM (Equations 1 and 2) was fit to check if the multilevel measurement model is required instead of the single-level measurement model. ICCs for items obtained from the multilevel measurement model of MSEM ranged from :058 to :297 for pre-test and ranged from :016 to :318 for posttest, indicating a nonignorable dependency due to clusters (i.e., teachers).\nStep 3. Testing measurement invariance. In multiple measurement (or longitudinal) multilevel data arising from multiple groups, measurement invariance assumptions can be tested across time points (i.e., pre-test and post-test) and across groups (i.e., BAU vs. EAI). Measurement invariance across groups is necessary for comparing group means (Bejar, 1980) . However, the measurement invariance assumption across time points is not necessary when a pre-test score is used as a proxy variable for unobserved factors that predict or explain future attributes (e.g., Lockwood & McCaffrey, 2014) . Thus, measurement invariance for BAU versus EAI was tested at each time point. Using the multigroup multilevel measurement model (i.e., multigroup extension of Equations 1 and 2), three invariance models were compared to investigate measurement invariance across groups at pre-test and post-test (e.g., Widaman & Reise, 1997) : (a) a configural invariance model, in which all item parameters are estimated simultaneously in each group under the same factor structures; (b) a weak invariance model, in which only discrimination parameters are constrained to be equal across groups; and (c) a strong invariance model, in which all item parameters are constrained to be equal across groups.\nCompeting models to test measurement invariance assumptions were compared using a relative fit criterion, deviance information criterion (DIC; Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, & van der Linde, 2002 ) (Verhagen & Fox, 2013) . A smaller DIC represents a better fit of the model, and a difference of less than 5 or 10 units between models does not provide sufficient evidence for favoring one model over another (Spiegelhalter, Thomas, Best, & Lunn, 2003) . MSEM was fit at each time point using Mplus 7.11 to calculate DIC. Based on DIC, the weak invariance model was chosen at pre-test (DIC = 8, 226 for the configural invariance model, DIC = 8,168 for the weak invariance model, and DIC = 8,212 for the strong invariance model) and at post-test (DIC = 8, 276 for the configural invariance model, DIC = 8,148 for the weak invariance model, and DIC = 8,280 for the strong invariance model).\nIn the presence of weak invariance, the relative ordering of students' scores can be different because of the different difficulty levels between the groups. Whether BAU versus EAI can be scored and compared on the same scale under violation of weak invariance was checked with the correlation between scores ( b u 1jk + b u 1:k for pre-test and b u 2jk + b u 2:k for post-test) using a calibration by BAU versus EAI and a calibration with all students. The correlation coefficients were high: .975 at pre-test and .950 at post-test. This indicates that the relative ordering of students' scores does not change in the presence of weak invariance for BAU versus EAI. In addition, the group mean difference between BAU and EAI was compared between the weak invariance model and the strong invariance model in MSEM, by fitting multigroup MSEM 5 with the weak invariance model and MSEM with the strong invariance model, separately. The weak invariance model does not distort the scale score much at the group level at pre-test or post-test. 6 Based on both individual score and group mean comparisons, strong measurement invariance was assumed for BAU versus EAI in Step 4.\nStep 4. Fitting MSEM. Mplus code to fit MSEMs is available in the online supplementary material. 7 The group difference effect between BAU and EAI groups is coded with a value of 0 for members of the BAU group and a value of 1 for members of the EAI group. Based on a Gelman-Rubin statistic with 2 chains, a conservative burn-in of 7,000 iterations was used, followed by 8,000 post-burn-in iterations. Thinning was set at 40, meaning that 32,000 iterations were required after burn-in to obtain the 8,000 iterations. Table 1 presents person parameter estimates and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs) for MLM and MSEM. The pre-test score effect at the cluster level is smaller than the pre-test score effect at the individual level in both models. The same pattern was found in MSEM. However, the effect of the pre-test latent score at the teacher level was not significant in MSEM. The group difference, or EAI intervention effect, was statistically significant in both models. From the MLM results, the standardized effect size associated with the intervention effect 3.970 was about 0.571, which indicates that the EAI group performed 0.571 units higher than the BAU group on a standardized total score scale. However, in MSEM results, the EAI group performed 1.139 units higher than the BAU group on a latent variable scale. Item parameter estimates are shown in the online supplementary material. At pre-test and post-test, items vary in terms of item discriminations and difficulties, and items having a like denominator were less discriminating and less difficult at both within and between levels than items having an unlike denominator. The within-level reliability (r W ) obtained from the results of MSEM (Equation 8) was .693 for pre-test and .805 for post-test. The between-level reliability (r B ) obtained from the results of MSEM (Equation 9) was .560 for pre-test and .767 for post-test. These results indicate that there is nonignorable within-and between-level measurement error.\nDemographic variables for students and teachers to MSEM were also added to see if the effect of the intervention was changed with the inclusion of those variables. In fact, the change in significance and magnitude of the intervention effect was small when other demographic information for the students and teachers was added to MSEM."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Study", "text": "A simulation study was designed to investigate the performance of MSEM for binary responses in various multilevel designs including a condition similar to the empirical study and to compare the performance of MSEM with MLM in detecting group differences. The population datagenerating model was MSEM as specified in Equation 5 and data sets were generated using R (R Core Team, 2014) . Simulation conditions that may affect the group difference result were selected from previous research (e.g., L\u00fcdtke et al., 2011; Preacher, Zhang, & Zyphur, 2011) . These include the number of clusters (K = 24, 50, or 100), the number of individuals per cluster (n k = 5, 20, or 50), and the ICC at post-test (ICC = .05, .10, or .20). These three factors were fully crossed, yielding 27 ( = 33333) conditions. One thousand replications were simulated for each of the 27 conditions. Each generated data set was analyzed using both MSEM and MLM."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Conditions", "text": "Number of clusters. The numbers of clusters were set to K = 24, 50, or 100. A sample of 24 and 50 clusters is common in educational experimental intervention research (e.g., Bottge et al., 2014) . Examples of large numbers of clusters include national or international educational assessments such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Accordingly, 100 clusters were chosen.\nCluster size. Balanced cluster sizes were selected as n k = 5, 20, or 50 as used in MSEM studies (e.g., Preacher et al., 2011) . A cluster size of 5 is found in small group designs (e.g., Kenny, Mannetti, Pierro, Livi, & Kashy, 2002) . Given a selected number of clusters and cluster size, the total numbers of individuals result in 9 different sample sizes: J = 120, 250, 480, 500, 1,000, 1,200, 2,000, 2,500, or 5,000.\nICC at post-test. The ICC at post-test was set at ICC = .05, .10, or .20, given the fixed pre-test ICC of .3. ICC values are rarely greater than .30 in educational and organizational studies (e.g., Fox, 2010) . As considered in Preacher et al. (2011) , values of .05, .10, and .20 are considered small, medium, and large, respectively.\nAs shown in Equation 7 , each item can have a different degree of ICC in MSEM. To control for the effect of ICC in these simulation studies, however, the same item discriminations were set across items and scale constraints were used with respect to latent variables. Because post-test scores are explained by both a pre-test and an intervention effect at the cluster level, smaller ICCs for post-test than for pre-test were considered and a smaller a 2i, W for post-test than a 1i, W for pre-test was set for all items (i = 1, . . . , I). Given fixed a 2i, W = :8 and a 1i, W = 1, other population item discriminations were derived using Equation 7 for all items (i = 1, . . . , I). For the level of ICC = .05, the following item discriminations were set: a 1i, W = 1:000, a 1i, B = :655, a 2i, W = :800, and a 2i, B = :184. For the level of ICC = .10, the following item discriminations were set: a 1i, W = 1:000, a 1i, B = :655, a 2i, W = :800, and a 2i, B = :267. For the level of ICC = .20, the following item discriminations were set: a 1i, W = 1:000, a 1i, B = :655, a 2i, W = :800, and a 2i, B = :400.\nThe mean and regression coefficients are specified as follows: m = 0 (overall mean of pretest latent variable), q 01 = 0:4 (effect of pre-test at the individual level), d 00 = \u00c0 1 (mean of post-test latent variable), d 01 = 0:7 (effect of pre-test at the cluster level), and d 02 = 1:0 (intervention effect with dummy coding). Item difficulty was generated with a standard normal distribution, b 1i ;N (0, 1) and b 2i ;N(0, 1). Random variables (u 2jk and u 2k ) and residuals (e 2jk and e 2k ) were generated from a normal distribution with a unit variance to match with model identification constraints.

The same number of clusters were assigned to control and treatment groups for a balanced design."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses for Group Differences", "text": "Three outcome measures were considered: relative percentage bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and the observed coverage of the 95% CrI.\nLittle bias and variability for MSEM were expected because the population data-generating model was MSEM. For MLM, bias will be inversely related to ICC (e.g., Preacher et al., 2011) .\nThe relative percentage bias is given by 1003\u00bd( b d 20 \u00c0 d 20 )=d 20 and implies the accuracy of parameter estimates. The RMSE was computed using ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi\n, where r indicates the rth replication from a converged solution (r = 1, . . . , R). When a parameter estimate is unbiased, the RMSE quantifies the precision. For biased parameter estimates, the RMSE combines the parameter bias and precision into an overall measure of accuracy.\nIt is expected that the number of clusters and ICC will influence coverage for MLM. Given n k , increasing the number of clusters increases the total sample size. As the total sample size increases, the precision is increased and the CrI width is reduced. This results in reducing coverage for biased estimates. Because larger ICCs correspond to greater between-reliability, coverage should improve with increasing ICC. MSEM is expected to yield the least bias, which results in CrIs closely centered around the population parameter when the standard error of the estimate is precise. The precision of the standard error of the group effect was analyzed by determining the observed coverage of the 95% CrI. Coverage was determined by noting the proportion of trials in which the 95% CrI for the group difference effect included the population value of the group difference. Coverage close to .95 indicates that the precision is well estimated."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "No convergence problems were encountered in any replications for MLM and MSEM, except the sample size condition, n k = 5 and K = 24 (total sample size = 120) in MSEM. This nonconvergence problem may be due to the fact that the sample size is too small to estimate 125 parameters. 8 In the next section, results from only the converged solutions are reported.\nGroup difference effect in MLM and MSEM. The group difference effects are shown in Table 2 .\nRelative percentage bias. The following overall patterns in relative percentage bias were observed as reported in Table 2 . First, the relative percentage bias was much lower for MSEM than for MLM in all conditions. Relative percentage bias ranged in magnitude from \u00c0204:400 to \u00c05:440 in MLM, whereas it ranged in magnitude from \u00c016:780 to 0:050 in MSEM. On setting an acceptable bias criterion of 10%, unacceptable bias was found in all conditions in MLM, whereas unacceptable bias was found only in the condition with n k = 5 and K = 50 in MSEM. Second, the degree of bias decreased with increasing cluster size (n k ), number of clusters (K), and ICC in both MLM and MSEM. Third, relative percentage bias is negative in all conditions for MLM, indicating that the group difference effect was underestimated. However, a negative relative percentage bias was mainly found in MSEM with a small cluster size (n k = 5 or 20), a small number of clusters (K = 24 or 50), and a small ICC (ICC = .05 or .10).\nRMSE. Given biased parameter estimates, the RMSE presents the combined effect of parameter bias and parameter variance. RMSE has no accepted cutoff value for deciding whether an estimate is acceptable or not, but it represents a trade-off between bias and variability. In all conditions, MSEM outperformed MLM. RMSE ranged in magnitude from 0:132 to 1:025 in MLM, whereas it ranged in magnitude from 0:027 to 0:243 in MSEM. As was found with relative percentage bias, RMSE decreased with increasing cluster size (n k ), number of clusters (K), and ICC in both MLM and MSEM.\nCoverage. As predicted, MLM coverages were less than .95 when ICC is small and both K and n k are large. For large ICC, small k, and small n k , coverage was 1.00 in MLM. MSEM coverages were 1.00 in all conditions except one condition (n k = 5, K = 50, and ICC = .05), which indicates that standard errors can be overestimated in MSEM.\nOther parameters in MSEM. The overall measure of accuracy (RMSE) of MSEM parameter estimates (except the group difference estimate) is reported in the online supplementary material. For all item parameters (except a 2i, B and d 00 ), the behavior of RMSE is similar across different ICC conditions, given the same cluster size and number of clusters (with the exception of condition n k = 50, K = 100, and ICC = .05), and RMSE decreased as cluster size increased holding number of clusters (K) constant. The item discrimination parameter, a 2i, B , differs depending on ICC because the degree of ICC in outcomes was manipulated by increasing the magnitudes of a 2i, B . Thus, patterns of results were interpreted within the same ICC. Given the same ICC, RMSE decreased by increasing cluster size (n k ) and number of clusters (K). For d 01 and m, RMSE decreased with increasing cluster size (n k ), number of clusters (K), and ICC."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In summary, the first goal of this study was to illustrate the use of MSEM for binary responses to correct for the measurement error in the covariate and outcome using educational intervention data and to investigate the behavior of MSEM in various multilevel designs. The authors also sought to describe how model parameters can be estimated using Bayesian analysis in Mplus 7.11 and present calculations of reliability coefficients and ICC for each item. MSEM performed well in terms of bias and RMSE in estimating the group difference in all conditions except conditions with a small cluster size (n k = 5 or 20), a small number of clusters (K= 24 or 50), and a small ICC (ICC = .05 or .10). In addition, overall accuracy was not problematic 9 for other parameter estimates in MSEM. Overall parameter accuracy for all parameters, including the group difference, was acceptable for the simulation condition (n k = 20, K = 24, ICC = .20), similar to the empirical study (average n = 17.84, k = 24, average ICC across items at posttest = .202).\nThe second goal was to answer questions about the consequences of using MLM instead of MSEM. MSEM was chosen as a population data-generating model. Unacceptable bias and lower CI coverage was found in most conditions that were considered in using MLM. However, MSEM performed well in terms of parameter accuracy regarding bias and RMSE in estimating the group difference in all conditions except conditions with a small cluster size (n k = 5 or 20), a small number of clusters (K= 24 or 50), and a small ICC (ICC = .05 or .10). Given this study's simulation conditions, standard errors of the group difference estimate were overestimated in MSEM.\nThere are methodological limitations to the present study. First, the authors described MSEM for binary item responses, which are common in educational and psychological research. The description of MSEM, its parameter estimation description, and other quantities (reliability coefficients and ICC) for binary variables in this study cannot be directly applied to MSEM for outcomes with more than two categories (i.e., polytomous item responses). More parameters for item locations (or thresholds) must be modeled for MSEM with polytomous item responses.\nSecond, one may think that a comparison between MLM and MSEM approaches is unfair when the population data-generating model is MSEM. The authors chose MSEM as the population data-generating model for two main reasons. First, the main interest for the comparison was to investigate the extent to which group difference detection on total scores in MLM may produce misleading inferences about the group difference on an error-free latent construct. In addition, the authors were interested in the degree to which MSEM would outperform MLM even though it may be expected that MSEM would perform better than MLM overall in this situation. However, there is no guarantee MSEM will recover its own parameters well even when MSEM is the population data-generating model. Indeed, MSEM would not converge whereas MLM would when the sample size is small (K = 24 and n k = 5).\nThird, the present research as a simulation study shares the same limitations that are present in other simulation studies, that is, the conditions employed in the study design are limited, including the same 20-item test over time points, a balanced design, 1.0 group difference, measurement invariance between a control group and a treatment group, and the same item discriminations within a level to control for the effect of ICC. More extensive simulations that vary these limited conditions should be conducted to make solid generalizations. Furthermore, a future study should investigate sample size design and power issues with various magnitudes of the group difference.\nFourth, it was found that the standard error of the group difference estimate can be overestimated, based on the coverage observed in most MSEM conditions that were considered. The ratio of the mean posterior standard deviation (i.e., Bayesian standard error) to the standard deviation across replications ranged from 1.08 to 1.30 across the simulation conditions in MSEM, which implies that the standard errors were not overestimated dramatically. However, more systematic investigation is required to evaluate Bayesian standard errors, using different degrees of precision on the prior distribution and Monte Carlo error.\nMLM is frequently used to estimate group differences on the scale of total scores as evidence of an intervention effect. The main goal of this study was to present and evaluate MSEM as an alternative model for detecting group differences when measurement error exists in the covariate and outcome. When clusters are the unit of analysis as is typically the case in data sets from cluster-randomized designs, evaluations of treatment can be expensive. Researchers should be aware that MSEM can perform adequately only when group size, the number of clusters, and ICC are large enough."}]
