This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated on a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing between images belonging to subjects on a DAT trajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a DAT diagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker achieved state-of-the-art performance on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT conversion prediction task with an AUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 5 years to conversion windows respectively."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of AD pathology (ADP) such as aberrant deposition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) proteins, and the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins. The initial symptom of AD is cognitive impairment notably in the memory domain, that gradually involves other domains leading to a clinical diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). Patients with DAT progressively succumb to severe stages of dementia, requiring complete assistance for daily activities. DAT is the most common form of dementia, affecting 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 years (Alzheimer's Association, 2015) and as many as 1 in 3 people over the age of 85 (Hebert et al., 2013) . As of 2015, there were an estimated 46.8 million dementia afflicted growing to reach 131.5 million in 2050 (Prince et al., 2016) , projecting a very sizeable burden on healthcare systems and caregivers worldwide. This impending public health crisis due to rising DAT cases has prompted drug-development efforts to find treatments for AD that can reduce the severity of ADP or remove it altogether (Cummings et al., 2014; Gody\u0144 et al., 2016) . However, the success of such treatments ultimately depends on the ability to diagnose DAT as early as possible before irreversible brain damage occurs. Therefore, in recent years there has been a considerable push towards developing robust biomarkers useful for diagnosing DAT in clinical practice (Weiner et al., 2017) .\nFluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a minimally invasive neuroimaging technique to quantify the glucose metabolism in the brain which indirectly measures the underlying neuronal activity (Mosconi et al., 2010) . As metabolic disruptions are hypothesized to precede the appearance of cognitive symptoms in AD (Jack et al., 2013) , FDG-PET imaging presents itself as an attractive tool for investigating the metabolism changes triggered by ADP across the entire DAT spectrum, ranging from the presymptomatic phase to the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage followed by dementia. Our aim in this work is to develop an automatic method that can aid in the interpretation of the 3D topographic metabolism patterns encoded in FDG-PET images for the purpose of DAT diagnosis. To this end, we devised a supervised machine learning framework that takes as input a FDG-PET image of subject and outputs a continuous value between 0 and 1 termed as the FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS), which indicates the probability of the subject's metabolism profile to be belonging to the DAT trajectory, i.e., how likely is the subject to be clinically diagnosed with DAT.\nOne of the main contributions of our work is the introduction of a novel approach for stratifying the imaging data used in the development and validation of the proposed FPDS methodology. Most commonly, imaging biomarker studies employ a 3 group stratification, where the clinical diagnostic labels of NC, MCI and DAT assigned at the time of image acquisition are directly used for grouping the imaging data (Rathore et al., 2017) . In contrast, here we present a stratification scheme that groups images based not only on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future clinical diagnoses. Our novel stratification is able to more faithfully represent the different diagnostic trajectories observed in a real-world clinical setting when compared to the stratification depending only on the diagnosis at a single timepoint. For instance, based on our stratification, we can distinguish among NC images that stay NC (stable NC, sNC) from those that convert to MCI (unstable NC, uNC) , and from those that convert to DAT (progressive NC, pNC) . A similar delineation is also induced among the MCI and DAT images using our stratification scheme. An important contribution in this paper is the design of a novel multi-scale ensemble classification model for the proposed FPDS computation. The ensemble model consists of several individual classifiers trained on features extracted from the FDG-PET image at multiple scales. The probability predictions from each of these individual classifiers regarding the association of the given FDG-PET image with a DAT trajectory are fused together to obtain a more robust final FPDS prediction. Another noteworthy contribution of our work is the exhaustive and comprehensive statistical evaluation approach used to validate the FPDS predictions. First, the training model fit was evaluated and then a pseudo-independent test sample consisting of follow-up images corresponding to the baseline training data was used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ensemble model's generalization error. Finally, the predictive performance of the FPDS biomarker was evaluated on a large completely independent validation set of images taken from different stages of the DAT spectrum demonstrating a strong generalization potential of the reported results. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the largest FDG-PET based imaging biomarker study reported till date. Our study goals align with the phase 3 aims of the structured five-phase AD biomarker development framework that was recently proposed , and the results presented in our paper add to the currently available evidence for supporting the use of FDG-PET as a diagnostic tool for DAT (Frisoni et al., 2017) ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article was obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease. Till date, ADNI has involved 1887 subjects and assessed over one or more visits. Clinical diagnosis received by these subjects, can be broadly categorized among one of NC, MCI and DAT.

Each of these three groups were further divided into subgroups based on the diagnoses received during their follow-up. The subgroups are named according to the convention 'prefixGroup', where 'Group' is the clinical diagnosis obtained during the imaging visit, and 'prefix' signifies the past or the future clinical diagnoses of the same individual. Images associated with clinical diagnosis of NC, and a consistent diagnoses of NC during the entire ADNI study period are termed as the stable NC (sNC) group. Images associated with clinical diagnosis of NC, but convert to MCI in the future visits are termed as unstable NC (uNC). Images associated with a clinical diagnosis of NC and convert to DAT in their future visits are termed as progressive NC (pNC). Similarly, images associated with MCI are subgrouped as stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on persistent MCI diagnosis and conversion to DAT diagnosis respectively in their subsequent followup. Images with a clinical diagnosis of DAT who joined ADNI at the DAT stage, i.e., they converted to clinical diagnosis of DAT prior to ADNI recruitment, and remained DAT for the future ADNI visits are termed as stable DAT (sDAT). Images with a clinical diagnosis of DAT, with the recent past ADNI clinical diagnosis of either NC or MCI, i.e., they converted to DAT within the ADNI visits are termed as early DAT (eDAT). Note that a past or future clinical diagnosis visit may or may not include neuroimaging, but the past or future clinical diagnosis enables an enriched staging of each image given the evolution of clinical diagnosis.\nThe proposed stratification provides key advantage, offers subgroups namely pNC, pMCI, eDAT and sDAT, that represent various stages of DAT trajectory. The pNC subgroup is the earliest, the sDAT subgroup is the most advanced and the pMCI and eDAT subgroups are in-between these extremes along the DAT spectrum. These are denoted as the DAT+ class of images indicating their trajectory towards DAT. The subjects in the sNC, uNC and sMCI subgroups do not include a followup clinical diagnosis of DAT during the ADNI window; so although there is the possibility that post-ADNI these could progress to a clinical diagnosis of DAT, for the purposes of analysis in this paper, these subgroups are considered to not be on the DAT+ trajectory, hence denoted as DAT\u2212."}, {"section_title": "MRI processing", "text": "Pre-processing of the 3D structural MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI images from ADNI included standard intensity normalization to remove image geometry distortions arising from gradient non-linearity, B1 calibrations to correct for image intensity non-uniformities and N3 histogram peak sharpening (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mrianalysis/mri-pre-processing). The pre-processed images were segmented into the gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue regions (Dale et al., 1999) using the Freesurfer software package (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). A rigorous quality control procedure was employed to manually identify and correct any errors in the automated tissue segmentations following Freesurfer's troubleshooting guidelines. Subsequently, the GM tissue region was parcellated into 85 different anatomical ROIs using Freesurfer's cortical (Desikan et al., 2006) and subcortical (Fischl et al., 2002) labeling pipelines."}, {"section_title": "FDG-PET processing", "text": "The ADNI FDG-PET images used in this study were pre-processed using a series of steps to mitigate inter-scanner variability and obtain FDG-PET data with a uniform spatial resolution and intensity range for further analysis (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/PET-analysis/preprocessing). Briefly, the original raw FDG-PET frames were co-registered and averaged to obtain a single FDG-PET image, which was then mapped from its native space to a standard 160 \u00d7 160 \u00d7 96 image grid with 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 mm 3 voxels. After standardizing the spatial resolution and orientation, the intensity range of the FDG-PET image was normalized such that average intensity of all the foreground voxels in the image was exactly equal to one. The intensity normalized images were then filtered using scanner-specific filter functions to obtain FDG-PET data at a uniform smoothing level of isotropic 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel."}, {"section_title": "Multi-scale patch-wise FDG-PET SUVR features", "text": "In order to better localize the average regional glucose metabolism signal, each of the 85 GM ROIs obtained using Freesurfer were further subdivided into smaller volumetric sub-regions or patches. Our previously proposed adaptive surface patch generation method (Raamana et al., 2015) , which is based on k-means clustering, was applied to the 3D image domain to obtain a patch-wise parcellation of the GM ROIs. Instead of subdividing each GM ROI into a fixed number of patches, the number of patches per ROI were adaptively determined using the patch size parameter (m), denoting the number of voxels in each patch. This achieves a patch density (patches in ROI/voxels in ROI) that is uniform \u2248 ( ) m 1 throughout the image domain, which is desirable, as it leads to a compact yet rich description of the entire GM tissue region. The scalespace theory framework (Witkin, 1984) argues for storing the signal at multiple scales in the absence of a-priori knowledge regarding the appropriate scale at which to analyze the signal. Motivated by this scale-space idea, we generated 16 different levels of patch-wise parcellations, m = {100, 150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500, 1000,1500, 2000,3000,4000,5000,10000} to obtain a fine to coarse multi-scale representation of the GM region for capturing the regional glucose metabolism signals at different scales. We note that the patch-wise parcellations were initially generated on the standard MNI ICBM 152 non-linear average T1 template (Grabner et al., 2006) (http://nist.mni. mcgill.ca/?p=858) and then were propagated to each of the target MRI images in our dataset using the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) non-rigid registration (Beg et al., 2005) . This template-based parcellation approach ensures a one-to-one correspondence between the target image patches, which is required for the construction of a valid multi-scale FDG-PET feature space in the next step.\nThe FDG-PET images were co-registered with their respective MRI images using the inter-modal linear registration facility (Jenkinson et al., 2002) available as part of the FSL-FLIRT program (https://fsl. fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT). The quality of the co-registration was visually checked and the detected failures were corrected by rerunning FSL-FLIRT with a narrower rotation angle search range parameter to avoid getting trapped in local minima. The estimated 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) mapping was used to transfer the patch-wise parcellations from the MRI domain onto the FDG-PET domain. The mean FDG-PET image intensity value in each of the mapped patches was used to calculate the patch-wise standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) as, the mean intensity in a given patch divided by the mean intensity in the brainstem, chosen as the reference ROI (Herholz et al., 1990; SanabriaDiaz et al., 2013; Gray et al., 2012; Herholz et al., 2002) . This resulted in a total of M = 17 (including the original Freesurfer parcellation) patch-wise FDG-PET SUVR feature vectors that encoded the multi-scale regional glucose metabolism information derived from a given target FDG-PET image. Table 1 Novel stratification of ADNI images and associated demographic, clinical & biomarker details. The stratification was based on two criteria, clinical diagnosis of subjects at the time of FDG-PET image acquisition and their longitudinal clinical progression. Each image is assigned a membership of the form 'prefixGroup', where 'Group' is the clinical diagnosis at imaging visit, and 'prefix' signals past or future clinical diagnoses. For e.g., an image is designated as pNC if the subject was assigned a NC diagnosis at that particular imaging visit, but the subject converts to DAT at a future timepoint. The eDAT images are associated with the diagnosis of DAT, but the subject had received NC or MCI status during previous ADNI visits (conversion within ADNI window). Whereas, the sDAT images belong to subjects with a consistent clinical diagnosis of DAT throughout the ADNI study window, hence these individuals have progressed to DAT prior to their ADNI recruitment.

The main idea behind ensemble based supervised classification is to combine several individually trained classifiers together to obtain a single, more robust classification model (Dietterich, 2000) . Accordingly, in the proposed framework, classifiers were trained separately on each of the individual multi-scale feature vector spaces to construct a classifier ensemble. Then, a fusion of the multiple predictions from individual classifiers in the ensemble was performed, yielding the ensemble model estimate about the probability of the input multi-scale feature vectors belonging to the DAT+ trajectory. This probabilistic prediction output by the ensemble classification framework was taken to be the proposed FDG-PET DAT score.\nThe training samples corresponding to the DAT\u2212 and DAT+ classes needed for building the ensemble classification model were given by the baseline sNC (N=360) and sDAT (N=238) images respectively ( Table 1 , Footnotes 5 and 6). The proposed M multi-scale patch-wise FDG-PET SUVR feature vectors were extracted from all the training samples. To prevent over-fitting of the ensemble model to the chosen training sample set, the subagging approach (Buhlmann, 2003) was employed to randomly generate F = 100 subsets of training samples. The random sampling was performed using a sampling ratio of \u03b3 = 0.8 in a stratified manner to avoid class imbalance, ensuring an equal number of samples from both the DAT\u2212 and DAT+ classes, i.e., N train = 2 \u00d7\u230a0.8 \u00d7 238\u230b = 380 samples in each of the F training subsets. An ensemble of M \u00d7 F probabilistic kernel (Damoulas and Girolami, 2008) classifiers were individually trained on each of the M feature spaces using the F different training subsets. The classifier training was preceded by a t-statistic based feature selection step to identify the k = \u230aN train /10\u230b = 38 most discriminative features within the feature vector and also to address the \"curse of dimensionality\" issue (Raamana et al., 2015) . Each of the M \u00d7 F = 1700 trained probabilistic kernel classifiers output a continuous scalar p i \u2208 [0 1],i = {1,\u2026 M \u00d7 F}, that denotes the probability of an input feature vector belonging to the DAT+ class (1 \u2212 p i being the DAT\u2212 class membership probability). The FDG-PET DAT score is then simply defined as the mean of the DAT+ class probability predictions obtained from each of the M \u00d7 F classifiers.\nIn summary, given an unseen \"test\" sample containing a FDG-PET/ MRI image pair, we first extract the M multi-scale patch-wise SUVR features vectors from the images, and then reduce the dimensionality of each of these feature vectors by retaining only the k most discriminative features that were identified during the training phase. The pruned feature vectors are fed to the previously trained M \u00d7 F classifier ensemble to obtain M \u00d7 F probability predictions regarding the DAT+ class membership, which are then averaged to obtain the FDG-PET DAT score corresponding to the given test sample."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Our study dataset consisted of 2984 FDG-PET images (with corresponding structural MRI images), belonging to 1294 ADNI subjects, who have undergone imaging and clinical evaluations at one or more longitudinal time points.

Within this NC group, there are NC that will stay NC, i.e., stable NC (sNC, N=753 images), convert to MCI, i.e., unstable NC (uNC, N=110 images) or convert to DAT, i.e., progressive NC (pNC, N=58 images), and hence even though all are NC, the images are treated as distinct subgroups of the NC group given their future divergent evolution of clinical diagnosis. In a similar fashion, we distinguish among the images with clinical diagnosis of MCI as consisting of those who will continue to stay MCI, i.e., stable MCI (sMCI, N=881 images) throughout ADNI, or convert to AD, i.e., progressive MCI (pMCI, N=486 images) at a future visit.

The FPDS means in the sMCI group gradually increased from less than 0.2 in the younger age ranges (55-70 years) to greater than 0.5 among the older age ranges (85-95 years).

In general, the FPDS was weakly, but positively correlated with t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 . The correlation coefficient ranged between 0.13 and 0.31 among the various groups considered. However, correlation coefficients exhibited by DAT\u2212 groups (uNC and sMCI) were found to be statistically significant (p=0.0380 and p < 0.0001), whereas the DAT+ (pNC, pMCI and eDAT) groups only exhibited a trend of positive correlations with r-values in the 0.13 -0.24 interval.\nThe potential influence of t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 on FPDS was further characterized by generating the FPDS distributions among the subgroups associated with low and high t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values respectively. A previously published t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 cut-off of 0.52 (Duits et al., 2014) was used to define the \u03c4/A\u03b2 \u2212 (low-risk AD: t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 < = 0.52) and \u03c4/A\u03b2 + (high-risk AD: t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 > 0.52) sub-groups within each of the 7 stratified image groups. In Fig. 5 , it can be seen that, for both the sNC and sDAT, the mean FPDS value is lower among the \u03c4/A\u03b2 \u2212 compared to the \u03c4/A\u03b2 +. Accordingly, for the sNC which belong to the DAT\u2212 trajectory, the classification accuracy (using a 0.5 FPDS threshold) in the \u03c4/A\u03b2 \u2212 is higher compared to \u03c4/A\u03b2 +. On the other hand, for the sDAT which are on the DAT+ trajectory, the classification accuracy is higher among the \u03c4/A\u03b2 + instead. A similar trend can also be observed among the validation groups (uNC, sMCI, pNC, pMCI, eDAT), as shown in Fig. 6 , where all the groups show lower mean FPDS values among the \u03c4/A\u03b2 \u2212 in comparison to \u03c4/A\u03b2 +. Furthermore, the classification accuracies are higher in the \u03c4/A\u03b2 \u2212 for the DAT\u2212 groups (uNC, sMCI) compared to \u03c4/A\u03b2 +, whereas they are higher in the \u03c4/A\u03b2 + for the DAT+ groups (pNC, pMCI, eDAT)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper we report the development and validation of a novel FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS).

Most previous studies on imaging biomarkers were limited to stratifying images based on the NC, MCI and DAT diagnostic labels assigned at the time of image acquisition (Rathore et al., 2017) . However, in recent years there has been interest in developing early stage DAT biomarkers adopting a sMCI/pMCI stratification of images associated with a clinical diagnosis of MCI (Tong et al., 2017) . Our novel approach extends this MCI image stratification idea to the entire DAT spectrum by also stratifying the NC and DAT images into the sNC/uNC/pNC and eDAT/sDAT groups respectively. This enabled the validation of the FPDS in a realistic experimental setting that is quite close to a practical clinical setup, where images from the uNC, sMCI, pNC, pMCI and eDAT groups were completely blinded from the trained ensemble classification model. We put forth our stratification approach as an ideal benchmark to evaluate future DAT biomarker methods."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the stratified groups", "text": "The training and validation image sets used in our analysis were found to be unbiased with respect to the associated relevant non-imaging phenotypic information, justifying the ignoring of non-imaging covariates in the proposed supervised learning framework. The age, MMSE and CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values observed across the stratified groups did not reveal any anomalous group difference patterns (Tables 1 and 2) that could potentially confound the proposed FDG-PET imaging based analysis. Most importantly, the sNC and sDAT groups used for training the FPDS model had similar mean ages, and further as expected the sNC group had a significantly higher MMSE but a significantly lower t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 compared to the sDAT group. Moreover, mean ages among the sMCI, pMCI and eDAT groups in the validation image set were also comparable to the training groups. The other two validation groups namely uNC and pNC had slightly, yet statistically significantly higher mean ages (\u223c 3 years older) than the training groups. However, this significant group difference might just be reflective of a sampling bias given that the uNC (N=110) and pNC (N=58) groups have considerably fewer images compared to the training groups, sNC (N=753) and sDAT (N=464). The group differences in MMSE and t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values between the validation and training groups followed known patterns, where the DAT\u2212 groups (uNC and sMCI) showed significantly higher mean MMSE but significantly lower mean t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 when compared to the sDAT group, whereas the DAT+ groups (pNC, pMCI and eDAT) had significantly lower mean MMSE but significantly higher mean t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 in comparison to the sNC group."}, {"section_title": "FPDS computation model characteristics", "text": "Two aspects of the trained ensemble classification model warrant further discussion, viz., the ROIs chosen by the model for FPDS computation (Table 3) , and the model's predictive performance on the sNC and sDAT groups (Fig. 1) .\nThe ROIs selected by the ensemble model included parieto-temporal regions along with precuneus and cingulate gyrus. Recent studies have demonstrated the hypometabolism of parieto-temporal regions including precuneus and posterior cingulate as the earliest evidences for MCI progression to DAT (Arbizu et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2014) . Further, left hemisphere regions were chosen more often compared to their corresponding contralateral regions. Similar, preferential left sided hypometabolism was reported during early stages of DAT (Brown et al., 2014) . Hence, the ROIs chosen by the ensemble model for FPDS computation are consistent with established spatial hypometabolism patterns in DAT.\nThe ensemble model's FPDS predictions on the sNC and sDAT images were consistent with the fact that these images belong to individuals who are at the extremities of the DAT spectrum, i.e., the FPDS distributions of sNC and sDAT were skewed and only had a small overlap with AUCs of 0.95 and 0.98 for the baseline and follow-up subgroups respectively. Interestingly, among the sNC images with FPDS > 0.5 (misclassified as DAT+), the mean t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 was found to be slightly higher (0.42 vs 0.36, p=0.2463) than the sNC images with FPDS < =0.5 (correctly identified as DAT\u2212). Whereas, in sDAT images with FPDS < =0.5 (misclassified as DAT\u2212), the mean t-tau/ A\u03b2 1\u221242 was statistically significantly lower (0.84 vs 1.06, p=0.0073) when compared to sDAT images with FPDS > 0.5 (accurately labeled as DAT+). These observations agree with the positive correlations found between the t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and FPDS values among the sNC and sDAT groups respectively (Fig. 5) . The occurrence of DAT like metabolism patterns (higher FPDS) among the misclassified sNC might be owing to their increased t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values and in a similar manner the shift away from DAT metabolism patterns (lower FPDS) among the misclassified sDAT could be attributed to their relatively lower t-tau/ A\u03b2 1\u221242 values.\nThe predictive performance of the ensemble model is on par with (or better than) the sNC vs sDAT classification results published in the latest FDG-PET imaging based studies, which showed AUCs ranging from 0.93 on a cohort of 52 sNC and 51 sDAT images to 0.97 on a 117 sNC and 113 sDAT cohort (Li et al., 2017) . These studies evaluated their classification models using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, which is known (Bylander, 2002) to produce generalization error estimates (measure of predictive performance on unseen data) similar to that of the out-of-bag prediction scheme, that was used for evaluation of the ensemble model on baseline sNC and sDAT images. However, arguably the ensemble model's performance on the follow-up images gives a much better estimate of the generalization error, as the follow-up images were completely hidden during the ensemble model training process and hence can be considered as unseen data, despite their implicit relation to the corresponding baseline images. It's also important to highlight the relatively large sample size of the follow-up image set (393 sNC and 226 sDAT images) in comparison to the cohorts used in previous FDG-PET studies Li et al., 2017; Weiner et al., 2017) . This further underscores the confidence in the reported predictive performance of the ensemble model on sNC and sDAT groups."}, {"section_title": "Comprehensive evaluation of the FPDS computation model", "text": "The ensemble classification model's predictive performance evaluated on a large independent validation set of images (N=1767), taken from individuals at different stages of AD spectrum, provided a rigorous and a realistic way to assess the potential of using FPDS for DAT diagnosis (Fig. 2 ). The ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.78 in discriminating the DAT\u2212 (uNC and sMCI) and the DAT+ (pNC, pMCI and eDAT) groups, strongly advocating the consideration of FPDS as a DAT biomarker. A more detailed analysis of the FPDS predictions across the DAT\u2212 and DAT+ groups revealed a non-trivial association between the t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and FPDS values. The DAT\u2212 images with FPDS > 0.5 (misclassified as DAT+) had statistically significantly higher mean ttau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 (0.71 vs 0.49, p < 0.0001) compared to the DAT\u2212 images with FPDS < =0.5 (correctly labeled as DAT\u2212). While, the mean ttau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 among the DAT+ images with FPDS < =0.5 (misclassified as DAT\u2212) was found to be significantly lower (0.74 vs 0.94, p=0.0015) compared to the DAT+ images with FPDS > 0.5 (correctly labeled as DAT+). In light of these findings, along with the positive correlations observed between t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and FPDS within each of the DAT\u2212 and DAT+ groups (Fig. 6) , it can be speculated that the relatively higher t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values might be triggering the presence of DAT like metabolism patterns (higher FPDS) in misclassified DAT\u2212. Similarly, the comparatively lower t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values could be the underlying cause behind the lack of DAT like metabolism patterns (lower FPDS) among the misclassified DAT+.\nThe predicted FPDS values for the sMCI images were observed to increase with age (Fig. 3) , i.e., images corresponding to older subjects tended to have higher FPDS values compared to images taken from younger subjects. In particular, when comparing the two subgroups of sMCI images whose age ranges were above and below the average sMCI age of \u223c 75 years (Table 1) respectively, the mean FPDS for the images in the older subgroup was found to be significantly greater than the mean FPDS among the images from the younger subgroup (0.45 vs 0.22, p < 0.0001). Further, as could be expected based on the statistically significant positive correlation observed between FPDS and t-tau/ A\u03b2 1\u221242 in sMCI (r=0.2526 with p < 0.0001, Fig. 6 ), the older subgroup also showed a significantly higher mean t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 compared to the younger subgroup (0.61 vs 0.51, p < 0.0001). Apart from the sMCI group, none of the other uNC, pNC, pMCI and eDAT groups displayed any apparent age specific FPDS patterns (Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, among these groups a trend of positive correlations between t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and FPDS was observed (Fig. 6 ). This suggests a possible age independent causal relationship between t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and the occurrence of DAT like metabolism patterns.\nIn the pMCI group, the predicted FPDS values were found to decrease with longer time to conversion (Fig. 4) . Notably, the mean FPDS for the subgroup of images that were within 4 years to conversion was significantly higher than that of the image subgroup whose conversion times exceeded 4 years (0.67 vs 0.43, p < 0.0001). Moreover, in concordance with the positive correlation observed between t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 and FPDS among the pMCI (r=0.1312 with p < 0.0609, Fig. 6 ), the mean t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 for the within 4 years to conversion subgroup was also significantly higher compared to the subgroup with longer than 4-year conversion times (0.91 vs 0.66, p=0.0229). Based on these findings it is conceivable that, from around 4 years prior to a clinical diagnosis of DAT there might be a noticeable increase in the t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 causing a prevalence of DAT like metabolism patterns among the pMCI. While beyond the 4-year conversion window, it can be expected that there would be a considerable reduction in the appearance of DAT like metabolism patterns in pMCI. In fact, metabolic disruptions in an earlier NC stage of pMCI were found to be virtually undetectable as evidenced by the significantly lower mean FPDS of the pNC group compared to the pMCI (0.35 vs 0.63, p < 0.0001) and also indicated by the extremely low classification accuracy (0.28, Fig. 4 ) achieved on pNC images."}, {"section_title": "MCI conversion prediction -comparison with state-of-the-art", "text": "Several FDG-PET image analysis methods have previously been considered for addressing the task of predicting MCI to DAT conversion (Young et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015a,b; Lange et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Pagani et al., 2017; Inui et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017) . In these methods, the main idea is to train a binary classification model for separating the MCI into two groups, the sMCI which remain stable and the pMCI that convert to DAT in the future. Aside from the standard approach of using images from the sMCI and pMCI groups as training data (Wang et al., 2016; Pagani et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2014) , some of the methods have augmented the training process with information derived from the sNC and sDAT images as well (Liu et al., 2017; Lange et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2015a,b) . Further, akin to the proposed approach for training the FPDS computation model, there were a few methods that solely employed the sNC and sDAT images during the training phase (Young et al., 2013; Inui et al., 2017) .\nIn Table 4 , the sMCI vs pMCI classification results reported in the aforementioned works are summarized. Table 4 also shows the AUC achieved when using the FPDS to discriminate between the sMCI and the pMCI that are within 2, 3 and 5 years to conversion respectively. The proposed FPDS based approach outperformed almost all of the state-of-the-art methods achieving an AUC of more than 0.77 in each of the three time to conversion cases. Only Wang et al. (2016) and Pagani et al. (2017) reported higher AUCs than the proposed approach. However, these two methods reported the cross-validated AUC, whereas a more challenging independent validation experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the FPDS approach. Moreover, in Wang et al. (2016) and Pagani et al. (2017) , the classification model parameter tuning was done using the testing subsets of the cross-validation splits which leads to inflated estimates of the classification performance. In fact to avoid such an optimistic performance evaluation, the other methods reporting cross-validated AUCs (Zhu et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015a; Cheng et al., 2015b) used \"nested\" crossvalidation, where the classification model parameters were tuned on the training subsets of the cross-validation splits rather than the testing subsets. Last, it should be highlighted that the better performance of the FPDS approach was demonstrated on a considerably larger sample size (> 5x more images) compared to the other methods."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future directions", "text": "The results reported in this paper are understandably limited by the ADNI data characteristics. In general, the final (at time of death) clinical diagnosis for ADNI subjects is not known, this is because either the subjects are surviving or they were not followed-up around their demise. Consequently, it is possible that some subjects currently determined to be on the DAT\u2212 trajectory, i.e., with images belonging to the sNC/uNC/sMCI groups, might receive a clinical diagnosis of DAT in the future. While this is a limitation in our current results, in case the final diagnosis for such subjects becomes available, it would be interesting to review if the ensemble model had actually correctly predicted the sNC/uNC/sMCI images of these subjects as belonging to the DAT+ trajectory (FPDS > 0.5). Another limitation of the reported results, as mentioned before, is that the correlation analysis between the FPDS and t-tau/A\u03b2 1\u221242 values was reported only on a subset of the images owing to partial availability of CSF measures in the ADNI database. In spite of these ADNI data related limitations, it is important to note that both the novel stratification scheme and the ensemble classification framework proposed in our work have a more general applicability and are not specific to the ADNI cohort used in this study. In fact, as part of future work we plan to extend our methodology to incorporate multimodal imaging data and validate it on other relevant AD neuroimaging databases. "}]
