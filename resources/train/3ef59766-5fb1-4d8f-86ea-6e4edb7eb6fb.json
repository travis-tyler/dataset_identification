[7] [8] [9] Whether poorer walking performance previously observed in this group is also associated with impaired leg muscle mitochondrial function is unknown. We hypothesize that as is the case in PAD with ABI <0.90, an ABI of 0.90 to 1.10 is also associated with lower leg muscle mitochondrial energy production compared with an ABI of 1.11 to 1.40. To test this hypothesis, we examined the association between ABI and mitochondrial energy productions, assessed by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS), in participants of the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), free of clinically overt PAD."}, {"section_title": "Methods Sample", "text": "We analyzed data from 363 men and women participating in the BLSA with ABIs between 0.90 and 1.40, who underwent post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery rate (kPCr) measurement via 31P-MRS of the thigh muscle and ABI testing. Participants were divided in 2 groups: those with an ABI of 0.90 to 1.09 and those with an ABI of 1.10 to 1.40. The overall design, study population, and measurement protocols of the BLSA have been previously reported. 10 Briefly, the BLSA, established in 1958, is a continuous enrollment cohort study of community-dwelling adults conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program. Participants with no major chronic conditions or functional impairments are enrolled in the study and follow-up visits occur at intervals of 1 to 4 years, becoming more frequent for older participants. Trained and certified technicians administered all of the assessments, following standardized protocols.

BP cuffs were applied to the arms and ankles of patients and BP was recorded in triplicates. The ABI was calculated as the average of the triplicate readings of resting ankle systolic pressure of the index leg divided by the average of the left and right arm resting brachial systolic pressure readings.

Participants performed a rapid ballistic knee extension exercise while lying supine in the bore of the magnet; this maneuver was practiced before entering the magnet. 11, 12 A series of pulse-acquire 31P spectra were obtained before, during, and after the knee extension exercise. The pulse sequence consisted of adiabatic radiofrequency excitation pulses with a 90-degree flip angle, for 300 acquisitions, with a repetition time of 1.5 seconds; signal averaging over 4 successive acquisitions for signal-to-noise ratio enhancement, gave effectively 75 spectra obtained with a temporal resolution of 6 seconds.

Interestingly, in this study, the positive association between ABI and lower muscle energy production was linear along the entire ABI range of 1.10 to 1.40."}, {"section_title": "Lower ABI is Linearly Associated With Reduced Mitochondrial Energy Production", "text": "These findings expand on previous reports showing a significant reduction in mitochondrial energy production in patients with PAD [2] [3] [4] and suggest that even modest alterations in lower extremity perfusion may cause reduced muscle mitochondrial energy production. The mechanism that links ABI with muscle mitochondrial energetics is not clear. There is a debate on whether the reduced mitochondrial energy production in PAD is a result of decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery during exercise or results from intrinsic mitochondrial impairment caused by repetitive cycles of ischemia-reperfusion injury. 2 Decreased perfusion via cuff-induced stenosis causes a reduction in postexercise mitochondrial energy production in healthy men and women, supporting the notion that reduced oxygen delivery during exercise affects mitochondrial function. 5 Further studies with assessment of leg arterial anatomy and flow are needed to examine whether a modest reduction in ABI is a result of subclinical flow limiting lesion in arteries of the lower extremities.\nAn additional explanation of the linear association between ABI and mitochondrial function within the \"normal\" range is that a modest reduction in ABI is a marker of arterial stiffness, which has been associated with universal organ dysfunction with aging, and not restricted to the legs. A normal ABI (1.10-1.40) reflects physiologic pulse pressure amplification, ie, higher systolic BP, in distal versus proximal arterial sites. 8, 27 This phenomena is caused by the stiffer peripheral versus central arteries and by wave reflection hemodynamics that amplify pressure to a greater extent in distal versus proximal arterial sites. Given the profound central arterial stiffening and alterations to wave reflection dynamics with aging, 28 peripheral amplification and subsequently ABI are reduced. Hence, a modest reduction in ABI within the range of 1.1 to 1.4 could also be a marker of central arterial stiffness, and not necessarily a reflection of limb-specific flow impairment. Further studies with a larger sample size and repeated measures are needed to examine whether measures of arterial stiffness and pulse pressure amplification explain the association between ABI and mitochondrial energy production and functional capacity."}, {"section_title": "Reduced Mitochondrial Energy Production as a Potential Link Between Low ABI and Impaired Walk Endurance", "text": "McDermott et al 29 have shown that an ABI between 0.90 and 1.10 was associated with reduced functional capacity measured by 6-meter walking speed. Furthermore, an ABI of 0.90 to 1.10 was prospectively associated with a greater decline in 6-minute walk performance as well as a greater risk for developing mobility loss over 5 years, when compared with an ABI of 1.11 to 1.40. 9 These findings suggest that a gradual decline in ABI may be a marker of subclinical atherosclerotic disease in the lower extremities as well as in other organs that cumulatively affect lower extremity performance. 8 Our findings suggest that a possible modest restriction of blood flow with lower ABI could potentially compromise muscle mitochondrial function and directly contribute to poorer walking function in this group. We have previously reported, using data from the same cohort, that reduced mitochondrial energy production was associated with less exercise endurance, assessed by 400-meter walking speed. 30 Future studies are needed to demonstrate whether modest reduction of ABI when associated with impaired mitochondrial function predicts the risk of developing overt PAD. In addition, our findings raise the question of whether persons with ABIs of 0.90 to 1.10 would benefit from interventions aimed at preventing further mitochondrial damage and, therefore, its functional consequences and perhaps even full development of PAD."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between skeletal muscle mitochondrial energy production assessed by 31P-MRS of thigh muscle and ABI over the range of ABI of 0.90 to 1.40. However, it is important to consider the study limitations. This is a cross-sectional analysis; hence, inferences regarding causality cannot be made. The design of the BLSA prevented the inclusion of participants with PAD, which would have provided a wider range of ABI and kPCr. However, we believe that this topic has been studied in a PAD population, making the findings of this report complementary to those previously reported.\nIn addition, the magnitude of difference between the 2 groups is smaller compared with that reported between normal and PAD. While this is expected, it raises questions about the clinical relevance of these findings. We have previously reported, using data from this cohort, that kPCR was strongly associated with 400-meter walking speed, 30 which suggests that even such variations in this normal range might underlie subclinical alterations in function. We are in the process of collecting longitudinal data of ABI, mitochondrial function, and walking endurance from a larger sample, which will allow further elaboration on these findings.\nAnother limitation of our study is that mitochondrial testing was performed on the thigh muscle. This is likely to be affected only by proximal flow limitation compared with calf muscles, which are more frequently involved. Last, we measured ABI using the oscillometric rather than the auscultatory technique. This technique does not provide separate tibial and peroneal measures. However, the oscillometric technique has the clear advantage of being less operator dependent."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "An ABI of 0.91 to 1.10 is associated with reduced mitochondrial energy production.
