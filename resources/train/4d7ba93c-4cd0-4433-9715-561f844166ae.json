[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using a chronic anaesthetised preparation, we measured hemodynamic responses evoked by sensory stimulation and respiratory gases in the J20-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease over a period of 3 months. We showed that neurovascular responses were preserved compared to age matched wildtype controls. These results failed to confirm previous investigations reporting a marked reduction of neurovascular coupling in the J20-AD mouse model. However, when our procedure involved acute surgical procedures, previously reported neurovascular deficits were observed. The effects of acute electrode implantation were caused by disturbances to baseline physiology rather than a consequence of the disease condition. These results highlight the importance of experimental procedure when determining the characteristics of animal models of human disease.\nNeurovascular coupling is the process by which neural activity causes localised changes in cerebral blood flow. Impaired neurovascular coupling has been suggested as an early pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and if so, could serve as an early biomarker of cerebral pathology. We have established an anaesthetic regime in which evoked hemodynamic responses are comparable to those in awake mice. This protocol was adapted to allow repeated measurements of neurovascular function over three months in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD (J20-AD) and wild-type (WT) controls. Animals were 9-12 months old at the start of the experiment, which is when deficits due to the disease condition would be expected.\nMice were chronically prepared with a cranial window through which optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS) was used to generate functional maps of the cerebral blood volume and saturation changes evoked by whisker stimulation and vascular reactivity challenges. Unexpectedly, the hemodynamic responses were largely preserved in the J20-AD group. This result failed to confirm previous investigations using the J20-AD model. However, a final acute electrophysiology and OIS experiment was performed to measure both neural and hemodynamic responses concurrently. In this experiment, previously reported deficits in neurovascular coupling in the J20-AD model were observed. This suggests that J20-AD mice may be more susceptible to the physiologically stressing conditions of an acute experimental procedure compared to WT animals. These results therefore highlight the importance of experimental procedure when determining the characteristics of animal models of human disease."}, {"section_title": "Introduction (631/650 words)", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans currently has no effective treatment. Most of our recent insights into the causes of AD are linked to the discovery of increased amounts of Beta-Amyloid plaques associated with significant neuronal loss (Hardy, 1992) . Despite the large investment in both clinical and pre-clinical research resources focussed on the Beta-Amyloid hypothesis, no effective preventative or remedial treatment has so far been found. Consequently, alternative theories regarding the onset and development of AD have been proposed. One of the notable rival hypotheses is the Neurovascular Degeneration Hypothesis (NDH), first proposed by Zlokovic (Zlokovic, 2010 (Zlokovic, , 2011 . It suggests that a functional deficit within cells of the neurovascular unit (neurons, glial cells, pericytes and vascular cells) would deprive active neurones of adequate oxygen and glucose, which could either be the initial trigger of AD, or significantly add to the disease burden. If correct, the NDH would offer the potential for developing new treatments based on targeting identified dysfunctional cells in the neurovascular unit. With the aid of modern neuroimaging methods (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging -fMRI) measurements of the progressive breakdown of neurovascular coupling (NVC) could also act as an early biomarker of AD. A recent study analysing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, (Iturria-Medina et al., 2016)) suggested that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be the earliest pathological event to emerge, possibly marking the beginning of the disease process. This report alone highlights the need for more research into the NDH.\nA problem facing investigations of the neurovascular unit is that the technologies currently used with human subjects do not have the spatial and temporal resolution required to understand the basic mechanistic processes involved. To address this issue transgenic mouse models of AD have been developed and now play an important role in investigating the underlying mechanisms responsible for the AD-like disease state. These transgenic mouse models may not perfectly replicate the human condition, however, it is hoped that they share the critical features to enable us to discover the underlying mechanisms responsible for the condition (Ameen-Ali et al., 2017) . The pre-clinical AD mouse models allow the use of more invasive technologies to measure both hemodynamic and neuronal variables in more detail throughout disease development. Consequently, several groups have reported disruptions to NVC in transgenic AD mice that overexpress human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) (Lacoste et al., 2013 , Ongali et al., 2014 , Park et al., 2014 , Royea et al., 2017 . These studies used laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) from a restricted cortical region in acutely anaesthetised animals.\nTo extend these investigations we have developed a chronic mouse preparation that is sufficiently stable to permit repeated measures of neurovascular function across a 3 month period when the disease state is present (Sharp et al., 2015) .\nConsequently, with the J20-AD mice and age matched wild type controls temporarily anaesthetised, we used repeated measures 2-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) to record neurovascular responses evoked by sensory stimulation and vascular reactivity challenges. A final acute experiment was conducted in which 2D-OIS and multi-channel electrophysiology were performed simultaneously. Contrary to expectation, our chronic imaging studies found little or no difference in the hemodynamic responses between J20-AD and WT animals across a range of sensory stimulations and gas challenges. However, in the final acute experiment, reduced NVC function similar to that reported in previous investigations (Lacoste et al., 2013 , Ongali et al., 2014 , Park et al., 2014 , Royea et al., 2017 was observed. This difference suggests that the J20-AD mice are more susceptible to the physiological stresses incurred by acute experimental procedures compared with WT controls. These results indicate that experimental conditions are critical when characterising mouse models of human disease, and differences in methodology are likely responsible for the variable and sometimes incompatible results frequently seen in mouse pre-clinical neurovascular studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Anesthesia and cranial window surgery. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the UK Government, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the European directive 2010/63/EU, and approved by the University of Sheffield Ethical review and licensing committee. Two groups of 5 animals were used: (i) heterozygous transgenic male C57BL/6 mice that overexpress human APP (hAPP) carrying the human Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations under control of the PDGF\u03b2 chain promoter (hAPP-J20 line); and (ii) male wild type controls. All animals were between 9 and 12 months on the date of surgical preparation. Animals were anesthetized with fentanyl-fluanisone (Hypnorm, Vetapharm Ltd), midazolam (Hypnovel, Roche Ltd) and sterile water (1:1:2 by volume; 7.0 ml/kg,i.p.) for surgery, while anaesthesia during the imaging experiments was further maintained with isoflurane (0.5-0.8%) in 100% oxygen. A homoeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus) maintained rectal temperature at 37 \u02daC.\nMice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) and a dental drill was used to thin the skull overlying the right somatosensory cortex to translucency thereby forming an optical window (~4mm 2 ). A thin layer of clear cyanoacrylate cement was applied to reinforce and smooth the window. This reduced specular reflections during imaging and prevented skull regrowth during the 3-month experimental period. A stainless steel imaging chamber was secured over the thinned cranial window using dental cement. This chamber was used to stabilise the head during imaging sessions. After surgery animals were left to recover for a minimum of 7 days before chronic experimental imaging sessions commenced.\nDuring this period animals were monitored regularly and weighed to ensure they did not fall below 90% of surgical day body weight."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Design", "text": "All animals were imaged using an anaesthetised condition adapted from our previous published methodology (Sharp et al., 2015) .

In the last session a 16-channel electrode was placed in the active whisker barrel region (see below for method of localisation) to provide a measure of concurrent hemodynamic and neural activity. Each session began with an induction of anaesthesia (see methods)\nfollowed after 1hour by 2D-OIS. In the last acute (4 th ) imaging session imaging started 30 minutes after the electrode had been inserted. Each 2D-OIS session comprised 8 separate experiments performed in a set order. Each experiment separated from the previous one by ~3mins during which time we acquired a dark image used to remove camera noise from the spectroscopy data.\nExp1: Short duration sensory stimulation breathing 100% oxygen: With the animal breathing oxygen (100%) there were 30 successive trials of 25s. 5s after the start of each trial whisker stimulation was administered for 2s.

Images were then analysed on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a modified Beer-Lambert law, which used the generated mean photon path lengths, to convert the detected attenuation for each wavelength into predicted absorption. The absorption values were then used to generate 2D spatiotemporal image-series of the estimates of the changes in total hemoglobin (Hbt), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hbr) from the baseline values. All experiments started with the animal breathing 100% oxygen, for this condition we assumed a concentration of hemoglobin in tissue at 100\u03bcM and saturation set at 70%. We then used the gas transition experiment 3 to assess how these baselines changed when the animal breathed normal air. This was calculated on an individual animal basis. The baseline blood volume and saturation values in air were consistent for both WT and J20-AD mice (Hbt concentration WT=99.3\u00b10.42sem, AD=99.7\u00b10.47sem; Saturation WT=62.6%\u00b10.6, AD = 62.6\u00b10.6).

Separate 2-way repeated measures ANOVA's were performed for Hbt, Hbo and Hbr for each of the 5 whisker stimulation experiments (Exp1,2,4,5,7, results shown in Table 1 ).

In these circumstances the baseline values for both WT and J20-AD seemed to be recovering from a prior event. This was especially evident during the initial phase of the session (exp1 and 2). Also obvious was that the prior event caused the J20-AD perturbation from baseline to be larger than the WT animals. Our supposition is that the perturbation at the beginning of the experimental session was indicative of a cortical spreading depression (CSD) that was caused by the acute electrode insertion.

For Hbt the first PCA almost always highlighted major branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) responding to the stimulus (Fig 8b) .\nThis reflected strong activation of the arterial tree on the surface of the brain. For Hbr the first PCA showed how strongly the surface veins were changing in saturation as Hbr was decreased due to the large increase in fresh blood arriving to the cortex.\nAfter selecting arterial and vein regions (Fig 8f-i) , clear differences were observed in both groups, not only in the magnitude of the chronic and acute responses (described above) but in the return to baseline depending on whether the animal was breathing 100% oxygen or medical air.

However, compared to the chronic imaging sessions, we found that the magnitude of evoked-responses of both WT and J20-AD mice were reduced, with the J20-AD mice affected to a significantly greater extent. We draw a general conclusion that well-controlled procedures are necessary to separate the effects of methodological confounds from genuine effects of pathophysiological changes induced by the disease state being tested."}, {"section_title": "Preservation of neurovascular coupling in the J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.", "text": "Why in the stable chronic recording phase of our study did we fail to replicate the neurovascular deficits reported previously? First, we used similar whisker stimulation protocols to the studies that reported 35-50% reductions in the cerebral blood flow responses of J20-AD mice from 7 months of age. Our subjects were 9-12 months old at the start of the study. Both our and previous experiments were all performed with anaesthetised mice. However, previous studies (Lacoste et al., 2013 , Ongali et al., 2014 , Royea et al., 2017 conducted few stimulation presentations (4-6 stimulation trials per animal), in the anaesthetised mouse immediately following acute procedures to thin the skull. At the outset, we sought to extend these findings by using 2D-OIS to resolve changes in different vascular compartments with repeated testing in a chronically prepared preparation. Informed by our previous work with an awake head restrained preparation (Sharp et al., 2015) , we adopted a refined anaesthetised protocol that permitted extended (3hr) imaging sessions repeatedly over weeks. Under anaesthesia, the haemodynamic responses evoked by sensory stimulation in this chronic preparation were comparable to those seen previously with awake animals (Sharp et al., 2015) . Another difference was the present protocol involved a more detailed set of experimental variables, i.e. sequences of multiple trials (120) with different duration whisker stimulations (2s and 16s), with and without vascular reactivity gas challenges. Also, our protocol enabled us to generate an average experimental session by averaging the sequence of hemodynamic time series from all chronically prepared subjects ( Figure 5 and 6 ). These data show, not only that responses to individual sensory stimulations could be observed, but that the haemodynamic baseline values were stable throughout the session. Under our more stringent chronic conditions and more detailed testing we failed to replicate the previously reported haemodynamic deficits in J20-AD mice. Therefore, our conclusion must be that neurovascular function is still largely preserved in the J20-AD mouse in this age range."}, {"section_title": "Acute experimental conditions", "text": "Given these essentially negative results from the first three chronic experimental sessions, we looked for correspondences between haemodynamic and neural responses in a final acute experimental session. Significantly, this phase of the study involved acute experimental conditions akin to those used in the previous investigations (Lacoste et al., 2013 , Ongali et al., 2014 , Royea et al., 2017 . After the electrode insertion we noted that that baseline hemodynamics were altered.\nSpecifically, there was a significant reduction in blood volume and saturation that gradually recovered to normal stable levels towards the end of the session.\nSignificantly, the baseline changes were larger for the AD mice compared with the WT controls. We therefore suggest that acute procedures, in our case the insertion of a multi-channel electrode, likely causes a cortical spreading depression (CSD).\nThis is characterised by an alternating vasoconstriction and dilation that can last over 90 minutes, and is known to affect neurovascular coupling profoundly (Piilgaard and Lauritzen, 2009, Chang et al., 2010) . Therefore, differential rates of recovery from CSD between the J20-AD and WT mice is the most likely explanation of the differences in haemodynamic performance between the groups. Also important, Chang et al (2010) reported that hemodynamic recovery from CSD takes longer than the recovery of neural activity. This could explain the lack of correspondence between the neural (no differences) and haemodynamic measures (significant differences) between the WT and J20-AD groups in the final acute phase of our study. Supporting this interpretation, electrode insertion in mice induced a robust CSD response across the whole cortex (Eles et al., 2018) . If CSD is the culprit, why should J20 mice be more susceptible to its deleterious effects? It is known that J20 mice exhibit hypertrophic astrocytes and activated microglia in the cortex near beta amyloid plaques (Ameen-Ali et al., 2017) . If these cells were sensitized as part of the disease process, the CSD event could be more profound in J20-AD animals. The larger baseline disturbance in the J20-AD animals at the start of recording in the final acute experimental session would be consistent with this suggestion (Figure 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Oxygen Vs Air response shape", "text": "A further unexpected result was that, regardless of mouse model, the shape of hemodynamic response changed according to whether the animal was breathing oxygen or air. The overall response magnitude was reduced and there was an undershoot in the return to baseline when the animals were breathing air, compared with when they were breathing oxygen. This difference was driven by the arterial response (see Figure 8 ). In contemporary neurovascular research the prevailing view is that coupling is more likely to be neurogenic in origin, compared to metabolically driven changes in blood flow (Kennerley et al., 2012 , Urban et al., 2012 . However, as the neural responses evoked by 2s sensory stimulation were remarkably similar between the air and oxygen conditions (Figure 7 ), the observed differences appear to be a direct effect of inspired oxygen controlling the arterial response, particularly in the return to baseline. Previous in vitro experiments (Gordon et al., 2008) , reported that levels of oxygen can dictate whether an artery dilates or constricts in response to a stimulus, and that this is mediated by different responses of astrocytes. Interestingly, a recent 2-photon microscopy study (Uhlirova et al., 2016) reported similar arterial responses to mouse sensory stimulation. In some cases the responses had a bi-phasic shape (similar to our air condition) while in others, there was have a gradual return to baseline without overshoot (similar to our oxygen condition). No reasons were given to why the same sensory stimulus produced a varying arteriolar responses. However, an important conclusion from this aspect of our study is that tissue oxygen levels may be an important determinant of neurovascular control and warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the study", "text": "Our current spectroscopy algorithm requires an estimation of both a level of blood volume and saturation. Although, previous published research used LDF, which has a similar weakness, arterial spin labelling studies suggest that baseline CBF is reduced in J20-AD mice (Hebert et al., 2013) . We mitigated these effects by measuring changes in baseline volume and saturation in our animals when switching from breathing oxygen to air. If there were differences in saturation between the two groups, this would be evidence that our estimated baselines values were inaccurate.\nHowever, the consistency of the results between the WT and AD mice suggests that under the oxygen condition, our estimates were appropriate. Moreover, even if estimates of volume and saturation were wrong, the fractional change in Hbt response would be unaffected. We have run the data across a range of assumed Hbt baselines and this produces no difference in the fractional change in Hbt response ( Figure 9 ).\nFinally, it must be noted that all our experiments were performed under anaesthesia, which of course is a non-physiological state. To some extent this is mitigated by our previous investigation (Sharp et al., 2015) that showed the responses in the present study were comparable to those seen previously with awake animals. On the positive side, the current anaesthetised preparation provides a more stable imaging platform where the effects of controlled small mechanical stimulations can be observed. Importantly, baseline perturbations, such as caused by the insertion of an electrode, are easier to detect in the absence of uncontrolled motivational and movement variables that are often inherent in awake experimental protocols."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions.", "text": "Contrary to previous reports of neurovascular deficits J20-AD mice, under the stable chronic imaging conditions we found that the neurovascular performance of J20-AD did not differ reliably from that of WT controls. However, the acute phase of the current study showed the J20-AD mice to be more susceptible to disruptive interventions, such as the acute experimental procedures used in the current and previous investigations. The J20-AD mouse model may, therefore, represent an ideal model to explore the effects of mixed pathologies with conditions such as atherosclerosis that would further compromise neurovascular function.
