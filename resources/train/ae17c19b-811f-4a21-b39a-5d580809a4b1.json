Moreover, it is unknown whether physical activity status influences age-related increases in arterial stiffness in females. Arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI, applanation tonometry) were measured in 53 healthy females, including 10 premenopausal (Pre-S) and 18 postmenopausal (Post-S) sedentary women, and 9 premenopausal (Pre-PA) and 16 postmenopausal (Post-PA) physically active women. In the sedentary women, there were no age-related differences in arterial blood pressure, but aortic PWV and carotid AI (measures of central arterial stiffness) were higher (P\u03fd.01) in Post-S versus Pre-S (1065\u03ee110 versus 690\u03ee80 cm/sec and 16.5%\u03ee1.8% versus 0.3%\u03ee1.6%, respectively); however, there were no significant differences in leg and arm PWV (measures of peripheral arterial stiffness). Systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were higher (P\u03fd.05) in Post-PA versus Pre-PA. Despite this and in contrast to the sedentary women, aortic PWV and AI were not different in Post-PA versus Pre-PA. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that maximal oxygen consumption, plasma total cholesterol, and plasma LDL-cholesterol were significant independent predictors and together explained up to 50% of the variability in central arterial stiffness.

They were divided into two groups according to their physical activity status. The sedentary groups consisted of 10 Pre-S and 18 Post-S women, none of whom performed regular exercise. The physically active groups consisted of 9 Pre-PA and 16 Post-PA women who had been performing endurance exercise training for at least the past 2 years (mean, 13\u03ee1 year), and were actively competing in running road races. On average, the endurance-trained women exercised for 6\u03ee1 h/wk.

In principle, the flattening or applanation of the curved surface of a pressurecontaining structure under the detecting device allows direct measurement of arterial pressure pulse within the structure. This tonometer has been shown to register a pressure wave with harmonic content that does not differ from that of an intra-arterially recorded wave, and the use of the tonometer on an exposed artery records a waveform identical to that recorded intra-arterially. 12 Waveforms were recorded on a Gould recorder at a high speed of 100 mm/sec. All measurements were performed by the same investigators. Recordings were taken only when reproducible signals could be obtained with high-amplitude excursion. The peak of the R wave from the simultaneously recorded ECG was used as a timing marker. A minimum of 20 consecutively recorded pulse waves were analyzed and averaged as previously described. 3, 13 All the analyses were performed manually by the same investigator who was blinded to the group assignment. The measured pressure waveform consists of both a \"forward\" or \"incident\" wave, and a \"reflected\" wave that is returning from a peripheral site. The reflected wave is superimposed on the incident wave such that the pulse and systolic pressures are increased. This increase is defined as a pressure pulse AI, and it is calculated as pressure wave above its systolic shoulder (\u232cP) divided by pulse pressure. 3, 13 The shoulder was defined as the first concavity on the upstroke of the wave and separates the initial systolic pressure rise from the late systolic peak. The carotid AI has been proposed as an indicator of the magnitude of wave reflections, which is closely linked to arterial stiffness. 3 In the present study, carotid AI was used as a measure of the stiffness of the central arteries. The reliability of the AI measurement in our laboratory was established by sequential measurement on 8 adult men and women of varying age on two separate days. Carotid AI was 5.0%\u03ee3.2% versus 4.8%\u03ee2.9% for trial 1 versus trial 2 (not significant); the mean coefficient of variation was 7%."}, {"section_title": "PWV", "text": "PWV is measured from the foot of pressure waves recorded at two points along the path of the arterial pulse wave, and is calculated from the measurement of pulse transit time (or time delay) and the distance traveled between two arterial recording sites.\n14 Two identical transcutaneous Doppler flowmeters (model 810-A, Parks Medical) were used to obtain the pulse wave (1) between the aortic arch and the femoral artery (aortic PWV); (2) between the femoral and posterior tibial artery (leg PWV); and (3) between the brachial and radial artery (arm PWV), as previously described by Avolio et al. 1 Distance traveled by the pulse wave was assessed in duplicate with a random zero length measurement over the surface of the body with a nonelastic tape measure. The peak of the R wave from the simultaneously recorded ECG was used as a timing marker. A minimum of 20 simultaneously recorded waveforms were analyzed and averaged as described previously. 1 All the analyses were performed by the same trained technician who was blinded to the group assignment.

PWV was calculated from distance (cm) divided by transit time (sec). Transit time was determined from the time delay between the proximal and the distal foot waveforms. The foot of the wave was identified as the commencement of the sharp systolic upstroke. The test-retest reliability of our PWV measurements was established using the experimental approach described for AI above. The mean PWV combined for three sites was 973\u03ee56 versus 956\u03ee54 cm/sec for trial 1 versus trial 2 (not significant).

Importantly, aortic PWV and carotid AI were \u03f330% and 50% lower (P\u03fd.01), respectively, in Post-PA versus Post-S.\nIn the present study, we found that aortic PWV and carotid AI levels were \u03f330% to 50% lower in Post-PA compared with Post-S. Our results support the recent findings of Vaitkevicious and colleagues from the BLSA, 2 in which physically active older males demonstrated \u03f325% to 35% lower levels of carotid AI and aortic PWV than their sedentary age-matched peers. However, because no data on active young adults were presented in their study, it is possible that young active males might also have exhibited reduced arterial stiffness compared with age-matched sedentary males. Thus, similar increases in central arterial stiffness with age may have been present in active and sedentary males.\nThe present study extends our current understanding of the relation between physical activity, aging, and arterial stiffness in at least two ways. First, by establishing that central arterial stiffness is similar in active versus sedentary young adults, our findings indicate that the lower levels of central arterial stiffness observed in middle-aged and older physically trained subjects appear to be caused by an absence of an increase with age. Second, our study demonstrates this beneficial association between regular physical activity, aging, and arterial elasticity in women, in whom the age-related risk of cardiovascular disease is markedly elevated after menopause. 20 It is not clear how regular physical activity may prevent increases in central arterial stiffness with age. One possibility is that arterial blood pressure does not increase as much with age in physically active women. However, in the present study the active postmenopausal women demonstrated higher levels of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure and pulse pressure than the active premenopausal women. Thus, there was an absence of central stiffening with age despite a modest elevation in arterial blood pressure. This apparent dissociation between age-related elevations in arterial pressure and stiffness may be explained by the fact that the resting blood pressure of the active postmenopausal women was still within the normotensive range (Table 2 ). Another possibility is that regular physical activity minimizes age-related structural changes in the arterial wall. In this regard, the endurance-trained state has been shown to be associated with an elevated overall content of elastin and a reduced calcium content of elastin in rat aorta. 25 A third possibility is that regular physical activity may act to maintain endothelium-dependent vasodilation with age, as recently reported."}, {"section_title": "Physiological Correlates of Arterial Stiffness", "text": "Univariate correlation analyses were performed to determine which physiological variables were most closely associated with arterial stiffness. Because the correlated variables and correlation coefficients were similar in the sedentary and physically active groups and when grouped separately by age (ie, premenopausal and postmenopausal), the data were pooled and presented together. The relations between aortic PWV and selected correlates of interest are depicted in systolic blood pressure (r\u03ed0.46 and 0.42), mean arterial blood pressure (r\u03ed0.40 and 0.42), plasma total cholesterol (r\u03ed0.56 and 0.52), and plasma LDL-cholesterol (r\u03ed0.56 and 0.48), respectively. Aortic PWV and carotid AI were not significantly related to height, diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, dietary sodium intake, urinary sodium excretion, plasma HDLcholesterol, or fasting glucose or insulin concentrations. A modest, but significant correlation (r\u03ed0.43, P\u03fd.01) existed between carotid AI and aortic PWV. There were no significant correlations between arm or leg PWV and the other subject characteristics, with the exception of correlations between systolic blood pressure and leg PWV (r\u03ed0.40, P\u03fd.01) and between fasting insulin concentration and arm PWV (r\u03ed\u03ea0.40, P\u03fd.01). Arm and leg PWV were not significantly related to aortic PWV.\nTo establish which of these correlates were independent predictors of arterial stiffness in the overall population, we performed stepwise regression analyses. The variables that entered for carotid AI were V O 2 max, which explained 25% of the variability (P\u03fd.001), and total cholesterol, which explained an additional 5% of the variability (P\u03fd.05). For aortic PWV, V O 2 max appeared first in the analysis and explained 41% of the variability (P\u03fd.0001); an additional 8% of variability in aortic PWV was explained by LDL-cholesterol (P\u03fd.05). No other variables entered were significant predictors.\nSeveral factors in addition to arterial blood pressure are known to be related to the elasticity of arteries. We found that central arterial stiffness was significantly related to body fatness, aerobic fitness, systolic blood pressure, and the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile in the present study sample of healthy females. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that aerobic fitness, plasma total cholesterol, and plasma LDL-cholesterol levels were the significant independent correlates of central arterial stiffness.\nAerobic fitness is a major determinant of overall physiological functional capacity, and low levels of aerobic fitness have recently been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality. 8, 27 The present finding of a significant inverse relation between measures of central arterial stiffness and maximal oxygen consumption in general supports recent results from the BLSA. 2 However, whereas an association between aortic PWV and aerobic fitness was observed primarily in the older cohort in that study, we found significant relations (r\u03ed\u03ea0.5 to \u03ea0.7) in each age and activity subgroup, as in the overall pooled population. Thus, collectively, the present findings and those from the BLSA 2 suggest that central arterial stiffness may be one factor responsible for the inverse relation between premature mortality and aerobic fitness in middle-aged and older men and women.\nFinally, increased arterial stiffness has been proposed as a potential mechanism in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, 4, 28 although the exact mechanistic link has not been established. The strong univariate correlations between plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and central arterial stiffness, and in particular, the independent association with plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels suggest that dyslipidemia may play a role in the relation between central arterial stiffness and the risk of atherosclerosis in women. 4 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion Arterial Stiffness in Premenopausal versus Postmenopausal Sedentary Women", "text": "Healthy postmenopausal sedentary women demonstrated significantly higher levels of aortic PWV and carotid AI compared with premenopausal females, indicating an age-associated increase in central arterial stiffness. A novel aspect of the present study was that the elevated central arterial stiffness was observed with age in the sedentary women in the absence of increases in arterial blood pressure. In previous studies 1, 2 reporting stiffening of central arteries with age in females, at least modest increases in arterial blood pressure, an important correlate of arterial stiffness, were present. Thus, our data indicate a primary effect of aging in the increase in the stiffness of central arteries observed in healthy sedentary postmenopausal women. This increase in arterial stiffness, however, may precede an age-related elevation in blood pressure in these women.\nThere are several possible explanations for the influence of aging on the loss of elasticity of central arteries. The most likely explanation appears to be age-associated structural changes in the arterial wall. Aging is associated with a decrease in elastin and an increase in collagen and connective tissues in the arterial wall. 16, 17 Fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina with age has also been observed in human thoracic aorta. 17 Age-related increases in central arterial stiffness do not appear to be dependent on the presence of clinical atherosclerotic disease. The stiffening of arteries has been observed in a Chinese population in whom the prevalence of atherosclerosis is very low 1 as well as in rigorously screened US men and women. 2 However, in the present study, there was a modest correlation between arterial stiffness and plasma cholesterol levels. There- fore, we cannot exclude the possibility that subclinical atherosclerosis contributed to the age-related elevation in central arterial stiffness in the sedentary women. In contrast to the central arteries studied, there was no obvious age-associated increase in the stiffness of the peripheral arteries in the present population of healthy normotensive females. In hypertensive subjects, it has been reported that the common carotid arteries demonstrate a greater increase in rigidity with age than the common femoral arteries. 18 Such differential effects of aging on the stiffness of central versus peripheral arteries may be related to their distinct roles in hemodynamic regulation. Compared with the central arteries whose cushioning function damps fluctuations in flow, the peripheral arteries do not exhibit the same extent of pulsatile changes in diameter 19 and, as such, may not undergo the adaptations leading to a loss of elasticity.\nOur findings of an increase in central arterial stiffness with age even in healthy normotensive women may have a number of clinical implications. Arterial stiffness recently has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, 4 the prevalence of which increases markedly after menopause. 20 The stiffening of arteries also is thought to result in impairments in baroreflex sensitivity, which could play a role in the increased prevalence of orthostatic hypotension observed with age. [21] [22] [23] Moreover, increased central arterial stiffness would act to increase the afterload imposed on the left ventricle, contributing to ventricular hypertrophy, and eventually, left ventricular ischemia and dysfunction, which are known to increase with age in women. 24 Importantly, our results suggest that even healthy normotensive postmenopausal women face the clinical risks of these increases in central arterial stiffness."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "In summary, we have shown that central, but not peripheral, arterial stiffness increases with age in sedentary healthy females in the absence of age-related increases in arterial blood pressure. The age-associated stiffening of central arteries did not occur in physically active females, suggesting that high levels of physical activity may prevent increases in arterial stiffness with advancing age in women. Finally, aerobic fitness, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were found to be significant independent physiological correlates of central arterial stiffness in healthy females varying in age and physical activity status. Our findings suggest that an absence of increases in arterial stiffness with age may contribute to the lower incidence of cardiovascular disease observed in postmenopausal women who exercise regularly."}]
