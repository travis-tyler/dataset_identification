[{"section_title": "Scientists and Engineers in the United States", "text": "Data from SESTAT show that as of October 2010, scientists are about 17% of the S&E workforce, with computer and information scientists constituting the largest group. Engineers are about 7% of the S&E workforce. A majority of engineers work in three fields: electrical engineering (25%), mechanical engineering (19%), and civil engineering (15%). Nearly one-third of individuals in the S&E workforce have S&E-related occupations, with the largest concentration being in healthrelated professions (62%). Other detailed data from SESTAT show that 44% of individuals who were trained as scientists (especially in the social sciences) or engineers work in non-S&E occupations. Thirty percent of these individuals work in other non-S&E occupations, a category that encompasses a wide variety of jobs. Women are 45% of the overall S&E workforce and hold 28% of S&E jobs. Female scientists and engineers constitute 68% of individuals who work in health-related occupations. In science occupations, 67% of psychologists are women. Of individuals in engineering occupations, 87% are men. Nearly three-quarters of employed scientists and engineers are white, and most (70%) scientists and engineers in S&E occupations are white. Asian scientists and engineers are the next largest group, constituting 18% of employment in S&E occupations."}, {"section_title": "NSCG", "text": "The NSCG is the core of SESTAT, providing data collected over time that detail the characteristics of the entire college-educated population in the United States. Its population of college graduates includes scientists and engineers who hold at least a bachelor's degree. The NSCG provides information on individuals educated or employed in S&E fields and non-S&E fields. Of the nearly 52 million collegeeducated persons represented by the 2010 NSCG, 59% reported their highest degree to be in a non-S&E degree field. Another 12% reported their highest degree to be in an S&E-related degree field, predominately health fields. About 28% reported S&E fields, with social or related sciences (11%) being the most commonly reported S&E field (table 2). The degree fields chosen by nativeborn and foreign-born college graduates differ significantly. Native-born U.S. citizens comprise 86% of the college-educated population residing in the United States. Given the large size of the native-born population, the distribution of fields in which their highest degree was earned is very similar to that of the overall collegeeducated population. Foreign-born college graduates (including naturalized U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens) are more likely to hold S&E and S&E-related degrees. Among the 7.2 million college-educated persons who are foreign-born, 42% hold S&E degrees and another 17% hold S&Erelated degrees as their highest degree.  The vast majority of recent graduates employed in were working full time, ranging from 70% of those with degrees in social and related sciences to 89% of engineering graduates (table 3)."}, {"section_title": "NSRCG", "text": "Other detailed data from the NSRCG show that part-time employment was more common among bachelor's graduates (24%) than among master's graduates (16%). Being a student was the most commonly cited reason given by recent bachelor's and master's graduates alike for working part-time. Bachelor's graduates provided \"Full-time job not available\" as the second mostmentioned reason for part-time employment, and master's graduates provided \"Did not need or want to work more hours\" as their second most-mentioned reason."}, {"section_title": "SDR", "text": "The SDR data further supplement the NSCG and the NSRCG data in SESTAT with doctoral scientists and engineers who earned their SEH doctorates from U.S. academic institutions. The unemployment rate for SEH doctorate recipients as of October 2010 was 2.4%. The median annual salaries among those working full time varied across employment sector, with engineers reporting median salaries ($115,000) that were higher than those reported by doctorate recipients in the science and health fields ($95,000 and $93,000, respectively) (table 4). Across the three broad fields of degree, doctorate recipients working in the private, for-profit sector reported median annual salaries higher than those reported by doctorate recipients working in 4-year educational institutions. Individuals who had earned a doctorate in a science field and were employed in the federal government reported median salaries of $110,000: lower than those reported by individuals employed in the private, forprofit sector ($120,000) but higher than those reported by their counterparts working in the private, nonprofit sector ($101,000). In general, earnings rose with experience. In the science fields, doctorate recipients who earned their doctorates before 2001 had a median salary 51% higher than that of more recent doctorate recipients ($106,000 versus $70,000). Among engineers, this difference was 37% ($130,000 versus $95,000). For those holding a doctoral degree in a health field, the difference was 27% ($104,000 versus $82,000)."}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "Non-S&E degree fields.
