Results: Biomarker results strongly correlated between assays with Spearman's r 0.94 for Ab42, 0.98 for t-tau, and 0.98 for p-tau. Using Gaussian mixture modeling, cohort-specific cut-points were estimated at 1092 pg/mL for Ab42, 235 pg/mL for t-tau, and 24 pg/mL for p-tau. We found an excellent concordance of biomarker abnormality between assays of 97% for Ab42 and 96% for both t-tau and p-tau.

These biomarkers are part of the diagnostic research criteria for AD [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, use in clinical practice is hampered by high measurement variability, low diagnostic specificity toward non-AD neurocognitive diseases at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, and limited understanding of the role of CSF biomarkers versus other biomarker modalities in clinical practice and in design of clinical trials [7] . To achieve implementation of the CSF biomarkers in clinical practice, it is important to reduce the large variation observed in the current methods and results for CSF biomarker measurements. Major sources of intralaboratory and interlaboratory variations that currently hamper the establishment of universal biomarker cut-points are preanalytical handling of the CSF samples and analytical variation [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .\nThe Innotest enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely used for routine CSF biomarker analysis and involves several steps of manual pipetting, which can cause variation in biomarker values. The interlaboratory variation of Innotest results has been reported to be .15% in an international quality control program (www. neurochem.gu.se/TheAlzAssQCprogram) [8] . Another complication is that for the Innotest an upward drift of Ab42 values over time has been shown [8, [13] [14] [15] . To reduce variation in manual immunoassays, multiplex assays or (semi)automated platforms are being developed [16] [17] [18] [19] . The fully automated Elecsys assays for CSF Ab42, t-tau CSF, and p-tau (181P) run on the cobas e 601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany), an instrument commonly used in academic hospital laboratories [20] . The Elecsys assays are reported to have very good intralaboratory and interlaboratory variations of 2% to 5% [7] . The Ab42 CSF assay has been validated technically in artificial or quality control CSF (www.neurochem. gu.se/TheAlzAssQCprogram) [7, 20] , and clinically in research cohorts [21, 22] . The Elecsys assays have not yet been tested in a real-life setting, with a more diverse patient cohort and less standardized (pre)processing of samples compared with a research setting, that is, when CSF is collected in multiple, nonacademic memory clinics and sent to a central laboratory for biomarker analysis.\nThe aim of this study was to compare CSF biomarker results of the novel Elecsys assays with results obtained from the manual Innotest ELISAs.

The prospective design and real-life setting of the project is representative for the variation in routine diagnostics.\nWe collected 137 CSF samples from patients attending eight different local memory clinics throughout the Netherlands.

Processing included centrifugation (1800g, 10 min, 4 C) and transfer of the supernatant to novel tubes of the same type, then the CSF sample was stored at 4 C or 220 C until transport. Clinicians and laboratory employees were personally instructed (E.W., I.M.) on use of these particular Sarstedt tubes for CSF. We closely monitored whether sample collection was per protocol and provided feedback if needed. Both tubes were sent to the Neurochemistry Laboratory of the VU University Medical Center (since June 2018 Amsterdam UMC), cooled or frozen, and were kept at 280 C pending analysis of the biomarkers Ab42, t-tau, and p-tau.

Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) of the cut-point estimates were determined with bootstrapping using 999 bootstrap samples. We assessed concordance of biomarker abnormalities and a combined CSF AD profile between assays using clinical cut-points for Innotest results (Section 2.3) and mixture modeling-derived cut-points for Elecsys.

Next, we examined whether preanalytical protocol deviations influenced the method comparison for Ab42. When we stratified the analysis for samples that were collected conform preanalytical protocol versus deviating from protocol, results for Passing-Bablok regression analyses were comparable (Fig. 3) . Specific protocol deviations, for example, an extra CSF transfer or extra freeze/thaw cycle for measurement of Elecsys, did not seem to decrease the association between methods, although these groups were too small to perform statistical testing.

When combining biomarkers into AD biomarker profile (i.e., decreased Ab42 combined with increased p-tau [6] ), concordance was 89%. Fifteen cases (11%) were discrepant and for most of these cases Elecsys p-tau values were slightly below the cut-point, within the 95% CI (Supplementary Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this diagnostic nonacademic dementia multicenter cohort, we observed 96% to 97% concordance between the routinely used manual Innotest and the automated Elecsys biomarker results for CSF biomarkers Ab42, t-tau, and ptau. For the combined AD biomarker profile (i.e., decreased Ab42 with increased p-tau) concordance was 89% and discordant cases showed concentrations close to the biomarker cutpoints. Our results suggest that the results from both methods are well interchangeable in a clinical diagnostic setting.\nAt this point the CSF biomarkers are used in research criteria for AD, but are not used in clinical diagnostic routine yet, partly because of high intralaboratory and interlaboratory variations. Manual assays are usually associated with analytical variation, which is supposed to be solved by automation. This notion is supported by the observation in previous studies of lower interassay and interlaboratory variation percentages of Elecsys compared with the manual ELISA tests: a mean of 5% coefficient of variation for Elecsys compared with .15% coefficient of variation for Innotest in biomarker results measured in the Alzheimer's Association Quality Control program since 2014 (www. neurochem.gu.se/TheAlzAssQCprogram). However, these studies were performed in selected research settings, which may not be comparable to a real-life situation. In the present study, samples were collected in a multicenter setting, which increases the variation in the preanalytical protocol. To reduce this variation, extra efforts were made to harmonize the sample collection at the eight secondary memory clinics, including by the use of a standardized protocol [24] , by close contact with the local personnel involved, by constant monitoring and feedback on protocol deviations to avoid repetition, and by supply of the 10 mL Sarstedt tubes. Still, deviations in the preanalytical protocol were reported in 43% of the samples, which could have weakened the correlation between the two methods. No effect of preanalytical protocol deviations, however, was found on the strength of the correlation between the two methods, indicating that no method-specific preanalytical effects have occurred. However, the potential influence of preanalytical effects on both Innotest and Elecsys measurements was not formally assessed in this study and protocol deviations affecting both measurements could have influenced biomarker results.\nThe strong correlation between the biomarker results from the two methods in our study is in line with previous results that showed high correlations of Elecsys Ab42 concentrations with the Ab42 liquid-chromatography massspectrometry reference method and with amyloid imaging [20] [21] [22] . Because of these strong linear correlations, we obtained conversion formulas to translate between Innotest and Elecsys results from Passing-Bablok regression analysis, which are needed to enable use of both types of results for clinical research and follow-up. We would like to emphasize, however, that these conversion formulas are preliminary and should be sustained with more data. In addition, these conversion formulas are specific to the present data set and are not suitable for other cohorts that use different preanalytical protocols.\nBecause cut-points for the Elecsys assays were not yet available at the start of this study, we derived cut-points based on a Gaussian mixture modeling, which is a data-driven approach that allows discovering distributions in data, which may reflect pathologic and normal ranges of biomarker values [28, 29] . Cut-points for the Ab42 Elecsys measurements have been previously reported in three cohorts: 1100 pg/mL in the Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably cohort, 977 pg/mL in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort [21] , and 1098 pg/mL in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohort [22] . The close similarity of the Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cut-points that were obtained in research settings with our cut-point obtained in real-life diagnostic setting (1092 pg/mL) suggests that the automated Elecsys assay provides robust measurements. The Ab42 cut-point of the ADNI cohort was lower compared with the cut-points in other cohorts, probably because of the more extensive preanalytical protocol of ADNI or because of other (patient-related) variation factors in the cohort [21] . Although correlation analyses facilitate comparison of two methods on a group level, concordance analyses of biomarker abnormality based on cut-points are relevant to allow method comparisons on an individual level. Of the 11% discordant cases in our comparison, most had biomarker values near the cut-point. On a general note, biomarker values near the cut-point need cautious interpretation, as imprecision of (one of) the assays, or biological variation, can play a role in the exact absolute values. As such, cut-points should never be considered as absolute measure, but always in the context of other biomarkers and clinical history. Clinicians could interpret 95% CIs surrounding cutpoints as a \"gray zone\" of at risk for abnormality rather than a conclusive positive or negative biomarker outcome. Also, the borders of this gray zone could facilitate patient stratification for clinical intervention studies. To illustrate, using the value at the lower gray border of the Ab42 cut-point could help to select a group with high certainty of amyloid pathology, whereas using the value at the upper gray zone border could help to select patients in early phases of amyloid pathology development.\nA potential limitation of the present study is that for 20% of our samples, the Elecsys measurements were above the (1-42) ; CI, confidence interval; p-tau, phosphorylated tau; t-tau, total tau. upper limit of the measuring range at 1700 pg/mL, which was also reported in other studies [21, 22] . For the present study, Ab42 concentrations .1700 pg/mL were calculated by extrapolation of the calibration curve. This estimation of the high Elecsys Ab42 concentrations could have biased the correlation between the methods in the higher range. However, as these values concern the upper limit of the normal range of Ab42 concentrations, these are not clinically problematic as such individuals are clearly in the normal range. Furthermore, the sample size of our cohort was relatively small, and so determining cut-points in a data-driven way with Gaussian mixture modeling might be less accurate, which is reflected by the relatively large CIs for the cut-points. Still, our cut-point for Elecsys Ab42 showed very close correspondence to those determined in other cohorts [21, 22] , suggesting that Gaussian mixture modeling robustly detects the normal and pathologic distributions of Ab42, even in a relatively small population. Another potential limitation is that the time lag of analysis of CSF pairs between Innotest and Elecsys spanned between 4 and 23 months, which may have increased discordant biomarker results. However, we did not see an effect of storage time on biomarker concentrations ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and observed very high concordance, so it is unlikely that an additional 4 to 23 months of storage influenced the results. Furthermore, our previous study showed stable CSF Ab42, t-tau, and p-tau concentrations over 12 years of biobank storage [14] .\nIn conclusion, the fully automated Elecsys assays demonstrated closely corresponding outcomes compared with the manual Innotest with regard to biomarker abnormality of CSF Ab42, t-tau, and p-tau in nonacademic memory clinics, reflecting daily practice diagnostic settings. Because the Elecsys assays are automated and allow direct sample measurement cost-effectively, these assays seem promising to succeed in reducing the biomarker variability. Altogether, this study provides the basis to introduce these automated assays in clinical practice, hopefully leading to more reproducible biomarker results on a global scale.
