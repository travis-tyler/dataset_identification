Methods: Cognitively normal subjects (n = 83, 75 AE 5 years, 35(42%) female) with normal CSF ab 1-42 and tau and repeated CSF sampling were selected from ADNI. Subject level slopes of ab 1-42 decreases were estimated with mixed models.

Associations between decreasing ab 1-42 levels and clinical decline (i.e., progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, MMSE, memory functioning) and biological decline (tau, hippocampal volume, glucose processing and amyloid PET) over a time period of 8-10 years were assessed. Results: Ab 1-42 levels decreased annually with \u00c04.6 AE 1 pg/mL. Higher baseline BACE1 activity (b(se) = \u00c00.06(0.03), P < 0.05), ab 1-40 (b(se)= \u00c00.11(.03), P < 0.001), and ab 1-38 levels (b(se) = \u00c00.11(0.03), P < 0.001) predicted faster decreasing ab .

The presence of plaques can be detected by decreased concentrations of amyloid b 1-42 (ab ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cognitively normal individuals without evidence for aggregated amyloid can show decreasing concentrations of ab in CSF over time. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] However, it remains uncertain as to whether such decreases indicate an early, preamyloid stage of Alzheimer's disease. Investigating the risk factors for rate of decrease in ab concentrations, and whether such decreases are associated with subsequent decline in cognition and other biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease over time is critical for understanding the very early pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and may enable development of strategies toward prevention of amyloid accumulation.\nAb is produced via amyloidogenic processing of the transmembrane amyloid b precursor protein (APP) through cleavage by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). 7 During this process, other ab isoforms, ab and ab , are also produced and these isoforms are less prone to aggregation than ab . 7, 8 In autosomaldominant Alzheimer's disease, it has been shown that several genetic mutations cause increased production of ab . 9 In sporadic Alzheimer's disease, cross-sectional studies have reported higher ab CSF levels with higher amyloid plaque burden as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). 10 But, lower ab 1-42 levels in CSF or amyloid plaques on positron emission tomography (PET) without a clear association with ab levels have also been reported. 11, 12 As such, it is still unclear to what extent increased APP processing is involved in amyloid aggregation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.\nIn the present study, we investigated whether decreasing amyloid in cognitively normal individuals with initially normal amyloid and tau markers can be considered an early pathophysiological event in Alzheimer's disease, and to this end we studied both upstream and downstream processes associated with decreasing amyloid. We hypothesized that if increased APP processing is related with amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease, then higher CSF levels of proteins associated with APP processing might be associated with faster ab decreases over time. We further hypothesized that if faster decreasing ab levels consequently initiate downstream pathophysiological processes, then such decreases should be associated with subsequent decline in cognition and other brain markers associated with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we had two objectives: First, to investigate whether higher baseline levels of markers involved in APP processing (i.e., BACE1, sAPPb, ab , ab ) were associated with faster decreases in ab over time in a sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults with initially normal ab and tau CSF biomarkers. Second, to investigate whether these faster rates of decreasing ab 1-42 levels subsequently lead to other pathophysiological changes in Alzheimer's disease, by studying relationships between rates of decreasing ab 1-42 levels with declines in cognition and other established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (i.e., amyloid PET, CSF tau, Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and hippocampal volume)."}, {"section_title": "Methods Subjects", "text": "The data analyzed in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Results remained similar after additionally adjusting for baseline tau levels, and MMSE scores. In those models, higher but still normal baseline tau levels were also associated with clinical progression. Subjects with fast decreasing ab 1-42 also showed decline in MMSE and in delayed recall memory scores on the Wechsler's Memory and ADAS scales (Table) , and tended to decline on the RAVTL delayed memory test, but this was not significant (Fig. 1B-E) .

Only subjects with fast decreasing ab showed amyloid aggregation on amyloid PET, and decreases on FDG PET (Figures 2C and D) .

Furthermore, our results suggest that fast decreasing ab 1-42 CSF concentrations initiate downstream pathophysiological processes that are known to be involved in AD, as fast decreasing ab was associated with subsequent clinical and cognitive decline, as well as amyloid aggregation on PET, glucose hypometabolism, increase in CSF tau and hippocampal atrophy. Together our findings suggest that initially higher levels of APP processing-associated proteins and subsequent decreasing ab 1-42 levels indicate the earliest, pre-amyloid, pathophysiological stage in Alzheimer's disease. Ab 1-42 is produced when APP is initially cleaved by BACE1. 7 Alzheimer's disease causing genetic mutations in APP, and also in PSEN1 and PSEN2, can promote ab production, the isoform that is particularly prone to aggregation.\n9,21-23 So far, it has been challenging to study the involvement of APP processing in the initial stages of ab aggregation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, because the onset of amyloid aggregation is difficult to estimate. The results from our longitudinal analyses suggest that increased APP processing may also play a role in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, as higher levels of BACE1, ab and ab were associated with subsequent faster decreases in ab . These findings converge with observations in autosomal-dominant AD of higher ab 1-40 levels in mutation carriers compared to controls 15 years before estimated year of symptom onset, which was followed by decreases in ab 1-42 at 10 years before estimated symptom onset. 24 A recent rodent study suggested that BACE1 inhibition strategies might be most effective during the initial phase of plaque formation. 25 Our results indicate that it might be possible to identify individuals who are in such a pre-amyloid stage of the disease, when they have higher levels of APP markers, in combination with fast decreasing ab 1-42 levels. However, these APP-associated protein levels may change over time in a nonlinear way, 24, 26 and so more longitudinal studies are required to study whether it is possible to develop approaches for identifying subjects at risk for incipient amyloidosis based on these markers. Another question that remains is what biological process causes APP processing to increase. One explanation is that APP processing increases with aging, as a cross-sectional study observed higher BACE1 levels with older age, 15 which may explain increasing prevalences of amyloid abnormality for older ages. 27 Increased APP processing has also been associated with higher neuronal activation in rodent models, with highly active brain areas showing increased vulnerability for amyloid plaque formation. [28] [29] [30] [31] Support for the involvement of a similar mechanism in human beings has recently been reported, with brain areas showing relatively higher activation during nontask conditions were also among the regions showing the first signs of amyloid aggregation as measured with amyloid PET. 32 Most individuals with normal amyloid and tau CSF markers remain cognitively stable, 33, 34 but still some of these individuals show cognitive decline. It is this subset of individuals that provides the opportunity to study the earliest pathogenic changes involved in Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we showed that low amyloid concentrations within the normal range were associated with clinical progression in nondemented individuals, suggesting that a dynamical range exists during which amyloid starts to decrease. 35 We now further extend on those findings and show that faster decreasing ab of initially normal levels are associated with subsequent downstream declines in clinical, cognitive, and biological markers for Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal individuals. Previous studies have demonstrated that normal ab CSF levels in nondemented individuals can decrease below the cut-point for abnormality over time. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] However, those previous studies have reported conflicting results as to whether decreases in ab levels are associated with clinical progression, as one study did not observe an association with decline on cognitive test scores when grouping subjects according to whether or not subjects developed abnormal ab 1-42 levels within 3 years, 4 while another study observed a trend for decline on MMSE scores when subjects were grouped according to the median slope. 5 With our approach, we compared subjects who had initially both normal amyloid and tau biomarkers based on whether they showed slow, intermediate or fast decreasing ab 1-42 levels, and this enabled us to show that fast decreasing ab 1-42 levels were associated with clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and showed faster decline on the MMSE and on neuropsychological memory tests that measure delayed recall, which is sensitive to AD-related cognitive decline. This suggests that decreasing ab 1-42 levels trigger other downstream pathophysiological processes involved in Alzheimer's disease. Still, the close correspondence in time for amyloid to become abnormal and clinical progression may seem to be at odds with earlier observations in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease that ab 1-42 levels plateau many years before the onset of dementia. 24, 36, 37 It must be noted that of the 12 subjects showing clinical progression, 10 progressed to MCI and only two progressed to dementia, and so it might be that the rate of amyloid decreases plateaus in the MCI stage. 38, 39 Another possibility is that in late onset AD the pathophysiological cascade may take less time to unfold than in early onset AD, as the aging brain might be more vulnerable for pathophysiological changes.\nSubjects with fast decreasing ab showed amyloid aggregation on PET about a year later. The observation that amyloid in CSF may become abnormal before PET is in line with previous reports. 12, 24, 32, 40, 41 An implication of these results is that for the earliest disease stages ab CSF might be more useful than amyloid PET to serve as an outcome measure for trials testing drugs that target ab production. However, it must be noted that although the concordance between CSF and PET measures for abnormal amyloid is often high, 42 it is also possible for individuals to have an abnormal amyloid PET scan and normal amyloid CSF. 42, 43 In some cases, CSF amyloid may decrease at a later point in time, 13 indicating that not all individuals seem to follow the same temporal trajectories of CSF and PET changes. Such discrepancies may reflect differences between these modalities in terms of sensitivity and/or specificity to detect certain pathological aspects of amyloid plaques among individuals. Brain glucose metabolism only decreased in subjects with fast decreasing ab . Tau levels increased in subjects showing intermediate and fast decreasing ab levels, suggesting that the process of amyloid aggregation and tau increase might be coupled together in time, which has also been observed in autosomal dominant AD. 24 Potentially, decreasing ab 1-42 levels reflect the presence of toxic ab oligomers that can trigger tau pathology. 21, 44 However, no continuous correlation between tau levels and continuous ab slopes was observed, and so alternatively these processes might be independent from each other. We further observed that hippocampal volumes reduced for all subjects, independently of the rates of decreasing ab . This suggests that reductions in hippocampal volumes over time can in part reflect normal aging processes, or neurodegenerative processes unrelated to Alzheimer's disease. As such hippocampal atrophy, although closely linked to the disease and to memory loss, may not necessarily be specific for Alzheimer's disease. 33, 45 At this point, research schemes for disease staging allow use CSF tau levels, glucose metabolism or hippocampal atrophy to indicate neuronal injury. 46 The present observations suggest that these markers reflect different aspects of neuronal injury, and so these markers should not be used interchangeably.\nThe majority of subjects that showed decreasing ab 1-42 levels did not carry an APOE e4 allele, which was unexpected as APOE e4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The relatively large proportion of subjects lacking this allele might be explained by their average age of 75 years, which is an age when about 22% in noncarriers are expected to have abnormal amyloid versus 60% APOE e4 carriers. 27 Consequently, it is unclear to what extent our findings can be generalized to APOE e4 allele carriers. One study reported higher ab levels with older age in cognitively normal noncarriers, but observed no association with age in carriers. 12 Another study reported that higher levels of ab 1--40 correlated with higher plaque burden in carriers, although of weaker strength than in noncarriers. 10 Although, our results highlight the importance of repeated CSF sampling over a long period of time to improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease, more longitudinal studies are required to study this question in younger participants, when the proportion of APOE e4 carriers with normal amyloid is expected to be larger. 12, 27 A limitation of the present study is that even though this sample of individuals with repeated CSF and detailed follow-up information over a period spanning 10 years is currently one of the largest samples available, due to the average age and the present inclusion criterion of normal amyloid the proportion of individuals who showed clinical decline was small. Another potential limitation is that there were no repeated measurements available for APP markers, and so it remains unclear whether those markers change over time. Furthermore, amyloid aggregation on PET was analyzed using SUVr values, which might not be the most optimal approach to reliably detect (small) changes over time. 47 In addition, the slow and intermediate tertiles of decreasing ab showed annual changes that were similar to measuring variability. Since those groups showed no or little decline in cognition and other biomarkers, it is conceivable amyloid levels will remain largely normal in those individuals. However, subjects in the fast tertile of decreasing ab showed consistent, subsequent clinical and cognitive decline, as well as decline in other biomarkers, suggesting that these individuals are in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease.\nIn conclusion, we observed in cognitively normal subjects with initial normal CSF biomarkers that higher levels of APP processing seem to be at the start of a pre-amyloid stage of Alzheimer's disease, during which ab concentrations show rapid decreases over time. Trials that target amyloid production are currently on going. Although these results require replication in larger samples, an implication is that CSF ab might have use as an outcome marker in trials targeting amyloid beta when levels are still normal, and that such therapeutic strategies might be of benefit for this population.
