[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the important factors in the early diagnosis of dementia is the evaluation of activity of daily living (ADL). In addition to cognitive impairment, the impairment of ADL is an important criterion for distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from dementia. 1 The importance of accurate assessment of ADL is more emphasized given the increasing trend in measuring ADL rather than cognitive function in longitudinal studies that examine the effects of pharmacological/non-pharmacological interventions. ADL is a critical outcome in tracking disease progression in clinical contexts and treatment trials. 4 Problems in ADL help predict who will more rapidly decline and convert to dementia. 5 There are two ways to evaluate ADL: self-rated and informant-rated. As the severity of dementia progresses, the patients' insight decreases, and the difference between the impairment perceived by the patients and by the caregivers becomes larger. Therefore, it is difficult to trust the patients' self-report. 6 In most clinical settings and studies, patients' ADL is rated by caregivers who know the patients well. 7 - 9 Several scales for ADL are available. However, most of the scales focus on the loss of independence in basic and instrumental ADL. 10 - 13 The activities included in these scales are not variable enough to assess various mild functional impairments observed in daily life. 14 The Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale was developed to create a psychometrically rigorous instrument for assessing the functional abilities of older adults across a wide range of ability, spanning normal aging through mild to moderate dementia. It emphasizes assessing functional changes that may occur \"very early\" in the course of an incipient degenerative disease, such as during the syndrome of MCI. 15 ECog consists of 39 items that can measure subtle and mild functional changes before reaching a level where one cannot independently perform key activities, such as use of transportation. A particular strength of the scale is that it categorizes the items according to specific cognitive domains. Therefore, if a problem occurs in one item, it can be interpreted as a change in a related cognitive domain. ECog gives a global score and six domain scores, including memory, language, visuospatial function, and executive functions (planning, organization, and divided attention). Farias et al. 15 reported that the global factor score and the patterns of the six domain-specific factor scores are useful in differentiating MCI as well as dementia from normal older adults (NA). Moreover, subtypes of MCI have showed different patterns of domain scores in ECog.\nECog is a scale constructed through a psychometrically rigorous process and has been widely used in clinical and research areas. Especially, it has been selected for ADL measurement in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which is a multisite longitudinal study for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) conducted in more than 13 countries. 16 In Korea, few scales have been developed to assess cognitively mediated functional abilities in older adults for early detection and monitoring progression of MCI and dementia. Thus, this study aimed to validate and standardize the Korean version of ECog (K-ECog)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The participants were 268 cognitively NA, 151 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 77 dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) patients. As ECog is an informantrated questionnaire, the caregivers of all of the participants also participated in the study. NA participants were recruited through community outreach. They were those who fulfilled Christensen's health screening criteria 17 and showed normal performance in the KoreanMini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). 18 DAT and aMCI participants were selected from the patients who visited the Department of Neurology of two university hospitals. All of the patients underwent clinical diagnostic dementia work-up, which included a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and brain imaging. Cognitive impairment was defined as at least 1.5 standard deviation (SD) below the normal norms. 19 Their ADL status was assessed based on the Korean-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL). 13, 20 The Petersen criteria for MCI were used. 1 In aMCI patients, those with either single or multiple cognitive domain impairments were selected for the study. The aMCI included only patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0.5. The clinical diagnosis of DAT was based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. 21 The patients with either a CDR global score of 0.5 (range for CDR sum of boxes, 2.5-4.0; n = 23; 30%) 22 or CDR global score of 1.0 (n = 54; 70%)were included in the DAT group."}, {"section_title": "Materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "K-ECog", "text": "The original ECog 15 is an informant-rated measure for cognitively-relevant everyday abilities.

For each item, informants are asked to compare the participants' current level of everyday functioning with how he or she functioned 10 years earlier. Response options include the followings: 1 = better or no change, 2 = occasionally worse, 3 = consistently a little worse, 4 = consistently much worse, and \"I don't know.\" The ECog global score, which is the sum of all items divided by the number of items completed excluding the number of \"I don't know\" items, ranges between 1 and 4.\nTwo clinical neuropsychologists translated the original 39 items into Korean (Appendix 1). The back-translation was performed by a bilingual translator to confirm that the meanings of the original items were well translated.

Validation of the K-ECog "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The results revealed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability of K-ECog, indicating that the items of K-ECog measure the same general construct and that their scores are stable over time. The relationships of K-ECog with existing measures for assessing everyday function or cognitive functions were evaluated. As expected, K-ECog demonstrated reasonable relationships with K-IADL. Such relationship was also found with cognitive screening tests, particularly K-MMSE and K-MoCA. K-ECog, therefore, was shown to have good convergent validity with previously established measures, including IADL and cognitive screening tests.\nEveryday function is believed to have a multidimensional construct, as different daily tasks vary in the degree to which they require specific cognitive ability. In the original ECog study, Farias et al. 15 chose the model represented by one general factor and six domainspecific factors, namely, memory, language, visuospatial function, EF: planning, EF: organization, and EF: divided attention. The CFA results of K-ECog also showed that a factor structure with equal weight on all factors of K-ECog is appropriate for indexing overall ADL functioning. The goodness of fit of this model was similar to that of the original ECog (K-ECog: RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99 vs. ECog: RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.99). This multidimensional structure of K-ECog permits a more detailed investigation of the determinants and course of functional impairments that can be helpful in diagnostic differentiation in the clinical field.\nWe examined whether K-ECog could measure the degree of ADL impairments. The results showed large group differences on the total score and each cognitive domain scores of K-ECog among the NA, aMCI, and DAT groups. NA participants showed the least degree of change relative to their baseline (comparison to 10 years ago); the aMCI group showed an intermediate level of functional impairment; and the mild AD group showed the greatest degree of functional impairment. This trend indicated that K-ECog is sensitive to relatively subtle ADL changes. We likewise found differences between the domain scores of K-ECog in each group. In the NA, the memory and EF: divided attention scores were significantly higher compared with other domain scores. In the aMCI, the memory score was significantly higher than the EF: divided attention score, although these two scores were significantly higher compared with the other domain scores. In the DAT, the memory score was significantly higher than the EF: divided attention score, although these two scores were significantly higher compared with language, visuospatial function, and EF: organization scores. The EF: planning score did not show significant differences with EF: divided attention, but was significantly higher than language score, although there were no differences among EF: planning, EF: organization, and visuospatial function scores. The memory score was significantly higher compared with any other domain scores. Thus, memory problems were more frequently reported than other cognitive functions in all three groups. Subsequently, EF: divided attention was also reported to be more problematic than the other cognitive 9/14 https://jkms.org https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e67\nValidation of the K-ECog functions. This finding is consistent with previous studies that reported impaired divided attention in aMCI or AD. 27, 28 These characteristics of domain scores in each group showed the progression process of cognitive dysfunction from normal older adult through MCI to DAT. Thus, K-ECog is a useful tool for distinguishing early cognitive dysfunction in daily life by evaluating various cognitive domains.\nFurther, ROC curve analyses revealed K-ECog is a valid instrument for differentiating between cognitively normal and cognitively impaired older adults. The discriminative accuracy of K-ECog was identical to that of K-IADL, K-MMSE, and K-MoCA. As such, K-ECog is a valid cognitive screening measure as well as ADL scale for differentiating impaired individuals from NAs.\nTrained clinicians should meet patients in person to administer MMSE and MoCA. Meanwhile, K-ECog answered by caregivers does not need trained experts for administration. With only a reliable caregiver's report, K-ECog can provide information on patients' general cognitive function as well as ADL. From the ROC curve analyses, the optimal cut-off scores to differentiate the older adults with cognitive impairment from the NA were calculated. The cut-off scores of K-ECog to differentiate aMCI from NA and to differentiate DAT from NA were \u2265 1.41 and \u2265 1.61, respectively.\nMost items in the existing ADL scales are related to more than one cognitive domain. For example, \"shopping\" included in most ADL scales requires multiple cognitive abilities, such as visuospatial function, memory, calculation, and planning. K-ECog consists of six sections, each section includes items strongly associated with a particular cognitive function. Therefore, it allows clinicians to know the specific cognitive domain that causes the impairment of a specific item. That is, K-ECog could also provide information on specific cognitive-domain dysfunctions as well as general cognitive function, as mentioned above, without requiring the clinician to see the patients personally. Therefore, K-ECog would be highly useful in situations where it is difficult for the clinician to assess the patients directly. Further, unlike performance-based cognitive screening tools, such as MMSE, K-ECog is affected minimally by patients' educational background. 9,29, 30 Assessments of both cognitive and everyday functioning levels are essential for the diagnosis and intervention of dementia. Cognitive assessment using neuropsychological tests requires relatively long hours of testing and trained professionals who can examine and interpret the cognitive tests. However, many community-based clinics do not have experts or the settings for it. It is recommended to use K-ECog in such settings. K-ECog is time efficient and useful, as it can be completed by an informant within a few minutes when formal cognitive testing is not feasible. Its role of cognitive screening may identify the need for additional neuropsychological evaluation. 31 At present, longitudinal studies are increasingly conducted, matching the increased interest in the prevention, early detection, and intervention of dementia. Many researchers have focused on cognitive changes according to dementia severity, but few studies are available on detailed changes in everyday functioning from MCI to dementia. Unlike other existing ADL scales, K-ECog is more optimal for longitudinal studies, as its items are designed to evaluate subtle changes in everyday function. K-ECog also permits researchers to study direct relationships between functional deficits and the related neuropsychological dysfunction. It may help researchers design more valid studies on pharmacological and cognitive intervention targeting specific everyday functions."}]
