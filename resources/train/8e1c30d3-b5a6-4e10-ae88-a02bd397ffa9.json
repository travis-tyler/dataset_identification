The three original federal programs, from which \"TRIO\" derived its name, began in the 1960s: Upward Bound (1964), Talent Search (1965), and Student Support Services (1968. The fourth TRIO program, Educational Opportunity Centers, was added in 1972. The Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, the subject of this report, resulted from the 1986 amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965. In 1990, the Department of Education created the Upward Bound Math-Science Program to help Upward Bound students recognize and develop their potential to excel in the fi elds of mathematics and science. TRIO also includes a training program for TRIO directors and staff, authorized in 1976, and the newest program, TRIO Dissemination Partnership, authorized in 1998 to facilitate the replication of successful program practices at institutions and agencies that do not have a federally funded TRIO project. The goal of the McNair Program is to increase the number of doctoral degrees earned by students from underrepresented populations. The program awards grants to undergraduate institutions for projects to motivate and prepare students from disadvantaged backgrounds with strong academic potential. Grantees work with students through the completion of the undergraduate degree, assisting with graduate school preparation, application, and entrance.

The fi rst projects were funded in 1989, with grant competitions currently held every four years. All grants are awarded on a four-year cycle, except for the institutions that score in the top 10 percent of each competition. These grants are awarded for fi ve years. Table 1.01 describes the annual award to the McNair Program along with information about the number of participants the program was expecting to serve. In program year 1989-90, the McNair Program funded 14 projects that expected to serve 415 students. By program year 2001-02, 156 projects were expected to provide services to 3,774 students. The funding level of the McNair Program increased from a little less than $1.5 million in program year 1989-90 to $35.8 million in program year 2001-02. Even when converted to 2002 dollars (values not displayed in table), the amount expected to be available per participant almost doubled over this time period because the average number of students that each project was funded to serve did not fl uctuate widely, ranging between 23 and 30 students. Because the actual number of participants served increased faster than the number of students the projects were funded to serve over the last three program years, the average amount actually available per participant has decreased slightly (Table 1.02). In program year 1996-97, just more than 2,000 students received services from 99 projects with a total appropriation of $19.8 million for an average of $9,772 available per student.

According to the numbers reported in the APRs alone, projects actually reported serving 150 percent of the students they were funded to serve.

See \"Future Directions\" chapter for further discussion. funding level of $36 million, averaging approximately $8,900 per student. In program year 2001-02, the actual number served was 106 percent of the number of students the program was funded to serve. 3 The $36 million appropriation for the McNair Program in program year 2001-02 represents about 5 percent of the total appropriation to all TRIO programs in that year. The McNair Program is one of the smaller TRIO programs, but it is the only one that aims to increase the representation of disadvantaged students in graduate school. Table 1.03 describes the characteristics of the 156 grantee institutions for 2001-02. The majority of grantees were public, doctoral degree-granting universities with total full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollments of more than 10,000 students.

McNair participants are examined in three ways. The fi rst approach includes only active McNair participants, describing students who actually received services in each reporting year. The second approach includes new participants only, describing students receiving program services for the fi rst time in each reporting year. Describing participants in these two ways highlights any changes in new participants or patterns in new participant selection over time. The third approach describes all individuals reported by projects in a given year, including new, continuing, and all former participants. 4 This approach, although consistent with previous McNair reports, is somewhat less meaningful in that the majority of students who are included are not receiving any direct services from the grantee. This is particularly the case in the more recent years as the number of former participants accumulates. By program year 2001-02, active and new participants made up only 24 and 14 percent, respectively, of all participants reported.

However, as can be seen by the distribution of race/ethnicity in Table 2.03 and Figure 2.01, approximately 75 percent of the active participants each year belonged to the three groups underrepresented in graduate education (African American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native). For the purpose of determining eligibility for program services, McNair projects report participants as low-income and fi rst-generation or as underrepresented. However, many participants are clearly both underrepresented and low-income and fi rst-generation. Indeed, Hispanic and African American students are both underrepresented in graduate education and are less likely than Asian or white students to have parents with college degrees (Nettles & Millett, 1999). Table 2.04 presents the distribution of race/ ethnicity by eligibility status for the most recent year's data.

However, obtaining a doctorate can take, on average, from 6.3 years for the physical sciences to 19.2 years for education (Kerlin, 1995). Although not enough time has elapsed for many McNair participants to obtain this degree, a number of interim indicators provide measures of project success in moving participants toward this goal.

Of those participants, 2,302 were new to the program and received services for the fi rst time. Fifty-seven percent of the active participants and 14 percent of all participants were new in 2001-02. Twenty-four percent of all students reported in the APRs were active and currently receiving program services. For 1997-98 through 2001-02, approximately 40-47 percent of new participants each year were involved with the McNair Program for a single year, approximately 30-58 percent received services for two years, and approximately 25 percent received services for three or more years. There was little difference among the types of participants, although the percentage of new and active participants who were white decreased slightly over time. In general, just under half of McNair participants were African American, approximately one-quarter were Hispanic or Latino, and nearly one-fi fth were white. Approximately 5 percent of participants were Asian; slightly less were American Indian/Alaska Native; and only 1 percent were Hawaiian or Pacifi c Islander. New participants were most often juniors and seniors in college, whereas active participants followed a similar pattern but with a smaller portion of juniors and a higher proportion of fi fth-year undergraduates. Consistently, more than 70 percent of participants were low-income and fi rst-generation. Approximately one-third of McNair participants were male; this percentage decreased slightly over time. Although the average ages at project entry were similar, slightly more of the new and active participants were 17 to 20 years old at project entry than were all participants. More than half of the students from ethnic groups underrepresented in graduate education were also low-income and fi rst-generation. For all participants, the population did not change much from year to year (because each year differed from the previous year only by the addition of the relatively few new participants). As a result, overall recruiting patterns showed little change over time. Although projects may be recruiting younger students and fewer whites and males, these differences are small.  \nApproximately 40 percent of McNair graduates gain acceptance to graduate school, and in 2000-01, 98 percent of those accepted enrolled. The percentage of bachelor's degree recipients enrolling in graduate school increases with each program year, from 13 percent in 1998-99 to 39 percent in 2000-01. A higher percentage of underrepresented students enrolled in graduate school than did low-income and fi rst-generation students, and a higher percentage of whites and American Indian/Alaska Natives enrolled than did members of other ethnic groups. The number of participants enrolled in graduate programs not only increases with each program year but also increases with each year following college graduation (by 15 to 47 percent, depending on the year), suggesting that many participants do not enroll in graduate school immediately after graduation. Of the participants who enrolled in graduate school, between 79 and 96 percent (depending on the cohort) persisted after one year, approximately 60 percent persisted after two years, just fewer than half persisted through three years, and 43 percent persisted to four years. Compared with other groups (a national sample and a demographically similar sample), a slightly higher percentage of McNair participants enrolled in graduate school (10.2 percent, compared with 6.4 and 5.8 percent). However, compared with the same samples, McNair participants persist less once in graduate school, (60 percent after three years compared with 85 and 83 percent, respectively). Although nearly all participants earn bachelor's degrees (95 percent after four years), whites and Asians are more likely to earn advanced degrees. Overall, 15 percent of all participants have a master's degree; 4 percent have earned a doctoral or other advanced degree. In the past fi ve years, nearly 500 participants have earned doctorates, and of those who did, slightly higher percentages were Asian and white."}, {"section_title": "A note concerning data quality", "text": "The analyses in this chapter include participants from program years 1997-98 through 2001-02, even though there is some incompatibility between the way certain questions were asked before and after the 1999-2000 data collection.

This is shown in some tables in this chapter, where occasionally data from earlier years are not available and appear to be inconsistent with trends evident in later years. Another source of error in the data arises from the practice of updating missing and erroneous information in current and subsequent year data fi les only. Errors and omissions are not fi xed retroactively (see Table  C-2 for the proportion of missing and invalid data for each year). Because this has been the practice for updating and correcting student data fi les, the more recent data will always be more accurate and complete than the less recent data. As such, confl icts should be resolved by giving precedence to newer data. A fi nal note concerns response rates. For all years except 1997-98, at least 95 percent of funded projects provided APR data; in 1997-98, only 77 percent did so. See Table C-1 for response rates. We include data here from all available years to allow the description of project outcomes to encompass as many years as possible.

Table 3.01 shows the percentage of the active participants in each year who earn a bachelor's degree in the years following participation in the McNair Program. By 2000-01, nearly one-fourth of active students earned a bachelor's degree in the same year they participated in McNair, and approximately two-thirds earned a bachelor's degree one year later.  "}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate graduation year", "text": "Chapter 3: Program Outcomes and Impact Nationally, approximately 25 to 30 percent of undergraduates enroll in graduate school at any time following college graduation (McCormick, Nu\u00f1ez, Shah, & Choy, 1999;Nettles & Millett, 1999;Golde & Dore, 2001;Choy & Geis, 2002). Of the McNair graduates in 2000-01, 36 percent enrolled in graduate school immediately after graduation and more will enroll in subsequent years after graduation. Unlike graduate students in general, McNair graduate students are made up of 72 percent low-income/fi rstgeneration and 28 percent from groups underrepresented in graduate education. Nationally, 41 percent of graduate students are fi rst-generation and 14.9 percent are from groups underrepresented in graduate education (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). The number of McNair participants enrolling in graduate school also increases in subsequent years after graduation. As can be seen in Table 3.04, the number of participants enrolled in graduate school increased each year as time from the undergraduate degree increased. Of the McNair participants graduating in 1998-99, 166 were enrolled in graduate school the year following graduation, 247 were enrolled the following year, and 310 were enrolled three years after graduation (an increase of 49 percent from the fi rst to second year, and 26 percent from the second to third year). One explanation for the increase in numbers of McNair participants enrolling in graduate school each year is that many participants do not enroll immediately after graduation from college. Therefore, the number of students enrolled in graduate school increases with each year following college graduation. Research indicates that only 25 to 30 percent of graduate students enroll immediately after college graduation and that another 17 to 29 percent enroll within two years. However, immediate enrollment is more common for those enrolled in doctoral programs than for those enrolled in master's or fi rst professional degree programs (McCormick, Nu\u00f1ez, Shah, & Choy, 1999;Nettles & Millett, 1999;Golde & Dore, 2001;Choy & Geis, 2002). Although it is likely that delayed enrollments account for much of the increase in graduate degree enrollments with each subsequent year after college graduation, another explanation is that the quality of the data continues to improve greatly with each year. As the data quality and response rate improve each year, grantees include more participants in the annual reports and correctly report them as enrolled. Those who may have enrolled in graduate school but were not consistently tracked would be considered missing or would have incorrect enrollment status reported until the program corrected or updated the data; at that time, that individual would be included in that year as a graduate student. Therefore, in addition to those who delayed graduate school enrollment, the increase in graduate enrollments likely also refl ects those who may have immediately enrolled in graduate school but were not previously reported as such until their records were updated in subsequent years.\npersistence for just those students who enrolled in graduate programs the year after college graduation. This approach likely underestimates persistence because students who took time off between graduating from college and enrolling in graduate school are not included, nor are the students who may have enrolled immediately following graduation but whose records were missing or invalid in the report for that year. After the fi rst year of graduate school, between 79 and 96 percent of these students were persisting (still enrolled at the end of the year). At the end of the second year of graduate school, approximately 60 percent were still persisting, and after three years, between 44 and 53 percent were still enrolled. Forty-three percent persisted through the fourth year. We note that on average, nearly half of all students who begin doctoral study never obtain the Ph.D. (Golde, 2001;Kerlin, 1995). Underrepresented and low-income students have less fi nancial and social support in graduate school, making an ambitious goal even more diffi cult for McNair participants, who are more likely to be underrepresented and low-income than are graduate students in general (see Future Directions for further discussion). This research suggests that doctoral students from lower-income backgrounds tend to be less successful in graduate education, and many McNair participants are both low-income and underrepresented. Thus, the 43 percent persistence rate after four years (compared with a 50 percent completion rate on average for all doctoral students) for McNair participants needs to be interpreted with the fact that McNair participants are likely to have less fi nancial and social support throughout graduate school than are others who are not low-income and fi rst-generation or underrepresented."}, {"section_title": "Graduate school persistence", "text": "Because it is diffi cult to accurately determine persistence when the number of enrollees increases every year (because every subsequent year after the fi rst has more students enrolled in graduate school, the persistence rate will be greater than 100 percent each year), Table 3.05 describes graduate school  "}, {"section_title": "A comparison of graduate school persistence", "text": "To provide additional context for the persistence of McNair participants through graduate school, we compare the academic progress of McNair participants with the academic progress of other students. In addition to providing context, the comparison is also a measure of the impact of the program on participants' pursuit of graduate degrees. As mentioned earlier, the desired outcome for participants is the doctoral degree. However, because not enough time has elapsed for most participants to have completed graduate school, graduate school persistence is our proxy outcome measure. This section compares the persistence rates of McNair participants with the rates of both a nationally representative sample and a sample of similar students. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B), funded by the National Center for Education Statistics, is a longitudinal study of the employment and graduate school experiences of bachelor's degree recipients. Approximately 11,000 students who completed their undergraduate degrees in 1992-93 make up the 1993 cohort of the B&B. The study tracks participants for 10 years, collecting data on employment, family education background, and graduate school enrollment at each of three follow-up periods (1, 4, and 10 years following graduation). 7 Although a second B&B cohort of students obtaining their bachelor's degree in 2000-01 has begun, not enough time has passed for this cohort to provide the graduate degree persistence information needed here. The B&B study provided two groups for comparing graduate school enrollment and persistence with that of McNair participants. The fi rst was a nationally representative sample. This included everyone in the 1993 cohort who participated in both the initial and follow-up surveys and provided information on postbaccalaureate enrollment (representing approximately 1.18 million individuals).8 Applying defi nitions similar to those used by McNair projects, we selected only the underrepresented, low-income, and fi rstgeneration students (representing approximately 700,000). This is the demographically similar sample. 9 The McNair group consists of all participants who received bachelor's degrees in 1998-99 (n=1,282). Table 3.06 presents the results of these analyses, which must be interpreted with the following note of caution: Because the data quality has improved greatly in recent years (see earlier in this chapter and Appendix C for details), the persistence comparison based on these data, although promising, likely underrepresents the true persistence of McNair students. We used the 1998-99 participant data because we wanted data from the earliest year possible to allow enough time to measure persistence while still allowing the use of a prior year's data to confi rm the year of bachelor's degree obtainment. The prior year's data were necessary because many projects repeatedly report the highest degree earned each year, making it diffi cult, even combined with end-of-year enrollment status, to otherwise determine when a participant actually earned a degree.  Table 3.05. These enrollment rates differ from the persistence rates presented there in that here the percentages are of all graduates and not just of those enrolling in graduate school. The number of graduates reported in the three years following graduation is not removed from the denominator for any of the persistence rates described in this "}, {"section_title": "1992-1993 B&B bachelor's degree recipients, 1993-97", "text": "Ten percent of the McNair participants who obtained a bachelor's degree in 1998-99 enrolled in graduate school during the 1999-2000 academic year. In comparison data from the 1992-93 B&B Study of bachelor's degree recipients, 6.4 percent of this population and 5.8 percent of a demographically similar population enrolled in graduate school. A similar pattern is evident for the second and third years (Table 3."}, {"section_title": "06).", "text": "This comparison suggests that the McNair program has a positive impact on applying to and enrolling in graduate study for participants immediately after graduation. In the year following graduation, a higher percentage of the McNair students entered graduate school than did the national and similar comparison sample students. However, after three years, the gain narrows and the proportion of McNair students that persists is similar to the proportion of the other samples (5.7 vs. 5.4 and 4.9 percent). This suggests that although the McNair Program helps participants enroll in graduate school, they may have more diffi culty staying enrolled once there. Examining just those completing the fi rst year of graduate school reveals differences in graduate school persistence. Of the 131 McNair students who completed the fi rst year of graduate school, 76 percent persisted through the second year, compared with 95 percent of the national and 94 percent of the similar sample. By the end of the third year, 60 percent persisted, compared with 85 and 84 percent of the national and similar samples, respectively. This indicates that although McNair participants gain acceptance into graduate school at higher rates than do non-McNair participants, a smaller percentage persists once enrolled. Table 3.07 displays the degrees reported by all McNair projects in each reporting year between 1997-98 and 2001-02. Although just more than half of all participants have earned a bachelor's degree, this number will continue to increase as those currently enrolled in undergraduate programs complete their degrees. Approximately 15 percent of all participants in each year have earned a master's degree, and approximately 4 percent of all participants have earned a doctoral or other terminal degree. However, the average time to complete doctoral studies is approximately 10 years, and the participants described -Not available; this was not an available response option in these years. a Percentages are higher because there was no category for other advanced degrees, which were likely included here as doctoral degrees.

As such, the interpretation of these results is constrained by the abbreviated timeframe. Obtaining a doctorate in four years or less is relatively uncommon. The number of earned doctorates will increase in the future as time allows students to progress through graduate programs. Research suggests that although women and men are equally likely to enroll in graduate school, women are more likely to enroll in master's degree programs and thus earn master's degrees, whereas men are more likely to enroll in and earn degrees from fi rst-professional and graduate degree programs (Bradburn, Berger, Li, Peter, & Rooney, 2003;Kerlin, 1995). Other sources also report a higher percentage of males than females earning doctorates (23 vs. 13 percent;Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, & Choy, 2001). For McNair participants, men and women were equally likely to enroll in graduate school (see Table  3.03). Table 3.08 describes participants' earned degrees by gender and suggests that McNair participants do not show any large gender difference in their obtaining either the bachelor's or the doctoral degree. However, the percentage of males earning other terminal degrees is slightly higher than that of females, and the percentage of females earning master's degrees is slightly higher than that of males. These "}, {"section_title": "Highest degree earned as of 2001-02", "text": "Chapter 3: Program Outcomes and Impact results suggest that for McNair participants, men may be more likely to earn other terminal degrees, and women may be more likely to earn master's degrees, but there are no gender differences in who earns doctoral degrees. However, these differences are quite small and are the result of relatively small numbers of advanced-degree holders. Future reports will continue to explore any gender differences as more participants obtain degrees. There were little differences in highest degree obtained for low-income and fi rst-generation and underrepresented students. Higher proportions of white and Asian participants earned advanced degrees, including master's, doctoral, and other terminal degrees, whereas smaller proportions of African American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native participants earned advanced degrees.  Table 3.09 describes the participants who have earned doctoral degrees. Compared with all McNair participants, the group of doctoral degree recipients comprised more whites and Asians and fewer Hispanics and American Indians than were expected. There were no differences by gender or eligibility status. Refl ecting the target population served, the McNair Program is producing higher proportions of doctorates among low-income and fi rst-generation and underrepresented groups. Nationally, women earn 35 percent of doctorates; fi rst-generation college students earn exactly half, and members of underrepresented ethnic groups earn only 8 percent (Nettles & Millett, 1999;Kerlin, 1995). Compared with these national proportions, higher percentages of McNair doctorate recipients were female, fi rstgeneration and low-income, and underrepresented. McNair doctorate recipients were 65 percent female and 69 percent low-income and fi rst-generation. Sixty-three percent of McNair doctorates were earned by students from groups underrepresented in graduate education. 10"}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4 Future Directions", "text": "Participation in the McNair Program is associated with increased graduate school entrance rates. McNair participants, who benefi t from a higher entrance rate into graduate school than nonparticipants, persist through graduate school at similar rates as nonparticipants. On average, nearly half of all students who begin doctoral study obtain the Ph.D. (Golde, 2001;Kerlin, 1995). Of McNair participants who enroll in graduate school, slightly less than half are still enrolled four years later. Research suggests that fi nancial diffi culty is the most frequent reason for graduate school withdrawal, and students from low-income backgrounds (the target population of the McNair Program) are particularly vulnerable to fi nancial diffi culties (Nettles & Millett, 1999;Kerlin, 1995;Lovitts, 2001). Further, most graduate support comes in the form of research or teaching assistantships, and the amount and availability of this support vary by fi eld of study. Assistantships in science and engineering programs are more readily available and tend to provide more money than assistantships in other fi elds (Choy & Geis, 2002). However, the majority of doctoral students are not enrolled in science or engineering fi elds. In addition, the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic students is particularly pronounced in science and engineering, the fi elds that provide more assistantships (National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, 2000;Nettles & Millett, 1999). Because McNair participants may be more likely than traditional graduate students to face fi nancial diffi culty, exploring the relationship between fi nancial assistance, pursued majors, and persistence in graduate school could be of great relevance and warrants future exploration. After fi nancial diffi culties, a lack of social support is the most frequent reason for leaving doctoral programs (National Academy of Sciences, 1997). Even though most graduate programs actively recruit members of groups underrepresented in graduate school, the environment is not always supportive of them once they enroll. Fewer women reported satisfaction with the graduate school environment than did men (69 vs. 80 percent), and smaller proportions of African Americans, Latinos, and Alaska Natives reported satisfaction than did whites and Asians (60 vs. 74 percent; National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, 2000). Indeed, more Hispanic and African American doctoral students stopped out of their programs because of a \"lack of social fi t\" than did whites and Asians (8 and 6 percent vs. 4 and 5 percent; Nettles & Millett, 1999). We suspect that students who continue their graduate studies in the same institution from which they received McNair Program services would receive a higher level of social support than those who continued their graduate work in a different institution. As a result, a plausible research question is determining whether participants who pursue their graduate work in the same institution have a higher retention rate than those who transfer to a different institution. In addition to determining persistence from the APRs, we also recommend conducting a small intensive survey on former McNair students who have dropped out of graduate school. The purpose of this survey is to gain understanding about the circumstances under which the student decided to terminate his or her graduate work, thus providing insights into how existing services and activities should be modifi ed and what new activities should be developed. However, querying students about the reasons they stopped pursuing a doctoral degree requires identifying who, among the McNair participants, has actually dropped out and will not continue. Presently, there is no defi nition of dropout for McNair participants-the assumption applied is that ultimately all McNair participants will earn their doctoral degrees so there is no defi nition for failure. Defi ning dropouts among the McNair participants would be a useful fi rst step in exploring the factors related to graduate school attrition among McNair participants. The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study began following a new cohort consisting of 2000-01 bachelor's recipients. In future years, we will compare McNair participants with this newer cohort for graduate persistence and degree obtainment rates. Including graduate fi nancial aid and graduate fi eld of study in future data collections will highlight how these factors relate to graduate school success for McNair participants. As briefl y described in Chapter 1, our analysis also revealed that some grantees report serving many more students than they were funded to serve. Further investigation based on conversations with project staff and analysis of the project objective portion of the APRs suggests that overreporting may be the result of lacking a common understanding of how \"students served\" should be defi ned-some grantees defi ne students served more liberally than others. For example, some grantees defi ne the number of participants a program is funded to serve as the number of new participants they are expected to recruit each year instead of the total number they are expected to serve including new and continuing participants. Another reason for the overreporting is a misconception that grantee performance is determined, in part, by how far the grantee exceeds the targeted number of students to be served. Future correspondence to the grantees should clarify the defi nition of students served and the importance of defi ning and reporting this number correctly in the evaluation of grantee performance."}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "text": "This glossary lists the terms used in the report.

The Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, is a longitudinal study providing information concerning education and work experiences after completion of bachelor's degrees. B&B provides both cross-sectional information one year after bachelor's degree completion, comparable to the Recent College Graduate (RCG) Survey, and longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate-level education and the workforce. B&B provides information on entry into, persistence and progress through, and completion of graduate-level education. This information has not been available through follow-ups involving high school cohorts or even college-entry cohorts, both of which are restricted in the number who actually complete the bachelor's degrees and continue their education. In the fi rst B&B study, about 11,000 students were identifi ed in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS):93 who completed their degree in the 1992-93 academic year.

The Carnegie Classifi cation, originally published in 1973, was subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, and 2000. Participant status was then verifi ed using prior-year data for all students as described below, and all students reported in each year were then reclassifi ed into one of the following participant groups for that year: active participant, new participant, and all participants. It is according to the following defi nitions of participant status that we describe participants in Chapters 2 and 3. (1) Active participants as described in Chapters 2 and 3 include those students whom grantees classify as \"new\" participants and who (a) are not reported in previous years or (b) have a project entry date in the academic year in which they are reported as \"new.\" Active participants also include students classifi ed as \"continuing\" who are currently enrolled as an undergraduate. (2) New participants as described in Chapters 2 and 3 include those who (a) were not present in previous year's data and whose participant status was \"new\" or (b) whose project entry dates indicated they were new to the McNair Program in the year they were fi rst included in the APR. (3) All participants as described in Chapter 2 include active (new and continuing) and all prior-year participants reported by each project, except for those who have earned a doctoral degree (once a student earns a doctorate, they are no longer tracked or included in the annual performance reports). A fi rst-generation college student is the following: (1) an individual neither of whose natural or adoptive parents received a baccalaureate degree; or (2) a student who, prior to the age of 18, regularly resided with and received support from only one natural or adoptive parent and whose supporting parent did not received a baccalaureate degree. Services. Defi nitions applicable to \"services\" include the following: \u2022 Academic counseling means assisting students in making educational plans, selecting appropriate courses, developing career plans, meeting academic requirements, and planning for graduation education. \u2022 Admissions assistance means workshops or individualized assistance to help participants successfully complete graduate school applications. \u2022 Campus visitations mean project-sponsored trips to postsecondary institutions for the purpose of acquainting students with institutions that the project participants may wish to attend. \u2022 Career awareness means project-sponsored activities, such as fi eld trips, special lectures, and workshops, to increase students' knowledge of the various career opportunities available. \u2022 College entrance exam preparation means workshops, tutoring, or individualized assistance specifi cally designed to help students meet scoring requirements on national or state standardized tests given to students for admission into a postsecondary educational institution. \u2022 Financial aid assistance means workshops or individualized assistance to help participants complete various fi nancial aid applications, including scholarship applications, U.S. Department of Education federal student fi nancial aid applications, and state applications for fi nancial aid. \u2022 Other research means research activities for which students did not receive any payment from the McNair program. \u2022 Seminars mean any seminar intended to prepare students for graduate school.\n\u2022 Summer internships mean only those research activities for which students who have completed their sophomore year received the legislated stipend of up to $2,800. \u2022 Tutorial assistance means individual or small-group informal academic assistance provided by professional staff or students who are either part-time paid, volunteer, or internship-for-credit students. An underrepresented student is one belonging to a group that is underrepresented in graduate education, including those of Hispanic, African American or American Indian/Alaska Natives descent. The quality of the data provided by McNair grantees is steadily improving. Table C-2 describes the percentage of all cases reported each year by all projects that are missing, invalid, or out of range. Most data fi elds have fewer than 5 percent of cases that are invalid, and the percentage of these cases decreases each year. Because McNair Programs are required to track participants until the Ph.D. is awarded, each participant is included in every year's Annual Performance Report until the Ph.D. (or other terminal degree) is granted. After a participant graduates, projects must track and report on his or her academic progress through graduate school. Because not all participants enroll in graduate school or obtain a Ph.D., the APRs include many prior-year participants not currently enrolled in any academic program. The diffi culty associated with tracking and reporting on participants every year who are no longer making academic progress accounts for the relatively higher percentage of invalid data for the \"current grade level,\" \"enrollment status,\" and \"degree\" variables.
