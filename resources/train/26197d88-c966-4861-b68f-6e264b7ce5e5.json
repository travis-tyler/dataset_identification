Key words: disparities, gender, mental health, rurality W HILE mental health problems are both prevalent and costly, treatment for these conditions continues to be far less than adequate. Recent commissions and studies have shown that only about half of the people with mental health problems receive treatment for their mental health conditions and less than half of those receive treatment that meets minimally acceptable standards. [1] [2] [3] [4] Furthermore, there is evidence that the availability of some types of treatment, notably psychotherapy, has significantly declined. 5 Su-perimposed on the system-wide failure to treat mental health problems are disparities in treatment evident among certain groups, including rural residents, ethnic minorities, and men. 4, [6] [7] [8] "}, {"section_title": "MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT", "text": "Treatment outcome is highly dependent on treatment quality, which is described in practice guidelines (eg, American Psychiatric Association, Web site www.psych.org). Practice guidelines are evidence based and prescribe both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy as first-line treatments for most psychiatric disorders. Receipt of evidence-based treatment is associated with better outcomes, [9] [10] [11] [12] including reduction in symptoms and disability, and improvements in work performance. [13] [14] [15] [16] Delivery of mental health services occurs in diverse settings; however, treatment in the mental health specialty sector, where patients are 169 more likely to receive guideline-concordant care, is consistently associated with better outcomes. 3, 4, 11 In the general healthcare sector, which is increasingly responsible for the treatment of mental health problems because of changes in the financing of mental health care, those with psychiatric disorders are less likely to receive minimally adequate care, 4, 17 or practice guideline-concordant care."}, {"section_title": "18-22", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Rurality", "text": "Recent studies have shown that rural residents are less likely to receive mental health treatment in both specialty mental health and primary care settings (Hauenstein et al, unpublished data, 2005). Freiman and Zuvekas 23 found that rural residents receive less specialty care, decreasing with the number of available psychiatrists per 1000 residents. Seriously mentally ill rural residents also have been shown to receive fewer specialty services, even though public mental health services are mandated for this population. 24, 25 A survey and 6-month follow-up of treatment for depression showed that rural residents were less likely to receive guideline-concordant care compared with nonrural residents, and distance to care was one factor that led to insufficient care. 6, 26 Rural residents are more likely to incur the consequences of inadequate treatment. Rural residents with psychiatric disorders are more likely to be hospitalized and to attempt suicide [27] [28] [29] than are those in nonrural areas. Poor treatment is related to distance to care, lack of specialty providers, traditional health beliefs, and stigma. 4, 6, 25, 26, 30 One difficulty in interpreting the effects of rural-urban residence on mental health treatment is the variability in defining rurality across studies. Most often, rural is characterized as not metropolitan. 6, 23, 28 There is considerable heterogeneity among rural counties defined in this way, which ranges from very rural (population \u22642,500) to those with rural attributes but adjacent to a major metropolitan area. Dichotomizing counties into metropolitan or nonmetropolitan fails to account for numerous variables that may account for patterns of utilization and may disguise actual rates of treatment in rural areas. There is also little consistency across studies that use finer measures of rurality. For example, recent studies have used the urban influence codes, 31 rural-urban continuum codes (Petterson et al, unpublished data, 2006), and census definitions of rurality, 4 making comparisons across studies difficult."}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "Research has shown that overall men receive less mental health treatment in both the general health and mental health specialty sector than do women. 8, 23, 32 For example, Frieman and Zuvekas 23 found lower treatment rates for men, including prescription of psychotropic medication. There is also evidence of a gender difference in how men and women access care. Men are more likely to use emergency services, while women are more likely to enter treatment through primary care. 33, 35 There is some evidence, however, that men's uptake of mental health services is different from that for women. 32 Although women are more likely to obtain treatment, men are more likely to benefit from intervention. Wang et al 4 also showed that women receive more mental health treatment than do men, but not specialty mental health treatment; however, other studies have reported that women receive more treatment in all settings. 23, 35 The cited studies did not address the effects of gender on treatment in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "Perceived mental health", "text": "Numerous studies have examined the relationship between patients' self-rating of mental health and treatment visits. Self-reported mental health tends to correlate with diagnosed psychiatric problems. For example, Rucci et al 36 found that poor self-reported health was associated with later diagnosed ICD-10 mental disorders. Self-reported health and mental health have been associated with the use of healthcare services. Our recent work has shown a linear relationship between self-reported mental health and use of mental health services (Hauenstein et al, unpublished data, 2005) . Fair and poor health has been associated with greater use of specialty mental health and psychotropic medications. 23 In another study, self-reported health was associated with greater healthcare utilization over a 22-year period. 37 Yet another study showed that those who perceived a need for mental health treatment were 6 times more likely to receive a specialty mental health visit. 38 A large community-based study in Puerto Rico showed that poor reported mental health was associated with utilization of mental health services for women (25.8%) but even more so for men (31.6%). 39 These studies illustrate the utility of this self-report measure in estimating current health status and in predicting health services utilization. There is a clear link between thinking you are sick and getting help.\nIt is apparent that both gender and rural residence can independently affect mental health services use. The extent to which disparities exist in the amount and quality of mental health services used by gender and residence is more obscure. The present research evaluates the extent to which gender and residential disparities exist in the use of specialty mental health services, or services use overall. We further examine how self-reported mental health mediates the relationship between gender and rural residential effects. We use 1996-1999 panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 40 to determine rural-urban disparities in mental health treatment for men and women. These nationally representative data are collected to monitor the use and costs of healthcare in the United States. To determine rurality, we use the rural-urban continuum codes, 41 which differentiates rural areas by their size and adjacency to an urbanized area. Our expectation was that when examined by this refined measure of rurality, rural men and women would receive less treatment than urban men and women, and rural men would receive the least treatment of all of these groups."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The MEPS 40 is the third in a series of national surveys designed to provide estimates of the use of health services, medical expenditures, and sources of payment including insurance coverage. The MEPS comprises surveys of households, healthcare and insurance providers, and nursing homes. The household survey collects data on demographic characteristics, use of medical care services, payments, access to care, income, and employment. Interviews are conducted with one member of each household who reports on the healthcare experiences for the entire household. The target population for the MEPS is the civilian noninstitutionalized population residing in the United States. Thus, the sample does not include a substantial number of users of mental health services provided in institutions such as long-term or military psychiatric facilities, residential settings, and jails and prisons, among other residence-based facilities. It also does not include people who are homeless.\nBeginning with 1996, a new household MEPS sample was selected each year from a nationally representative subsample of households participating in the National Health Interview Survey of the preceding year. After a preliminary contact, the panel for each year is interviewed 5 times over the next 2 1 / 2 years, at roughly 6-month intervals. For example, Panel 1, the 1996 panel, was interviewed 5 times from March 1996 through May 1998. In each of the 5 rounds of interviews, the panel was asked for current information on certain variables and for the healthcare experiences of household members during a period preceding the interview. For most respondents, the first interview round obtains information on the period from January 1 of the panel's first year to the date of the first interview, while the second, third, and fourth rounds ask for information for the period from the preceding interview to the current interview. The fifth and last round asks for information for the period from the fourth interview to December 31 of the panel's second year. Information was thus obtained for 5 nonoverlapping periods of time covering 2 calendar years. Since a new panel is formed each year, the panels overlap increasing the effective sample size at a given point in time.\nIn this analysis, we used pooled data from the first 4 panels of the MEPS, which provide information on the years 1996-2000. The overall response rate, combining the National Health Interview Survey response rate and the response rate for round 1 of the MEPS, varies between 73% and 78% for Panels 1 to 4. For almost all respondents (96.4%), we had information from 2 full calendar years, and we treated the observations for each year as separate observations. The survey weights and design variables took multiple observations of an individual into account. Of the 56,375 observations with positive sample weights and interviews in the calendar year, we excluded 17,073 observations with ages below 18 and 6,240 observations with ages over 64, as well as an additional 628 cases because of missing information on at least one variable used in our analysis. We excluded elderly respondents because of near universal insurance coverage with Medicare in this group, and so we could independently examine the effect of being uninsured on treatment rates. After excluding these cases, our sample consisted of 34,356 respondents yielding 66,741 personyear observations."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Reported mental health problems were identified at each MEPS interview. Primary respondents were asked to identify their own and other household members' physical and mental health problems, whether treated or untreated, in the reference period prior to the interview. These conditions were recorded verbatim by the interviewer and subsequently categorized by trained coders into International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. However, to protect the confidentiality of respondents, only 3-digit codes are available to the public. For our purposes, we classified as mental health conditions those conditions that had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes between 290 and 315 as well as codes of 797 (\"senility without psychosis\") and V40 (\"mental/behavioral problem\"). In a separate section of the interview, respondents were asked whether they were taking any medication and if so for which medical condition. A small number of respondents (approximately 3%) added to their list of existing medical conditions when asked about medical conditions in this manner.\nWe defined treatment for a mental health problem as any visit to a healthcare provider in a calendar year that the respondent reported was for a mental health problem, as defined above. We characterized specialty mental health treatment using several variables in the MEPS. For each medical visit, respondents were asked whether their visit was best described, for example, as a general checkup, diagnosis or psychotherapy, or mental health counseling. In a follow-up question, respondents were asked whether during the visit they received specific treatments, for example, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, drug or alcohol treatment, or psychotherapy/counseling. For our purposes, we defined specialized treatment as all visits characterized as \"psychotherapy or mental health counseling\" or \"drug or alcohol treatment\" or \"psychotherapy/counseling.\"We also considered any visits to a nonphysician mental health specialistpsychologist, social worker, or counseloras specialized treatment. Precedence for use of this definition for specialized treatment can be found in the work of Olfson and colleagues. 5 Note that one limitation of the MEPS data is that it is not possible to distinguish psychiatrists from other physicians. Here, we define any type of mental health treatment as either treatment or specialized treatment for a mental health problem in the calendar year. In our sample, we identified 2,483 respondents who had at least one visit of any type of mental health treatment during a calendar year and 1,066 respondents who Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area 9\nCompletely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area * MSA indicates metropolitan statistical area.\nhad at least one visit of specialized treatment during the calendar year. Our measure of rurality is the rural-urban continuum codes developed by the Department of Agriculture. This is a county-level classification providing complete coverage of the United States. As shown in Table 1 , counties are grouped on a roughly ordinal scale using 3 criteria: absolute population size, population dispersion, and physical proximity to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). One advantage of this measure is that it is widely available and in use by the Bureau of Health Care Professions and the Department of Agriculture. On the basis of a comparison of alternative measures of rurality, 31 we collapsed the rural-urban continuum into 3 levels of rurality: MSA with codes of 1-3, non-MSA with codes 4-6 (hereafter least rural non-MSA), and non-MSA with codes 7-9 (hereafter most rural non-MSA). In our sample, 26,521 respondents resided in MSA counties, 4,681 resided in urbanized non-MSA counties, and 2,444 resided in rural non-MSA counties.\nInformation on reported mental health was obtained by asking, \"How would you rate your [or person's] overall mental health?\" on a 5-point scale (responses ranged from \"excellent\" to \"poor\"). The MEPS includes a parallel measure of general health, also based on a 5-point scale anchored from excellent to poor. In cases where the respondent was not present at the interview, the primary respondents for the household survey were asked to report the mental health and general health status of other household members. These proxy reports of overall mental health were obtained for a little less than 40% of the sample. To control for potential bias, in our multivariate analyses we included a dummy variable to flag these cases; \"self report\" is equal to 1 for self-reports and 0 for proxy reports.\nSeveral demographic variables were used as controls in our models: age, income-to-needs ratio, schooling, and geographic region. Age was coded categorically in the ranges 18-24, 25-44, and 45-64 years. In the MEPS, we used 2 indicators of socioeconomic status: income-to-needs ratio and schooling. Incometo-needs ratios are calculated by dividing family income during the calendar year by the family's poverty line (based on family size and composition). The income-to-needs ratios include values imputed for cases with missing income. The resulting percentages were grouped as follows: less than 100% of poverty line (poor), 100% to 125% (near poor), 125% to 200%, 201% to 400%, and more than 400%. Schooling was categorized as 0 to 11, 12, and 13+ years. To minimize problems of endogeneity, schooling and employment status were measured in the MEPS at the first interview during the calendar year (the first interview for the first calendar year and the third interview for the second calendar year).\nRegion was coded categorically using Census definitions: north east, north central, south, and west."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The MEPS has a complex multistage sample design that uses stratification, cluster sampling, and oversampling of certain population groups. All analyses were done using the svy (survey) commands in STATA 8.2, which takes the design into account. STATA uses linearization-based variance estimators, which are appropriate for the design variables provided with the MEPS data. We used strata and primary sampling unit variables specifically provided by the MEPS for purposes of pooling data across years. In addition, the survey weights and design variables were adjusted to take multiple observations of an individual into account. To test multidimensional hypotheses, we carried out an adjusted Wald test, which uses the approximate F statistic (d \u2212 k + 1)W/(kd), where W is the Wald test statistic, k is the dimension of the hypothesis test, and d is the total number of sampled PSUs minus the number of strata.\nIn the following analysis, we first present the descriptive statistics for our sample of nonelderly adults across gender and level of rurality (Table 2) . We also present treatment rates-any type of mental health visit, specialized visits, and number of visits-across the same dimensions in Table 3 . Figure 1 reports the probability of any type of treatment at each level of reported mental health. Multivariate results are presented in Table 4 , using logistic regression when the outcome is dichotomous (any type of treatment and specialized treatment) and linear regression when the outcome is continuous (number of visits). We also computed predicted treatment rates, setting all covariates to their mean for the subsample of nonelderly men and nonelderly women. Table 2 . Our findings are similar to those of others investigating rural populations in that residents in most rural non-MSA counties-both men and womenwere older, more likely to be White, and located in the south and midwest. Our results show that residents in non-MSA counties were more likely to be married than their counterparts in MSA counties. There were no urbanrural differences in the age or presence of children, but across all levels of rurality men were more likely to not live with their children."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics by gender and level of rurality are presented in", "text": "The likelihood of being poor also increased with rurality for both men and women. Within each level of rurality, however, a greater percentage of women than men were poor. For example, 16 .8% of women in the most rural non-MSA counties had poverty-level incomes (income-to-needs ratio < 100%) compared with 12.4% of women in MSA counties. The corresponding percentages for men were 12.3% in the most rural non-MSA counties and 8.3% in MSA counties. The proportion of men and women with less than 12 years of schooling increased significantly with levels of rurality (P < 0.01). Across all levels of rurality, there was no significant difference in employment rates among women and men.\nConsistent with other studies discussed above, most rural non-MSA residentswhether men or women-were more likely to be uninsured than their counterparts in metropolitan areas. An interesting finding was that a substantially greater fraction of men in the 2 types of non-MSA counties had coverage through public insurance than their counterparts in MSA counties.\nA key result was that for both men and women, reported mental health deteriorated slightly but significantly as rurality increased (P < 0.01 for men and P < 0.05 for women). For instance, the percentage reporting \"excellent\" mental health declined from 42.9% for women in MSA counties to 39.2% in the least rural non-MSA counties and to 38.2% in the most rural non-MSA (7-9) counties. For men, there was also a comparable decline in reported mental health across levels of rurality. Similarly, men and women in the most rural non-MSA counties reported poorer general health than did their counterparts in more urban counties. Across gender, men generally reported better mental and general health than did women at each level of rurality.\nEstimates, by level of rurality and within gender of (1) the percentage receiving any type of mental health treatment in a calendar year, (2) the percentage receiving specialized mental health treatment in a calendar year, and (3) the mean number of visits (of any mental health treatment type in a calendar year), appear in Table 3 . Our results show that women residing in the most rural non-MSA counties received significantly less of any treatment and of specialty treatment than did women living in urban areas. Treatment rates of women in the least rural non-MSAs were similar to those of women in MSA counties; both were higher than the rate for women in the most rural counties. Just 7.5% of women in the most rural non-MSA counties received any type of treatment compared with 10.1% of those in MSA counties and 11.1% of those in non-MSA, less rural counties. Likewise, just 4.4% of the most rural women received specialized treatment compared with 6.6% and 5.9% of women, respectively, in MSA and non-MSA, less rural counties. It is interesting to note that among women who did obtain mental health treatment, women in the least rural non-MSA counties had significantly fewer visits (mean = 5.12) than their counterparts in either MSA counties (mean = 8.54) or the most rural non-MSA counties (mean = 7.35).\nA second finding, consistent with previous research, is that in each type of county men received significantly less treatment than did women, but the difference between men and Number of visits in year NS NS NS * Standard errors are in parentheses.

The last 3 rows report gender differences for each measure by level of rurality. MSA indicates metropolitan statistical area.\nwomen was smaller in the most rural non-MSA counties. For any treatment, across all levels of rurality, there were no differences in rates of treatment. The pattern was different, however, for specialty mental health treatment; men in both nonmetropolitan areas received less specialty care than did men living in MSAs. Likewise, among men who obtained some type of treatment, the mean number of visits in a calendar year was lower in non-MSA counties than in MSA counties. Self-reported mental health was significantly related to receipt of treatment for both men and women. Figure 1 focuses on differences in rates of any type of treatment by level of reported mental health. There was a sharp increase in treatment rates as mental health deteriorated from \"excellent\"to \"poor\" for both men and women. For men with mental health ranging from \"excellent\" to \"good,\" there were only small differences in treatment rates by level of rurality. However, among the group that reported needing treatment the most-those with \"fair\" and \"poor\" mental health-far fewer men in the rural non-MSA counties obtained treatment than did their counterparts in MSAs or least rural non-MSA counties.\nThis figure also illustrates the sharp difference in treatment rates between women in the most rural non-MSA counties and other types of counties, with the obvious exception of those with \"poor\" mental health. This finding may be due to the very small sample of women in this category; the estimate for women with poor mental health in the most rural counties was based on just 32 personyear observations. Among women who reported \"fair\" mental health, for example, only 25.6% of women in the most rural non-MSA counties obtained mental health treatment compared with rates greater than 40% in both MSA and least rural non-MSA counties.\nMultivariate regression results estimated separately for women and men are shown in Table 4 ; the full set of estimates is presented in Appendix A. This table also presents predicted values for women and men across each level of rurality. These values were obtained Table 1 ).

Predicted values were computed with all covariates set at their mean for the full sample of women in Panel A and for men in Panel B. Absolute value of t ratio in parentheses. \u2021 Significant at 5%. \u2020 Significant at 1%.\nby substituting the means of the covariates for the entire sample of either men or women into the corresponding regression model. As a whole, multivariate regression results are consistent with those reported above. First, we found substantial differences in treatment rates across levels of rurality that persisted even when reported mental health and sociodemographic variables were controlled in the analysis. All else equal, the odds of any treatment for women in either MSA or the least rural non-MSA counties were more than 1.5 times the odds of treatment for women in the most rural non-MSA counties. We found that women in the most rural non-MSA counties were significantly less likely to obtain any type of mental health treatment and especially specialized treatment than were their counterparts in metropolitan counties or less rural non-MSA counties. The predicted treatment rates of 10.18% in MSA and 10.39% in least rural non-MSA counties were significantly higher than the predicted rate of 7.24% for women in the most rural non-MSA counties. Mental health specialty treatment rates for women were also significantly higher in MSA counties (6.56%) than the rates of their counterparts in the most rural counties (4.63%); among women receiving treatment, the predicted number of visits of any type of treatment was slightly lower (\u03b2 = \u22122.274) in least rural non-MSA counties. The results in Table 4 for men also show a statistically significant difference in specialty treatment (but not any type of treatment or number of visits) across level of rurality. In particular, the predicted rate of mental health specialty treatment in the most rural non-MSA counties was nearly half the rate in MSA counties, 2.34% compared to 4.13%."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our findings showing that both men and women living in the most rural areas receive less specialty mental health treatment than do those living in MSA counties likely reflect the paucity of mental health resources available in rural areas. Of the 518 designated mental health professional shortage areas, 76% are located in nonmetropolitan areas. 42 Merwin and her colleagues 43 showed that the odds of having a shortage of mental health professionals increased with the level of rurality, with the most rural non-MSAs having a 4-fold likelihood of having too few mental health providers. The centralization of community mental health centers in response to reductions in financing of mental health may also play a role in the reduced specialty mental health treatment rates in rural areas. 44 What may be more significant is our finding that women residing in the most rural non-MSA counties had significantly lower levels of any treatment than women in least rural non-MSA and MSA counties. Women are more likely to perceive a need for mental health treatment, to desire specific mental health treatments, and to receive their care in primary care settings. 37, [45] [46] [47] Given women's greater propensity to obtain mental health services, the rural-urban disparity in mental health treatment for women we report here may be a good index of the unmet need for mental health services in rural areas in primary care as well as traditional specialty mental health care. An interesting finding was that women in the least rural non-MSA counties had shorter durations of treatment than did either women in MSA counties or those in most rural non-MSA counties. Our current findings do not shed light on explanations of this disparity in treatment for women. For example, women in least rural non-MSA counties reported their mental health to be equivalent to that of women in MSA and rural non-MSA counties, and so less treatment cannot be attributed to better mental health in this sample. Least rural non-MSA counties as we have defined them here are either adjacent to a metropolitan area, or have a population of 20,000 or more. They also tend to be recently transformed areas, as people migrate from larger urban areas seeking a more rural area. 48 Because these areas are changing, they may have relative shortages of mental health providers, necessitating travel to large urban centers to receive care, decreasing the number of overall visits received. This is an area for further research as we begin to understand more about how rural communities change.\nThe finding that men received less treatment than did women across all levels of rurality is consistent with previous research. There is a paucity of data on outcomes of mental health treatment for rural men. A recent and important study using the rural-urban continuum codes showed that men residing in the most rural counties had higher suicide rates than did those residing in urban areas, corresponding with our findings that men residing in the most rural areas received less mental health specialty treatment. 49 These investigators further show that the rural-urban gap for suicide deaths has widened over a 27-year period. For example, male respondents from urban areas in the most recent cohort evaluated (1995-1997) had an age-adjusted suicide death rate of 17.5% versus 19.8% in the earliest cohort of urban men (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) . However, men from the 1995-1997 cohort living in the most rural areas had an ageadjusted suicide rate of 26.9% compared with 20.7% in the 1970-1974 cohort. It is reasonable to surmise from this report that urban men received more treatment than did those residing in more rural areas, thereby reducing preventable suicide deaths. These rates are disturbing when considering findings of Sherbourne et al 32 that men who had received specific mental health treatment had much improved quality of life and significantly more employed days compared with men who had received no specific mental health treatment.\nSelf-reported mental health is a strong predictor of mental health treatment. Our findings show that at all levels of self-reported mental health, both men and women received more treatment as their perception of the state of their mental health deteriorated. The data also suggest that both women and men in MSA counties were more likely to enter treatment before they perceived their mental health to be severely deteriorated than were those residing in either of the non-MSA counties. Indeed, our findings show that women in the most rural non-MSA counties were more likely to receive treatment at the poorest levels of reported mental health than were residents of MSA and least rural non-MSA counties. This finding is consistent with earlier studies that show that rural residents have higher suicide ideation and more hospitalizations than do residents of more urbanized areas."}, {"section_title": "27-29", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "This study has several limitations that must be addressed in future research. First, as noted above, the MEPS is restricted to the civilian, noninstitutionalized population and thus does not include many users of mental health services who are homeless or reside in longterm residences or military facilities, including those in psychiatric hospitals, prisons, and jails. The overlap of any treatment and specialized treatment is another limitation of the dataset we use. The MEPS does not discriminate between psychiatrists and generalist physicians; thus, we were unable to obtain independent estimators for these 2 facets of treatment. This study is also limited in its reliance on self-reports or proxy-reports of mental health and mental health conditions. Despite these limitations, our findings illustrate the need to study more comprehensively the mental health system that serves rural residents."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "That men and women residing in the most rural counties receive less specialty mental health care is not a surprising finding given the underfunding of mental health and known shortages of mental health providers in these areas. What is of concern is that women living in the most rural areas who rely on primary care services may not be receiving treatment in these settings at the same rate as provided in more urban areas. That men from the most rural counties receive services in primary care settings at the same rate as men in more urban areas likely is due to men's overall low utilization of mental health services, not more availability of these services to them. The increased uptake of mental health services as rural dwellers perceive their mental health to be at its worse only underscores the unmet need for mental health care for those living in the most remote rural settings."}]
