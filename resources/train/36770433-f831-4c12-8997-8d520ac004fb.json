These data suggest that the relative degree of structuring present in these two countries may be related to gene flow. These structuring levels were also supported by simple phylogenetic pairing methodologies such as UPGMA, which in this case, with a discontinuous pattern of genetic divergence between the groups (supports the idea of possible sub-geographical isolations resulting from past fragmentation events), was observed a not so numerous amount of branches in the tree generated and with few mutational steps.\nThese few mutations have possibly not yet been fixed by drift by the lack of the founding effect, which accompanies the behavior of dispersion and/or loss of intermediate haplotypes throughout the generations. The values found for genetic distance support the presence of this continuous pattern of low divergence between the groups studied, since they considered important the minimum differences between the groups, when the haplotypes between them were exchanged, as well as the inference of values greater than or equal to that observed in the proportion of these permutations, including the p-value of the test.\nThe discrimination of the 38 genetic entities in their localities was also perceived by their small inter-haplotypic variations, hierarchised in all covariance components: by their intra-and inter-individual differences or by their intra-and intergroup differences, generating a dendogram that supports the idea that the significant differences found in countries such as Brazil and Venezuela, for example, were shared more in their form than in their number , since the result of estimates of the average evolutionary divergence found within these and other countries, even if they exist, were very low.\nBased on the high level of haplotypic sharing, tests that measure the relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance, such as the Mantel test, were dispensed in this Estimators \u03b8, even though they are extremely sensitive to any form of molecular variation (FU, 1997) , supported the uniformity between the results found by all the .
