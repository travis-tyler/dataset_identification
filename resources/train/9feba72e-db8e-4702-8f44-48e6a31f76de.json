[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Mitochondrial genetics are an important but largely neglected area of research in Alzheimer's disease. A major impediment is the lack of data sets. Methods: We used an innovative, rigorous approach, combining several existing tools with our own, to accurately assemble and call variants in 809 whole mitochondrial genomes. Results: To help address this impediment, we prepared a data set that consists of 809 complete and annotated mitochondrial genomes with samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These whole mitochondrial genomes include rich phenotyping, such as clinical, fluid biomarker, and imaging data, all of which is available through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative website. Genomes are cleaned, annotated, and prepared for analysis. Discussion: These data provide an important resource for investigating the impact of mitochondrial genetic variation on risk for Alzheimer's disease and other phenotypes that have been measured in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative samples."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects .20 million people worldwide and is the only one of the top 10 causes of death that has no effective treatments [1-3]. Full-time care is required as AD progresses, further impacting patients and their loved ones and stressing the health-care system. With incidence expected to increase to 1 in 85 people by 2050 [2], it is essential to achieve early diagnosis, effective treatments, and a better understanding of the underlying etiology.\nUnderstanding the underlying mechanisms of risk for AD is a key for both diagnosis and treatment. Swerdlow et al. [4] proposed the Mitochondrial Cascade Hypothesis of AD. Briefly, an individual's genetics determine the baseline mitochondrial function and how mitochondria change as a person ages and declining mitochondrial function causes ADspecific pathologies.\nIn addition to the evidence provided by Swerdlow et al. [4] , several lines of evidence support a role for mitochondria 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc. edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.
