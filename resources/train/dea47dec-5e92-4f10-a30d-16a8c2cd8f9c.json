[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive and irreversible dementia, and accurate diagnosis of AD at its prodromal stage is clinically important. Currently, computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET) imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features or deep learning methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can reveal pathological information. Methods: In this study, 18 F-FDG PET and clinical assessments were collected in a cohort of 422 individuals [including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy controls (HCs)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 44 individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a two-sample Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) based on 30 AD patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on two time scans of 32 HCs from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient for radiomic feature stability analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients were regarded as a feature selection criterion, to select effective features associated with the clinical cognitive scale [clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes (CDRSB); Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to test the ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD patients. Results: As a result, we identified brain regions which were mainly distributed in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs. A total of 168 radiomic features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The classification experiment led to maximal accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI versus HCs and AD versus MCI.

Presently, approximately 90 million people have been diagnosed with AD, and it is estimated that the number of AD patients will reach 300 million by 2050. 1 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is considered a precursor of AD, has been an increasingly common target of potential therapeutic trials. 2 Currently, there is no effective cure solution for AD; thus, the early detection at its prodromal stage and accurate diagnosis of AD are important for patient care and developing future treatment. 3 In recent years, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technology has been widely used in the diagnosis, classification and rehabilitation evaluation of AD. In particular, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET, which is a functional molecular imaging modality performed utilizing glucose metabolic activity and distribution via imaging agents, 4 has been proven to be a valid tool to help doctors diagnose AD and MCI. 5 Currently, there are two primary categories of computer-aided diagnoses of AD and MCI based on 18 F-FDG PET imaging: (1) the numerical distribution method of glucose uptake values, and its common imaging markers are usually low-order and simple image features 6 ; (2) machine learning and deep learning techniques. Gary and colleagues 7 used multi-region PET image fusion structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to extract the average signal intensity per cubic millimeter in each region as features to classify AD patients and healthy controls (HCs), achieving an accuracy of 82%. Silveira and colleagues 5 proposed a boosting classification technique based on simple classifier hybridization for the diagnosis of AD and MCI, with average accuracies of 90.97% and 79.63%, respectively. Liu and colleagues 3 invented a classification framework based on the combination of two-dimensional convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, and the classification accuracies of AD or MCI versus HCs could reach 91.2% and 78.9%, respectively. However, the aforementioned low-order markers used in numerical methods were mostly hand-crafted, original, and low-level features that could not reveal the neuropathological heterogeneity of brain tissue and could hardly achieve high classification accuracy. [3] [4] [5] By comparison, although the deep learning frameworks could achieve better diagnostic accuracy, these methods only obtain the calculation values without clinical significance; thus, we cannot determine the association between intermediate values and the disease. For clinical practice, finding image features that can provide pathological information about diseases and using them for efficient classification diagnosis have great implications for physicians. In this paper, to find high-level image features and develop efficient and accurate diagnostic tools, we proposed an emerging method, radiomics, for 18 F-FDG PET image feature extraction. The term 'radiomics' refers to the extraction and analysis of large amounts of advanced and high-order quantitative features with high-throughput from medical images. 8, 9 These radiomic features could not only effectively diagnose disease and assist in treatment but also reveal the in-depth information hidden in the images that may help develop personalized and accurate medical plans. [8] [9] [10] Radiomics has been well developed in oncological studies. [11] [12] [13] [14] Although current radiomics research studies have been mainly focused on oncology, considerations have been recently extended to numerous medical applications. 8 However, no application of radiomics has been described in AD and MCI. Therefore, the present study was aimed to determine whether radiomic features extracted from 18 F-FDG PET brain images could be used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnoses, and then we proposed a novel computer-aided Alzheimer's diseases diagnosis approach based on radiomics."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "As shown in the Figure 1 , we first preprocessed the collected 18 F-FDG PET data using normalization and smoothing. Next, we performed statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses based on two-sample, Student's t tests of the preprocessed data to determine the regions of interest (ROIs). Subsequently, a few radiomic features were extracted from the ROIs. Thereafter, we applied the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient for feature selection. Finally, based on these selected radiomic features, we completed three classifications for AD versus HCs, MCI versus HCs and AD versus MCI using a support vector machine (SVM).

These 60 samples were not included in subsequent feature selection and classification experiments. We set the peak threshold at p < 0.01 with family-wise error correction over the entire brain regions with a threshold of 20 voxels. Significantly different brain areas were localized using the software xjView9.6 (www. alivelearn.net/xjview). Because MCI is an intermediate process of HC conversion to AD, we assume that these ROIs can also be used for feature extraction of MCI data. Thus, these regions were treated as ROIs in subsequent studies.

The radiomic features were separately extracted from the 32 HCs (HC1 group) in using their first-time and second-time 18 F-FDG PET images. The one type of radiomic feature extracted from these samples was divided into two feature vectors (first and second-time). The two vectors were then treated as inputs to calculate the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. We judged the stability of each feature by the value of alpha. The coefficient threshold was 0.8 and features above this value were considered stable and those features below this value were excluded from follow-up studies.\nSecond, to screen out the radiomic features associated with AD and MCI, we used Pearson's journals.sagepub.com/home/tan 7 Table 2 .

If there was a correlation, we believe that this feature was effective for AD or MCI and would be used for classification. To ensure statistical reliability, we conducted a crossvalidation test. Taking AD as an example, the cross-validation process was as follows: (1) we randomly chose 70 patients from the AD1 group (100 patients that were not used for SPM analysis described in section Regions of interest); (2) we extracted ROIs from the above 70 patients and got stable radiomic features; (3) we calculated the correlation between the ADAS scale and each feature using Pearson's correlation coefficients. As a result, those features which were related to ADAS (p < 0.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction) were considered as selected features; (4) the remaining 30 patients from the AD1 group were used as a test dataset for subsequent classification experiments. Finally, the above cross-validation process was repeated 500 times.\nFor the MCI group, we calculated the correlation between the CDRSB scale and each feature and did the same cross-validation process 500 times. In addition, we also did the same cross-validation process to explore radiomic features that were effective for both the AD group and MCI group by calculating the correlation between the ADAS scale and each feature. All calculations were implemented in MATLAB R2014b using raw values without normalization.\nTo further explore the consistency of the selected features in different conditions, we also extracted selected features using ROIs from the Huashan cohort and calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for those feature using samples which participated in feature selection cross-validation (CV) experiments (100 AD and 100 MCI patients). In this step, we also conducted classification experiments 500 times for each SVM classification. Taking the AD versus HCs classification as an example, we used 70 patients from the AD1 group (the same as 70 patients selected in the section, Feature selection) and randomly selected 70 patients from the HC2 group (100 patients that were not used for SPM analysis described in the section, Regions of interest) to train the SVM classifier. Then, we used the remaining 30 patients from the AD1 group and 30 patients from the HC2 group to test the SVM classifier. Finally, the Huashan cohort was used as the second test dataset to further validate the classification results. We also did the above process for AD versus MCI, and MCI versus HCs 500 times.

The classifier version used in this experiment was LIBSVM 2.9.1 (www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and was implemented in MATLAB R2014b. In addition, we repeated the above feature selection experimental process using ROIs obtained by the Huashan cohort as a comparison. The same classification experiments were also repeated.

To prove the stability and generalization of the proposed radiomic method, we selected different samples by different PET scanners with different imaging properties, including samples from the ADNI database and Huashan Hospital. This kind of cross-dataset research approach was frequently used in the radiomic studies to avoid the over-fitting problem, as well as to test the generalization ability of the whole research framework. 8, 11, 12, [21] [22] [23] LGRE, low-gray-level run emphasis; LGZE, low-gray-level zone emphasis; LRE, long-run emphasis; LRHGE, long-run high-gray-level emphasis; LRLGE, long-run low-gray-level emphasis; LZE, large zone emphasis; LZHGE, large zone high-gray-level emphasis; LZLGE, large zone low-gray-level emphasis; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; RLN, runlength nonuniformity; RLV, run-length variance; RP, run percentage; SRE, short-run emphasis; SRHGE, short-run high gray-level emphasis; SRLGE, short-run low-gray-level emphasis; SZHGE, small zone high-gray-level emphasis; SZLGE, small zone low-gray-level emphasis; ZP, zone percentage; ZSN, zone-size nonuniformity; ZSV, zone-size variance. To define ROIs, we performed a voxel-based, twosample, Student's t test in a group of 30 HCs and 30 AD individuals from ADNI cohorts to determine the brain areas associated with AD pathology.\nIn the subsequent experiments, we regarded the ROIs of AD as those of MCI because the patients with MCI who will be converted to AD have brain tissue lesions similar to those of AD. [24] [25] [26] [27] As shown in Tables 3 and 4 , most of the results are consistent with the typical results reported previously. Ferreira and colleagues found that the medial temporal region is the most consistent neurostructural biomarker for predicting AD, 28 and our results were consistent with this finding (AAL: Temporal_Mid, Temporal_Inf and Temporal_Sup). Occipital lobe regions (AAL: Occipital_Mid, Occipital_Sup, Occipital_Inf), anterior cingulate (AAL: Cingulum_ Post, Cingulum_Mid), and the parietal cortex area (AAL: Parietal_Sup, Parietal_Inf, Parietal_Sup) were also identified in agreement with previous studies. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] After t test analysis, an ROI template was obtained ( Figure 2 and Table 3 ), and features were extracted from this ROI. In total, 215 radiomic features were extracted for each sample, including intensity, texture, and wavelet features.\nRecent radiomics research studies usually involved shape features because the target ROIs with various shapes, such as the tumor areas, were segmented manually. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 22 However, those shape features were not included in this study. For brain PET studies, preprocessing steps usually include spatial normalization and smoothing. In this study, we followed this preprocessing process, further reducing the effects of shape differences. Moreover, individual heterogeneity in tumors was much higher than that in normal brain tissue. Therefore, our feature set did not contain shape features.\nIn addition, the stability of 215 radiomic features in brain 18 F-FDG PET images was determined, revealing 168 stable features (alpha > 0.8).\nStability analyses proved that more than half of Obviously, these connections were not caused by random factors. Hence, the stability results proved the reliability of subsequent analyses and indirectly proved that radiomic features contains a wealth of pathological information. The possible association of radiomic features with CDRSB and ADAS was explored based on Pearson's correlation. We found that many radiomic features that were not studied previously were relevant with cognitive scale values. Here, we studied two scales because ADAS is a scale specifically designed to measure cognitive performance in AD patients. 33 As described in the section Feature selection, two group analyses containing AD patients used ADAS values; however, for MCI patients, we used CDRSB because it is a scale specifically sensitive for MCI measurement. As a result of the feature selection, we found that about 50-70 features were associated with AD through the Pearson correlation coefficient, about 30-40 features were associated with MCI, and about 10-20 features were associated with AD and MCI mixed samples. Jaccard index values of frequently occurring features in Table 6 showed that selected features were consistent with the correlation with disease. These correlations suggested that highorder radiomic features extracted from 18 F-FDG PET brain imaging could be used not only for classification diagnosis but also contained rich information related to pathological processes for further study and mining. [8] [9] [10] 22 Importantly, on a 500-times cross-validation experiment based on both ADNI and Huashan cohorts using SVM as a classifier, we found that radiomic features had a distinct ability to classify AD versus HCs, MCI versus HCs and AD versus MCI with maximum average accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9%, respectively. By using the cross-validation method, the above results avoided the bias of test results, and presented the validity of the selected features, and SVM classification. 34 Table 9 lists the results of this paper compared with the results of previous studies, and these methods were complex image classification algorithms based on deep learning techniques. As shown in Table 9 , the radiomic method could achieved a satisfied classification accuracy in both AD versus HCs (91.5%) and MCI versus HCs (83.1%) comparable with complex algorithms. Thus, radiomics may have application prospects in the field of AD and MCI diagnosis. Because the significance of the calculation values existing in the neural network framework are unknown, compared with the deep learning framework, another advantage of radiomics is that its features are correlated with AD and MCI clinical scales. Based on this, a future study can investigate the relationship between the radiomic feature values and the disease directly to help physicians carry out personalized and precise treatment. 8 "}, {"section_title": "Limitations and further considerations", "text": "Although the potential application value of radiomics in the diagnosis of AD and MCI has been proven in the paper, some limitations persist that may influence the results of this study. First, for individuals from ADNI and the Huashan Hospital, their ages and races were not matched. The average Asians. Whether the differences in age and race will influence the results has not been studied yet and can be explored in subsequent studies.\nSecond, the shape and some texture features of PET images were lost in the preprocessing step, events that may influence the results. In this study, we used a smooth step and selected the MNI template for image registration and lost some texture and morphology information during the registration process. However, this is a routine step in other AD studies; thus, we followed this preprocessing principle. The effect of these preprocessing methods on the results is unknown and requires follow-up studies.\nThird, the pathobiological mechanism concerning the correlation between radiomic features and clinical scale was not explored in this paper. In our current research, we only confirmed that the radiomic features were related to the clinical scale, indicating that there is indeed a correlation between radiomic features and AD/MCI pathology; however, we did not further study the pathobiological mechanism. In future research, the mechanism between each feature and disease should be studied in detail."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, the research in this paper proved that high-order radiomic features extracted from 18 F-FDG PET brain images can be used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnoses.

The simplicity of the acquisition of radiomic features and its highthroughput nature would constitute powerful tools for personalized precision medicine for the population affected by AD and MCI."}, {"section_title": "Author Contribution", "text": "Yupeng Li and Jiaying Lu have contributed equally to this work."}]
