Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronically progressive neurodegenerative disease highly 18 correlated to aging. Whether AD originates by targeting a localized brain area and propagates to the 19 rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. Here, this 20 question is addressed at the group-level by looking to differences in diffusion-tensor brain networks. 21\nIn particular, making use of data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 4 22 different groups were defined (all of them matched by age, sex and education level): ( = , 23 healthy control participants, HC), ( = , early mild cognitive impairment, EMCI), ( = 24 , late mild cognitive impairment, LMCI) and ( = , AD). We built diffusion-tensor brain 25 networks and performed group comparison across 3 disease stages: stage I (HC vs EMCI), stage II 26 (HC vs LMCI) and stage III (HC vs AD). The group comparison was performed using the 27 multivariate distance matrix regression analysis, a technique that was born in genomics and was 28 recently proposed to handle functional network data, but here was applied to diffusion-tensor data. 29\nThe results were three-fold: First, no significant differences were found in stage I. Second, in stage II, 30 statistically significant differences were found in the connectivity pattern of a subnetwork strongly 31 associated to memory function (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, 32 fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal pole). 33\nThird, a widespread disconnection across the entire AD brain was found in stage III, affecting 34 stronger to the same memory subnetwork appearing in stage II plus to other subnetworks, including 35 the default mode network, the medial visual network, frontoparietal regions, and subnetworks 36 encompassing mainly subcortical structures (including part of the hippocampus, amygdala and 37 putamen). The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that group differences were approached across 38 severity progression. A better possibility would have been to analyze well time-resolved longitudinal 39 data, building diffusion-tensor networks belonging to the same patient across all disease stages (from 40 control to AD), but such data (to the best of our knowledge) are not available yet.\nProgressive brain disconnection in AD"}, {"section_title": "Introduction 42", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a chronically progressive 43 neurodegenerative disease highly correlated to aging; indeed, although the prevalence of clinically 44 manifested AD is about 2% at the age of 65 years, it increases to about 30% at the age of 85 years 45 (Wimo et al. 1997) . 46 AD is characterized by an accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles 47 composed of tau amyloid fibrils (Hardy 2006 ) associated with synapse loss and neurodegeneration 48 leading to long-term memory impairment and other cognitive problems. There is currently no known 49 treatment that slows down the progression of this disorder. 50\nThe initial AD pathology develops many years before the cognitive and functional impairments are 51 evident. Different terms have been used to describe this disease-starting condition, including pre-52 dementia and prodromal AD or MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The concept of MCI, a disorder 53 situated in the spectrum between normal age-related cognitive decline and dementia, has varied over 54 the past 2 decades. Indeed, MCI has been classified into different broad categories depending on 55 memory performance and the number of impaired cognitive functions (Mueller et al. 2005) . 56\nAn accurate prediction of conversion from MCI to AD can help to clinicians to evaluate AD risk pre-57 symptomatically, initiate treatments at early stage, and monitor their effectiveness (Cheng et al. 58 2015, Li et al. 2014 ). However, the group of MCI is highly heterogeneous, and not all MCI patients 59 convert to AD (Ritter et al. 2015) . Indeed, the annual rate in which MCI progresses to dementia 60 varies between 8% and 15% per year (Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki 2009 ). The amnestic subtype of MCI 61 is more prevalent than non-amnestic one (Petersen et al. 2010) , and it has a significantly higher 62 annual conversion rate to AD, between 30% (Schmidtke and Hermeneit 2008, Rozzini et al. 2007) to 63 40% (Geslani et al. 2005) . 64"}, {"section_title": "Progressive brain disconnection in AD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "This study aims to search for neuroimaging biomarkers that can account for differences with respect 65 to a healthy control (HC) population from the early to the final stages of AD. Multitude of different 66 neuroimaging studies has addressed the conversion from MCI to AD, see (Zhang et al. 2014 ) and 67 references therein. In relation to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was shown that the 68 hippocampus volume and the volume from other subcortical structures at MCI were well correlated 69 to a worse progression to AD, with accuracy of about 65% in the prediction from MCI to AD (Teipel 70 et al. 2015) . 71\nRather than assuming that specific brain regions are going to be affected by AD, other authors 72 achieved a better accuracy in the prediction from MCI to AD (achieving values of about 80% 73 accuracy) by performing a blind approach including multiple regions of interest (Westman et al. 74 2011 , Eskildsen et al. 2013 , Liu et al. 2013 ). The use of Tensor Diffusion MRI in combination with 75 structural MRI has provided better results as compared to solely structural MRI, finding that white-76 matter integrity of the fornix, cingulum, and parahippocampal gyrus provided accuracy varying from 77 80% to even 95% (Wee et al. 2013 , Mielke et al. 2012 , Douaud et al. 2013 . 78\nInitiatives like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provide open access to the 79 research community to important material and resources (demographic data, imaging datasets, 80 cognitive tests, etc.) to study AD, pushing forward studies correlating different imaging modalities to 81 the neuropsychological disease's status. Interestingly, ADNI also allows the possibility of studying 82 variations in the images across disease's progression, as brain images are categorized in different 83 groups ranging from HC to AD, with two intermediate stages, early and late mild cognitive 84 impairment, EMCI and LMCI, respectively. Albeit EMCI and LMCI patients have some memory 85 impairment beyond the standard dysfunction associated exclusively to aging or education level 86 (Medina et al. 2006) , the conversion rate to AD is only of 5-10% per year (Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki"}, {"section_title": "Diffusion tensor brain networks 152", "text": "To build diffusion tensor brain networks a similar methodology as in previous work was followed 153 (Diez et al. 2015 , Alonso-Montes et al. 2015 , Amor et al. 2015 using FSL (FMRIB Software 154 Library v5.0) and the Diffusion Toolkit. First, all the selected images were downloaded in DICOM 155 and transformed to Nifti format for further analysis. Next, an eddy current correction was applied to 156 overcome the artifacts produced by variation in the gradient field directions, together with the 157 artifacts produced by head movements. Next, using the corrected data, a local fitting of the diffusion 158 tensor was applied to compute the diffusion tensor model for each voxel. Next, a Fiber Assignment 159 by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm was applied (Mori et al. 1999) . Then a transformation 160 from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space to the individual-subject diffusion space was 161 applied and projected the brain hierarchical atlas (available to download at 162 http://www.nitrc.org/projects/biocr_hcatlas/). In particular, M=20 modules were considered that was 163 shown in (Diez et al. 2015) to best-match functional connectivity modules with structural ones. This 164 allowed building 20 x 20 structural connectivity (SC) matrices, each per subject, by counting the 165 number of white matter streamlines connecting all module pairs. Thus, the element matrix (i,j) of SC 166 is given by the streamlines number between modules i and j. As a result, SC is a symmetric matrix, 167\nwhere connectivity from i to j is equal to that from j to i. 168 169"}, {"section_title": "Cross-group analysis: Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression 170", "text": "The cross-group analysis has been performed using the Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression 171 (MDMR) approach proposed in (Shehzad et al. 2014 ). Based on the hypothesis that at the early 172 stages of the AD progression, if some subnetworks disconnect will propagate at further stages to the 173 rest of the brain, a multivariate distance regression was chosen to apply, which allows testing the variation of distance in connectivity patterns between groups as a response of the Alzheimer's 175 progression as compared to the HC state. For a fixed brain module i, the distance between 176 connectivity patterns of module i to the rest of the brain was calculated per pair of subjects (u,v) --by 177 calculating Pearson correlation between connectivity vectors of subject pairs--, thus leading to a 178 distance matrix in the subject space for each module i investigated. In particular, the following 179 formula was calculated 180\nwhere is the Pearson correlation between connectivity patterns of i for subjects u and v. After 182 repeating the same procedure for all subjects, as many distance matrices as partition modules 183 ( = 1, \u2026 ,20) were obtained. Next, MDMR was applied to perform cross-group analysis as 184 implemented in R (McArtor 2016). 185\nIt is important to emphasize that NDMR does not look to how individual modules are locally 186 organized or connected, but to the integration connectivity pattern between those segregated modules 187 to the rest of the brain. Therefore, when NDMR finds group differences in a given module, this 188 means that the connectivity alterations from that module are being propagated to the rest of the brain. 189 MDMR yielded a pseudo-F estimator (analogous to that F-estimator in standard ANOVA analysis), 190 which addresses significance of disease strength due to between-group variation as compared to 191"}, {"section_title": "within-group variations (McArdle and Anderson 2001).

Notice that, from here on, we will consider \u2261 . 196 Thus, we got a different for each module i. Similarly, the within-group sum of squares can be 197 written as 198\nwhere is the number of subjects per group and a variable equal to 1 if subjects u and v belong 200 to group g and 0 otherwise. The between-group variation is simply = \u2212 , which leads 201 to a pseudo-F statistic that reads 202\nwhere m is the number of groups. As it was acknowledged in (Zapala and Schork 2006) , the pseudo-204 F statistic is not distributed like the usual Fisher's F-distribution under the null hypothesis. 205 Accordingly, we randomly shuffled the subject indices and computed the pseudo-F statistic for each 206 time. A p-value is computed by counting those pseudo F-statistic values from permuted data greater 207 than that from the original data respect to the total number of performed permutations. 208\nFinally, we controlled for type I errors due to the 20 independent statistical performed tests by false 209 discovery rate corrections (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) .

For this purpose, diffusion tensor brain networks 264 were built allowing determining connectivity differences at three consecutive disease stages: stage I 265 (HC vs EMCI), stage II (HC vs LMCI) and stage III (HC vs AD). 266\nThe results showed an absence of significant changes in connectivity patterns in stage I, that is, 267 between patients with early mild cognitive impairment and healthy individuals. The approach we 268 have applied, the Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR) analysis, finds group 269 differences in the connectivity patterns from different modules to the rest of the brain. Therefore, at 270 very early mild cognitive impairment, although possible structural damages might occur locally, they 271 are not capable to produce global inter-module network reorganization/redistribution that can be 272 measured by the NDMR analysis. As the disease progresses, not only the disconnection pattern of module 18 becomes more evident 311 (increasing the distance between AD and controls, Table IV) On the other hand, identifying the brain connection patterns in those patients who have not yet 346 developed AD, will allow us to know the changes that occur in these connectivity patterns over time.\nIn addition, it will be possible to associate those connectivity patterns with clinical patient's changes 348 present at each disease stage. This might help to better understand the relationship between 349 deterioration in brain functioning and the clinical patient's characteristics. 350"}, {"section_title": "Limitations 351", "text": "The results of the present study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, it is a 352 cross-sectional study with different groups of people in each experimental group and with a small 353 sample size, so future studies should try to extend to bigger cohorts and follow the same group of 354 people over time as the disease progresses. Second, the patients included in the study have a probable 355 AD, which means that the definitive diagnosis of AD can only be performed post-mortem (Fearing et 356 al., 2007) . The use of patients with familial AD could help to know in depth the evolution of the 357 disease and the changes in cerebral connectivity from many years back to its onset. Third, there are a 358 number of risk factors associated with the decline of mild cognitive impairment which can affect 359 brain connectivity such as advanced diabetes, symptomatology depressive disorder, hypertension, 360 hypotension, obesity, history of traumatic brain injury and APOE genotype, that have not been taken 361 into account in this study. Future studies should take into account the possible influence of these 362 variables on the processes of cerebral connectivity. 363\nIn conclusion, the deterioration of cerebral connectivity is evident and is in line with the evolution of 364 AD from both the neuropathological and neuropsychological point of view. That is, the first cerebral 365 connectivity changes occur in the regions of the middle temporal lobe (hippocampus and entorhinal), 366 which coincides with the first symptoms of altered episodic memory in the preclinical stage and in 367 mild cognitive impairment. As the disease progresses, the brain damage and its disconnection of 368 these regions become more evident and expands to other areas, which coincides with the expansion 369 Memory Box Score (subpart of CDR) 0 at least 0.5 at least 0.5 NA 571 "}]
