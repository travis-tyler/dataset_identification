[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This First Look report presents selected findings from transcript data collected through the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS) for the 2011-12 cohort of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:12). The students in the 2011-12 cohort were selected during the 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), a cross-sectional study focused on student financial aid. 1 The selected students were nationally representative of undergraduates who entered postsecondary education for the first time in the 2011-12 academic year. After the base-year data collection through NPSAS:12, the 2011-12 cohort members were surveyed two more times: in 2014 and 2017 (BPS:12/14 and BPS:12/17). The base-year and follow-up surveys gathered comprehensive information about students' demographic backgrounds, enrollment characteristics, academic and social experiences in college, persistence in and completion of postsecondary education, and transition into employment, among other indicators. Between January 2018 and March 2019, all known postsecondary institutions attended by the BPS:12 cohort students between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 academic years were contacted to provide postsecondary transcripts. These postsecondary institutions were identified based on students' base-year and follow-up interviews and other sources such as the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) and the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). The obtained transcripts provide the opportunity to create a 6-year record of academic enrollment for the 2011-12 cohort, including coursetaking, credit accumulation, academic performance, and degree completion. The purpose of this report is to illustrate the range of information available in the PETS data. The selected findings present examples of the estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not intended to address any particular issue. Table 1 presents students' undergraduate credits and grade point average (GPA) in the first year 2 as well as over 6 years. Table 2 highlights students' coursetaking in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and performance in these 1 NPSAS:12 included a nationally representative sample of about 95,000 undergraduate and 16,000 graduate students attending about 1,500 Title IV eligible postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Wine, Bryan, and Siegel 2013). NPSAS was first administered in 1986-87. It was administered every 3 years thereafter until 1995-96 and has since been administered every 4 years through 2015-16. NPSAS covers broad topics on student enrollment in postsecondary education and how students and their families finance students' education. More information about NPSAS data collection is available at https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas. 2 First year in this report refers to the first 12 months of postsecondary enrollment based on the student's postsecondary start date."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "courses. 3 Table 3 shows the extent to which students participated in remedial or developmental education after entering college. Table 4 displays students' highest postsecondary attainment disaggregated by their coursetaking experiences. Table 5 shows students' summer enrollment and the number of summer credits earned. 4 Table 6 presents students' time to complete their first postsecondary credential. Table 7 focuses on bachelor's degree recipients, showing their time to bachelor's degree disaggregated by first-year credit accumulation. All tables in this report were restricted to the 81 percent of PETS respondents for whom transcript information or enrollment data were available for all known postsecondary institutions attended. 5 The report provides overall estimates as well as estimates for groups of students defined by selected demographic, enrollment, and coursetaking characteristics. All estimates have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse. This report is descriptive in nature and, therefore, it is not appropriate to draw causal inferences from the results presented. Many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, but the estimates do not account for such relationships. All comparisons mentioned in this report were tested for statistical significance using a two-tailed t test to ascertain that the differences are larger than would be expected by sampling error. Unless otherwise indicated, all differences cited are statistically significant at the .05 level. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Appendix A describes the variables used to generate the estimates in this report. Appendix B provides technical notes with information on such topics as sample design, weighting, response rates, and nonresponse bias. Appendix C contains standard errors for all estimates in this report.

Almost all transcripts were received in electronic format except for a small number of transcripts sent via an express mail service, which were first scanned and then processed in the same manner as all others. Incoming transcripts were logged and checked to ensure they were complete and associated with the requested sample member. After receipt, in a process referred to as keying and coding, data from the transcripts were entered into the keying/coding system (KCS), an online application designed to capture data efficiently and securely from the transcripts. The KCS included data entry fields for institution-, student-, and transcript-level data. Coding taxonomies, including the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), and the 2010 College Course Map (CCM), enabled standardization of institution names, fields of study, and courses that appeared on transcripts. Institution-level data collection. The fielded institution sample for BPS:12 PETS included 4,360 distinct IPEDS institutions. Of the 4,360 institutions, 290 were deemed ineligible because they had closed or were not postsecondary institutions, resulting in 4,070 eligible institutions. Of these 4,070 institutions, 2,770 (68 percent) provided transcripts. Table B-1 provides institution participation rates by control, level, and doctorate-granting status of institution. Student-level data collection. Data requests were originally made for 35,540 eligible sample members. During the review of the BPS:12/17 data, approximately 300 students were identified as ineligible for the BPS study. Based on information from transcripts and other data sources, an additional 240 ineligible students were identified because they were enrolled too early to be eligible for the BPS study.

A transcript was received from each institution attended for about 16,890 sample members (48 percent). Table B-2 shows the transcript collection results at the student level.

A student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within each institution category for BPS:12 PETS as required by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Statistical Standards because response rates fell below 85 percent (Seastrom 2014). \u00b9 Sample member eligibility was determined during the student interview or from institutional records in the absence of a student interview. \u00b2 A student is considered a transcript respondent if a transcript was received from one or more institutions that the student attended and the transcript contained a course, term, or a degree program. \u00b3 The base weight adjusted for unknown eligibility was used to produce the weighted response rates in this column. NOTE: Numbers of sampled students, eligible students, and transcript respondents are rounded to the nearest 10. Bias due to nonresponse was estimated for characteristics known for most respondents and nonrespondents. These characteristics include institution-and student-level variables available from the Central Processing System (CPS) and NPSAS:12. Bias was estimated before and after the nonresponse weight adjustment in order to examine the impact of the nonresponse adjustment.

To obtain transcript results as accurately as possible, all tables in this report were restricted to the 81 percent of PETS respondents for whom transcript information or enrollment data were available for all known postsecondary institutions attended. An additional PETS analysis weight was not created for this subset of PETS respondents so the effect of restricting the sample to these students was examined.
