We modeled environmental and habitat associations of the marsh-endemic, Federally endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris, RERA) and co-occurrence with eight associated small mammal species from annual trap data, 1998-2014, in six estuarine marshes in North San Francisco Bay, California. Covariates included microhabitat metrics of elevation and vegetation species and cover; and landscape metrics of latitude-longitude, distance to anthropogenic features, and habitat patch size. The dominant cover was pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica) with 86% mean cover and 37 cm mean height, and bare ground with about 10% mean cover. We tested 38 variants of Bayesian network (BN) models to determine covariates that best account for presence of RERA and of all nine small mammal species. Best models had lowest complexity and highest classification accuracy. Among RERA presence models, three best BN models used covariates of latitude-longitude, distance to paved roads, and habitat patch size, with 0% error of false presence, 20% error of false nonpresence, and 20% overall error. The all-species presence models suggested that within the pickleweed marsh environment, RERA are mostly habitat generalists. Accounting for presence of other species did not improve prediction of RERA. Habitat attributes compared between RERA and the next most frequently captured species, California vole (Microtus californicus), suggested substantial habitat overlap, with RERA habitat being somewhat higher in marsh elevation, greater in percent cover of the dominant plant species, closer to urban areas, further from agricultural areas, and, perhaps most significant, larger in continuous size of marsh patch. Findings will inform conservation management of the marsh environment for RERA by identifying best microhabitat elements, landscape attributes, and adverse interspecific interactions.\nBayesian network models, California vole, habitat use, Microtus californicus, occupancy, Reithrodontomys raviventris, salt marsh harvest mouse, San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, small mammal assemblage"}, {"section_title": "| INTRODUC TI ON", "text": "Tidal marshes constitute a small fraction of land area but typically provide diverse habitat for a unique suite of wetland vertebrate species and contribute disproportionately to regional biodiversity (Greenberg, Maldonado, Droege, & McDonald, 2006; Wiest et al., 2016; Zedler, Callaway, & Sullivan, 2001) . Tidal marshes are becoming increasingly vulnerable to a variety of threats and stressors (Kintisch, 2013) , including inundation from high tides caused by local sea level rise and storms (Craft et al., 2009; Kirwan & Temmerman, 2009; Thorne et al., 2018) , differential response of wetland plants to flooding (Janousek et al., 2016; Kirwan & Guntenspergen, 2015) , changes in vegetation productivity from local warming (Maegonigal et al., 2016) , incursion by invasive species (Winder, Jassby, & MacNally, 2011) , coastal erosion (Kane, Fletcher, Frazer, Anderson, & Barbee, 2015) , urban development (Enwright, Griffith, & Osland, 2016; Shellhammer, 1989) , pollution (McCann et al., 2017) , and other factors. All such changes can impact suitability of tidal marsh habitat for the variety of associated wildlife species, especially habitat specialist and endemic species Thorne, Takekawa, & Elliott-Fisk, 2012; Torio & Chmura, 2015) .\nDue to these direct and indirect human impacts, many marsh wildlife species are listed as endangered or threatened pursuant to the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Endangered Species Act. It is likely that many changes to ecosystems", "text": "caused by shifting climate patterns have not been recognized, but habitats can respond quickly and drastically in unpredictable ways, leading to substantial uncertainty about impacts to endemic wildlife.\nGiven this, uncertainty defining habitat characteristics is growing increasingly important for the conservation of biodiversity, especially for at-risk species.\nMany resource management agencies have established a habitat-based approach, rather than an individual species approach, for recovery of marsh endemic species (DOI, 2013; Goals Project, 2015; USFWS, 2013) , making it all the more important to understand habitat relationships of at-risk species presumed to be provided by a habitat-based approach. Our study focused on the salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris, RERA, Figure 1 ), federally-, state-, and IUCN-listed as endangered (CDFG, 2015;  USFWS, 2013; www.iucnr edlist.org/speci es/19401/ 22385344).\nRERA is endemic to the wetlands of the San Francisco Bay (SFB), California, where marsh plant communities and obligate wildlife are at risk of habitat loss from local sea level rise over the coming decades (Thorne, Buffington, Elliott-Fisk, & Takekawa, 2015; Veloz et al., 2013) .\nRERA currently occupies <25% of its historic range because of habitat fragmentation and loss, with >80% loss of historic wetland habitat in SFB (Statham et al., 2016) . The northern subspecies (Reithrodontomys raviventris halicoetes) is found along San Pablo and Suisun Bays, and the southern subspecies (R. r. raviventris) is found in South SFB with the subspecies divide somewhere in Central Bay (Shellhammer, 1989; Statham et al., 2016; USFWS, 2013) .\nHowever, detailed habitat associations of both subspecies are not well understood. Smith, Riley, Barthman-Thompson, Woo, et al. (2018) reviewed the RERA literature to date. Smith, Riley, BarthmanThompson, Statham, et al. (2018) recommended research priorities to further RERA recovery, including the need for data synthesis to assess regional habitat associations and species interactions. On this basis, we collated several monitoring datasets to address this priority research need.\nSeveral independent monitoring efforts have been conducted to assess SMHM abundance with varying sampling design and effort, very low SMHM captures, and lack of marking individual captures, such that traditional occupancy models would not be appropriate.\nTherefore, we used a probabilistic analysis approach with Bayesian network (BN) modeling to determine RERA correlates with environmental and habitat parameters, and to evaluate relationships with other sympatric small mammal species.\nBayesian network models link variables with probabilities calculated using Bayes' Theorem (Korb & Nicholson, 2010; Koski & Noble, 2011) and are relatively robust to zero inflated data and collinearity.\nWe analyzed trap data and associated vegetation, patch (elevation and inundation), and landscape covariates, including presence of other small mammal species, to determine habitat associations of RERA. Explicitly, we aimed to assess (a) microhabitat and landscape attributes determining RERA presence, and (b) if RERA presence was associated with other small mammal species. We developed all BN models from empirical field and spatial data. This modeling approach can be used to project impacts on RERA from future changes in habitat conditions, disturbances, and climate change, and to inform management of these tidal marsh environments to facilitate species recovery and conservation. The marsh plain is dominated by pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica, syn. Sacrocornia pacifica, formerly Salicornia virginica; Calflora, 2018) , and the lower marsh area is dominated by Spartina foliosa, a native of the region.\nExamples of local marsh inhabitants are salt marsh common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa), San Pablo song sparrow (Melospiza melodia samuelis), and San Pablo vole (Microtus californicus sanpabloensis), state-listed species of special concern; California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), a state threatened species; and California Ridgway's rail (Rallus obsoletus, formerly clapper rail, Rallus longirostris obsoletus). However, RERA is the only mammal species in the world that is entirely endemic to coastal marshes and is found only in tidal marshes in SFB (Figure 1 ).\nIt currently occupies <25% of its historic range because of habitat fragmentation and loss, with >80% loss of historic wetland habitat in SFB (Statham et al., 2016) . The northern subspecies (R. r. halicoetes) is found along San Pablo Bay, and the southern subspecies (R. r. raviventris) is found in South SFB with the subspecies divide somewhere in Central Bay (Shellhammer, 1989; Statham et al., 2016; USFWS, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "| Field trapping", "text": "Small mammal surveys were conducted as separate monitoring efforts, and for these analyses results were collated from estuarine marsh study sites in San Pablo Bay (Fagan, Guadalcanal, Tolay Creek, and Tubbs Island Setback), Grizzly Bay (Benicia-Martinez Marsh), and Central Bay (Corte Madera) (Figure 2 ).

Where local marsh conditions narrowed, not providing adequate area for a grid, one to three transects were used, each consisting of ten traps per transect. Random placements of traps were used only in the Tubbs Island Setback site because tidal marsh habitat and the upland transition zone were narrow with variable width such that the random placement allowed better coverage by which to associate RERA captures to habitat.

For other sites (Benicia-Martinez, Fagan, Guadalcanal), we used data from the nearest NOAA tidal station. Sites with locally collected data had one or two loggers that were placed at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to capture high tides and determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water level readings were collected every 6 min starting on the date of deployment and continued for at least one year to calculate tidal datums for each trapping location.\nWe used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates, and we surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download to correct for any vertical movement and to reference water levels to NAVD88 elevations. All raw water level data were corrected with a local time series of barometric pressure.\nFor Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001; Solinst Canada Ltd.). We used water level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (NOAA 2003) , and calculated only local mean high water (MHW) and mean higher high water (MHHW) because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal and therefore could not be used to compute lower datums.

Similarly, in a study of Spartina marshes along the southwest Atlantic coast of the United States, Canepuccia, Pascual, Biondi, and Iribarne (2015) found that occurrence of small mammals was related to vegetation cover and diversity, and that small mammal species composition varied by landscape context and configuration.\nA Type II error may be more egregious if models predict RERA nonpresence than when this State-and Federally listed endangered species is actually present. That is, false absences (Type II error) of an endangered species have a greater potential negative consequence for conserving population viability than do false presences (Type I error). Predicting absence when the species is present could result in no specific habitat management being directed to such locations, potentially resulting habitat degradation or loss for the species. In such cases, models cannot substitute for on-the-ground surveys. This type of habitat association model is better suited to assess RERA presence than to conclude absence. We note, too, that we have not analyzed any temporal trends or differences in habitat associations over the course of the trapping seasons and years, assuming that the availability of environmental conditions in each trapping location remained constant over time. We also note that studies are lacking on identifying specific threats to population viability of the species, other than inferences made on threats of habitat changes, which aligns with the recommended research priorities to further RERA recovery, including range-wide population estimates, demographics, and dynamics .\nAdditional threats to small mammals in tidal marshes and potentially to RERA conservation may yet appear or confound recovery, such as uptake of environmental toxins as documented by Clark, Foerster, Marn, and Hothem (1992) . BN models for habitat associations can be informative for tidal marsh restorations that may be able to accommodate higher marsh elevations in relation to inundation and larger marsh patches in their designs. Ultimately, management and conservation of RERA, particularly under threats of climate change, sea level rise, and anthropogenic alteration of habitats, may need to take an ecosystem-level approach (e.g., Stagg et al., 2016 ) that includes tracking increased inundation and flooding of pickleweed habitat from rising sea level (Field, Bayard, et al., 2016; Kirwan et al., 2010; Rosencranz et al., 2018) .\nThe current study could not compare RERA occurrence with attributes of random-site locations, so resource selection functions of the mouse for particular habitat attributes could not be determined.\nThis could be a valuable topic for future studies, to better understand RERA habitat selection for guiding site management, especially considering landscape level changes associated with sea level rise and climate change.
