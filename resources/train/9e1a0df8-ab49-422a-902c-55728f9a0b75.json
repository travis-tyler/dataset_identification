We will seek to extract data on 5.4 million people from across Scotland (figure 1). Therefore, our study aims to collect data from all residents in Scotland registered with a general practice, which translates to over 91% coverage of the Scottish population.21"}, {"section_title": "Primary care ::: Databases ::: Methods", "text": "Almost all individuals in Scotland are registered with a general practice, which provide free of charge healthcare services. Data from all patients registered in general practices will be extracted and studied. The University of Edinburgh and Public Health Scotland (PHS) will recruit the additional general practices through Albasoft Ltd.17\u201321 Albasoft Ltd is the trusted third party that will carry out the data extraction from all general practices using the Enhanced Services Contract Reporting Options system.17\u201321 We will also extract data from a network of COVID-19 Community Hubs and Assessment Centres established by NHS Health Boards across Scotland.23 The aim of this network is to provide a direct and rapid route of people with COVID-19 symptoms that have worsened or not improved after a week. Patients can call NHS 24 for an initial assessment and then if needed the call will be passed to a telephone community hub, staffed by clinical decision makers.23 The clinical decision maker will then decide if an appointment for a face-to-face consultation at an assessment centre is necessary.23 Previous observational studies have shown over 91% completeness of capture of contacts and accuracy of clinical event coding (Read codes) among practices in Scotland.21"}, {"section_title": "Secondary care ::: Databases ::: Methods", "text": "The Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) database will be used to derive information for all in-patient hospitalisations and emergency admissions in Scotland, which is maintained by the Information Services Division.24 Specifically, we will use data from the SMR01 record, which is an episode-based patient record for all inpatients and day cases discharged from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric specialties in Scotland.25 Data from the SMR02 record will also be used, which is an episode-based patient record for all inpatients and day cases from obstetric specialties in the NHS Scotland.26 The SMR dataset also contains mortality data that derive from the National Records of Scotland.27 Regular validation checks are applied to the SMR database. The latest data quality assessment of these SMR datasets have shown over 90% completeness and accuracy in consistency with previous years.28 We will also extract and link data on prescribing and administration of medicines for inpatients that are available from Scottish Hospital Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration systems.29 The study data will also be linked with data from patients admitted to adult general intensive care units (ICU), which derive from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) national database.30 The database contains detailed information on the management of critically ill or injured patients. Data are collected from all general ICU and combined ICU/high-dependency units (HDUs). Data from more than 90% of general HDUs and a number of specialist ICUs and HDUs are collected by the database.30"}, {"section_title": "Laboratory and serology data ::: Databases ::: Methods", "text": "The Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS) system of PHS is a database that holds surveillance data on various microorganisms (eg, influenza virus and coronavirus) and infections reported from diagnostics and reference laboratories.31 Data on laboratory results for all reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests carried out in Scotland are being collated by ECOSS and can be linked to other data sources.31 Positive laboratory swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 will also be sent to national sequencing centres where 500 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences will be performed.\nIn a substudy, the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Laboratory will collect and store residual sera from routine blood tests from patients until the serology test becomes available.32 The EAVE study has already stored 1000 biochemistry samples from a subset of participating practices from 2014, demonstrating that a potential mechanism for the collection and storage of the residual sera works.17 We aim to collect and store serially throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be used to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses by the presence of antibodies.17"}, {"section_title": "Exposure definitions and potential confounding factors ::: Methods", "text": "The following exposure variables will be used in relation to the study\u2019s primary outcomes: sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES) and clinical at-risk group. SES will be determined based on the Scottish Multiple Deprivation Index (SIMD). The SIMD classification is based on deprivation quintiles. Quintile 1 refers to the most deprived and quintile 5 refers to the least deprived. The SIMD is a combination of 38 indicators of the following seven domains: income, employment, health, education, housing, geographical access to services and crime.21 Clinical at-risk groups refer to individuals with certain underlying medical conditions where are at-risk of COVID-19 related complications and for whom seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended. The following clinical at-risk conditions will be considered: (A) chronic respiratory disease (with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as subsets); (B) chronic heart disease; (C) chronic liver disease; (D) chronic kidney disease; (E) chronic liver disease; (F) chronic neurological disease; (G) diabetes types 1 and 2; (H) conditions or medications causing impaired immune function; (I) pregnancy; (J) asplenia or dysfunction of spleen; (K) obesity (body mass index (BMI) <20, 20\u201325, 25\u201330, 30\u201339 and \u226540 kg/m2); (L) hypertension (subsets controlled/uncontrolled hypertension); (M) tuberculosis and (N) multimorbidity.21 This list will be updated as more evidence arises within the medical literature. The following exposure variables will be used in relation to study\u2019s secondary outcomes: any new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and existing or new therapies and antimicrobial medication against COVID-19. These will be determined once our study data are available and any new therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been produced.\nA number of aforementioned and additional population characteristics below will also be used as potential confounding factors in relation to the study\u2019s primary and secondary outcomes. Charlson Comorbidity Index will represent the weighted comorbidity score based on secondary care data.17\u201321 The urban/rural location will be determined based on the urban/rural eight-fold classification (UR8). The UR8 is the definition of rural areas in Scotland: 1 is assigned to large urban areas and 8 is assigned to remote rural areas.21 Smoking status will be determined and presented into the following four categories: current smoker, non-smoker, ex-smoker and not recorded for patients with no data on smoking.17\u201321 The type of smoking products (eg, vaping products) and alcohol use will also be determined, if possible. Previous healthcare usage will be used to measure number of primary care consultations and secondary care admissions in previous years. The number of prescriptions will also be determined for previous years.17\u201321 General practice will also be used to account the effect of clustering within practices. The effect of population density will also be investigated. Additional exposures such as number of household members for those with a confirmed SARS-CoV-02 infection and daily protective measures will also be investigated given the high transmission rate of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Outcome definitions ::: Methods", "text": "The primary outcomes of this study will include: (A) laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2; (B) serum from blood samples taken from biochemistry tests (or rapid antibody tests if available) will be used to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection by the presence of antibodies; and (C) SARS-CoV-2 infection related clinical outcomes including general practice, COVID-19 centres and out-of-hours consultations, hospital admissions including secondary bacterial infections and multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with these infections, emergency admissions, out of hours consultations and deaths. Secondary outcomes include: (A) vaccine uptake proportions; (B) prevention and reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related general practice consultations, hospital admissions including secondary bacterial infections, emergency admissions, out of hours consultations and deaths due to therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials; and (C) adverse events related to therapies, for example, vaccine, antimicrobial administration or other therapies."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis ::: Methods", "text": "Baseline characteristics of all study participants will be described in relation to the study\u2019s exposures and outcomes of interest. Mean, median, proportions, ORs and rate ratios (RRs), together with a measure of dispersion will be provided where appropriate to describe differences between the various study groups based on the nature of each variable. The amount of missing data will be described for each variable. Two-tailed hypotheses tests with a 5% significance level will be used for all study\u2019s outcomes.

The healthcare burden of COVID-19 in terms of morbidity and mortality in relation to to demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics will also be determined. SARS-CoV-2 infection will be confirmed via laboratory (RT-PCR) and serology testing. Healthcare burden will be measured via general practice consultations, out-of-hours consultations, A&E attendances, hospital admissions including secondary bacterial infections and deaths. Exposure of interest as per our objectives a and b will change over time as the medical literature and surveillance reporting is continuously updated. Currently, particularly factors of interest for Scotland include: age; sex, geographical location, SES, underlying condition or medication and BMI. Analytical techniques including descriptive analysis, univariable and multivariable logistic regression will be used to determine the association between different exposure variables and the likelihood (odds) of the study\u2019s primary outcomes (SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity, mortality and healthcare burden). The effect of confounders and effect modifiers will be explored through causal frameworks generated for each hypothesis,33 with clinical input."}, {"section_title": "Vaccine uptake ::: Secondary analyses ::: Methods", "text": "Differences in vaccine uptake will be measured in relation to demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics. As per primary analyses, exposure of interest will change over time as the medical literature and surveillance reporting is continuously updated. Key sociodemographic and clinical factors will be analysed including age, sex, SES and underlying condition. Analytical techniques including univariable and multivariable logistic regression will be used to determine the association between different exposure variables and vaccine uptake. The effect of confounders and effect modifiers will be explored through causal frameworks generated for each hypothesis,33 with clinical input. Key confounding factors will include age, sex, SES and underlying condition. The number of individuals that refuse to be vaccinated and the reasons for declining vaccination will also be investigated, if possible."}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of new or existing prophylactic and therapeutic interventions ::: Secondary analyses ::: Methods", "text": "We will assess the effectiveness of any new or repurposed therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 related morbidity and mortality such as general practice and out-of-hours consultations, hospitalisations including secondary bacterial infections, emergency admissions and deaths. Exposure of interest (therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials) will change over time as the medical literature and surveillance reporting is continuously updated. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 related clinical outcomes and deaths will be estimated between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) and 95% CIs will be calculated using the formula, VE = (1\u2212risk ratio)*100 for unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates. A time-dependent Cox model or the equivalent Poisson regression models (taking into account the time at risk and the possibility of multiple events (not for death)) will provide the RRs and 95% CIs of VE for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 related clinical outcomes and deaths. Causal frameworks will be generated for each hypothesis,33 with clinical input. Key confounders for the VE models will include age, sex, SES and underlying condition, with vaccination group representing a time-dependent covariate. In these VE models, propensity variables related to vaccine receipt and effect modifiers (eg, vaccinations, consultations and hospitalisation in the previous season, urban/rural status, smoking status, Charlson Score and pregnancy) will be used to control for the healthy vaccine effect.17 This is in addition to the demographic variables, which will always be used.\nSimilar statistical methods will be used to assess the protective effects of therapies and antimicrobials. A binary variable of ever/never exposure to therapies/antimicrobials as an explanatory variable will be included in the VE analyses. The therapy/antimicrobial exposure will be a second time-dependent exposure for consultation, hospitalisation and death rates analysis. We will also consider using a measure of the volume of therapy/antimicrobial exposure (eg, length or dose of prescription) if the data are adequate. Use of therapies/antimicrobials will be included as a covariate in any of our models where primarily assess VE. Alternatively, exposure to the vaccine will be included in any of our models where primarily assess the effect of therapies/antimicrobials, if appropriate. For example, the effect of therapies/antimicrobials may be assessed from a period before the vaccine becomes available and, in such instances, no adjustment needs to be made."}, {"section_title": "Safety of new or existing prophylactic and therapeutic interventions ::: Secondary analyses ::: Methods", "text": "We will determine any adverse events following the administration of new or repurposed therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials. Specific therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 will be determined as the outbreak unfolds and depending on existing medical literature. The risk of adverse events will be estimated using self-controlled study designs. The main assumption in these study designs is that in case of an adverse event related to prophylactic and therapeutic agent exposure, then the occurrence of an adverse event in the period after administration is greater than in periods in the same patients that are temporally not related to prophylactic and therapeutic agent administration.21 The risk interval (the period at risk for an adverse outcome) and the control interval (the period not at risk for an adverse outcome) will be determined separately for each outcome.21 Causal frameworks will be generated for each hypothesis,33 with clinical input. The main advantage of the self-controlled design is the control for all fixed individual-level confounding since any comparisons are carried out for the same individual rather than between exposed and unexposed populations to therapies, vaccines or antimicrobials.21 Key confounding and effect modifiers will be determined as the outbreak unfolds and depending on existing medical literature."}, {"section_title": "Sample size ::: Methods", "text": "Our prospective cohort will be constructed from patients registered in all general practices across Scotland with a combined list size of 5.4 million people of all ages. Sample size calculations to assess vaccine and antiviral effectiveness against pandemic influenza have been provided in previous work.17 Similar sample size calculations are likely to be applicable to the current COVID-19 pandemic; however, sample size calculations (one per key analysis) are dependent on how the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds in Scotland. Thus, our power to answer each objective will be dependent on the frequency of the relevant outcome. Power calculations will be carried out subsequent to the first wave of the pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Patient and public involvement (PPI) ::: Methods", "text": "We will convene a virtual panel of PPI members who will contribute to the interpretation and dissemination of findings."}, {"section_title": "Ethics and dissemination ::: Methods", "text": "This study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee, South East Scotland 02.
