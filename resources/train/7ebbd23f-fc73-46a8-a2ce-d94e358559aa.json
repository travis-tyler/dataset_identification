The most widely accepted model of AD progression proposes a cascade of neuropathological events in which abnormal levels of Ab, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration precede dementia [1] . The idea of pathophysiological progression was incorporated by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/how_to_ap-ply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf. *Corresp criterion for predementia phase of AD, which recognizes that the coexistence of abnormal Ab and neurodegeneration biomarkers better identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients who will progress to dementia [2] . This notion has been supported by recent observations demonstrating that MCI Ab1 individuals with neurodegenerative changes, measured by brain hypometabolism or atrophy, have higher rates of neuropsychological decline as compared with MCI biomarker negative participants [3] [4] [5] . Yet, a key question that remains unanswered is whether the highest rate of progression to dementia in MCI Ab1 individuals with downstream cascade abnormalities is due to a synergistic effect between the coexistent brain pathologies or simply the sum of their deleterious effects. This question is particularly important in the context of the two hallmark proteinopathies underlying AD [6] . Although Ab and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins well characterize AD pathophysiology, brain hypometabolism or atrophy may be found in several other brain disorders associated with neuronal loss [2, 7] . Given the emphasis of the current literature on the combination of Ab and neuronal degeneration biomarkers [3] [4] [5] 8] , the clinical fate of MCI patients with abnormal Ab plus p-tau proteins is scarcely known. The importance of characterizing the synergistic effect between Ab and p-tau on the development of dementia goes beyond the understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression. Determination of such synergism has immediate implications for the population enrichment of clinical trials testing anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapy. For example, if Ab and p-tau synergistically determine dementia, the enrichment of clinical trial populations with carriers of both pathologies would increase the rate of clinical progression without loss of therapeutic effectiveness. Conversely, if Ab and p-tau simply add their deleterious effects on cognitive decline, carriers of both pathologies would lead to a reduced therapeutic effectiveness of an intervention targeting only one of these proteinopathies, given the residual effect of the untreated protein on the clinical course of the disease.\nAlthough several studies have shown that Ab and p-tau independently predict disease progression [9, 10] , a hypothetical framework proposes that both proteinopathies synergistically potentiate downstream neurodegeneration [11] . The presence of such a synergism would suggest that the effect of Ab and p-tau on the progression of AD taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effects at the same level. In fact, recent findings from our laboratory support this framework showing that the synergistic effect between brain Ab and p-tau rather than neurodegeneration drives AD-related metabolic decline in a cognitively normal population [12] . Similarly, in vivo studies conducted in controls have suggested that p-tau modulates the link between Ab and brain atrophy or behavioral changes [13] [14] [15] , whereas animal model literature has demonstrated a synergistic effect between Ab and p-tau peptides, leading to downstream synaptic and neuronal dysfunctions [16] .\nHere, in a longitudinal analysis conducted in amnestic MCI individuals, we tested the hypothesis that the synergism between Ab aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation determines progression from amnestic MCI to AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database description and study participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Furthermore, we found that only among amnestic MCI Ab1/p-tau1 individuals, did the baseline values of Ab and p-tau biomarkers predict cognitive and clinical impairments. Finally, a voxel-based analysis revealed that the temporal and inferior parietal cortices were the brain regions vulnerable to the synergism between Ab and p-tau peptides.\nOverall, our results suggest the synergism between Ab and p-tau as an important element involved in the progression from amnestic MCI to AD dementia. This finding extends previous studies conducted in cognitively normal persons demonstrating that the synergism between Ab and p-tau determines functional and structural abnormalities [12] [13] [14] [15] . Interestingly, the temporal and inferior parietal cortices described here as the structural substrates in which the Ab and p-tau synergistic effect conferred an increased likelihood of clinical progression, are well known as vulnerable brain regions in patients who progressed from MCI to dementia [23] . Indeed, the synergistic effect between Ab and p-tau reported here is well supported by molecular studies describing synaptic and neuronal damages as consequences of the synergistic interactions between Ab and tau peptides [16, 24, 25] .\nThis study revealed that the link between Ab levels and progression to AD dementia depends on the p-tau status. This finding sheds light on the literature showing conflicting results reporting the association between Ab and cognition.

Interestingly, Ab levels fail to predict time-to-progression to dementia in MCI Ab1 individuals with evidences of brain hypometabolism or atrophy [4] . One might claim that Ab levels represent an important predictor of forthcoming dementia, particularly in predementia persons with p-tau abnormalities [2] . Suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP) has emerged as an important concept referring to patients showing a biomarker signature of neurodegeneration without Ab abnormalities [9] . As the concept of SNAP arises in our study as the group of MCI Ab2/ptau1 individuals [9] , we would like to comment on the clinical progression of this population. Previous studies have demonstrated that in SNAP MCI, characterized by the presence of neuronal degeneration evidenced by brain hypometabolism or atrophy, the rate of cognitive decline is higher than in MCI individuals who are biomarker negative and comparable to MCI carriers of Ab-plus neurodegeneration [4] [5] [6] . In contrast, we demonstrate here that SNAP MCI Ab2/p-tau1 subjects clinically progress at a rate similar to that of MCI subjects who are biomarker negative. This reduced rate of progression of our SNAP MCI Ab2/ptau1 population may be explained by the fact that CSF p-tau reflects neurofibrillary tangles pathology rather than neuronal degeneration [7] . Importantly, the clinical stability of MCI Ab2/p-tau1 participants supports the synergism between Ab and p-tau pathologies as a key element triggering AD dementia [1, 10] . The reduced rate of clinical progression web 4C=FPO web 4C=FPO Fig. 2 . The amnestic MCI Ab1/p-tau1 individuals present the lowest baseline scores and the highest rate of decline in most neuropsychological functions. The values are presented in z-scores anchored in normative data of a cognitively normal population. In the box and whisker plots, the lower and upper boundaries show the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, whereas the horizontal line shows the median. The dots represent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals less than the fifth or higher than the 95th percentile. Bonferroni-corrected P values for multiple comparisons indicate the values assessed with analyses of covariance adjusted for age, gender, years of education, APOE \u03b54 status, and baseline neuropsychological test score for longitudinal analysis. Post hoc multiple comparison analysis provided significant differences between biomarker groups for each neuropsychological test at *P , .05 and **P , .001. (A) At baseline, the Ab1/p-tau1 group presented the lowest baseline scores in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), logical memory immediate recall (LMI), and 30-minute delayed recall (LM30). The Ab1/p-tau1 group showed worse performance in the Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B) than the Ab2/p-tau2 and Ab2/p-tau1 groups. (B) The Ab1/p-tau1 group presented the highest longitudinal impairment in all neuropsychological tests except TMT-A and MMSE. Ab1/p-tau1 group showed higher decline in MMSE than Ab2/p-tau2 and Ab2/p-tau1 groups. Notably, Ab2/p-tau2, Ab1/p-tau2, and Ab2/p-tau1 groups did not differ from each other in any baseline or longitudinal cognitive performance. Abbreviations: Ab, amyloid-b; p-tau, phosphorylated tau. of our SNAP MCI Ab2/p-tau1 group as compared to that observed in previous studies may be due to the presence of a significant proportion of MCI individuals who are in the early clinical stages of MCI in the ADNI-GO/2 cohort [11, 12] . This is consistent with studies on cognitively normal individuals showing that SNAP progresses at a rate similar to that of biomarker negative subjects [3, 13] . Furthermore, it is possible that the cognitive decline observed in SNAP MCI in previous studies, defined by less-specific biomarkers for AD such as brain hypometabolism or atrophy, was driven by other pathophysiological processes such as TDP-4, alpha-synuclein inclusions, and hippocampal sclerosis [14, 15] . Together, these results support that SNAP MCI individuals characterized by the presence of p-tau pathology, different from those with SNAP MCI defined by neuronal degeneration biomarkers, clinically progress at rates comparable to those seen in MCI biomarker negative individuals. 18 F]florbetapir SUVR and CSF p-tau in temporal and inferior parietal cortices predicts progression to dementia. T-statistical parametric map, after correcting for multiple comparisons (random field theory at P , .001), overlaid in a structural magnetic resonance scan revealed that lateral and basal temporal and inferior parietal cortices were the brain regions where the synergism between [ 18 F]florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (p-tau) status was associated with an increased likelihood of progression to Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia over 2 years.\nThis study has some methodological limitations. Biomarkers provide naturally continuous measurements; therefore, thresholds are invariably subject to conceptual and analytical idiosyncrasies and may change depending on the method of analysis used. However, the use of regression models with continuous biomarker values helped prevent our results from being driven by the use of more liberal or more conservative biomarker threshold. Additionally, we assessed the synergy between Ab and p-tau across all brain voxels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducting a voxel-based logistic regression analysis to evaluate progression to dementia using Ab PET imaging. Importantly, our results showing the synergism between amyloid-b and p-tau leading to downstream clinical progression do not exclude the possibility that these two proteinopathies might arise sequentially (e.g., amyloid-b triggering the spreading of tau over the neocortex early on in the pathophysiological progression [14] ). Certainly, cell cultures and in vivo studies with long-term imaging of amyloidb and p-tau in animal models and in humans could better investigate causal and temporal relationships between these proteins. It is also important to mention that the observations reported here do not to prove a biological synergy between Ab and p-tau proteins. Our overall progression rate to dementia was 19% over 2 years. Previous studies conducted in memory clinic cohorts have reported progression rate in MCI of up to 59% over 2 years [31] . This might be explained by the fact that the ADNI-GO/2 inclusion criteria include MCI individuals in a less-advanced disease stage as compared to these cohorts [32] . In fact, our findings are similar to a recent study involving MCI ADNI-GO/2 participants that reported an overall progression rate of 15% over 1.6 years [33] . Finally, regarding the population included in this analysis, it is important to emphasize that it represents a select group of amnestic MCI persons motivated to participate in a dementia study. As such, for reasons related to the study inclusion criteria and self-selection bias [34] , these individuals may not represent the general MCI population. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to replicate our findings on a population-based cohort.\nFrom a clinical perspective, if replicated, such a synergism has important implications in understanding the dynamics of progression to dementia. For example, the clinical stability of nondemented persons with biomarker abnormalities described in numerous cohorts [35, 36] could be explained by the absence of convergence of the Ab and p-tau pathways, postulated here to be crucial for imminent clinical progression in amnestic MCI. In addition, the combination of abnormal amyloid-PET and CSF p-tau biomarkers may represent a valuable strategy for the enrichment of amnestic MCI populations with individuals having a high probability of developing AD dementia in therapeutic clinical trials targeting Ab or tau aggregates.\nFrom a therapeutic perspective, one can derive important predictions from the existence of a synergistic interaction between Ab and p-tau in AD. For example, one can predict that therapeutic interventions targeting either Ab or p-tau pathology might similarly mitigate AD progression. Furthermore, the same synergistic model implies better effectiveness of a combined therapeutic approach targeting both, Ab and p-tau, pathological pathways. However, it is important to mention that the synergism between pathological pathways might not always translate into synergistic effects of multiple treatments. Importantly, this model should be supported by further studies combining long-term sequential biomarker and clinical observations.\nIn conclusion, our results support the synergism between Ab and tau pathologies as a driving force behind the clinical progression to AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1.
