[{"section_title": "Surveillance of COVID-19 in northern France", "text": "Strengthened surveillance of COVID-19 cases was implemented in France on 10 January 2020, with the objective of identifying imported cases early to prevent secondary transmission in the community. In this context, the first cases detected by the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (NRC) hosted at Institut Pasteur, Paris, happened to be the first identified in Europe. As the COVID-19 epidemic progressed in the country, the task of identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections was shared with the NRC-associated laboratory in Lyon and then extended to first line hospital laboratories in the whole country, with the NRC at Institut Pasteur focusing on the northern part of France, including the densely populated capital. Screening and sampling for SARS-CoV-2 was targeted towards individuals who had symptoms (fever and/or respiratory problems) or a travel history to risk areas for infection [3]. As the virus continued to spread, it became clear that COVID-19 patients could exhibit greatly variable clinical characteristics [4], including a proportion presenting with asymptomatic infection or mild disease [5]."}, {"section_title": "Patient sampling and analysis of retrieved SARS-CoV-2 genomes", "text": "We generated complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from nasopharyngeal or sputum samples sent to the NRC at the Institut Pasteur as part of the ongoing surveillance (Figure 1A).

This dataset enabled to perform a phylogenetic analysis to gain more insight into the initial introductions and spread of the virus in France.

The investigations were carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 95/46/EC) and the French data protection law (Law 78\u201317 on 06/01/1978 and D\u00e9cret 2019\u2013536 on 29/05/2019)."}, {"section_title": "Detected early viral introductions appear not to have seeded local transmission ", "text": "Our analysis indicates that the quarantine imposed on the initial imported COVID-19 cases, who were captured by the syndromic surveillance in France, appears to have prevented local transmission. The first European cases, who were originally in \u00cele-de-France (IDF) and who were previously described elsewhere [6], were direct imports from Hubei, China. They were sampled on 24 January 2020 and the two derived respective viral genomes, IDF0372 and IDF0373, fall accordingly near the base of the tree, within clade V, according to GISAID nomenclature (Figure 2, Figure 3A). Clade V is characterised by sequences with a T nucleotide at position 26144, instead of a G, corresponding to a V amino acid, rather than a G, at position 251 of non-structural protein 3a. The IDF0372 and IDF0373 genomes were identical and both harboured a G22661T non-synonymous mutation (V367F) in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, not observed in other genomes. Similarly, IDF0515, obtained from a 29 January sample, corresponds to a traveller from Hubei, China. This basal genome falls outside of the three major GISAID proposed clades V, G, and S (Figure 2), but carries the G11083T mutation associated with putative lineage V1 (Fig. S2), suggesting convergent evolution or a reversion of the V-clade defining G26144T change. Subsequent early cases detected in February in the West (Bretagne; B) or East (Grand Est; GE) of France (B2334/B2340, clade V and GE1583, clade S), all with recent history of travel to Italy, add to the genomic diversity of viruses from northern Italy, but also do not appear to have seeded local transmission within the current sampled sequence set (Figure 2)."}, {"section_title": "Clades and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 further circulating in northern France", "text": "All other sequences from northern France fall in clade G, defined by two synonymous mutations (C241T, C3037T) and one non-synonymous substitution (A23403G) corresponding to a D614G mutation in the spike protein (Figure 3), and this includes sequences captured during the steep increase of reported cases in many strongly affected regions (Figure 1). While a more thorough sampling will be needed to confirm this hypothesis, the phylogenetic analysis of sequences recovered in the current study suggests that the French outbreak was mainly seeded by one or several variants of this clade, unlike what is observed for many other European countries (https://nextstrain.org/ncov/europe?f_region=Europe) [7,8]. This clade can be further classified into lineages (putatively named G1, G2, G3, G3a, G3b), albeit supported again by only one to three substitutions. The lineages are for the most part respectively represented by sequences from several regions. Several genomes correspond to patients in GE, Normandie (N), IDF, Hauts-de-France (HF) and B with recent history of travel in Europe (GE3067, N1620, IDF2792), United Arab Emirates (IDF2936), Madagascar (HF1993), Egypt (B1623, B2330) or linked to Paris airports (IDF1980). These genomes might represent additional introductions of the same clade, since the respective cases tested positive for the virus when other local G-clade-virus infections had already been detected in the north of France. On the other hand, in lineage G3b, three sequences sampled in Algeria are closely related to sequences from northern France and likely represent exported cases in light of recent history of travel to France.\nThe syndromic surveillance allowed to capture one of the earliest representatives of clade G (HF1463, sampled on 19 February) (Figure 2). Importantly, this sequence carries two additional mutations compared with the reconstructed ancestral sequence of this clade (Figure 3B). Other sequences sampled weeks later (IDF2849, GE1973) are more basal to the clade, highlighting the complexity and risk of inferences based on 1 or 2 nucleotide substitutions. Because of this, and the scarcity of early sequences in many countries in Europe, country and within-country level phylogeographic estimations are unreliable with the current dataset. It is thus impossible to infer with confidence how the virus was introduced to France from the epicentre of the outbreak, and multiple routes are possible."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The generated genomes in this study provide more insight into the SARS-CoV-2 clades and variants circulating in northern France at the beginning of the outbreak and later during the pandemic. Results of the analyses seem to indicate that, at least for the first imported cases who could be captured by the surveillance, these introductions did not lead to further transmission of the virus in the community. Indeed, sequences from imported cases detected early in the outbreak did not belong to clade G, a clade identifying all the genomes retrieved later in the epidemic. Within clade G, a number of variants could be observed. Moreover, the earliest patient infected with a representative of clade G (HF1463) had no history of travel or contact with returning travellers, suggesting that the virus was silently circulating in France in February, a scenario compatible with the large proportion of persons with mild disease or asymptomatic infections [5], and observations in other European countries [9,10]. While this is also compatible with the time to the most recent common ancestor estimate for clade G (Figure 2), the current sampling clearly prevents reliable inference for the timing of introduction in France. Moreover while the current data may lead to hypothesize that the French outbreak could have been mainly seeded by one or several variants of the G clade, more data will be needed to confirm this. Another explanation would be that while the outbreak began with viruses belonging to various clades, the clade G might have become dominant in the north of France as the epidemic progressed.\nCrucially, while all early symptomatic suspected COVID-19 cases samples were sent to the NRC for testing, this was no longer the case as the epidemic developed (Figure 1A). In addition, pauci- or asymptomatic cases are scarcely represented in our dataset. This study also reveals areas for potential improvement of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in France as several regions are poorly represented (Figure 1A). This is likely due to the heavy burden on hospitals, which while being able to perform local testing owing to the rapid sharing of molecular detection tools by the NRC, might have had to reduce the number of positive samples sent for confirmation and sequencing to the NRC. Because of this, and of the syndromic-only based surveillance, we likely underestimate the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in France.\nIn conclusion, our study sheds light on the origin and diversity of the COVID-19 outbreak in France with insights for Europe, and highlights the challenges of containment measures when a significant proportion of cases are asymptomatic."}]
