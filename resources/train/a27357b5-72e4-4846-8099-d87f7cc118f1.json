The Black River main-stem has its headwaters in Medina County near Lodi, where the West Fork joins the East Fork of the East Branch and flows northward through Spencer, LaGrange, and Grafton. The West Branch begins in northern Ashland County and flows northward into Lorain County through Rochester, Wellington, and Oberlin before meeting the East Branch to form the Black River main-stem at the confluence in Elyria.

Most counties have a planning commission, sewer or wastewater district, and a County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD). The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) operates within the Lorain, Medina, and Cuyahoga County portions of the watershed. Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) District 3 manages maintenance, upgrades, and engineering studies within the majority of the Black River watershed; ODOT District 12 manages the portions within Cuyahoga County. The Lorain County Storm Water District was formed in early 2010. It is a county-wide utility that currently extends only to the unincorporated communities and was developed to comply with US EPA water quality regulations and begin to more effectively manage storm water drainage and flooding issues throughout Lorain County. All property owners (residents, schools, churches, businesses, industries, and governments) within the unincorporated areas are assessed a fee based on their amount of impervious surface. Residential properties are assessed a flat rate calculated from an average amount of impervious surface; non-residential properties are assessed based upon their actual measured impervious surface. There is a credits system in place for non-residential properties. Implementation of best management practices for storm water can be used by non-residential properties to decrease their fee by varying percentages depending on the amount of storm water mitigated. Increased storm water management practices will improve the water quality in and around the Black River watershed, creating a better environment for local wildlife and providing future generations with the opportunity to enjoy local waterways while managing the effects of growing development. The Lorain County General Health District (LCGHD) provides health services to all of Lorain County within the watershed with the exception of the cities of Elyria, Lorain, and Avon Lake, which have their own Health Departments or Districts. The Cuyahoga County Board of Health (CCBH) and the Medina County Phase II storm water regulations pertain to storm water runoff of Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s) that service populations less than 100,000 and are located partially or fully within urbanized areas as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. They also cover on a case-by-case basis small MS4s located outside urbanized areas that Ohio EPA designates into the program. Source: Ohio EPA's MS4 site (http://epa.ohio.gov/dsw/storm/ms4_index.aspx). The French Creek sub-watershed was one of 12 Ohio watersheds designated a Rapidly Developing Watershed (RDW) by the Ohio EPA. RDWs exhibit some or several of the following attributes: \uf0b7 A significant portion of the stream still in attainment or partial attainment of aquatic life use designation. \uf0b7 Evidence of increasing stress on water quality, habitat and aquatic life caused by land surface disturbances such as construction activity and impervious surfaces. \uf0b7 High rates of forecasted population growth and a strong probability of high-density development occurring within a significant portion of the watershed over the next several years. Local communities located within RDWs were required to obtain Ohio EPA's Alternative General Permit for MS4s Located within Rapidly Developing Watersheds in 2003 (http://epa.ohio.gov/dsw/permits/gpfact.aspx#currently%20available). In the Black River watershed this included the MS4 communities of Avon, Avon Lake, Elyria, North Olmsted, Olmsted Township, Westlake, Sheffield, and North Ridgeville. This alternative permit required RDW communities to meet the Construction and Post-Construction minimum control measures within 3 years as opposed to 5 years. The RDW designation is no longer used, but it highlights the need for action within this particularly sensitive sub-watershed. Medina, Ashland, and Huron County currently have no Phase II communities within the Black River Watershed."}, {"section_title": "B. Demographics", "text": "Demographic datasets were obtained from the US Census Bureau and the Ohio Department of Development. Watershed characteristics were estimated on a county-wide basis for Lorain County and on either a community-by-community or census block basis for Cuyahoga, Medina, Ashland, and Huron Counties. Demographic categories from the various counties, communities, and census blocks were then synthesized where possible to form a general watershed profile. Population and housing within the watershed are heavily distributed towards the north in Lorain, North Ridgeville, Avon, Avon Lake, Sheffield, Elyria, Sheffield Lake, Westlake, and North Olmsted. The watershed is home to nearly 400,000 residents but about 43 percent of the population lives in either Elyria or Lorain. . In Lorain County, the northern communities make up one-third of the land area of the county but contain nearly 78% of the county's total population. This difference in population density between the north and south is becoming more pronounced as a result of recent development trends. Unlike the \"urban flight\" experienced in most major metropolitan areas within Northeast Ohio where a shift towards exurban and suburban growth occurs, the population density in the watershed's northern communities is actually increasing. Between 2000 and 2010 in Lorain County the northern communities accounted for approximately 87% of new housing development. A majority of the land area of the watershed is rural, but a majority of the population base is urban. This is primarily related to public utilities. Areas within the watershed that have utility services tend to grow at a faster rate and a higher density. In particular, areas without sewer lines are limited in their density by the structural demands of on-lot home sewage treatment systems (HSTS). Improved access to sewer lines coupled with encroaching development from the northern communities will create a need within unincorporated areas in the central areas of the watershed to better manage the resulting pressures from land use change."}, {"section_title": "C.

A listing of known plans either under development or in-place follows: codes Lorain County Lorain County Comprehensive Land Use Plan: adopted in 2000 to promote a rational development strategy to accommodate increasing land use pressures but also enhance the rural, natural, and agricultural heritage of the county. The Plan delineated \"Priority Development\" and \"Priority Conservation\" areas within the County; however, a detailed analysis of environmental factors was not performed. This Plan recommended the creation of a specific Environmental Strategic Plan. Lorain County Environmental Strategic Plan: prepared in 2006 to address sanitary, storm water, and brownfield issues and promote ecological good stewardship within Lorain County. This Plan encouraged the formation of a County-wide Storm Water Utility, the establishment of a stream corridor protection zone, enforcement of setbacks, and the creation of a comprehensive inventory of both developable and environmentally sensitive lands. Each municipality and township was encouraged to create its own Land Use Plan and enact zoning resolutions to identify and manage Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) within their jurisdictions. The County-wide Storm Water Utility is currently under implementation in unincorporated areas. The rest of the LCESP exists as a resource and recommendation to communities within Lorain County seeking to develop their own environmental plans. Individual watershed communities who have Comprehensive or Master Plans in place include the cities of Avon Lake, Avon, Sheffield Lake, and North Ridgeville. The city of Lorain has adopted seven urban renewal plans that address issues such as brownfield remediation and recommend implementing conservation development and naturalized drainage systems in redevelopment projects. In 2001 and 2002 New Russia and Pittsfield Townships, respectively, adopted Comprehensive Plans that stress the importance of improving the environmental quality of the Black River through use of wetlands, riparian corridors, stream and floodplain setbacks that act as natural filters for pollutants and eliminate detrimental siltation. In 1999 LaGrange Township developed a draft Land Use Plan that recommended management of land use and development in the Township to protect surface water resources (streams, ponds, flood zones, and wetlands) from pollution, sedimentation, excessive increases in storm water runoff, and unnecessary alteration of their natural state and function. Carlisle Township developed a Comprehensive Land Use Plan in 2000 that focuses on improving the ecological health of the Black River and takes a watershed-based approach to future community development. The City of Oberlin updated their existing Comprehensive Plan in 2004 (http://www.cityofoberlin.com/Files/Planning/TEXT%20Plan%20Update%202004.pdf) that focuses on the environmental issues in the Plum Creek sub-watershed and has implemented a land use planning process in which setbacks are specified for riparian zones and conservation easements are set. As of October 2010, Eaton Township has a Comprehensive Land Use Plan in review which discusses the need for riparian setbacks and other environmentally sound practices in future land use and development."}, {"section_title": "Ashland County", "text": "Ashland County Comprehensive Land Use Plan: Approved in February 2000 and found here; stresses the importance of instituting appropriate measures to protect the natural landscape and maintain the ecological health of Ashland County. This Plan recommends preserving natural corridors through implementing practices such as conservation easements, conservation development, and redevelopment/reuse of brownfield sites. Ashland County specified in their Plan that groundwater has become polluted because of inappropriate land uses and surface water has become polluted and lost quality because of development encroaching into riparian corridors, causing the transformation of natural waterways into \"sterile drainage ditches\" which flood more frequently due to increasing volumes of runoff and the speed of water moving across impermeable surfaces. The preservation and restoration of riparian corridors along the Black River and its tributaries are a primary goal of the Black River Watershed Action Plan."}, {"section_title": "Medina County", "text": "Per communication with the Medina County Department of Planning Services (MCDPS): Litchfield Township, Chatham Township, Homer Township, Harrisville Township, Liverpool Township, and the Village of Spencer all have Comprehensive or Land Use Plans completed and adopted.

Out of the communities within the Black River watershed, the city of North Olmsted has its own Master Plan, updated in 2005 and found here. This Plan primarily recommends conservation development, as over 90% of the city is developed and the majority of open greenspace, like Bradley Woods Reservation, is already maintained and managed by Cleveland Metroparks. Conventional subdivision and zoning regulations allow an alternative arrangement of building lots while preserving a significant amount (40%) as permanent open space. Generally, these regulations allow all but the \"unbuildable\" portions of the property such as 100-year floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, and stormwater management areas to be developed. Conservation subdivisions can also be part of an overall plan to develop a greenway system through a community. In Figure 3, the illustration on the left shows traditional residential subdivision development. The illustration on the right shows how the same number of lots can be accommodated on the site while preserving environmental features and maximizing open space. Conservation design takes into account the unique natural features of a site and provides for their permanent preservation. Such features could include wetlands, floodplains, significant wildlife habitats, woodlands, historic sites, and scenic views. Conservation subdivision designs offer several advantages over conventional layouts. Economic advantages include lower costs of infrastructure and design, faster appreciation in value, reduced demand for new open spaces and parks, and environmentally oriented marketing and sales strategies. The environmental and ecological advantages of conservation design include the reduction of storm water runoff, pollutant filtering, protection of natural buffers along wetlands, and maintenance of wildlife corridors. Conservation development is preferred to preserve the natural ecology in the area and to take into account unique natural and geological features. In the Black River watershed, the opportunity for conservation design will become more prevalent as more and more of the communities within the watershed urbanize and connect to sewage lines. The lot space requirements of home sewage treatment systems hindered conservation design in older communities, but current and future development projects can take advantage of the environmental and economic benefits conservation design and Low Impact Development (LID) has to offer. volunteers who have a vested interest in the health of the areas in which they work, play, and live is the way for engaged citizens to educate their neighbors about the importance of preservation and restoration of water resources within the Black River watershed while using technical, educational, and funding assistance to implement projects that benefits the communities of the watershed."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Development of Watershed Group", "text": "The building of public support has been initiated through the Watershed Coordinator's engagement at over forty community events and agency meetings through the year 2010. These meetings involved citizens who are committed to the health of the watershed as well as professional and representative stakeholders whose roles make them crucial to the development of a watershed organization that combines professional expertise with informed community leadership. The recruitment of key stakeholders and other potential partners, especially property owners, has been taking place throughout the past year. Given that half of the East and West Branch sub-watersheds consist of cultivated land, outreach to agricultural agencies such as the North Coast Farm Bureau of Erie, Huron, and Lorain Counties and similar organizations are necessary in order to bring the perspective of agricultural interests to bear on addressing water quality issues. In a state-wide study of runoff (nonpoint source pollution) conducted by Ohio EPA, one stretch of the West Branch was found to be \"the most severe case of agricultural nonpoint source pollution ever recorded in Ohio.\" In contrast, nearly 60% of the lower watershed (north of Rt. 20) has been developed. The constituency in this part of the Black River watershed will be more focused on issues related to brownfields redevelopment, rapid suburban development, and implementing programs that can be effective without using large amounts of property. This includes citizen volunteers who represent community organizations and homeowner associations as well as business sector supporters. To elicit further support and elevate watershed health issues into the mainstream, the Watershed Coordinator has been and will continue to provide educational speaking engagements and will seek opportunities to partner with community, educational, business, and trade organizations which can help the broader Black River watershed community make the connection between environmental, economic, and community health. The task of educating the public and garnering support cannot fall on the shoulders of a single person, nor can it become the task of agency personnel. In order to create positive and lasting change in the Black River watershed, the community needs to be organized either through an existing non-profit entity or the creation of a new 501c3 non-profit organization. This entity or organization would be tasked with giving direction to the Watershed Coordinator. The coordinator would continue to be housed at the Lorain County Community Development Department and would report to the Director of Community Development, especially since Lorain County Commissioners have been providing the local match to the ODNR grant. However, for the following reasons, a separate group of advisors to the Watershed Coordinator is needed to provide guidance as an independent entity from Lorain County Community Development: \uf0b7 Although the Black River watershed encompasses much of Lorain County, it extends into Medina, Ashland, Cuyahoga, and Huron Counties. Independent direction would permit the addressing of issues that extend beyond county boundaries. \uf0b7 An advisory group can assist the Watershed Coordinator, especially with fundraising, community outreach, monitoring and data collection, project implementation, and other areas where committee members can work on multiple tasks in a coordinated fashion. \uf0b7 An advisory group can make independent policy decisions based solely on the needs of the Black River watershed and provide perspectives that are not based on any one particular government or non-profit entity's own mission. The three options for the formation of this independent advisory group are as follows: Continue with the present ad-hoc committee of advisors: The advantage to this strategy is that the structure is already in place. The ties between the individuals forming this ad-hoc committee can be strengthened through a Memorandum of Understanding that describes the responsibilities and expectations of each member. However, the responsibility for raising funds, gathering resources, and implementing the Watershed Action Plan would reside exclusively with the Watershed Coordinator and Lorain County Community Development. Opportunities for raising funds through foundation grants would be limited by the absence of a non-profit organization structure to accept funding."}, {"section_title": "Develop a Watershed Action Plan Advisory Committee that is a subcommittee of an existing", "text": "Non-Profit Organization: An existing organization can take on the responsibility of providing oversight to a Black River watershed group which would effectively become a subcommittee to the existing organization's board of directors, provided that the mission of the parent organization is compatible with the roles and responsibilities of the Black River watershed group and that the board of directors agrees to such an arrangement. The advantage of this strategy is that it would provide immediate support to the watershed group by serving as the group's fiscal agent while providing technical expertise and immediate credibility. Furthermore, the parent organization's 501(c)(3) status would allow the watershed organization to immediately be eligible for funding that is not available to local government entities. However, this path of action has two possible disadvantages: it relies on the constancy of the parent organization to be able to support the mission of the watershed group on a long-term basis and over the tenures of various boards of directors, and it opens up the possibility that the goals and/or actions of the parent organization may be at odds with those of Lorain County Community Development. 3. Create a new Black River watershed Organization: While this option would take the most time and effort to organize, the advantage of creating a new non-profit organization is that it would provide the independent authority and focus needed to address the multiple issues besetting the Black River watershed. A new 501(c)(3) would be eligible for funding opportunities that Lorain County Community Development cannot apply for. It would be able to exclusively educate the public and gather funds and in-kind resources devoted to the Black River. One danger is that there may be the perception that the goals of a new Black River watershed organization would have too much in common with an existing organization such as the Black River Remedial Action Plan. Discussions with the Black River RAP should take place to see whether having a separate organization would create redundancies, and if it doesn't, how this new organization would collaborate with the Black River RAP."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "The current group of Black River watershed stakeholders should be convened as a working group to explore the above three options. If needed, this working group should augment its capabilities and scope by recruiting members who would provide the group with the necessary geographic diversity, citizen involvement, and skills that mirror the diverse circumstances present in the watershed. This group would consult with Lorain County Community Development, the Black River RAP, ODNR, NOACA, Ohio EPA, and other key stakeholders to identify the key parts of the Watershed Action Plan to focus on, and to determine the organizational structure that would best support the goals of the Watershed Action Plan. Regardless of the organizational structure chosen and initiated by the working group, the following principles should be followed: \uf0b7 It should be an independent group that provides oversight and support to the Watershed Coordinator \uf0b7 It should include representation from throughout the watershed as well as professional and citizen representation that reflects the land use issues of the watershed \uf0b7 It should have the capacity to raise funds, provide educational outreach, act as a liaison between the group and community, government, environmental, educational, and business entities, and provide data and scientific support. \uf0b7 The group should have a president, treasurer, and secretary, take regular minutes, be open to and actively engage with the general public, and be governed by consensus. \uf0b7 The group should provide significant support to the Watershed Action Plan, including the refinement of the plan, the implementation of its recommendations, and the eventual evaluation and updating of the plan.

The watershed coordinator has prepared and distributed fact sheets to both elected officials and the general public, with content ranging from the current status of the Black River watershed to the importance of mitigating stormwater in both urban and rural environments. An email newsletter has been developed to keep interested parties informed of the state of the watershed and the planning process, and a Facebook and web site are maintained by the watershed coordinator which aid in fostering a sense of community and interaction among stakeholders. In addition, the coordinator has spoken at and will continue to speak at local and regional events regarding the water quality issues at play within the watershed and what actions can be taken to solve those issues. As the action items are being developed, members of the community are being invited to review and provide valuable feedback. Future watershed meetings will be held to focus on the concerns of specific groups, such as developers, businesses, the agricultural community, and the general public; thus the finalized plan will be able to provide well-rounded and comprehensive strategies that all levels of stakeholder can be invested in.

The ancestral shorelines, or beach ridges, were used as transit routes through the wetlands by Native Americans and early settlers. The wetland areas were later drained beginning in the late 1800s to provide arable land and support increased agriculture, as the unique lake-modified climate extends the growing season several weeks longer than that of inland regions. Common industries in this region are fruit and vegetable farms, nurseries, and factories. The southern portion of the watershed consists of the Low Lime Drift Plain, characterized by a low, rolling landscape punctuated by glacial features like end moraines and kettle lakes. Its soils are less fertile and need to be drained in order to be agriculturally viable. Dairy, livestock, corn, and soybean farms are common, and the growing season is shorter than that of the Erie Lake Plain.

They tend to be associated with wetlands but are generally more extensive. Many hydric soils are seasonally inundated in the early spring and have saturated soils for only a portion of the growing season. This is sufficient for the soils to develop hydric characteristics, such as anaerobic conditions in the upper parts, and support hydrophytic vegetation. In Lorain County, approximately 70,000 acres are classified as hydric soils, and another 192,000 acres contain non-hydric soils with hydric inclusions. The Trumbull soil association is hydric in nature, and occurs in geographic depressions and other drainage areas within the upper two-thirds of the watershed. It is naturally poorly to very poorly draining and characteristic of wetland areas. In many areas within the Black River watershed, Trumbull soils have effectively lost their wetland characteristics as a result of agricultural activities and active artificial drainage such as tiled fields. Miner and Lorain soils are also associated with Mahoning and Ellsworth silt loams. These soils have seasonally high water tables, low permeability and are hydric in nature. As a result, these soils present severe limitations for HSTS and are a cause of wet basements for many homeowners. Within the Lake Plain portion of the watershed, the Haskins-Jimtown-Oshtemo soil associations are characteristic of the beach ridges, outwash plains and stream terrace areas. They are deep soils, somewhat poorly to very poorly drained and flat to low-relief. These soils are found only in the northern parts of the watershed, and are primarily used for horticultural cultivation and residential development. Also associated with the Lake Plain are extensive swales of poorly to very poorly drained hydric soils. Such swales are found between the ancient beach ridges formed by lakes ancestral to present day Lake Erie. Historically, these flat areas have been extensively drained and used for agricultural production. Within the past decade much of this area, located primarily in the Black River (041100010602), French Creek (041100010601) and Heider Ditch-Frontal Lake Erie (041100010603) 12-digit HUCs, has been and continues to be converted to extensive residential, commercial and industrial uses. The increased impervious surfaces coupled with the already poorly-draining hydric soils cause serious flooding problems for the communities in this area. Directly south of the City of Lodi and the glacial end moraines that surround the community park is a large expanse of land known as \"muckland.\" This muckland is a product of geology and glaciation. The glaciers created the terminal moraines evident in Lodi. The hillier terrain created by these moraines surrounded lower elevation areas. Here, water would tend to drain off of the moraines and become trapped in large expanses called \"mucklands,\" which attracted species typically encountered in bogs or prairie kettles. Peat moss would grow in these wet conditions. The thick root masses in peat moss accumulate and decompose slowly, eventually creating a thick, springy mat of sphagnum moss. Other sedges and aquatic grasses emerge in these saturated open conditions, as well as swamp forest species such as elm, ash, or pin oak. The organic matter from these plants shedding their leaves or dying off accumulates in the waterlogged soils. Because decomposition of organic matter requires oxygen-rich conditions, this material would decompose very slowly, eventually creating a thick boggy mat. As areas in the southern watershed were drained for agriculture, the water table descended rapidly, exposing large stretches of very black, organic-rich soils, 20-30 feet thick in some areas. If drained, the rich organic content creates a friable, loose soil rich in nutrients that can be ideal for crop growth. Mucklands define large expanses that contain highly organic soils. The central part of the Black River watershed contains remnant bogs or kettle holes that are defined by similar organic soils. One such bog, Camden Bog, lies about 10 miles west of Oberlin. Owned by Oberlin College, Camden Bog was created when a large hole formed in the ground and filled with glacial ice. As the glaciers expanded, the ice would be driven downward, expanding the hole. As the glaciers melted, these holes would fill with water and create a boggy environment much like those encountered in the mucklands, but on a smaller scale. Bogs are not encountered in Lake Plain soils north of Oberlin;the wave action of the ancestral lakes that preceded Lake Erie sorted sand and clay materials which eventually filled in the topography in that region."}, {"section_title": "Bedrock and Glacial Geology", "text": "Map 6: Bedrock Geology (See Appendix A). The oldest visible bedrock in the watershed is the Ohio Shale, a brittle shale formed approximately 360 million years ago during a late Devonian marine transgression and composed of black clays and silt particles carried from the ancestral Appalachian mountains to the East. Only about a hundred feet of the Ohio Shale is exposed within the Black River watershed. The three major bedrock exposures within the watershed are the Mississippian-age Bedford Shale, Berea Sandstone, and Cuyahoga Formation. They were formed 320-345 million years ago as the deeper, offshore waters of the Devonian period regressed to a nearshore deltaic environment. Evidence of bioturbation and wave ripples can be seen in the rock facies and larger sand particles predominate over fine clays and silts. The oldest Mississippian exposure is the Bedford Shale, directly overlying the Ohio Shale. It is a soft, reddish-colored formation that can be seen exposed downstream from the sandstone falls at Cascade Park in Elyria. Overlying the Bedford Shale is the Berea Sandstone, a porous but durable quartz sandstone that ranges in color from gray to buff and has been utilized as a building material not only in Lorain County but throughout the United States. It resists erosion and can be found naturally exposed as escarpments in the falls at Cascade Park, as \"whaleback\" ridges in the northern portions of the watershed, and artificially exposed in the many sandstone quarries that remain from Lorain County's historic sandstone industry. Ancient wave ripples from the nearshore Mississippian seas can be seen within the Berea Sandstone, and it is found across Northeast Ohio in varying thicknesses (10-200'). The Cuyahoga Formation consists of blue-gray shales and is found primarily exposed in the southern headwaters portion of the watershed. It can be fossiliferous in places and can also contain fine-grained sandstone banding. Map 7: Primary Lithology (See Appendix A). About 2 million years ago during the Pleistocene, a series of glacial advancements and retreats known as the Wisconsin Glacial Episode repeatedly covered nearly two-thirds of Ohio under thick sheets of ice. The last of these glacial advancements, the Tioga, reached its maximum extent approximately 21,000 years ago. These glacial ice sheets were very powerful, scouring and leveling the landscape that had formed during the 300 million years since the end of the Mississippian period. Ancient hills and valleys that had existed for millions of years were flattened and filled with glacial debris. As the glaciers advanced and retreated, they left behind primary deposits of this debris, an unsorted, usually unconsolidated mixture of sediments that range in grain size from silt to boulders, known as glacial till. This till forms a substantial layer over most of the Black River watershed, averaging 50 feet thick in most areas. The Wisconsin ice sheet left large quantities of till behind as it receded from the region. Where the glacial retreats slowed, thicker deposits of till were deposited. These deposits are now seen in the form of low ridges called moraines. The rolling hills in the more southerly, upper reaches of the watershed are representative of this geologic feature. There are two terminal or end moraines found here, known as the Defiance and Spencer Moraines, which mark the southernmost extent of the Wisconsin advance."}, {"section_title": "B.

Map 8: Sensitive Species and Conservation Areas (See Appendix A).  Rare and threatened animal species are not as well-documented as plant species within the watershed. DNAP data described two species: the ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) and the blacknose shiner (Notropis heterolepis). The ruddy duck is designated a Special Interest species and the blacknose shiner is designated an Endangered species. The most recent ruddy duck sighting in the DNAP Heritage Database was at the Sandy Ridge Reservation, located in the Black River Main-stem (041100010602) in 1999. The blacknose shiner was last documented in an approximately 2-mile long segment of reach in the Coon Creek (041100010303) sub-watershed located within the headwaters region of the East Branch back in 1977. DNAP sensitive species and habitats data also described several great blue heron rookery locations along the Black River main-stem and the East Branch sub-watersheds. Since the 1980's, the number of active blue heron nesting sites along the main-stem of the Black River has been increasing. In the early 1990's, a major rookery was identified on the property of the then USS/KOBE steel company along the main-stem of the Black River. Increased sightings of herons have been reported in places where nesting and foraging does not typically take place (such as urban settings or industrial sites). Nonetheless, the location of a heron rookery on the steel plant property indicates improvements in water quality conditions, as herons. Herons require sizable fish populations to support their feeding habits. In addition to herons, several great egrets have also been observed. Similar to the heron in stature and physique, these large, white-feathered birds feature straight yellow beaks and black legs and feet. USS/KOBE has been providing annual updates on blue heron rookery populations nearof its facility along the Black River main-stem. Records from 1994 describe an endangered bird, the sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), nesting along Charlemont Creek, but no recent sightings have been reported. River otter tracks were identified during a 1993 wildlife census, but there are no documented sightings of river otters within the watershed. A federally endangered mammal and a candidate species reptile, the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and the the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) respectively, have ranges throughout the state of Ohio including the Black River watershedWatershed. A population of bigmouth shiners (Notropis dorsalis) has been identified in the West Branch subwatershed of the Black River. There are currently only two rivers in Ohio that are known to have native bigmouth shiner populations, the Black and the Rocky. It is therefore critical to the future of these native fish populations that water quality and habitat be improved within the West Branch subwatershed. A 1998 ODNR study examined changes in fish populations in the Black River between 1992 and 1994 and concluded that the probable cause of fish community losses was excess turbidity resulting from siltation. The \"lost\" species were all classified as silt-sensitive, with silt-tolerant species such as creek chubs, These species are designated \"targeted\" by ODNR and Ohio EPA out of the approximately 100 invasive species in Ohio, meaning they are the most difficult to control and are highly invasive in Ohio's natural areas. Invasive and nuisance species within the Black River watershed include foxtail grasses, cocklebur, colt's foot, flag grass, multiflora rose, phragmites, and garlic mustard. The multiflora rose has become particularly troublesome because it can colonize fallow fields and render them unsuitable for grazing. Poor management of land within the watershed places stress upon the native flora and fauna and leaves them vulnerable to invasive species. Removal of these invasive plants is time-consuming and costly to landowners. Implementation of best agricultural management practices for both remedial and preventative purposes will go a long way towards protecting, restoring and maintaining the natural ecology of the riparian areas and waters of the Black River. Encouraging the initial planting and long-term maintenance of native species wherever possible, from small home garden projects to large-scale road construction and subdivision development, would be an effective preventative measure to curb the likelihood of invasive species taking hold in potentially vulnerable areas."}, {"section_title": "C. Water Resources 1. Climate and Precipitation", "text": "The climate of the area is classified under the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger system as Dfa, or \"Hot summer subtype.\" It is characterized by average temperatures of 79-86 degrees F during the mid-late summer months and about 26.6 degrees F (or colder) during the winter months, and predominantly humid with very few arid days. There are distinct seasons (warm-hot summers and cold winters), frequent precipitation, and rapid variability of different weather systems. These features are indicative of a zone of conflict between polar and tropical air masses. The proximity of Lake Erie also has an influence on the region's climate, most notably in the \"lake effect\" snowfall experienced by areas closest to the lake during the winter months. In addition, the lake acts as a sort of temperature buffer, keeping temperatures relatively stable during the various seasons. For example, the winter months can get very cold but rarely do the temperatures reach subzero conditions. Precipitation in the area can vary but is generally well-distributed throughout the year. Map 9: Average Precipitation (See Appendix A). On average, the Black River watershed experiences about 36 inches of rain and 43 inches of snow a year. The majority of the rain, approximately 68%, is absorbed into the ground through infiltration. About 26% becomes run-off immediately into surface-water. Of that 68%, the majority enters the soil and is later returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. The rest (about 6 inches) goes initially into the groundwater supply, but a percentage of that eventually enters surface-water bodies as groundwater discharge. What remains goes either into the air by evapotranspiration or is used to supply water needs (Brown, 1990). The hydrologic cycle, when functioning properly, is an essential balance in the interactions between the air, the ground, the biota, and surface water. This balance of interactions is disrupted by anthropogenic stresses on the environment, such as increases in impervious surface from rapid urbanization. Less water is then absorbed into the ground and instead is diverted through storm sewers to the nearest available surface-water body at an unnatural volume and velocity, leading to issues like flashy flooding and untreated pollutants entering the system. An understanding of the need for proper functioning of the hydrologic cycle is essential in order to make good decisions for the protection and long-term use of the Black River's water resources.

Point sources of pollution, on the other hand, are pollution sources with easily identifiable origins. Many of the streams within the watershed have been dredged and channeled over a period of many years to drain adjacent wetlands and to make the rich alluvial soils suitable for farming. Sanitary wastes, if not properly controlled, threaten both groundwater supplies and the \"primary contact recreation\" designation of streams. The ecological impacts of sanitary treatment using on-site septic systems tend to worsen with an increasing populace and with a greater occurrence of poorly maintained systems.

Map 10: Wetlands (See Appendix A). The Black River watershed has lost a substantial portion of its natural wetlands, and preservation of whatever original wetland remains is an obvious and ideal first choice. We can, however, also view the current situation as a tremendous potential for wetland restoration and recovery. Ohio's \"no net loss\" wetland policy often results in the removal of a wetland in one area and \"restoring\" it in an area that is sufficiently far away as to completely eliminate any functional ecological benefit for the original location. While it is true that the new location may be a viable place to sustain a wetland ecosystem, the old location will now suffer the loss of an area that served a vital role in preserving water quality and controlling water quantity. Of particular concern are those portions of the Black River watershed that are rapidly developing as they already experience problems relating to loss of detention and retention areas and are incapable of handling large storm water events without experiencing flooding. Wetlands also serve as sediment sinks to trap and hold excessive sediment before it enters the waterways. Restoration of riparian wetland areas in key locations around the watershed floodplain would solve many of the attainment problems encountered within the Black River watershed.

The exceptions to this are in the extreme southeast near Lodi where the Killbuck Buried Valley Aquifer yields 100-500 gpm and at the mouth of the Black River, where clay and silt deposits yield less than 5 gpm. Very little of the Black River's water comes from groundwater owing to the low permeability of the clay soils and the shale bedrock that dominate the underlying geology. There is little opportunity for surface water to percolate into the aquifers. The vast majority of its water comes from storm runoff, which leaves the river naturally susceptible to wide fluctuations in stream flow throughout the year. Increasing urban development, particularly in the northern areas of the watershed, exacerbates these fluctuations by increasing impervious surface and the subsequent volume of water rapidly entering the Black River during storm events. 1 9 4 5 1 9 4 9 1 9 5 3 1 9 5 7 1 9 6 1 1 9 6 5 1 9 6 9 1 9 7 3 1 9 7 7 1 9 8 1 1 9 8 5 1 9 8 9 1 9 9 3 1 9 9 7 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 5 Source: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=04200500&agency_cd=USGS As evidenced by this flow graph from the USGS gauging station in Elyria, the Black River may be in a period of instability.

Drinking Water Source Assessments have been prepared for the community systems of Avon Lake, Elyria, Lodi, Lorain, Oberlin, Wellington, and eleven transient non-community systems. While the municipalities of Medina in Medina County and West Salem in Wayne County are not within the Black River watershed, they purchase a portion of their water from public water supplies that operate within Lorain County. Therefore it is important to not only communities directly within the Black River watershed but also to communities surrounding the watershed that ground and surface water health be maintained in the Black River basin. A number of communities within Lorain County purchase some of their water supply from New London in Huron County, part of the Vermilion River watershed. A review of the Village of New London compliance monitoring data from 1991-2002 (performed on treated drinking water) revealed that the system had no health based or Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) violations. The PWSs of Oberlin and Wellington get their drinking water from tributaries of the Black River. The City of Oberlin's PWS serves approximately 8,600 people through 2,520 service connections. The intake for Oberlin is located in the West Branch through the Parsons Road reservoir. The Village of Wellington's PWS serves approximately 4,600 people through 1,700 service connections and draws its water from Charlemont Creek. Although drinking water throughout the watershed meets federal standards for consumption, there are potential concerns about the future of these two water supplies. Currently, the policy at both PWS's is to draw water from their respective source streams at times where raw water analysis indicates low levels of TSSsTDS's and nutrients. Map 12: Intake Locations with CMZs delineated (See Appendix A). There are several locations along the Black River that have been designated by these reports as Corridor Management Zones, or CMZs. These are areas along streams and tributaries within the assessment area that warrant delineation, inventory, and management in the interest of preserving and maintaining the health of the public drinking water supply. Charlemont Creek, a designated CMZ, is particularly prone to excessive sedimentation. A focus on Charlemont Creek in efforts to curb sediment load may be an efficient option to improve both the status of the public drinking supply and the ecological health of the overall watershed.

Land Use", "text": "A land cover map and a land cover change analysis for the Black River watershed was generated in ArcGIS using 2001 and 2006 data-layers obtained from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP), provided by ODNR Office of Coastal Management's GIMS department. While land use and land cover data for the watershed as a whole exists, it had yet to be broken down by 12-digit HUC sub-watersheds. This was generated with assistance from OCM's GIMS department. For a complete listing of land change from 2001-2006 within the watershed by 12-digit HUC, see Appendix B. The Black River watershed is characterized by two very different land-use patterns. The East and West Branch sub-watersheds are predominantly rural and agricultural while the northern Black River mainstem sub-watershed is home to some of the most rapidly-urbanizing land in Northeast Ohio. Hence, land disturbances associated with both high residential growth and intensive agricultural practices are problematic for the Black River watershed. A breakdown of land use for each 10-digit HUC shows this marked difference between the southern and northern basins. As one moves from the northern downstream regions of the watershed south towards the upper headwaters, one can see that the land uses shift rather dramatically from over 60% developed to less than 10% developed, with the West Branch and East Branch being over 60% agricultural. The Headwaters East Branch has a low level of development almost completely concentrated within the communities of Spencer and Lodi and retains a sizable percentage of deciduous forest and land that is not developed or cultivated land. Every sub-watershed with the exception of the East Fork East Branch sub-watershed has over 50% of its acreage designated as \"human use\" (developed or cultivated land). In addition, while the East Branch HUC-10 is generally considered to have good stream quality, sub-watersheds within the lower reaches of the East Branch (Willow Creek, Jackson Ditch-East Branch) have significantly more developed acreage than other HUC-12s within the East Branch.

Thomas Johnson introduced steel to Lorain in 1894 when he moved his company to the City of Lorain, where Lake Erie, the Black River, and an accessible railroad system offered access to the ore, coal, coke, and limestone needed for steel processing. Many acres of forest were cleared to make room for the construction of the steel mill, and the City of Lorain straightened, armored, and dredged the Black River to allow for passage of large ore boats. Land for the mill was cleared in May of 1894. After a year of construction, twenty buildings were built, including power and boiler house facilities, a 38-inch blooming mill, and a rail mill. The blast furnaces began operations in 1895, and three years later, the company was refinanced and its name was changed to Lorain Steel Company. As a result of this financing, the mill doubled in size and three million dollars went into the construction of furnaces and coke ovens. The arrival of steel in Lorain enabled the city to pull itself from the depression of the 1890's that plagued much of the country. The presence of the mill allowed Lorain to become a major city. The production of steel has had a major impact on environmental quality in the area around Lorain. The environmental effects of steel production was a major factor in the International Joint Commission's listing of the Black River as one of forty-three Areas of Concern in 1987 for pollution in the Great Lakes basin. The earliest effort to reduce environmental pollution by the steel industry occurred in 1971 when the National Tube Company invested $120 million to install two bar mills and a Basic Oxygen Process furnace. The furnace, which blasts pure oxygen into the molten mix, raises productive efficiency while reducing air pollution through more complete combustion. As a result of National Tube's upgrade, twelve open hearths and the last of the Bessemer furnaces were removed. These old furnaces polluted Lorain's air with a thick plume of orange smoke, and installation of the new furnace helped to lift the orange tint that would collect in the area above Lake Erie, obscuring views and filling the air with particulate matter. In 1983, afish consumption advisory was issued for five miles of the Black River south of its mouth at Lake Erie. The fish, particularly brown bullhead catfish, experienced high incidences of cancerous tumors as a result of exposure to high concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in river sediment. Tumors and deformities in fish continued to be problematic in the Black River mainstem through 1994. USS/KOBE Steel closed its coking facility in 1983, eliminating the primary source of this pollution. Despite this, tumor rates did not decline until after 1990 when the river bottom was dredged and toxic contaminants were contained in a hazardous waste landfill installed on-site. While PAHs have been reduced, high levels of PCBs, mostly from other industries, remain a major problem. PCBs affect wildlife that consumes fish, mussels, or other bottom feeders, which can accumulate and concentrate the toxins present in the sediments within their bodies. Post-dredging, the water quality around the steel plant has improved significantly, causing the ban on fish consumption to be changed to an advisory to restrict brown bullhead, freshwater drum, and carp consumption. In 1998, as an acknowledgement of their progress in improving environmental quality through pollution prevention and waste reduction, USS/KOBE steel received an award from the Ohio Environmental Council. Their efforts included improvements in energy use, spent acids, solid waste, oils and lubricants, and volatile organic compounds. Today, the steel plant area is the site for the Black River Restoration Project, currently the largest stream bank restoration project in Ohio.

A comprehensive inventory of locations of home sewage treatment systems (HSTSs) in the Black River watershed is currently unavailable, especially in the rural sections of the watershed. Many of the systems were installed decades before any kind of regular mapping or initial monitoring was implemented, and so often times a HSTS inspector cannot pinpoint a location until they're called out to fix a failing system. In Lorain County, the General Health District is working in collaboration with the Lorain County Auditor to plot HSTS locations on a site-by-site basis in order to compile a comprehensive GIS database for the future. Detailed HSTS maps have already been generated for the communities of North Ridgeville, Sheffield Township, Sheffield Village, City of Avon, Carlisle Township, Elyria Township, Eaton Township, and Grafton Township, and can be found in Appendix A in the back. MS4 communities are required to provide or create detailed HSTS location maps, and so this information will be updated as more maps become available.

"}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Data", "text": "Crop Type, Tillage, Rotations The primary crops within the watershed are corn, soybeans, hay (alfalfa), oats, wheat, and barley. The standard crop rotation among agricultural operators within the watershed is an annual rotation with soybeans and corn. Both conventional and reduced-till methods are used; no-till is widely practiced throughout the watershed for soybeans, but is less prevalent for corn. Alfalfa remains infield for a three-year period. A 1998 study by Matisoff et al. in the nearby Old Woman Creek watershed analyzed the soil erosion losses for conventional versus no-till areas. Each method was analyzed over an average study area of 536 acres. The results showed a clear benefit to no-till methods in managing soil loss within the watershed; the tilled acreages had an erosion rate of 9.8 lbs/acre while the no-till acreages had an erosion rate of only 1.1 lbs/acre. This study can be readily extrapolated to the nearby agricultural communities within the Black River watershed and emphasizes the need for public education on the benefits of no-till or reduced tillage. Crop rotations, in addition to their traditional use of minimizing soil nutrient depletion, can greatly affect the amount of soil lost from erosion by runoff. In areas that are highly susceptible to erosion, farm management practices such as zero or reduced tillage can be supplemented with specific crop rotation methods to reduce raindrop impact, sediment detachment and transport, surface runoff, and soil loss. Rotation methods that leave the greatest amount of crop stubble on top of the soil provide the best protection against soil loss. Stubble cover minimizes erosion from water by reducing overland flow velocity and stream power, which hinders the ability of the water to detach and transport sediment. Crop rotations also affect the timing and length of when a field is subject to fallow. The seasonal variability of the climate in the Black River region can leave fields open for a significant part of the year. Efficient fallow management is an essential part of reducing erosion in a crop rotation system. Zero tillage is a fundamental management practice that promotes crop stubble retention under longer unplanned fallows when crops cannot be planted. Such management practices, which succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow, will ultimately reduce soil loss within a watershed. The primary livestock within the watershed are cattle. Large commercial herds are managed through existing Department of Agriculture programs, but smaller herds are managed almost exclusively through a voluntary approach. Voluntary compliance with sound manure management practices should be encouraged within the watershed. According to Ohio EPA, there are currently no Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) located within the Black River watershed. CAFOs are required by Ohio EPA to meet NPDES permitting standards. Most livestock operations are small to medium dairy operations with about 25-30 cattle; about a dozen exist with over 100 cattle (pers. comm., Lorain SWCD).

Irrigation is not widely practiced within the watershed except in limited specialty situations with fruits and vegetables.

Tiled fields in some form are common throughout the watershed and their effect upon the natural hydrology of the area is significant. Tiled drainage is an agricultural practice by which subsurface pipes are laid below a farm field in a grid pattern. They function much like the drain holes in a potted plant do by encouraging subsurface water to move out from between waterlogged soil particles and into the tile lines, where the water is rapidly funneled to an available nearby surface water body (river, lake, or stream). This artificially lowers the water table in the field and allows the plant roots to grow deeper and develop a more mature structure, thus increasing crop yields. Older tile lines are composed of ceramic and the water enters through gaps in the piping; newer tile lines are composed of plastic and the water enters through perforations in the plastic pipe. Tiled drainage alters the natural hydrology of the watershed; excess precipitation is directly routed to the streams through the tiles rather than over the land's surface, which results in a shorter travel time and provides less opportunity for pollutants to be naturally filtered through groundwater infiltration. In addition, the increase in volume and velocity of water routed into the waterways through the outflow drainage areas exacerbates bank erosion and incision in those areas, causing large amounts of downstream sediment transport.   information indicated that the watershed saw an approximately 11% increase in housing, the largest percentage of any area in Northeastern Ohio. In Lorain County, nearly 31,000 new homes are projected to be built by the year 2020.

They called the river \"Canesadooharie,\" meaning \"river of black pearls.\" Human habitation of the Black River watershed dates back to approximately 6,500 B.C. People who settled the area were foragers, hunters, or farmers attracted by the gently rolling landscape and rich natural resources. The Black River offered readily-accessible water, nearby land suitable for raising livestock and growing crops, dense forests, and abundant game hunting. The geological and human history of this area is made apparent today through the sites of recreational, historical, and cultural significance found throughout the Black River watershed. Numerous municipal parks and recreational facilities are located within the Black River watershed. The majority of the watershed is served by the regional districts of Lorain County Metro Parks and Medina County Park District. These parks provide opportunities to actively explore the geological, ecological, and historical features of the watershed through their trails, nature centers, and historic sites.

Previous and Current Complementary Efforts", "text": "In 1985, the Black River was designated as one of 43 Areas of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes basin by the Water Quality Board of the International Joint Commission. It is the only AOC that encompasses an entire watershed. This action spurred the formation of the Black River Remedial Action Plan, an ongoing effort to remove impairments to beneficial uses in the Black River AOC. The RAP process uses an ecosystem approach to solve environmental problems and involve diverse public stakeholders throughout problem identification and clean up. The RAP steering committee coordinates the implementation and evaluation of the three RAP stages for the Black River: Stage I involves the identification of all the environmental problems in the AOC and at a minimum describes these problems according to impacts on the fourteen beneficial uses of watersheds listed by the IJC; Stage II prescribes the actions needed to eliminate the problems and assigns responsibilities for these actions; and Stage III involves an ongoing monitoring of the AOC to ensure that problems do not develop in the future. The purpose of the RAP is to define the actions necessary to overcome the current water quality problems, to restore the river as closely as possible to its original, natural state, and keep it in a healthy condition. (Source: NOACA's Black River RAP information site.) As of the 2009 Annual Report, there have been several RAP-related milestones met within the watershed, such as the Lower Black River Master Ecological Plan. This Plan encompasses the area from the mouth of the Black River in Lorain Harbor to the 31 st street bridge in the City of Lorain and is intended to be a framework for improving, preserving, and restoring fishery health, aquatic and riparian habitat, and adjacent terrestrial habitats. Fish shelf installation, slag pile remediation, wetland restoration and construction, streambank stabilization, and bulkhead habitat creation are all proposed actions within this Plan. Another current project is the City of Elyria Greenway and Trail Plan, developed and finalized in 2009 under an ODNR grant to improve upon the City of Elyria's existing greenspace and add greenway corridors. The Plan addresses the current and future needs of the city for recreational trails, trails as alternative transportation, the health of the Black River resources found in Elyria, the conveyance of storm water into the river and the potential ecotourism connection opportunities to the region. The Black River Restoration Project is an action from the Lower Black River Master Ecological Plan that will restore approximately 11,500 feet of stream bank in the City of Lorain in the Black River Mainstem sub-watershed. It is currently the largest stream bank restoration project in the state of Ohio, and involves construction of about 320 feet of fish habitat shelves, removal of approximately 500,000 cubic yards of waste material, and floodplain restoration. It will also restore 650 feet of a large heron rookery located within the project area. The long-term goal for the project is to form a variety of wetland and floodplain habitats transitioning to a forested floodplain/wetland complex. The grading and waste material removal was expected to be completed by February of 2011. Planting of native herbaceous plants will begin at that time and extend to February 2012 in order to establish and maintain an effective barrier against invasive species. "}, {"section_title": "G. Physical Attributes of Streams and Floodplain Areas", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Early Settlement Conditions", "text": "Map 18: Original Vegetation (see Appendix A). The Black River watershed consisted primarily of beech forests in the East and West Branches and a combination of beech-mixed mesophytic-mixed oak forests in the Black River main-stem sub-basins. Elm-ash swamp forests were also present in smaller pockets throughout the watershed, and oak-sugar maple assemblages could be found in the upper headwaters near Lodi. . Their annihilation was a consequence of disagreements and conflicts over specific highly productive hunting and trapping grounds. The Eries, or \"Nation du Chat\" (literally \"Cat Nation\" -French) were described by the Jesuit priests as wearing large cat-like furs. These furs were most likely those of raccoons, which were a plentiful animal in the region."}, {"section_title": "Early Conditions of the Black River Watershed at the Time of European Settlement", "text": "After the defeat of the Eries, there were no permanent Native American Indian settlements in the Black River watershed. This allowed for relatively easy settlement by Europeans. Dense forests, lack of navigable roadways, and swampy areas still had to be overcome. This was a major obstacle faced by the settlers of what we now know as the area of Oberlin, Ohio. Oberlin was a large swamp, which was important for stormwater recharge and natural water purification, but it was a challenge for the early settlers to drain and effectively use this landscape. Col. James Smith, then a young man, provides a unique and first hand description of the \"Canesadooharie\" (or Black River as referred to by the Wyandots) through his journal that was later published. He was captured in the 1700s by the Wyandots, a group of Native Americans that frequented this and other Northern Ohio lands for hunting. He states in this early account, \"From the headwaters of Canesadooharie to this place, the land is generally good; chiefly flat or second rate... The only refuse is some swamps, that appear to be too wet for use, yet I apprehend that a number of them, if drained, would make excellent meadows.\" As we can see, the European mindset of clearing and draining the land was prevalent in this young man's mind. He continues by describing the timber of the Watershed, and names the presence of many native trees such as oaks, walnut, hickory, cherry, ashes, and elm. The nut bearing trees were extremely important to not only the native animal populations but were collected by Native American inhabitants and even early settlers. Col. Smith also describes many native animals and particularly focuses on the \"remarkably large and fat\" raccoons that lived in this area. This makes a clear connection to the Erie's garb described by the Jesuit priests. In less than two hundred years, the Black River watershed has largely been altered and would not be recognized by the Native American inhabitants or Col. Smith. Some of the once cut-over forests have grown back in areas of the Watershed, and many landowners are now learning and appreciating the existence of wetlands and riparian stream bank buffers. Wild turkeys and white-tailed deer are once again beginning to roam portions of the Black River watershed. It will take many years, but preserved wooded lands such as those contained within city parks, metropolitan parks, and privately protected lands, will once again boast giant trees similar to those that existed when Europeans set eyes upon the Black River watershed.\" About one mile south of the Indian Hollow Metropark on Indian Hollow Road is a 40-acre patch of virgin, first-growth forest. This area represents a \"core reserve,\" an area of relatively undisturbed forest that can provide a template for forest restoration efforts throughout the watershed. These woods possess several characteristics of a healthy forest ecosystem. There are four well-developed and distinct canopies. The understory in the forest is well-developed and biologically diverse. Mature trees, such as red oak and pin oak, are well distributed and not densely packed. Several of the trees sampled had a trunk circumference of 15-20 feet. Within the woods, vegetation tends to vary greatly depending upon drainage conditions. In several areas, water tends to collect in drainage sinks (large low elevation areas) or large holes left behind by fallen trees. Water concentrates in these areas and supports more hydrophilic (water-tolerant) species, including pin oaks, ash trees, and the threatened marsh marigold. These wet areas also provide important habitat for salamanders and frogs. This area was acquired by the Lorain County Metroparks, providing an essential asset for understanding the original composition of forest communities in the area and offering a benchmark by which to judge future forest restoration efforts in the watershed."}, {"section_title": "Channel and Floodplain Conditions", "text": "Floodplains are the areas adjacent to rivers and streams that are subject to frequent or regular flooding. The 100-year flood has one chance in one hundred of occurring in any given year and represents the flood level chosen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for regulatory purposes. Floodplains form a unique ecological niche and support biotic communities that are adapted for occasional inundation. Floodplains are unstable and potentially dangerous areas for human use. However, as is the case in the Black River watershed, floodplains are often targeted for agricultural purposes because the land, if drained, represents some of the best arable land available in the region. Approximately 20,524 acres or 6.7% of the total watershed lies within the 100-year floodplain. Map 19: Floodplain Map (see Appendix A). Presently, there are about 1,475 structures located in the Black River floodplain. Entrenchment from heavy channelization has limited stream access to the floodplain in many parts of the watershed, particularly in the urbanized downstream reaches, and some of the streams within the upper watershed have been dredged and channelized over a period of many years to drain adjacent wetlands and make the soils suitable for farming. Many small tributaries to French Creek and the Black River main-stem have had their sinuosity and floodplain access completely eliminated through channelization or culverting. Streams that have been disconnected to their natural floodplain keep the force of flow within their channels which causes downcutting and loss of material from streambanks (erosion). The upper reaches and tributaries in the less-populated rural areas have still retained a good portion of sinuosity, particularly in the East Branch sub-watershed. These areas should be targeted for protection and conservation. In the West Branch, many of the streams are utilized for direct drainage off nearby croplands so natural low-flow meander over a wide floodplain is not encouraged, but filter strips, grassed waterways and other agricultural BMPs can serve to mitigate and filter overland flow. NOACA assessed a significant portion of the streams within the Black River watershed for their Clean Water 2000 Plan and determined that approximately 14% are impaired by urban runoff, 13% are impaired by channelization and dams, and 87% are impaired by agriculture. The 13% figure is probably a conservative estimate of the number of streams impacted by channelization. Most streams in the northern sections are intentionally modified to eliminate or minimize floodplain access, as flooding of residential areas is a major concern in municipalities such as North Ridgeville and Sheffield Village. Frequent flooding in the towns of Avon and North Ridgeville illustrate challenges in the Black River watershed. Floods are typically viewed as natural disasters rather than normal events in nature. While they are dry most of the time, floodplains are actually a part of the river channel, wet only during storm events or times of high precipitation. The lowest floodplains in French Creek, where the rapidly developing cities of Avon and North Ridgeville are situated, regularly overflow 2 to 3 times a year. Floodplains at higher elevations that flood less frequently are given classifications related to time intervals between floods. These flood events are commonly referred to as 25-, 50-, or 100-year floods and indicate the probability that a flood will occur in a given year. In other words, a 25-year flood has a 1/25 chance of happening at any time. The main factors that contribute to flooding are the volume of rain that falls over a given time period and the capacity of the land to absorb that rain. If land absorbs a small percentage of rainwater and that run-off flows into a restricted channel, flooding will tend to occur. As forest or farmland is replaced with asphalt and turf, soil loses its permeability and the volume of stormwater that rushes into a stream increases. French Creek provides a good case study for the effects of increasing development in the Black River watershed. North Ridgeville and Avon, two of the fastest growing cities in Lorain County, are both located along French Creek. A close review of flooding along the creek demonstrates the problems of stormwater management in an area experiencing rapid development. Three contributing factors for this flooding are the slope of the land, soil types, and changes in land use over the last decade. Human development further disrupts normal flood patterns and increases the frequency and severity of flooding through the removal of riparian corridor and active floodplain. Since the recent settlement of the Black River watershed, the protective vegetative strips along the river, called buffer or riparian zones, have been mostly removed. This removal of natural vegetation increases both the volume and velocity of surface runoff into existing waterways. Many buffer zones and wetlands in floodplain areas have been removed and replaced with agricultural, residential, or commercial development. Lorain County has lost over 50% of its original wetlands, dropping from 30% to 10-15% of the total land area. Along the river, farmers plant crops right up to the stream bank to maximize the amount of acreage in production. Similarly, developers and landowners will often install turf and build right up to the stream banks to maximize their use of the land. The town of Avon exemplifies the rapid growth trend that has been occurring within the Black River watershed's lower reaches. Between 1991 and 1996, over 900 new residences, the highest in Lorain County, were constructed in Avon, and the city is one of the few places in the region still gaining in population. Almost all of the southeastern quarter of Avon lies within the 100-year flood plain along French Creek. The development boom that has swept through Avon is largely concentrated on this level land between State Route 83 and the Cuyahoga County line. Part of the flooding in Avon comes from the increase of impervious surface within the city. Another major contributor is increased development in North Ridgeville that sits upstream from Avon. Development in North Ridgeville imposes greater impacts on Avon as the storm water volume magnifies as it moves downstream. The increased volume comes primarily from runoff from impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, buildings, and other features of the built environment. On a paved lot, 98% of the rainwater that hits the surface will immediately flow off as runoff. Unfortunately, most turf lawns are much less pervious due to compaction of soils during development. Lawn turf can be amended using compact or augmenting drainage through planting of deep rooted native vegetation and trees. Through a combination of soil type, land use, and rainfall, The Lorain County SWCD has developed calculations for run-off volume resulting from development. This formula was applied to a 23-acre site in the Avon area where a commercial development was planned. As mature woodland with trees, shrubs and other vegetation, about 886,000 gallons per year flowed off of the site and into French Creek. As cropland, the same 23 acres contributes 1.2 million gallons per year. Finally, if the land is paved and turned into commercial or residential property, the runoff volume doubled, dumping almost 2 million gallons per year into French Creek. Given the rapid growth rate of Avon, North Ridgeville, Avon Lake, and other northern watershed communities, this scenario is repeated across hundreds of acres of land, contributing to major flooding problems for Avon and downstream communities along the Black River. The conventional engineering approach to handling storm water is to increase the volume and velocity of water passing through a system. Widening or deepening channels or digging new channels expands volume. Velocity is increased by reducing the bends or meanders in a water system and lining it with an impermeable surface such as concrete or rip rap. This kind of system hastens the drainage of storm water away from a given community. Unfortunately, as the case of Avon and North Ridgeville demonstrates, this approach has several limitations. North Ridgeville improved drainage in the late 1990's by straightening channels and lining waterways with concrete. This solution, while facilitating drainage away from North Ridgeville, exacerbated flooding for their downstream neighbors in Avon. In addition to flooding, another problem with this approach is the further degradation of aquatic habitat. Storm water surges increase sedimentation and erosion. In addition, rapid shifts in the volume of water can affect aquatic species. Greater aquatic ecosystem stability is achieved when storm water is collected and percolates slowly into a river system, insuring a more even flow and fewer wide fluctuations in stream load. A more proactive solution to storm water issues is to mimic the more natural drainage courses in the watershed. Before large-scale settlement, a vast network of wetlands and forests would absorb storm water. Water would slowly percolate out of these systems, providing a more consistent stream flow and reducing the extremes of flooding and drought conditions. One recent development in North Ridgeville has taken a proactive approach to mimicking these more natural conditions. Houses being constructed on the property will be clustered closely together. This allows for more space to be devoted to open space. Over 50% of the property will be devoted to habitat and natural storm water containment. A 10acre wetland will form in a sandy embankment, absorbing storm water and recreating native habitat conditions. While such housing developments are encouraging, current zoning and building codes do not support this kind of alternative development. A more proactive zoning code could encourage preservation of open space and a better approach to storm water management. An ideal stream restoration scenario would be to retain open space in the watershed, encourage the development of well-connected floodplain areas, restore sinuosity to the channel, and develop riffle and pool habitats where appropriate. However, this is an unlikely option in the developed and urbanized Black River main-stem and French Creek sub-watersheds where the communities are near build-out. Many opportunities still exist for floodplain and wetland restoration projects, though. One example is in the City of North Ridgeville, where the Watershed Coordinator has been partnering with local government, citizens, and a consulting firm to develop a Town Center District Plan. This plan will incorporate designs that facilitate and enhance transportation through North Ridgeville's town center, including the potential floodplain restoration of a channelized tributary to French Creek and development of an educational wetland complex behind the City Library with signage and access paths. Riparian corridor is an ecological definition that is applied to the connected waterways of a river system and includes stream banks and floodplains. Riparian corridors, like floodplains, offer important ecological functions and should be protected. Left in their natural state, riparian corridors act as stream buffers which help to prevent soil erosion, filter water pollutants, and provide habitat for wildlife. Flooding, erosion, excessive sedimentation of surface waters, increased storm water runoff, loss of wetlands, increased pollution, and loss of natural habitats are some of the problems the Black River watershed faces if riparian corridors are not protected. Riparian vegetation provides shading and keeps the temperature of the water lower, increasing the amount of oxygen available in the water and improving overall stream habitat quality. Riparian corridors also support species diversity, serve as vital natural throughways for migrating fauna, and promote environmental resilience versus future negative ecological impacts. From a social perspective, riparian zones can increase property values by being both aesthetically pleasing and providing space for many different recreational activities such as walking, bicycling, fishing, hunting, boating, and bird-watching. This diversity of interest can foster a stronger sense of community among local residents. Most people enjoy natural settings and wildlife viewing and are willing to pay a higher price to enjoy these benefits. Forested natural areas along the corridors can also prevent erosion and reduce the amount of sediment and nutrient-laden runoff from farming or development that enters the streams, thus protecting surface water quality. Riparian zones are instrumental in water quality improvement for both surface water runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface flow. Research has shown that riparian zones, particularly wetland riparian zones, play a significant role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff from agricultural fields. The Virginia Department of Forestry (VDF), in their efforts to protect and restore the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, determined that riparian forests as narrow as 50 feet in width can completely filter out excess nitrogen and reduce sediment and phosphorous by a significant amount. The amount of nutrient retention, however, varies by factors such as width of buffer and slope. The VDF recommendation is that a minimum buffer of 50 feet plus 4 feet for every 1% increase in slope will alleviate a nutrient problem. It should be a goal of Black River watershed groups to protect as many existing riparian corridors as possible. Many actions recommended by this action plan deal with the preservation of riparian corridors. The establishment and protection of riparian integrity has long been a focus of the Black River RAP Committee, who can be seen as a willing partner to protect these areas. Continued degradation of these sensitive locations will further exacerbate negative environmental impacts to water and habitat quality. To determine the approximate area of riparian corridor for each HUC-12, a buffer was created along hydrology lines from the National Hydrology Dataset (NHD) and used as a mask to clip relevant data from a land-use layer of the watershed. The resulting area of forest along the stream banks was then calculated and percentage estimates were made.

"}, {"section_title": "Natural and Modified Channels", "text": "A comprehensive inventory of modified vs. natural channels does not currently exist for the entire Black River watershed. Using QHEI data provided by Ohio EPA, known unmodified miles were estimated for the watershed. NOACA's Clean Water 2000 Plan estimated that 13% of streams within the Black River watershed have been channelized to some extent; the actual amount is probably significantly higher. This is probably a conservative estimate of actual unmodified miles. Artificially straightened river conditions in these areas cause significant amounts of suspended sediments to settle out. In the French Creek sub-watershed in particular, most sites with QHEI evaluations were channelized, re-routed, or otherwise altered for residential or commercial development. The Black River main-stem near the mouth is an industrial waterway in a federally-regulated channel and as such is dredged and maintained in a permanent entrenched state. Most of French Creek and its tributaries have been culverted, rerouted, or buried in pipes. The southern, more rural/agricultural part of the watershed also experiences some channelization as streams are straightened, ditches are dug out and cleaned, and banks are altered to facilitate drainage off croplands. The expedited drainage increases volume and flow further downstream and exacerbates an already pressing stormwater issue, leading to down-cutting and severe erosion. The result is that many banks have lost access to their floodplain and riparian areas."}, {"section_title": "Dams", "text": "Map 20: Black River Dams by Location and Purpose (see Appendix A). There are about 165 known dams within the Black River watershed. The majority of dams are privately owned and designated for recreational use to create small impoundments for fishing, boating, and swimming. There are 23 known public dams. In 2009, a dam which created Brentwood Lake, a 0.046 km 2 impoundment in Carlisle Township, was removed because of concerns that the dam would fail and flood out several nearby homes. The Lorain County Engineer's Department oversaw the removal and drained the lake, eliminating the pronounced algal blooms present in the impoundment area (Brentwood Lake, along with Findley Lake, was listed as Impaired for Eutrophication or Undesirable Algae) and restoring the natural stream which had not been free-flowing since the 1950s. However, there was no management of the property post-dam removal. The area has been subsequently overgrown by invasives and the local residents have voiced their desire to have the lake restored or at the minimum, some mowing done on the property to control the tall weeds. As a result, the Brentwood Lake site should be targeted as an important restoration area. It is situated over hydric soils and comprises about 15 acres; the relevant stream is a direct tributary to the East Branch of the Black River and takes drainage and nutrient loadings from an 18-hole golf course immediately upstream. Development of a properly-managed wetland complex in this area would serve a vital nutrient and storm water mitigation function for the Jackson Ditch-East Branch sub-watershed, which is suffering increased pressures from suburban development.

Specific fencing sites have been identified after discussions with local citizens, and will be targeted for future projects."}, {"section_title": "Eroding Banks", "text": "A specific inventory of number and location of eroding banks did not exist for the watershed; however, an analysis was performed in ArcGIS using a Highly Erodible Land (HEL) dataset in conjunction with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Land classified as Highly to Potentially Highly Erodible was isolated and used to mask along NHD flowlines, with the hypothesis being that the resulting measured stream miles would likely be very susceptible to eroding. A conservative estimate of 226.23 miles of eroding banks (or 18.1% of total miles) for the entire watershed was determined. This is considered minimum mileage, as the altered hydrology of streams in the northern watershed from increased development has exacerbated erosion there as well. In 1982, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) reported the majority of cropland within the watershed is eroding at an average rate of 4.7 tons/acre/year (more than 56% greater than the soil loss tolerance). The USACE found that more than 100,000 acres of cropland within the watershed was eroding at more than twice the rate of tolerable loss. At the time, the area represented fully one-third of the entire watershed. According to the USACE report, erosion resulting from agricultural practices within the watershed was the major source of sediment in the Black River and its tributaries. Highly Erosive Land (HEL) maps show that the most erosive soils are located in the upper, predominantly agricultural reaches of the watershed. This stresses the importance of implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) among local farmers to control and manage soil loss on their properties. The Black River TMDL also identifies sedimentation and turbidity as significant causes of water quality impairment. Stream bank scouring resulting from too much water being introduced into waterways is causing elevated levels of erosion and sedimentation throughout the entire watershed. Channel incision from high-energy flow alters the stream's natural morphology and prevents the stream's natural function through entrenchment and elimination of floodplain access. It is safe to say that one could find eroding banks present throughout the entire watershed area from the headwater tributaries to the main stem river, and particularly in the southern sections of the watershed where the most highly erodible soils are located.

The French Creek sub-watershed is shown as close but not meeting attainment. Splitting the site data into upstream and downstream of RM 6.9, though, shows a marked difference in habitat quality. The upstream section exhibits extremely low habitat scores indicative of the heavy development and subsequent hydromodification the sub-watershed has undergone in recent years. The downstream portion meets and exceeds attainment. This is due to the presence of good riparian corridor and protected stream bank along the French Creek Reservation, where the sampling was done for this section.  Aside from an approximately 0.8 mile stretch that was straightened as it crosses Interstate 90, the downstream portion exhibits moderate to good sinuosity. Development is generally medium to light residential and riparian cover still exists along the stream bank. Upstream of RM 6.9, though, French Creek exhibits low to no sinuosity. Development, while still mainly residential, is more intense and most if not all of the stream has been channelized as it crosses through the community of North Ridgeville. Riparian cover is sparse or nonexistent. Out of the 15.8 miles of stream that comprise French Creek, it is estimated that nearly 75% (about 11.8 miles) are modified in some way due to development and close to 100% of the tributaries to French Creek are modified. Although aquatic habitat, as measured by QHEI, is near the attainment score of 60, both of the fish community indices (IBI and MIwb) are a significant departure from being in attainment. The benthos score (ICI), while exceeding the attainment value of 34, may misrepresent conditions of the watershed as it represents an average score of only a single site, measured twice, once in 1997 and again in 2001. Interestingly, the fish and benthos community scores were obtained between RM 6.10 and RM 1.00, a stretch that averaged 63.9 for QHEI, a value of attainment for aquatic habitat. The QHEI scores, by River Mile, can be seen in the chart below.  Upstream of River Mile 6.9, no site achieved attainment for aquatic habitat. This is likely due to the flat terrain and the degree of development in this part of the watershed.

Tributaries sampled in the East Branch, however, fared significantly worse with over 80% of the sites listed as not being in attainment and no streams meeting attainment. Tributary streams in general fared poorly compared to the principal stream assessments except in the Headwaters East Branch.

Analysis of this data indicates that there are few stream miles in the Black River watershed that have a low or minimal chance of being threatened by human activity, particularly from agricultural use.

Two park WWTPs discharge to the lake with a monthly flow ranging from 20,000-44,000 gpd. The lake was assigned a Lake Condition Index (LCI) of 35.8. Lakes with LCI scores over 31 generally show impairment for one of their four designated uses. In Findley Lake, only the Recreational Use designation was in less than full attainment. Public Drinking Water and Aquatic Life uses were listed as Threatened, meaning the lake could have problems with these designations in the future and continued monitoring is recommended. Most other lakes within the watershed are maintained as private recreational use and were formed from impoundment of existing waterways.

Causes and Sources of Impairment/Threats", "text": "The Black River TMDL and the Ohio EPA 303(d) list have outlined the following causes and sources of impairment and/or threats to the Black River watershed. Agricultural practices contribute heavily to the sediment load; past and current agricultural and construction practices leave bare fields exposed and vulnerable to erosion. Stream bank erosion is also a significant cause of sediment. Plowing to the edges of streams, allowing livestock direct access to streams, and removal or disturbance of riparian vegetation all contribute to further destabilization and subsequent erosion of stream banks. Nutrient concentrations are closely associated with sediments in runoff and are also elevated within the Black River and its tributaries. Excessive phosphorous and nitrate loads come from non-point agricultural runoff as well as point-source discharges and home sewage treatment systems. This nutrient enrichment leads to nuisance algal blooms, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and loss of aquatic habitat and populations. Elevated bacteria (fecal coliform) levels within the watershed come from failed or failing HSTSs and illegal septage dumping (Boddy, 2002), combined sewage overflows, manure application in fields, and runoff from feedlots and urban areas. Soils with very slow or moderately slow permeability are rated as having severe limitations for septic system use. Because so much of the Black River basin is either covered by hydric soils or non-hydric soils with hydric inclusions, much of the region is not optimal for septic systems. In Lorain County, for example, approximately 98% of the soils are poorly suited for septic. Common limitations include a seasonal high water table, restricted permeability, poor natural drainage, flood hazards, and a shallow depth to bedrock. The high seasonal water table common within the somewhat poorly drained, poorly drained, and very poorly drained soil types which cover most of the watershed may prevent the proper functioning of septic disposal fields for varying periods of time."}, {"section_title": "Point Sources", "text": "Major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located within the watershed are operated largely by municipalities, including Avon Lake, Elyria, Lorain, North Ridgeville, Oberlin, Grafton, LaGrange, and Wellington.

Non-Point Sources", "text": "Non-point source pollution, which includes habitat alteration, is now responsible for most water quality problems in Lake Erie and its tributaries. Whereas large point source polluters are more easily identified and regulated, almost everyone contributes to non-point source pollution on a daily basis. This makes controlling non-point source pollution a much greater challenge. Non-point source pollution includes: \uf0b7 Contaminants that originate diffusely on the land and run off with rain or snow; \uf0b7 Sediment that erodes from unprotected construction sites, farm fields, and stream banks; \uf0b7 Bacteria and pathogens that enter the water from septic systems and combined sewer overflows; \uf0b7 Pesticides, fertilizers, road salt, pet waste, and heavy metals that wash off yards, parking lots, and golf courses. The major sources of nonpoint impacts to the Black River watershed are characterized by the dichotomous nature of the area. The downstream reaches of the watershed, north of Route 20, are heavily affected by suburbanization and urbanization. These sources cause increased sediment loading to the streams which results in poor substrate quality, embeddedness, and overall habitat quality impairment, which can be noted in the major tributary of French Physical changes to tributary streams also cause significant water quality degradation. Known as \"habitat alteration,\" these actions, including straightening, deepening, widening, damming or otherwise altering a river's natural form and flow cause the failure of many of Ohio's streams to meet water quality standards. Ohio's 312 miles of Lake Erie shoreline is a great source of wealth and vitality for its residents and visitors. Forty-one percent of Ohio's citizens live within the Lake Erie basin and reap its many natural, scenic, and economic benefits every day. Lake Erie has rapidly become one of Ohio's most popular visitor destinations. The Ohio Department of Development estimates that the shoreline brings more than $2.5 billion per year in travel revenue to Ohio's economy, which represents one-third of the state's travel revenue. Lake Erie is certainly a resource worth protecting and improving, and ensuring the water quality of its tributaries and streams is essential to that process. Significant pollution problems remain, despite the many strides that have been made in addressing point source pollution. Some major issues outlined in the Black River TMDL are: Habitat Alterations According to Ohio EPA, habitat degradation and sedimentation are now the leading causes of aquatic life use impairment in Ohio streams and rivers. The source of these causes of water pollution is mainly \"hydromodification,\" or physical changes to the stream or river. Nearly one-quarter of all hydromodification-related stream impairment is associated with suburban development."}, {"section_title": "Urban Development", "text": "Urban sprawl in recent years has expanded at an alarmingly rapid pace. Unfortunately, such fast-paced development has occurred without due consideration to the cumulative effects on water quality. As a result, urban sources of non-point pollutants, such as sediment from construction sites, combined sewer overflows, hydromodification, and storm water runoff, are having an increasingly negative impact on water quality. Urbanization tends to harden land and streams with concrete and asphalt. Therefore, water quality restoration alternatives are limited and expensive in the urbanized environment. For example, uncovering and restoring a culverted stream is much more costly than keeping development away from the stream during the planning process."}, {"section_title": "Agriculture", "text": "Agriculture occupies approximately 70% of the land use in the Lake Erie basin and the Black River watershed is no exception, with nearly 80% of its land used for agricultural purposes. This land use has a significant impact upon the area's water quality. Although agriculture's widespread and noteworthy adoption of conservation tillage has reduced specific non-point source pollutants such as phosphorous, significant opportunities for improvement remain. Intensive agricultural practices (e.g. larger fields, fewer types of crops, bigger equipment, concentrated livestock, and extensive drainage) continue to alter streams and wetlands and contribute sediment and nutrients to coastal waters. Other Non-Point Issues Alteration of the natural structure of the lakeshore, river mouths, and wetlands also contribute to water quality problems. Dam construction, shoreline modification, marina development, and diking are some of the activities causing such alteration. Significant stretches of tributaries, river mouths, and nearshore areas along Lake Erie have sediment contamination problems due to these impacts. In addition, inadequate maintenance and failure of suburban and rural HSTSs contribute nutrients and pathogens to Lake Erie and its tributaries.

In addition, the soils around these streams are some of the most highly erosive in the watershed and have some of the steepest slopes (60-80+ feet/mile) so sedimentation from erosion is likely to be a significant impact on habitat quality. Loss of these streams from development is unlikely at the moment; the far upper reaches of the watershed are very rural still and the Villages of Lodi and Spencer in Medina County are not experiencing any rapid growth or build-out presently.

In Lorain County, the General Health District is now inventorying HSTS locations on a site-by-site basis in order to compile a comprehensive GIS database for the future. Detailed HSTS maps have already been generated for the communities of Avon Mound systems, absorption fields, and aeration systems with NPDES permits are the main types of systems used in the Black River watershed, with mound and aeration systems comprising the majority since absorption fields generally require sandier soils than what is commonly found in the area. Approximately 2,787 on-lot systems composed of a traditional septic tank with subsurface leach-field are estimated to have been constructed within the watershed between 1979 and 1998. Conservative estimates from site inspections are that 20% of these older on-lot systems are not functioning adequately; the actual percentage is probably much higher owing to system age and the surrounding soils which are poorly suited for septic. A total estimate of 19,300 on-lot and off-lot discharge systems within the watershed was calculated from information provided by the Lorain County General Health District, the City of Elyria Health District, the Lorain City Health District, and the Medina County Health Department. In the summer of 2009, the Lorain County General Health District conducted two separate surveys to evaluate the functionality of known HSTSs in the area. They found failure rates as high as 50-60% on average regardless of system age, which points to lack of homeowner maintenance resulting in the failure of HSTSs at unacceptably high rates. A portion of the survey taken in the French Creek (041100010601) sub-watershed showed that 59% of aerator systems surveyed were failing due to missing or non-operational aerators. Using an extremely conservative estimate that 20% of systems are failed, approximately 4,000 systems could be failed or failing in the Black River watershed. The Ohio Department of Heath estimates that the average household generates 400 gallons of sewage a day. That means a potential discharge of 1,600,000 gallons a day; if a higher estimate of 60% is used the daily potential discharge increases to 4,800,000 gallons a day of untreated sewage. Old age, poorly drained soils, and a lack of routine maintenance are the most common causes of failure. Older systems were often designed for lower water usage or have simply outlived their life expectancy. When these older systems fail, the effluent can seep into nearby drainage tiles and ditches where it is directly transported to the Black River's waterways. Routine maintenance and proper operation of HSTSs are extremely important to protect the Black River's environment and preserve public health and safety. Sanitary sewers are the only long term solution to periodic replacement and maintenance of a HSTS. The Upper Black River Watershed Project was conducted from 1998-2002 by NOACA, the Lorain County General Health District, and the former Seventh Generation group. The goal of the project was to evaluate the effect of residential sewage treatment and disposal upon the streams and ditches located in the Upper Black River watershed. Sampling locations for the Upper Black River Watershed Project are shown on Figure 31. Field work was conducted from 1998-2000. A total of 617 samples from 52 locations in 10 townships in the watershed were taken. Specific care was taken to sample at locations where waterways were sited in close proximity to residential areas and not close to or directly impacted by agricultural and industrial runoff. The results are as follows:   The results indicate a definitive link between failed residential sewage systems and polluted water. Streams in the Black River watershed are being adversely affected in a significant way by HSTSs. Even at the most lenient standards, 31% of sites exceeded fecal coliform levels and 98% of sites exceeded E. coli levels. Taking the 16.2% HSTS failure rate from the NOACA study, loading amounts of N, P, and BOD by HUC-12 were estimated using the STEPL Region 5 model. The City of North Ridgeville, which is located almost entirely within the French Creek sub-watershed, was audited by Ohio EPA on July 14, 2010 for their MS4 Storm Water Program. In 2009, septic tanks were eliminated on 38 properties by tie-in to a sanitary sewer main. Other MS4 communities within the watershed are also actively working on eliminating HSTS discharges to their relevant waterways. Tie-in to a sanitary sewer line is the only long-term solution to degraded water quality from failing HSTSs, although continued homeowner education on proper maintenance of their systems and working with the Lorain County General Health District and other local health departments and districts to continue to identify critical areas will help improve existing conditions."}, {"section_title": "Number of New Homes Being Built", "text": "Housing data was compiled by community for the year 2009 and split among sub-watersheds.

Some swine operations exist but are not as common as dairy or beef. These livestock operations have a significant effect on water quality within the watershed. Most operators are careful to keep their livestock away from streams, but less have made efforts to control manure runoff on their farms with proper waste storage structures. In addition, farmers who take this manure for fertilizer over-apply it in most cases, or apply during times where it is washed off the fields and into nearby ditches and streams."}, {"section_title": "Acres of Highly Erodible Land and Potential Soil Loss", "text": "Soils within the Black River watershed have an average soil loss tolerance of 3 tons/acre/year. However, in 1982, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) reported the majority of cropland within the watershed is eroding at an average rate of 4.7 tons/acre/year (more than 56% greater than the soil loss tolerance). In their 1982 report, the USACE found that more than 100,000 acres of cropland within the watershed was eroding at more than twice the rate of tolerable loss. At the time, the area represented fully one-third of the entire watershed. According to the USACE report, erosion resulting from agricultural practices within the watershed was the major source of sediment in the Black River and its tributaries. Acreage of highly erodible land by HUC-12 was calculated from GIS data provided by ODNR's Office of Coastal Management. Sub-watersheds with near or greater than 10% highly erodible acreage are highlighted. Soil erosion is dependent on several factors: local soil type, slope, and local land use. The upper watershed, comprising parts of southern Lorain County and western Medina County, has been identified as being the greatest contributor to in-stream sediment loads due to soil erosion. Historically the predominant land use in these areas has been agricultural. Residential and light commercial land use has increased in the upper watershed since the initial USACE report, particularly near the city of Lodi located in the Headwaters West Fork East Branch Black River sub-basin. However, agricultural production remains the dominant land use within the watershed, which leaves significant portions of the landscape uncovered and susceptible to erosion for large parts of the year. In addition to anthropogenic causes, naturally occurring erosion and sedimentation rates in the upper reaches of the East and West Branches of the Black River are quite high. Steep slopes and river banks in the headwaters region, combined with deep, unconsolidated till-based soils contribute to naturally high erosion rates. Exposed stream-banks lack the soil stability provided by riparian vegetation and contribute significant sediment loads to the stream system. The volume of eroded sediment becomes particularly severe during storm events or other periods of high water flow. Unnaturally accelerated soil erosion and streambed sedimentation are detrimental in many ways. Soil loss lowers agricultural productivity, damages and clogs the stream drainage network and harms the biologic integrity of the Black River and all of its tributary streams. Excessive sedimentation interferes with reproductive and biological functions of aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish species. Sedimentladen waters increase turbidity and reduce light penetration, adversely affecting aquatic macrophytes in the benthos. This loss of benthic vegetation can lead to lower levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, placing stress on fish and macroinvertebrate populations. The effect of excess erosion and subsequent sedimentation on the aquatic habitat of the Black River watershed is significant. Most of the streambed habitat within the Black River watershed is severely impacted as a direct result of sediment load caused by agricultural practices from the upper (headwater) reaches of the watershed. While the average soil loss across the watershed is estimated at 3 tons/acre/year, the 2008 Black River TMDL reports that more than 20% of the land area in the southern watershed erodes at more than 5 tons/acre/year. The most erosive sub-watersheds are the three 10digit Headwaters East Branch sub-watersheds, the Upper West Branch, and Charlemont Creek. The low permeability of these soils also means that storm water runoff enters into rivers and streams quickly through overland flow. Riparian corridors that are found alongside streams and rivers provide a natural counter to this tendency. When left undeveloped and naturally vegetated, riparian corridors function to slow drainage and filter pollutants, thereby reducing flooding and improving water quality in the stream."}, {"section_title": "Culverting of Streams", "text": "Minor culverts for roadways are found throughout the Black River watershed.

For the purposes of the Lorain County Engineer's Department, any structure with a span of less than 10 feet is described as a culvert."}, {"section_title": "Channelization of Streams", "text": "Channelization is any activity that moves, straightens, shortens, cuts off, diverts, or fills a stream channel, whether natural or previously altered. Such activities include the widening, narrowing, straightening, or lining of a stream channel which alters the amount and speed of the water flowing through the channel. Some examples of channelization are: lining channels with concrete, pushing gravel from the stream bed and placing it along the banks, or placing streams into culverts. (Ohio EPA Region 7, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act/Wetlands Program, February 2005.) A large number of streams in the Black River watershed have been channelized and many are maintained in a modified state to facilitate drainage for agricultural and residential land uses. In the West Branch, where row crop agriculture dominates the land use along with pastureland, the removal of trees from stream banks coupled with the deepening and straightening of the stream course to expedite drainage can cause the loss of sustained stream flow. Less stream flow in a given drainage area means less assimilative capacity from a pollutant loadings standpoint. In the French Creek sub-watershed, a sizable amount of streams have been straightened, culverted, and rerouted to accommodate residential and industrial development. The mouth of the Black River is permanently maintained as a shipping channel and is dredged and armored as a result. Ditch cleaning has been traditionally viewed by residents as a needed activity to control localized flooding, but scientific studies discourage it because of its negative impact to stream biology and wildlife. These opposing viewpoints create a challenge for Lorain and Medina SWCDs, who must attempt to take a balanced approach when conducting drainage activities. Limited drainage ditch improvements that mitigate local flooding issues without complete disruption to the stream corridor and surrounding habitat, such as one-sided construction, maintaining natural vegetation on one bank, seeding of wildlife grasses and, where practical, maintaining stream pools, would be the most practical solution to this complicated issue (Black River TMDL, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Levied Streams and Dikes", "text": "Sections of Ridgeway Ditch and the Black River main-stem have levees in place.

However, land use change data indicates that agricultural land use is diminishing within the watershed. As this occurs, more streams will be left to natural forces without the need for drainage modification and may once again return to their preimpact state.

Siltation is listed as a cause of impairment in nearly every area of the watershed. Sediment flux in and out of an ecosystem is a natural process, but when deposition exceeds export, degradation of habitat may result. Sediment deposited on the streambed fills interstitial spaces within the substrate, eliminating the niche in which bottom-dwelling organisms reside.

Ohio EPA is planning to monitor the fish communities in the next couple of years.

Higher percentages of both external and internal fish tumors have long been associated with polluted water and sediments. This is especially true for the lower Black River main-stem which had been known around the Great Lakes as the \"river of fish tumors.\" In the Black River, the main contaminant causing fish tumors and deformities was polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from an old steel mill coking plant. The coking plant has been closed since 1983, and the PAH-contaminated sediments were dredged from the lower river between 1989 and 1990. By 2004, sufficient improvement had been documented to change the status of this use impairment to In Recovery Phase.

Areas of Impairment in AOC: Main-stem, West Branch, French Creek. This Impairment was listed as Restored in the East Branch in 2005. For attainment of state water quality standards in warm-water rivers and streams, the ICI score must be 34 or more but allowing for an insignificant departure from the state's criteria would allow for an ICI score of 30 to be used as a BUI delisting target. Even with this significant departure allowance, it will be difficult for the Black River AOC to achieve this goal in and along the maintained shipping channel due to the depth of and the numerous modifications to the river for shipping, industrial, and urban needs. It is likely that the RAP Coordinating Committee will need to determine what specific level of quality is attainable in the lower main-stem, hence the numeric target for delisting the impairment for benthic macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, very little data are available for ICI in the main-stem and throughout the Black River AOC. Ohio EPA is looking to secure additional funding to allow for additional monitoring in the next couple of years. Remedial projects outlined in the Lower Black River Restoration Master Plan can help restore the benthic communities in the main-stem. Areas of Impairment in AOC: Low Dissolved Oxygen in Main-stem, Nuisance algae growths in Findley Lake. According to the RAP's Stage 1 Document, the Eutrophication or Undesirable Algae beneficial use was listed Impaired for the Black River AOC due to pronounced algal blooms in Findley and Brentwood Lakes. In 2009, the earthen dam at Brentwood Lake was removed, so the impairment only remains for Findley Lake, where surrounding agriculture and the ODNR WWTP at Findley Lake State Park contribute phosphorous and other nutrient loads to the lake. In the past, Ohio EPA recommended a phosphorous reduction for the treatment plant. Ohio EPA plans to resurvey Findley Lake in 2011, and the Black River RAP Coordinating Committee will re-evaluate the impairment at Findley Lake when the new data become available. The RAP's Stage 1 Report also stated that there is the potential for Eutrophication impairment in the lower main-stem and in some small slow-moving tributaries in the upper watershed. An earlier dissolved oxygen study for the main-stem revealed that while dissolved oxygen sags are evident in the lower main-stem, little can be done to improve the situation due to the maintained depth of the navigation channel. The flat topography of the upper watershed areas is the primary cause of the slow, almost stagnant flow regimes through much of the summer. A lack of riparian canopy exacerbates the condition by allowing sunlight to warm the slow-moving waters. This is likely no different than many non-AOC tributary systems located in primarily flat agricultural areas. The potential for restoration in the upper reaches of the watershed will have to be assessed by the RAP Coordinating Committee.  State of Ohio Delisting Target: General surface water quality meets applicable OAC water quality criteria and is free from the following: \uf0b7 Suspended solids of other substances that will settle to form putrescent or otherwise objectionable sludge deposits, or that will adversely affect aquatic life, \uf0b7 Floating debris, oil, scum and other floating material in amounts sufficient to be unsightly or cause degradation, \uf0b7 Materials producing color, odor, or other conditions in such a degree to create a nuisance, \uf0b7 Public health nuisances associated with raw or poorly-treated sewage. Areas of Impairment in AOC: Entire Black River watershed. The Degradation of Aesthetics use impairment is listed throughout the entire Black River AOC. Excessive loadings of sediment from upstream areas, failed or failing home sewage treatment systems, combined sewer overflows and trash still impact the water system. The Black River watershed contains 12 discharging Waste Water Treatment Plants and an estimated 19,300 Home Sewage Treatment Systems. Because not all HSTSs are working properly, some fail and discharge untreated effluent into the Black River and its tributaries. According to OAC 3745-1-04, both the Ohio EPA and local health departments have jurisdiction to address these problems as public health nuisances. The criteria to determine a nuisance is bacteria sampling, odor and color, and other visual manifestations. Several studies in the Black River watershed by the Lorain County General Health District have indicated \"critical areas\" in the watershed as non-sewered areas in close proximity to the cities of Lorain and Elyria in the Black River Main-stem, Lower West Branch, Jackson Ditch-East Branch, Willow Creek, and French Creek sub-watersheds. These areas have older homes with small lots, undersized systems of poor and aging design, poorly-drained soils, and include the communities of Carlisle Township, Elyria Township, Sheffield Village, Sheffield Township, and Eaton Township."}, {"section_title": "BUI 14: Loss of Fish Habitat", "text": "State of Ohio Delisting Target: For free-flowing segment of AOC, Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) scores must average greater than or equal to 60. For Lake Erie and lacustrine areas, Lacustuary Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (LQHEI) must average greater than or equal to 55. Areas of Impairment in AOC: Entire Black River watershed. For Fish Habitat assessments, the RAP Coordinating Committee relies upon the Lacustuary Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (LQHEI) for Lake Erie, Lake Erie nearshore and lacustuarine areas and the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) for free-flowing areas of the AOC. Although not formally adopted by Ohio EPA, the LQHEI index is useful in assessing fish habitat conditions along the Lake Erie shoreline and in the lower stretches of river that drain to the lake. Both habitat methodologies are intended to provide a qualitative evaluation of the physical characteristics for amount and quality of fish habitat in a given stream reach and Lake Erie shoreline. Both methods are composed of six metrics which take into account variables such as substrate, cover, morphology, riparian cover and erosion, aquatic vegetation and other modifications. The maximum score for each method is 100. Most of the downstream areas of the lower Black River AOC have hard-armored or sheet-piled river banks which do not provide sufficient fish habitat and do not score well using LQHEI. In the lower Black River, the City of Lorain's Black River Restoration Project is helping to restore and protect aquatic and near-shore habitats. As part of the process, new LQHEI values were obtained for the lower six miles of the main-stem. The average LQHEI for the lower river study area is 39.4. In the upstream areas of the AOC, the unprecedented degree of recent development in the French Creek, Jackson Ditch-East Branch, Lower West Branch, and Willow Creek sub-watersheds, a lack of quality riparian habitat throughout the entire watershed and agricultural land use practices in the upper reaches of the watershed have led to eroding stream banks, excessive sediment loads, and a smothering of aquatic habitat. Data available from Ohio EPA have not been inclusive of all segments in a tributary sub-watershed, and new habitat studies need to be conducted before the RAP Coordinating Committee is able to delist fish habitat in the AOC. Ohio EPA is seeking funds to conduct these habitat evaluation studies. What data exists is old, but indicates that the Black River may be nearing attainment in certain areas: Some of the data in the table above is beyond the 5-year time limit for the state's Credible Data Bill, so its use in determining an accurate current state of fish habitat in the upper watersheds should be suspect and cannot be used in a formal delisting application to Ohio EPA and US EPA. However, the data can be used to show how close fish habitats in the upper watersheds may be to the delisting target value.

It should be noted that the successful implementation of this strategy is also expected to result in achievement of other goals that have been identified for the watershed, including de-listing of the majority, if not all, of the beneficial use impairments in the Area of Concern (AOC).

Riparian Setbacks/Buffers", "text": "The establishment and preservation of riparian buffers and setbacks are identified within the TMDL Report as a primary strategy to combat multiple impairments in the watershed. In addition, AOC delisting guidelines for the Loss of Wildlife Habitat BUI require the establishment of forested stream buffers. Riparian setbacks are a product of zoning codes established by communities. Such codes require the avoidance and preservation of riparian zones along streams in connection with development projects. Riparian buffers are often referred to as filter strips. Riparian buffers are simply riparian zones that are allowed to remain in a natural condition either through the use of a protective instrument (e.g., conservation easement or environmental covenant) or simply by omitting agricultural or developmental activities in those areas. Riparian setbacks/buffers serve multiple functions, namely the following: 1. Filtering of sediment, nutrients, and bacteria from overland runoff. 2. Shading of streams, lowering average temperatures and reducing algal growth, thereby reducing low dissolved oxygen problems. 3. Providing food and habitat for upland and aquatic wildlife. 4. Reducing streambank erosion, lowering sediment loads and improving in-stream habitat. The implementation of riparian setback codes in all communities and establishment of riparian buffers is critical to the successful implementation of this strategy. Within agricultural areas, riparian buffers should be encouraged through the use of NRCS cost-share programs, on a volunteer basis, and through other grant programs. A tool should be developed to assist with determining setback/buffer widths within the watershed. This tool could involve the creation of a graphic that shows theoretical setback/buffer widths for all streams in the watershed based on watershed area. This graphic would eliminate the need for watershed calculations on a case-by-case basis, could be automated using GIS software, and could be made available in both hard-copy format and on the internet. "}, {"section_title": "B. Stream, Wetland, and Floodplain Restoration", "text": "Stream erosion was identified as a primary contributor of sediments and nutrients in the TMDL Report. The restoration and stabilization of highly eroding stream segments will be an important component of the implementation strategy for achieving restoration goals. Several opportunities for grant funds are available for stream and wetland restoration projects in Ohio and the Lake Erie basin. Consequently, with landowner cooperation, this implementation measure has good potential for making progress on several identified impairments in the Black River watershed. The nature of restoration projects also typically involves the establishment or preservation of riparian corridors and associated wetlands and floodplains. A conservative estimate of eroding streams in the Black River watershed (by 12-digit HUC) is located in Section III.G.8 (Table 23). Channelization, culverting, and other hydromodifications to stream channels have also resulted in degradation to water quality and habitat within stream channels. In the northern, more urban portions of the watershed, the hydromodifications are primarily a result of development. In the southern, more agricultural subwatersheds, hydromodifications are primarily caused by agricultural drainage improvement projects (i.e., stream channelization) and lack of forested buffers. These modified channels likely overlap with the eroding channels identified in Section III.G.8 in many locations; however, there are also many instances where hydromodifications are impairing stream quality apart from stream erosion. A comprehensive inventory of stream erosion problems and potential restoration sites is not currently available in the Black River watershed. Until such an inventory is completed, restoration projects must be evaluated and prioritized as they become known. A comprehensive inventory of severe streambank erosion and development an inventory of potential stream, wetland, and floodplain restoration projects should be completed. This inventory will also inform and support the identification of potential preservation projects (Section VI.E). The removal of low-head dams and other impoundments is also needed. Dams convert flowing stream habitat into lake-like habitat, which limits populations of aquatic life. The first step in addressing dams and impoundments is the completion of an in-depth evaluation of existing dams and their potential for removal. The dam inventory/evaluation should be completed and include recommendations for additional steps necessary for removal of specific dams. Within the Black River mainstem, historical dredging activities have resulted in the loss of aquatic vegetation and in-stream habitat. Restoration efforts should focus on the removal of hydromodifications, restoration of riparian and aquatic habitat, removal of bulkheads, and repair of areas with high erosion rates."}, {"section_title": "C. Home Sewage Treatment System (HSTS) Removal or Repair", "text": "Home sewage treatment systems (HSTSs) are used to treat sanitary sewage in areas where no municipal treatment facilities exist. HSTSs can impact water quality through both point and non-point discharges from failed, faulty, or discharging systems and improper disposal of wastes from septic systems. While the majority of HSTSs are located in the rural and agricultural areas of the upper East and West Branches, some of the oldest HSTSs are located in the developed areas of the Jackson Ditch-East Branch (041100010404), Black River (041100010602) and French Creek (041100010601) sub-watersheds. The TMDL Report identifies the removal or repair of failing home sewage treatment systems as one of the four primary management options required to restore water quality in the Black River watershed. As described in Section III.J.2, a fair amount of work has been done in many areas of the watershed to identify, map, and assess HSTSs. However, failing HSTSs continue to contribute heavily to water quality standard exceedances for bacteria and nutrients. Older, non-sewered residential areas in close proximity to the cities of Lorain and Elyria contain homes that are on small lots with undersized and aging systems, many of which are presumed to be failing. Implementation actions listed in the Black River TMDL to address these sources of pollution include elimination of onsite septic systems through extension of municipal sanitary sewers, public education on home sewage treatment system maintenance, oversight of septic tank waste haulers, and identification and repair of faulty septic systems. Many homeowners are unaware of the operation and required maintenance of their HSTS system. With funding from Ohio EPA, the Black River RAP and the Lorain County General Health District developed an educational DVD that 1) explains the operation of a household HSTS; 2) outlines the need for routine inspection and maintenance of household treatment systems; and 3) describes how a HSTS owner can recognize when a system is not functioning properly. The DVD will be provided to each HSTS owner in Lorain County at the time of inspection. County and local health departments are encouraged to use this DVD as an educational tool and expand the routine inspection and maintenance programs for HSTSs and Semi-Public systems. The Lorain County General Health District is developing a database program that enables them to better regulate routine pumping of HSTSs. The database will be used to keep track of pumping dates, and queries will be run to determine which systems are due to be pumped. A reminder notice, as well as a pumping fact sheet and list of registered pumpers, will be mailed directly to the homeowner. In order to prevent an overload on pumpers, homeowners in two or three townships will be notified at a time (on a rotating monthly basis). Because the need exists for the development of statewide regulations for Semi-Public systems, the need for proper placement of these systems is crucial to the success of compliance with the Coastal Non-Point Management Plan and for the integrity of the Black River watershed. The creation of the regulations will allow for those standards to be recognized, discussed, and properly integrated into the adoption of new regulations. "}, {"section_title": "D. Point Source Controls", "text": "Enforcement of point source discharges falls under the jurisdiction of the Ohio EPA.

Consequently, the enforcement of state water quality standards relating to point source discharges in the watershed will be important for the achievement of short-and long-term goals described herein. The regulation of pollutant loadings and elimination of combined sewer overflows are the two most important components of this management practice. Pollutant loadings from point discharges should be reduced, which traditionally involves upgrades to treatment and pre-treatment facilities and the elimination of illicit discharges. The TMDL Report describes, in detail, the loadings that originate from each point discharge in the watershed. In order to ascertain any necessary revisions to point source discharge permit conditions, a detailed assessment should be made of existing NPDES permit-holders on a 12-digit subwatershed basis. This information should then be utilized by Ohio EPA to make management decisions regarding permit conditions going forward. A summary of point source discharges located in the watershed is included in Section III. The elimination of the twenty-six CSOs in Elyria will involve the separation of sanitary sewers from stormwater infrastructure.

Preservation should also focus on areas that have been identified as highly erodible (see Section III.J.5) in order to direct development towards less erodible soils. The preservation of existing natural areas is important to limit the impacts of future development and human use. Land use data, projected landowner cooperation, and existing preserves were taken into account to develop preservation goals for each 12-digit HUC (Section V). Existing preserves were calculated from data provided by the Western Reserve Land Conservancy, the Ohio Department of Natural Areas and Preserves, local park districts, and other property/easement holders.

Storm Water Management/Green Infrastructure", "text": "Within urbanized areas of the watershed (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: Map 26), urban storm water runoff is a significant source of non-point source pollution, according to the TMDL Report. The implementation and enforcement of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Storm Water Program, particularly for municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) communities, has and will continue to provide advancements on this front. MS4 communities are required to develop comprehensive storm water programs that address six minimum control measures, or MCMs. Public education and outreach, public involvement, illicit discharge elimination, regulation of construction site storm water runoff, regulation of post-construction storm water, and pollution prevention/good housekeeping for municipal operations are all required by the MCMs. Goals and requirements of the Phase II stormwater permits are duplicated as implementation actions in this plan. See Section V and Appendix F for details. Stormwater retrofits, particularly within older developments, should be evaluated and implemented. The first step in this process is the development of an assessment of potential retrofit sites. This assessment should include an inventory, assessment, and prioritization of potential retrofits within each urbanized subwatershed. Once this assessment has been completed, the process can move forward into public participation, design, permitting, and implementation. Upon completion of stormwater retrofit assessments, Appendix F will be updated by the BRWP to include the recommendations of the assessment report. As part of their comprehensive storm water programs, many communities are implementing a storm water utility. These programs collect fees from storm water dischargers and often offer credits to those dischargers that implement measures to reduce storm water runoff. According to Ohio EPA, Lorain County and all incorporated jurisdictions within Lorain County are currently assessing dischargers to fund their storm water utilities. Such programs often encourage the use of best management practices and also create a funding source for additional projects. Communities that are implementing a storm water utility or considering one should consider developing a credit structure for BMPs that reduce storm water runoff and/or improve storm water quality. Furthermore, such communities should consider utilizing assessment fees to implement additional projects of this nature. Specifically, project types that should be considered for a credit structure or implementation should be in line with those outlined in the implementation section of this report. Other stormwater BMPs should also be considered, such as detention/infiltration practices (permeable/pervious pavement, basins, rain gardens, infiltration trenches), erosion control measures (slope stabilization, filter strips), and other green infrastructure (green roofs, LEED accreditations, rain barrels, beneficial re-use). Additional crediting/evaluation considerations for certain project types are needed. This is especially the case for projects within agricultural areas that must meet the dual purpose of maintaining adequate drainage while providing habitat and water quality improvements. Some examples are highlighted below: Ditch Maintenance/Drainage Improvements -Should provide additional credit for over-wide or twostage designs. Should also provide additional credit for development of in-stream habitat features (e.g., riffle-pool complexes, boulders, rootwad revetments). Log Jam/Debris Removal -Should provide additional credit for utilizing woody debris by incorporating it into streambank stabilization projects. Streambank Stabilization -Should provide additional credit for projects that utilize natural bank stabilization or bio-engineering techniques. Should discourage the use of \"hard armoring\" or riprap and encourage the use of techniques that utilize natural materials and/or incorporate the re-vegetation of banks. Riparian Setbacks/Buffers -Should provide additional credit for projects that meet the widths specified in Section IV.A or as otherwise required by riparian setback codes."}, {"section_title": "G.

Lorain County has a Comprehensive Land Use Plan and an Environmental Strategy Plan that both detail the need for protection of sensitive environmental resources; however, the plans exist only as guidance documents and there are no specific implementations described within them. Therefore, the Black River Watershed Action Plan will fill the role and function of identifying criteria needed to assist in bringing the watershed into attainment, along with Coastal Non-Point Management Measures. To accomplish the goals of this measure, the Black River watershed partners will utilize several strategies to protect critical areas to maintain water quality in the Black River and its tributaries and work with local communities to guide development in a way that is ecologically and economically sustainable. The Black River Watershed Action Plan addresses this measure through a combination of action items. Implementation Management Practice E (Preservation of Natural Areas) supports the objective of preserving sensitive areas by public acquisition or by protection through the use of conservation easements. Implementation Practice A (Riparian Setbacks) uses setback codes to protect existing vegetated riparian corridors and wetlands. It also encourages the use of conservation development concepts to minimize disturbance of natural areas and limits stream crossings by roads and utility lines. Goals described for each 12-digit HUC call for the adoption or updating of local codes within townships and communities to control stormwater, minimize erosion/sedimentation, and to restore and protect riparian areas and floodplains. The Black River Watershed Action Plan also supports the compliance and enforcement of applicable stormwater regulations, including those requirements in the \"Rainwater and Land Development Manual\" and standards adopted by the state for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). This management measure will be difficult to implement due to the amount of education needed at the local level. Most communities look to increase their tax base quickly and meet EPA pre-and postconstruction requirements at a minimum. In addition, the siting of development for tactical, marketing, or convenience purposes often supersedes most reasons to not develop at a site where sensitive natural resources are located. Additionally, regulations at the state level do not mandate that a percentage of impervious surface be reduced so long as retention and containment requirements are addressed. An aggressive education effort on the part of the Black River watershed partners through organizations such as Lorain County PIPE to market the principles in the Black River Watershed Action Plan and other documents created to minimize land disturbance and protect watersheds will be necessary to legitimize their information and goals. The primary mechanism for controlling storm water, erosion and sediment control and impacts on aquatic resources during development are local development codes. Black River watershed partners such as Lorain County Community Development will work with member communities and local partners for communities to adopt best local land use practices. These practices are listed below: Model zoning regulations for the above codes that provide protection of existing resources while developing have been outlined by organizations like NOACA and Chagrin River Watershed Partners and will be used as guidance. Lorain County Community Development, specifically the Lorain County Planning Commission, will assist local communities and the Lorain and Medina SWCDs for adoption and implementation of these codes. In addition, protection of the natural drainageways can be accomplished through conservation easements. These easements should be prioritized for areas next to streams on the natural floodplain and kept in perpetuity. The easement should be held by the relevant SWCD, Western Reserve Land Conservancy, Black River watershed partners, or local community. This measure is also outlined in the Coastal Watershed Protection Measure. Increased impervious surfaces are a direct result of standard development practices. Reducing the input of storm water into the system by implementing the Black River Watershed Action Plan BMP suggestions is an effective strategy to lessen the volume of water flowing off the site of a development site or other impervious surface. This Plan advocates the use of bio-filtration through the use of detention ponds and wetlands, rain gardens, bio-swales, pervious pavement, green roofs, and unrestricted access to floodplains. Additionally, both NOACA and the Chagrin River Watershed Partners have draft Post-Construction Management Practice codes which would serve the Black River watershed well. ("}, {"section_title": "5.6.1) New On-Site Disposal Systems", "text": "The purpose of this management measure is to protect the Black River watershed from pollutants discharged by new on-site disposal systems. OSDS refers to both home sewage treatment systems (HSTS) as well as Semi-Public systems like package plants. The Lorain County General Health District and other relevant health departments in the watershed already incorporate regulations that require new systems to consider local soil conditions, lot size, and the design and type of system. Local health departments annually perform illicit discharge locating by point source tracking to find the locations of failing systems, sewer connections, and other pollutant-laden discharges. Adoption of statewide standards for OSDS would greatly assist to standardize the development of new on-site systems in the Black River watershed. The Black River watershed partners will continue to coordinate with local community engineers, Medina County Health Department, local health departments, LCGHD, and Ohio EPA on the location and management of any new disposal systems, as well as assist in educating communities about the need for keeping OSDSs maintained and functioning properly. For current Ohio sewage treatment systems laws and rules, see here: http://www.odh.ohio.gov/odhprograms/eh/sewage/sewrules.aspx Currently, no regulations regarding Semi-Public treatment systems exist in Ohio. The Ohio EPA acts as the regulator and reviews system design, placement, discharge, and capacity. The EPA will contract with county health departments to inspect these systems and will receive notification from the local health agencies if these systems are non-compliant. Because the need exists for the development of statewide regulations for Semi-Public systems, the need for proper placement of these systems is crucial to the success of compliance with the Coastal Non-Point Management Plan and for the integrity of the Black River watershed. The creation of the regulations will allow for those standards to be recognized, discussed, and properly integrated into the adoption of new regulations. Protective setbacks for the implementation of on-site waste disposal can provide additional protection to the stream. No watershed community has adopted specific codes or regulations that require disposal systems to have additional setback lengths from streams, rivers, or creeks. The Black River watershed partners will assist communities and the State of Ohio in developing language for the regulation and installation of disposal systems. Using NPDES setback regulations as the template, new Semi-Public setback requirements can be justified and implemented into the process. Local health departments should review changes mandated by the new HSTS rules (effective September 2010) and future rules (to become effective after January 1, 2012). County programs should be developed to meet CMMs and new rules established to position Counties for funding opportunities. Regular inspection programs should be continued within each County (3-5 years unless complaintdriven) for HSTS and expanded upon as funding becomes available to do so. Existing GIS-based databases and inventories of existing HSTS within each county should be expanded and consolidated. Finally, outreach and education efforts to inform homeowners of maintenance requirements (including methods, costs, etc.) for HSTS should be continued. (5.6.2) Operating On-Site Disposal Systems Black River watershed partners will continue to work with relevant health departments to develop and implement HSTS plans, point of sale, and other inspection programs to identify problem systems and repair or replace these systems. In the developing areas of Lorain County such as Eaton and Carlisle Township, existing systems are being eliminated through the expansion of sanitary sewer projects such as those being completed by LORCO. Phase II communities such as, but not limited to, Lorain, Elyria, Avon, and North Ridgeville are also working to eliminate HSTS within their community boundaries. As with new onsite disposal systems, new statewide regulations and standards would be beneficial in the Black River watershed. Policies and systems to ensure that existing OSDSs are operated and maintained to prevent the discharge of pollutants to both ground and surface waters to the greatest extent practicable should be established. Where necessary to meet these objectives, encourage the reduced use of garbage disposals, encourage the use of low-volume plumbing fixtures, and reduce total phosphorous loadings to the OSDS by 15% if the use of low-level phosphate detergents has not been required or widely adopted by OSDS users. OSDSs should be inspected at a frequency to ascertain whether or not they are failing, and Semi-Public OSDSs should consider retrofitting or upgrading so that total nitrogen loadings in the effluent are reduced by 50%. This provision would apply only if: \uf0b7 Conditions indicate that nitrogen-limited surface waters may be adversely affected by significant ground water nitrogen loadings from the Semi-Public, and \uf0b7 Where nitrogen loadings from OSDS are delivered to ground water that is hydrologically connected to surface water. As previously stated, eighteen communities within the Black River watershed fall under Phase II and are required to have a review of any known illicit discharges from the EPA and local health departments. Some communities will include a review of these known illicit discharges in their annual storm water reports to the EPA. The removal of OSDS is the only long-term solution to reducing bacterial and nutrient loading to the Black River and its tributaries. As stated in the watershed inventory, there are an estimated 19,300 HSTSs throughout the Black River watershed. Local utility projects such as LORCO are currently working to extend sanitary lines and reduce the amount of systems in the watershed. In addition, local health and engineering departments monitor streams and storm sewer lines for potential illicit discharges and will further perform source tracking to locate the source of the discharge. Local health departments employ registered sanitarians to inspect HSTSs and OSDS for proper functioning and performance. Often effluent discharge from failing or questioned systems will be sampled to determine if elevated bacteria levels are entering waters of the state. Additionally, local health departments and the Black River watershed partners will work with communities to educate the residents about watershed integrity through Lorain County PIPE workshops, oral presentations to various city and township councils, and literature distribution. Local health departments should review changes mandated by the new HSTS rules (effective September 2010) and future rules (to become effective after January 1, 2012). County programs should be developed to meet CMMs and new rules established to position Counties for funding opportunities. Regular inspection programs should be continued within each County (3-5 years unless complaintdriven) for HSTS and expanded upon as funding becomes available to do so. Existing GIS-based databases and inventories of existing HSTS within each county should be expanded and consolidated. Finally, outreach and education efforts to inform homeowners of maintenance requirements (including methods, costs, etc.) for HSTS should be continued. (5.8.1) Planning, Siting, and Developing Roads and Highways (Local Only) All watershed communities require that erosion and sediment control assurances are taken to reduce the sedimentation impacts from earth disturbances associated with these activities. No specific code, regulation, or requirement exists at the local level for projects less than one acre. Management goals for this measure would be: \uf0b7 Protect areas that provide important water quality benefits or are particularly susceptible to erosion or sediment loss; \uf0b7 Limit land disturbance such as clearing and grading and cut and fill to reduce erosion and sediment loss; and \uf0b7 Limit disturbance of natural drainage features and vegetation. All watershed communities currently have codes in place to control sediment and erosion (local or County-enacted); additionally, other agencies such as ODOT have their own. Some of these regulations are part of the State mandated EPA Phase II storm water program which requires all State, County, and municipalities to have measures in place to control illicit discharges and sedimentation. All construction of over one acre is required to follow the erosion and sediment control plan from the community or sponsoring agency. This includes new road and bridge development, residential home construction sites, capital improvement sites, commercial and industrial development, or any other construction activity within the community boundary. As stated within the plan, the Black River experiences significant sedimentation loading from stream scouring and development. Proper management of construction sites and the local enforcement of the codes and resolutions can assist in the reduction of unnecessary sediment entering the system. Black River watershed partners, with the assistance of Lorain County Community Development, will work to identify watershed locations where mitigation from disturbing a resource can be kept within the watershed, such as Elmwood Preserve in the City of Lorain, or the Wellington Reservation. Additionally, the Black River watershed partners will work with communities to educate them about the importance of wetlands and keeping streams in a natural state and encourage integrating them as such into any road, bridge, or capital improvement site design. All watershed communities have regulations to ensure that proper development practices and design are implemented on any new and existing roadway construction project. Consideration of future roadway development using BMPs such as installation of exfiltration trenches (for a case study of exfiltration trenches go here: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/ultraurb/5mcs1.htm) could provide assistance to reducing impervious surfaces and mitigating storm water runoff. County and municipality use of the Ohio Department of Transportation's Handbook for Erosion and Sediment Control is also encouraged. The handbook can be found at the link below: http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/ConstructionMgt/Admin/Manuals/Erosion%20Control.pdf The goal of this measure is to site, design, and maintain bridge structures so that sensitive and valuable aquatic ecosystems and areas providing important water quality benefits are protected from adverse effects. ODOT, County, and local municipalities all have procedures that utilize erosion and sediment control activity. These entities are also encouraged to consult the Ohio Department of Transportation's most current Handbook for Erosion and Sediment Control, Bridge Design Manual, Bridge Maintenance Manual, and Preventative Maintenance Repair Guidelines. The Black River watershed partners will work with communities to monitor the plans and to help ensure proper maintenance. Proper management of storm water near sensitive aquatic systems is crucial to the long term integrity of the resource being threatened. Additionally, site design and the implementation of BMPs will help ensure that proper precautions taken. Enforcement of those regulations is vital to protecting the Black River and its tributaries. Because bridge repair work or construction activities are directly over water, special care is important to minimizing the stream impact."}, {"section_title": "Hydromodification Protection Measures", "text": "The northern sections of the Black River watershed have been developed for over 100 years. Standard development practices and the addition of large-scale impervious cover across the French Creek, Black River, and Heider Ditch-Frontal Lake Erie HUCs have permanently altered these stretches of the watershed. The result has been intense channelization of the Black River and its tributaries, stream bank destabilization, loss of habitat, drastic increases in sedimentation, and frequent flooding. The southern parts of the watershed are predominantly rural and most streams are natural unless cleaned out to facilitate drainage from cropland."}, {"section_title": "(7.4.1) Channelization and Channel Modification -Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Surface Waters", "text": "The purpose of this management measure is to ensure that the planning process for new hydromodification projects address changes to physical and chemical characteristics of surface waters that may occur as a result of the proposed work. Implementation of this management measure is intended to occur concurrently with the implementation of Management Measure 7.4.2 (In-stream and Riparian Habitat Restoration) of this section. For existing projects, the purpose of this management measure is to ensure that the operation and maintenance program uses any opportunities available to improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the surface waters. Changes created by channelization and channel modification activities are problematic if they unexpectedly alter environmental parameters to levels outside normal or desired ranges. The physical and chemical characteristics of surface waters that may be influenced by channelization and channel modification include sediment, turbidity, salinity, temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, oxygen demand, and contaminants. Implementation of this management measure in the planning process will require the following goals to be met: \uf0b7 Evaluate the potential effects of proposed channelization and channel modification on the physical and chemical characteristics of surface waters in coastal areas; \uf0b7 Plan and design channelization and channel modification to reduce undesirable impacts; and \uf0b7 Develop an operation and maintenance program for existing modified channels that includes identification and implementation of opportunities to improve physical and chemical characteristics of surface waters in those channels. Implementation of the management practices identified in Section VI will work towards achievement of the goals for this management measure. Specifically, riparian setbacks, stream restoration, preservation of natural areas, storm water management practices, and agricultural best management practices will minimize the effects of previous channelization activities and proposed channel modifications. Local stormwater utilities implemented by Lorain County and other jurisdictions should provide additional credit and/or consideration for projects that incorporate the management practices discussed in Section VI. The final Black River Watershed Non-Point Source Pollution Control Program Plans list the endorsement of a watershed action plan as the primary action item to address this management measure. Endorsement of this plan will fulfill that recommendation. Furthermore, the collection of Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) data for the watershed was prescribed. In 2012, Ohio EPA will be conducting a comprehensive monitoring program within the watershed which will include IBI and QHEI data, among other metrics."}, {"section_title": "(7.4.2) Channelization and Channel Modification -In-stream and Riparian Habitat Restoration", "text": "The purpose of this management measure is to correct or prevent detrimental changes to in-stream and riparian habitat from the impacts of channelization and channel modification projects. Implementation of this management measure is intended to complement the implementation of Management Measure 7.4.1 (Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Surface Waters) of this section. Contact between floodwaters and overbank soil and vegetation can be increased by a combination of setback levees and use of compound-channel designs. Setback levees, meaning levees set back away from the stream bank, can be constructed to allow for over-bank flooding, which provides surface water contact to important streamside areas (including wetlands and riparian areas). Additionally, setback levees still function to protect adjacent property from flood damage. Compound ditch designs consist of an incised, narrow channel to carry surface water during low (base)-flow periods, a staged overbank area into which the flow can expand during design flow events, and an extended overbank area, sometimes with meanders, for high-flow events. Planting of the extended over-bank with suitable vegetation completes the design. Preservation of ecosystem benefits can be achieved by site-specific design to obtain pre-defined optimum or existing ranges of physical environmental conditions. Mathematical models can be used to assist in site-specific design. In-stream and riparian habitat alterations caused by secondary effects can be evaluated by the use of models and other decision aids in the design process of a channelization and channel modification activity. After using models to evaluate secondary effects, restoration programs can be established. The Lorain County Engineers currently maintain 40 miles of ditches along with Lorain SWCD. These ditches should be evaluated to determine if implementation of practices like setback levees or compound-channel designs are feasible. Future ditch maintenance projects petitioned through the SWCD or the County should be conducted in collaboration with an appropriate committee of the Black River watershed partners to provide technical assistance to protect the water quality of the watershed. These types of projects that incorporate compound, over-wide, or two-stage ditch designs should be given additional credit and/or consideration through the Lorain County and other storm water utilities. The final Black River Watershed Non-Point Source Pollution Control Program Plans list the endorsement of a watershed action plan as the primary action item to address this management measure. Endorsement of this plan will fulfill that recommendation. Furthermore, the collection of Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) data for the watershed was prescribed. In 2012, Ohio EPA will be conducting a comprehensive monitoring program within the watershed which will include IBI and QHEI data, among other metrics. The purpose of this management measure is to protect the quality of surface waters and aquatic habitat in reservoirs and in the downstream portions of rivers and streams that are influenced by the quality of water contained in the releases (tailwaters) from reservoir impoundments. Impacts from the operation of dams to surface water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat should be assessed and the potential for improvement evaluated. Additionally, new upstream and downstream impacts to surface water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat caused by the implementation of practices should also be considered in the assessment. The overall program approach is to evaluate a set of practices that can be applied individually or in combination to protect and improve surface water quality and aquatic habitat in reservoirs, as well as in areas downstream of dams. Then, the program should implement the most cost-effective operations to protect surface water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat and to improve the water quality and aquatic and riparian habitat where economically feasible. This management measure is intended to be applied to dam operations that result in the loss of desirable surface water quality, and of desirable instream and riparian habitat. Dams are defined as constructed impoundments which are either: \uf0b7 25 feet or more in height and greater than 15 acre-feet in capacity, or \uf0b7 6 feet or more in height and greater than 50 acre-feet in capacity. The Black River watershed contains nearly 165 dams; most are small lowhead dams or privately-owned. There are 23 publicly-owned dams which are referenced in the Watershed Inventory. In 2009, a dam which created Brentwood Lake in Carlisle Township was removed because of concerns that the dam would fail and flood out several nearby homes. Lorain County engineers oversaw the removal and drained the lake, eliminating the pronounced algal blooms present in the impoundment area (Brentwood Lake, along with Findley Lake, was listed as Impaired for Eutrophication or Undesirable Algae) and restoring the natural stream which had not been free-flowing since the 1950s. Dams cause significant adverse impacts to the ecology of rivers and streams by blocking migration of fish to upriver spawning habitat; warming water temperatures in impoundments well above downstream conditions and accumulating sediment, which degrades water quality and often buries high quality fisheries habitat. Dam removal, on the other hand, restores the natural flowing character of a stream and restores essential ecological processes in the river. Large segments of previously inaccessible water may be open to use by a variety of fish species. In addition, dam removal and sediment management can restore buried fish spawning habitat and other critical stream habitat. The effect of dams upon the water quality of the Black River and its tributaries has not been studied in any detail. Dams present within the watershed should be evaluated to determine current function and operational status. If the dam stands in disrepair, or is no longer operational, it should be targeted for removal and subsequent restoration of the site's natural hydrology. Black River watershed partners will continue to work with dam owners, County Engineers, local communities, and ODNR Dam Safety to evaluate and improve water quality near dams."}, {"section_title": "(7.6.1) Eroding Streambanks and Shorelines", "text": "There are no codes or resolutions that exist in the watershed that address streambank or shoreline erosion specifically. However, erosion has been identified as a significant problem in the Black River watershed by the Black River TMDL and significantly high levels of streambank erosion can be found in every 12-digit HUC within the watershed. Sub-watershed tributaries and headwater streams in particular are found to contribute substantial sediment loading due to poor stream bank stabilization and health. The Black River and its tributaries experience quickly changing stream flows during high precipitation events which causes stream channelization and stream bank destabilization. Anthropogenic impacts to the naturally highly erosive soils in the watershed exacerbate sedimentation rates significantly and need to be addressed. Tiled drainage in the southern portions of the watershed increases flow volume and velocity to the waterways, stressing them beyond their assimilative capacity and causing massive stream bank scouring and subsequent downstream sedimentation. Increased amounts of impervious cover in the northern portions of the watershed, particularly in the French Creek, Black River, and Heider Ditch-Frontal Lake Erie sub-watersheds also contribute to channelization and stream bank destabilization. Where stream bank erosion is a non-point source pollution problem, stream banks and shorelines should be stabilized. Methods that incorporate bio-engineering and vegetative techniques are strongly preferred, unless structural methods are more cost-effective considering the severity of shear stresses, erosion, and the potential adverse impact on other stream banks. Some communities within the Black River watershed have or are actively trying to enact stream bank setback codes and resolutions. These regulations assist in allowing the stream access to its floodplain and provide protection of the resource by establishing a buffer area to assimilate and mitigate surface runoff. Local land conservancies, such as the Western Reserve Land Conservancy, and SWCDs have easement programs available for community use. Section VI of the Black River Watershed Action Plan discusses stream restoration and bank stabilization in more detail. Community participation, code and resolution adoption and enforcement, and education of the local decision makers will be crucial to restoring the stream integrity of the Black River and its tributaries. $50,000 for the creation and development of each WAP. $15,000 per year for staff time to implement WAP's, $5,000 per year for outreach materials and education."}, {"section_title": "-2022", "text": "Target subwatersheds. "}, {"section_title": "VIII. Evaluation", "text": "The ultimate goal of the Black River Watershed Action Plan is to move non-attaining segments into attainment through the implementation of this plan by the watershed coordinator and the team of community stakeholders in the watershed group who together own this plan. An evaluation process is essential for determining the effectiveness of the plan implementation so that strategies can be improved upon, tasks that are shown to be more effective can be implemented more broadly, work that is shown to be ineffective can either be improved upon or jettisoned, and funding can be solicited based on quantifiable measures. The watershed restoration and protection goals described earlier in this document have been prioritized according to their impacts on water quality, habitat improvement, and other indicators, all of which have quantifiable objectives. Monitoring of stream quality is conducted by the Ohio EPA and periodically by other organizations such as park districts and universities. This data will be reviewed periodically during the implementation phase to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan. Similarly, this plan also includes a strategy for community engagement, including the mobilizing of volunteers and the establishment of a watershed group who will provide guidance to the watershed coordinator and who will also be responsible for other tasks such as monitoring, data collection, and education and outreach. The watershed coordinator and the watershed group will together develop a regular and consistent evaluation process to track progress towards implementing the plan, attaining water quality standards, and engaging the public. While data will be tracked and shared with professional stakeholders including ODNR, Ohio EPA, the Soil and Water Conservation Districts, and the Black River RAP, this data will also be shared with the rest of the watershed citizenry through public meetings, on the Black River Watershed website, and through other means such as email and social media such as Facebook.
