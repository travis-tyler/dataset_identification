These large-scale, multicenter studies must have strict inclusion criteria to accurately identify and discriminate normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia and recruit the population of interest to facilitate internal and external validity. This, however, is no straightforward task. Although there have been great gains in the development of biomarkers for the accurate in vivo diagnosis and early detection of AD (e.g., lumbar puncture, positron emission tomography) [1] [2] [3] , these are invasive procedures typically conducted following initial screening methods. Instead, investigators in AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies often initially rely on brief cognitive screening tests to detect cognitive impairment and classify patients, using a variety of researchderived cut scores, as having normal cognition, MCI, or dementia. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [4] and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory (LM) test [5] are two screening measures commonly used to determine inclusion in these studies.\nThe use of the MMSE and LM in AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies to ascertain diagnostic status and determine inclusion may be methodologically problematic. Numerous studies have demonstrated the psychometric limitations of the MMSE, such as large ceiling and floor effects, and sensitivity to practice effects [6] [7] [8] .\nThe utility of the MMSE in detecting MCI and AD dementia is indeed limited [9] [10] [11] . Perneczky et al. [12] examined the correspondence between the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores and found the MMSE lacked accuracy in the identification of patients with MCI or mild AD dementia.\nScores on the delayed recall dimension of LM (LM-II) can also lack diagnostic utility when administered in isolation. LM-II is associated with significant learning biases [13] , and practice effects may undermine its detection of impairment, particularly among potential AD trial subjects who have had repeated exposure to LM. For example, LM has been administered annually to all participants in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs), as part of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS), for approximately 20 years [14] . The consortium of these centers is an important source of enrollment for AD clinical trials. The ability of the LM relative to other tests to accurately detect AD has also been questioned [15] , and healthy older adults frequently demonstrate impairments on LM retention [16] . Performance on LM may also be relatively more sensitive to executive dysfunction than episodic memory [17] .\nGiven the diagnostic and psychometric limitations of the MMSE and LM, many AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies in which these instruments are used to determine eligibility may be inappropriately including or excluding subjects. This could influence the reliability and validity of study outcomes due to sampling biases. The recent phase III bapineuzumab and solanezumab trials both included the MMSE as part of study entry criteria, and both failed to meet primary efficacy endpoints [18, 19] . (In fact, no new compounds for the treatment of AD have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2003.) Although research from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has been at the forefront of the development of diagnostic methods and biomarkers for AD, ADNI also relies on MMSE and LM scores to determine eligibility.\nThe extent to which MMSE and LM scores are being used as eligibility criteria in AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies is unclear, and no study has examined whether the cutoffs used in these studies accurately correspond to AD spectrum clinical diagnoses. The purpose of the present study was twofold: (1) to identify all active and recruiting phases II and III AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies in the United States to determine the extent to which the MMSE and LM are used as eligibility criteria and to identify the cutoff scores used to ascertain AD diagnostic category; and (2) to exploit the large NACC database to determine the correspondence between MMSE and LM cutoff scores used in current clinical trials and diagnostic studies and AD spectrum diagnoses made by multidisciplinary diagnostic conference teams. The MMSE is often used to determine dementia severity in clinical and research settings, and past work [12] suggests this may be problematic due to the weak correspondence between the MMSE and the CDR (the gold standard for rating dementia severity), particularly at the mild end of the disease spectrum. Therefore, in the present study we sought, as a secondary aim, to replicate and expand upon the previous smaller-scale study on the MMSE and CDR [12] by examining their correspondence in the large NACC dataset."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Search criteria", "text": "We first examined the extent to which the MMSE and LM are used in AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies, as well as the cutoff scores employed in these studies.

The NACC, established by the National Institute on Aging in 1999 to promote collaborative AD research, is a publicly accessible, longitudinal database of standardized clinical data gathered from 34 past and present ADCs across the United States. The regional ADCs are based in university medical centers, and recruitment is carried out via neurology referrals and community outreach.

Specifically, the CDR is standardized for multicenter use, has demonstrated good interrater reliability and criterion validity, and has been shown to predict neuropathology [26] . In fact, even without an informant, recent work in communitydwelling elderly shows the CDR exhibits strong internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.83-0.84) and good interrater reliability (0.95 for global rating) and test-retest reliability (\u03ba = 0.80 for global rating) [28] . The CDR assesses the extent of a person's impairment in six domains: memory, orientation, judgment/problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. An algorithm is used to create an overall rating of impairment severity: 0 (no dementia), 0.5 (questionable dementia), 1.0 (mild dementia), 2.0 (moderate dementia), or 3.0 (severe dementia).

The major multisite diagnostic study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI 2) (funded by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, and private sector contributions facilitated by the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health), was also found to use the MMSE. MMSE cutoffs ranging from 3-14 to >27, but \u226424 and/or \u226426 most commonly defined the clinical spectrum of AD. A majority of studies that use 26 primarily target subjects with MCI or mild AD dementia.\nSeven recruiting and active AD clinical trials use LM to determine eligibility, and five of the seven use both the MMSE and LM. All trials use the delayed recall score of LM (i.e., LM-II). Notable trials include the \"Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4 Study)\" and \"A Placebo-controlled, Doubleblind, Parallel-group, Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Design and Dose-Regimen-find Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of BAN2401 in Subjects with Early Alzheimer's Disease\" (sponsored by Eisai Inc.). There was inconsistency with the WMS version used: the BAN2401 uses WMS-IV, but other trials use the WMS-R or the WMS-III. ADNI 2 also uses LM-II (WMS-R) to determine study eligibility. ADNI 2 and the A4 and BAN2401 trials use both the LM-II and MMSE.\nRegarding LM-II cutoffs, the A4 trial uses 6-18 to define asymptomatic AD. The BAN2401 trial cutoffs are ageadjusted and include 50-64 years: \u226415; 65-69 years: \u226412; 70-74 years: \u226411; 75-79 years: \u22649; and 80-90 years \u22647.

MMSE and LM-II cutoffs used to determine eligibility were associated with a high probability of inaccurate diagnostic classification in the >23,000 NACC subjects with normal cognition, MCI, and AD dementia. In the NACC sample, the MMSE and LM-II cutoff scores lacked diagnostic accuracy for the identification of MCI, and LM-II cutoffs poorly distinguished AD dementia from MCI (AUC <0.75). It was the consistently low PPVs and NPVs for MMSE and LM-II cutoff scores across all diagnostic classifications that were most alarming, however. The PPV was only 64 % for the MMSE cutoff often used to define MCI (or early AD dementia) in AD trials and diagnostic studies. The PPVs and NPVs were remarkably low for LM-II cutoffs and spanned the entire AD spectrum, with many PPVs and NPVs below 50 %, and as low as 33 % and 42 %, respectively. Given NACC's large sample and representativeness of the target clinical trial population (NACC is an important recruitment source for AD trials), there is a strong possibility that many of the multicenter studies in which investigators are testing AD therapeutic and diagnostic methods include subjects from a nontarget population. Such inappropriate sampling could potentially lead to biased or inaccurate results. The psychometric limitations of the MMSE and LM (e.g., large ceiling and floor effects, learning biases) limit their diagnostic accuracy. The MMSE and LM are highly influenced by demographic factors (e.g., age, education) [11, [31] [32] [33] . Many patients with MCI and mild AD dementia can perform within the \"normal\" range, and cognitively intact individuals can frequently score within the impaired range (healthy older adults commonly exhibit impaired retention on the WMS) [16] . Subjects in AD trials and diagnostic studies are likely to have had repeated exposure to the MMSE and LM, given that they are among the most widely used measures in the clinical management of AD and are included in many research registries (e.g., NACC ADCs). Both instruments are sensitive to practice effects and subsequent inflated scores; in fact, past work has shown that subjects with MCI from ADNI demonstrated practice effects only for LM [34] . It is the psychometric weaknesses of the MMSE and LM-II that underpin their lack of utility as standalone diagnostic measures, and their isolated use to determine inclusion into AD trials and diagnostic studies could lead to inappropriate sampling and affect the validity and reliability of study results [18, 19] .\nThere was an overall lack of agreement between MMSE and CDR scores among NACC subjects. The CDR is considered the gold standard for staging dementia severity, and the MMSE appears to lack validity in detecting and discriminating across the various disease stages, particularly at the mild end of the spectrum [35] . This has significant economic, clinical, and research implications, given that clinical trials rely on the MMSE to distinguish between subjects with normal cognition, MCI, and AD dementia when determining inclusion. Moreover, national guidelines in parts of the world use the MMSE to define dementia severity to guide pharmacological intervention [36, 37] .\nThere is a need to improve upon current study inclusion methods for AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies. The continued use of existing brief, inexpensive methods for determining entry into AD trials may lead to inaccurate study findings, including failure to meet endpoints, because of inappropriate inclusion of subjects into the trials, rather than lack of efficacy of the compounds being studied. With the tremendous amount of time and financial resources devoted to the development of new and cutting edge AD therapeutics and diagnostic methods, it may be time to set aside this \"penny-wise and pound-foolish\" approach to the selection of screening and/or selection instruments and devote adequate time and resources to the development of rigorous new measures that may be expensive and time-consuming, but would increase the accurate detection of the appropriate population and do justice to the science at hand. This would require development of specific tests based on the specific goal of the screening, focusing on cognitive (or other) domains, with appropriate variability (diminished floor and ceiling effects), extensive normative and clinical data, and attention to cultural and language differences. Alternatively, there are existing instruments and methodology that could be implemented that may facilitate appropriate enrollment. For example, a recent study in ADNI found optimal diagnostic certainty of MCI included <1 standard deviation below normative reference on two episodic memory measures (LM-II and Auditory Verbal Learning Test delay recall) [38] . If AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies continue to rely on single screening measures due to their time-and cost-effectiveness, it is encouraged that more stringent criterion cutoffs be used [39] and the methodology employed in this paper be used (i.e., calculation of PPV, NPV) to identify the best cutoffs for accurate diagnostic classification using existing measures. However, instead of relying on the MMSE, more comprehensive screening tools, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), may be helpful. The MoCA has been shown to demonstrate greater predictive ability of dementia and have lower ceiling effects than the MMSE [40, 41] . In sum, the specific solution for optimizing inclusion methods for AD trials is unclear, but alternatives need to be considered, including the possibility of abandoning current practice and developing new methods. The present study is not without limitations. The generalizability of the PPVs and NPVs is restricted to the NACC sample, a convenience research sample. However, this concern is attenuated, given that many clinical trials and diagnostic studies recruit from NACC sites. The cross-sectional data may have precluded robust diagnostic status within the NACC sample. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the limitations of the MMSE and LM across diagnostic severity groups, including their sensitivity to change and the role of practice effects, particularly in the context of recent work from the NACC dataset that shows most pronounced practice effects over time (relative to other measures from the UDS) on tasks of semantic and episodic memory [42] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The use of MMSE and LM-II scores to determine eligibility for AD clinical trials and diagnostic studies may lead to inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of subjects.
