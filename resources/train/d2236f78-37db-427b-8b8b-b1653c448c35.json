Shallow systems are particularly vulnerable to increases in watershed nutrient loads due to their position at the interface between land and open water. The prevailing conceptual model of eutrophication for shallow systems currently describes a succession in the dominant autotroph from seagrass to macroalgae to phytoplankton, but this model does not include benthic microalgae, which can sequester nutrients in photic systems. The Virginia Eastern Shore is characterized by shallow lagoons connected to upland watersheds through small tidal creeks, where the main source of fresh water and nutrients is groundwater. While some studies have characterized the response of the lagoons to nutrient loads, little is known about the tidal creeks and whether they act as filters, transformers, or conduits for land-based nutrients. We examined the role tidal creeks play in modulating watershed nutrient inputs in the Great Machipongo River (GMR) system, the largest tidal creek complex on the seaside of the Virginia Eastern Shore. We developed a field monitoring program that provided data to calibrate a reduced complexity Estuarine Ecosystem Model (EEM). Production, respiration, and net ecosystem metabolism were quantified, using both the open water and component methods, seasonally at three sites within this system. These rates together with monthly concentrations of standing stock nutrients and water column chlorophyll, monthly DataFlow surveys of physiochemical parameters, seasonally and spatially-intensive benthic chlorophyll surveys, and a bathymetric survey were used to develop and calibrate the EEM. The model was used to assess the degree to which tidal creeks export (via flushing), remove (via denitrification), or transform (via autotrophic uptake) land-based nutrient loads to the adjacent lagoons during baseflow and storm conditions. Component metabolism studies showed the system was overall net autotrophic, with increasing dominance of benthic processes towards the head of the estuary. Open water metabolism studies suggested the system was overall net heterotrophic, but we believe this conclusion is biased by the surrounding marshes and violations of the constant water mass assumption. The creek system exported 61,476 kg N y-1 as phytoplankton biomass, an amount approximately equal to inputs from the watershed and atmosphere, and imported 172,830 kg N y-1 in dissolved inorganic forms for a net import of 111,354 kg N y-1 from Hog Island Bay. Phytoplankton uptake, benthic microalgal uptake, and denitrification accounted for 216%, 343%, and 38% of the annual input of watershed and atmospheric N to the system, indicative of rapid cycling and advection of nutrients from Hog Island Bay. The storm simulation showed that almost all of the additional 28,635 kg N y-1 added from the watershed was flushed to Hog Island Bay and a small portion was denitrified. This study indicates that GMR system function is dominated by benthic processes, and the system acts as a transformer and filter of landbased nutrients during normal conditions and a conduit of nutrients during storm conditions."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "I. Eutrophication in Coastal Systems", "text": "Human influence on the coastal zone has become a worldwide issue. Inherent in the functioning of temperate marine systems is a limitation of autotrophic growth by nitrogen availability, and land use change with an associated increase in nutrient loading can have a major impact on coastal ecosystem function (Howarth 1988, Nixon 1995, Rabalais et al. 2002, Howarth and Marino 2006. This increase in nitrogen load typically results in eutrophication, defined as \"an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem\", which in turn causes varied responses in coastal systems (Nixon 1995). The classic response in relatively deep, plankton-based estuaries is enhanced productivity and biomass of phytoplankton (Nixon et al. 2001). In addition to direct effects of nutrient loading, indirect effects include a decrease in light availability needed for autotrophic growth and bottom water hypoxia due to decomposition of excess biomass (Cloern 2001). Other typical symptoms of late stage eutrophication include altered metabolic functioning, harmful algal blooms, fish kills, and loss of benthic vascular plants and associated species (Cloern 2001Kemp and Testa 2011). While deeper estuaries tend to exhibit predictable responses to nutrient inputs, these relationships have proven more elusive in shallow lagoonal systems (Nixon et al. 2001). Much of the global coastline including the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts is fringed by these shallow lagoonal systems which exhibit variable responses to eutrophication. Our changing conceptual model of eutrophication now includes system attributes such as tidal energy, residence time, light availability, and presence of filter feeders, that can mediate the response to nutrient loading, acting as 'filters' between increased loading and system response (Cloern 2001). One main characteristic that distinguishes shallow systems from deeper systems is a photic zone that extends to the sediments, thus stimulating benthic primary production and enhancing benthic-pelagic coupling of biogeochemical cycles (McGlathery et al. 2007). Tidally influenced creeks are often positioned at the interface between the land and adjacent lagoons, making them particularly susceptible to nutrient inputs from changing land use (Anderson et al. 2010). These zones of transition are also important sites of nutrient processing with sometimes extremely high turnover rates of nitrogen (Buzzelli 2008). High rates of denitrification in these shallow systems can also act as a major nitrogen sink, with average rates between 1 and 10 mmol m -2 d -1 and reported rates up to 30 mmol m -2 d -1 (Joye and Anderson 2008). These systems have the potential to act as conduits, transformers, or filters for land-based nutrient inputs as they transit to the adjacent lagoons. Given their small volumes and relatively rapid flushing rates, these creeks may act as conduits that rapidly flush land-based nutrients into the adjacent lagoons where they may have negative impacts. Alternatively, tidal creeks may exhibit typical responses associated with eutrophication such as phytoplankton blooms which transform land-derived nutrients into particulate and organic forms that are subsequently flushed to the lagoons. Finally, these creeks could act as efficient filters or traps for land-based loads through denitrification and immobilization by benthic microalgae. Due to their proximity to land, the first warning signs of human impact on estuarine systems could appear in these creeks, making study of their function of major importance."}, {"section_title": "II. Characteristics of Shallow Systems", "text": "One reason shallow systems respond to nutrient enrichment differently than deeper systems is the relative time it takes water to enter and subsequently leave the system. Flushing or residence time can control system dynamics and thus the fate of nutrients entering the system. In a compilation of multiple systems, Nixon et al. (1996) found that with increased residence times the percent of total nitrogen inputs that were subsequently exported from the system decreased. Flushing time is an \"integrative system parameter that describes the general exchange characteristics of a waterbody\", and is often the most useful and easily calculated metric of transit time in an estuarine system (Monsen et al. 2002). Typical flushing or residence times for deep systems like Narragansett and Chesapeake Bays are on the order of weeks to several months, whereas values for shallow systems are often on the order of days to weeks, with notable exceptions such as Chincoteague Bay, MD/VA: a shallow system with a residence time of 2-3 months (Pritchard 1960;Nixon et al. 2001;Herman et al. 2007;Wang 2009). There are two widely used methods for calculating flushing time of an estuary: the freshwater fraction method, which utilizes river flow, volume of the system, and a salt balance (Shen and Wang 2007), and where river inflow is not well known or tidal range is large, the tidal prism method (Monsen et al. 2002). Both calculations assume a wellmixed system, and the tidal prism method has a singular assumption that the tidal volume of water is replaced on every subsequent tide with new water (Fugate et al. 2005). This assumption can be addressed by introducing a coefficient \uf062 which represents the percent of exiting water that returns on the next flood tide, but this coefficient is difficult to estimate thus the tidal prism method may underestimate flushing time (Monsen et al. 2002;Fugate et al. 2005;Herman et al. 2007). Flushing time also affects phytoplankton primary productivity, which is contingent on the balance between growth and loss, although Lucas et al. (2009) point out that transport time is not always the main control of phytoplankton growth and loss. Systems can switch between growth and loss dominance seasonally or annually, and the balance can be controlled by a combination of flushing time, presence of grazers, and nutrient delivery (Lucas et al. 2009). In San Francisco Bay, Alpine and Cloern (1992) found changes in primary production and biomass varied not only with physical dynamics but also with the presence or absence of bivalves in the system, on a seasonal and yearly time scale. Shallow systems also differ from deep systems due to the varied roles played by multiple autotrophs. A compilation of estuarine primary production rates showed that most estuaries fall between 100-300 g C m -2 y -1 (Boynton and Kemp 2005). Because most of these rates are pelagic, the authors include data sets from Borum and Sand-Jensen (1996) that represent total system primary productivity from very shallow systems that include benthic rates. In this analysis, most systems fell between 300 and 400 g C m -2 y -1 , emphasizing the important role of benthic autotrophs in addition to water column autotrophs. In a similar comparison of metabolic rates for shallow lagoons, McGlathery et al. (2001) found that systems including benthic autotrophs had much higher rates of primary production than those only containing water column atutotrophs. Given their position on the bottom, benthic autotrophs have ready access to water column nutrients as well as nutrients in the sediments (Boynton and Kemp 2005). Because of this, benthic microalgae (BMA) can play a large role in nutrient cycling in shallow systems. Anderson et al. (2003) found that BMA can act as a sink for water column nitrogen when the metabolic nitrogen demand of the BMA exceeds that supplied by mineralization in the sediments. This study also showed that macroalgal nitrogen uptake can be important at certain times of the year (Anderson et al. 2003). Although this nitrogen removal can be a large sink, these macroalgal blooms can also cause a shift in the dominant autotroph due to shading of the benthos, which affects biogeochemical cycling due to the different fates of various benthic autotrophs (McGlathery et al. 2007). Biomarker studies conducted by Hardison et al. (2011) showed that although macroalgae act as a sink for carbon and nitrogen, this is only a temporary phenomenon and after the late-summer die off of macroalgae the carbon and nitrogen is cycled back into the system. Some of this carbon and nitrogen can then be sequestered by the sediments, but the amount is heavily dependent upon tides and waves working to suspend macroalgae into the water column or export it from the system (Hardison et al. 2010)."}, {"section_title": "III. Coastal Systems of the Delmarva Peninsula", "text": "The coastal bays and associated tributaries on the Eastern Shore of Virginia are typical back-barrier lagoons with shallow depths, small watersheds, and limited connections to the adjacent ocean through narrow inlets. While many tidal creek systems face intensified urban or residential development, the creeks on the Eastern Shore mainly face intensified agriculture. The main type of agriculture in this area has shifted in the last 10-15 years from traditional row crops including corn, soy, and sweet potatoes, to more intensive tomato plasticulture and chicken husbandry. Accomack County issued permits for 43 new poultry houses between 2001 and 2007, a significant addition for the size of the county which pushed its rank to third largest broiler chicken producing jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia (Accomack County 2010). Tomatoes produced on the Virginia Eastern Shore are now estimated to constitute 80% of the total grown in the Commonwealth of Virginia (Northampton County 2009). This change in agricultural use has the potential to leach excess nitrogen into the receiving waterways and groundwater given the more intensive nature of these activities relative to row crop agriculture (Giordano et al. 2011). Land use in the Virginia portion of the Delmarva Peninsula is less impacted than the more urban and heavily agricultural landscape to the north, comprised mostly of unchanged natural habitat (including wetlands), followed by agricultural uses and very little urban cover (Stanhope et al. 2009;Anderson et al. 2010 The seaside region of the Virginia Eastern Shore is characterized by unconsolidated sandy soils and shallow aquifers (Robinson and Reay 2002). Due to the morphology of the coastal lagoons and the small area of the peninsula, the Virginia Eastern Shore is characterized by lagoons with small ratios of watershed to lagoon area (Anderson et al. 2010;Giordano et al. 2011). Since the main source of freshwater to these systems is groundwater, the connection between land use and ecosystem function is especially enhanced, although difficult to assess (Robinson and Reay 2002, Stanhope et al. 2009. Residence time is estimated to be on the order of days to weeks for Hog Island Bay and the majority of the seaside lagoons on the Delmarva Peninsula (Fugate et al. 2005;Herman et al. 2007). Lying between the uplands and outer lagoons are small tidal creeks, ubiquitous along the entire Delmarva. These creeks flow from agricultural fields and forested uplands at their heads to broad salt marshes along the mainstem and mouths of the creeks. All systems on the Delmarva are well mixed and heavily influenced by tides, due to the approximately 1.2 meter tide range and small amount of freshwater input (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). In addition to uptake by BMA, macroalgae, and denitrification discussed above, the Eastern Shore is characterized by extensive intertidal marshes, which can be a proportionally large sink for nitrogen per unit area. Boynton et al. (2008) found that although marshes comprised only 27% of system area in the Patuxent River, MD, they removed a proportionally larger 46% of the external nitrogen load (Boynton et al. 2008).  (Brush 2010;Giordano et al. 2011). Nitrogen loading has been shown to increase chlorophyll a and total nitrogen concentrations in the coastal bays of Maryland (Boynton et al. 1996). Utilizing the relationships found in the Maryland bays and nutrient loading predicted by the NLM, Giordano et al. (2011) calculated expected chlorophyll-a and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations for the Virginia bays. These predicted concentrations disagreed with monitoring data in these systems, suggesting that the Virginia bays do not respond to increased nitrogen loads in the same manner as the more impacted Maryland bays. However, another explanation for this discrepancy is that Giordano et al.'s (2011) "}, {"section_title": "IV. Tools for Understanding Shallow Systems", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Ecosystem Metabolism", "text": "In defining how coastal systems function, an assessment of whole system metabolism can answer some basic questions about the system while also helping to steer research objectives. Net Ecosystem Metabolism (NEM) is a measure of the trophic status of a system, defined as the balance between the rate of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Respiration (R), and quantifies the energy available for transfer to higher trophic levels (Kemp and Boynton 1980;Staehr et al. 2012). NEM is a useful metric for determining if a system is supported by inorganic nutrients or organic terrestrial materials and assessing the fate of allochthonous and autochthonous inputs to the system (Kemp and Testa 2011;Staehr et al. 2012). Net autotrophic systems have higher rates of production than respiration and require inputs of inorganic nutrients, while net heterotrophic systems exhibit higher rates of respiration than production, requiring a source of organic matter to the system (Caffrey 2003;Kemp and Testa 2011). Autotrophic systems export organic matter and act as a source for fixed carbon, while heterotrophic systems export nutrients and act as a sink for fixed carbon (Kemp and Testa 2011). Comparisons of NEM can be made among multiple systems or over time within the same system, but because of high levels of variance and diverse ecological drivers in coastal systems, this is not always possible. In an attempt to characterize the metabolic state of any system and to understand how NEM responds to different environmental factors, multiple assessments must be made to identify and understand the relationship between biological processes and the driving physical and environmental factors.  (Caffrey 2003). While changes in DO concentrations may not fully reflect total respiration in the system if there are high rates of anaerobic respiration occurring in the sediments, DO-based rates partially account for anaerobic respiration because the reduced byproducts tend to get oxidized as they diffuse upward through the sediments Smith 2005, Testa et al. 2013). Open Water Method: A widely used method of calculating NEM involves integrating the entire system using continuously monitoring DO sensors. This open water method relies on the assumption that the water moving past the DO sensor is representative of the same water mass throughout the deployment, but this is often difficult to discern in estuaries. The DO sensors are often deployed for extended periods of time and at multiple sites to achieve adequate temporal and spatial resolution (Caffrey 2003, Kemp andTesta 2011). Many studies incorporate DO profiles, or DO data from multiple depths, in order to determine the similarity of water masses along horizontal and vertical gradients (Kemp and Testa 2011;Staehr et al. 2012). Dissolved oxygen percent saturation and concentration from successive time steps are used to calculate rates of production or consumption following correction for air-sea diffusion (Kemp and Testa 2011). Net community production (NCP) is defined by changes in DO during daylight hours or hours of positive production rates. Community respiration rates are defined by changes in DO during night time hours. Gross Primary Production (GPP) is defined as NCP plus R. These rates can be computed each measurement interval (e.g., every 15 minutes) or using averages over longer intervals (e.g., hourly) to smooth out any anomalies, and are then summed to obtain daily rates. Component Method: The component method of assessing NEM involves isolating parts of the system, analyzing each separately, and combining their rates to obtain NEM. Production and respiration rates are measured for the sediments, water column, and depending on the system, seagrasses, marshes, and/or macroalgae. Although these can be measured in situ or in the lab, these experiments are more commonly conducted in the lab due to logistical constraints (Hopkinson and Smith 2005). These rates are then scaled up to the whole system and combined to obtain total system rates of GPP and NEM. In order to address the bottle effects associated with lab experiments, bottle incubations are kept short to avoid the buildup of metabolites and the deficit of reactants."}, {"section_title": "b. Ecosystem Simulation Models", "text": "Studies that incorporate synthesis of data and/or models can answer ecological questions by identifying drivers among systems, within a single system, and along a temporal gradient. A recent paper by Kemp and Boynton (2012)  Process-based models incorporate formulations of rate processes based on ecological principles rooted in theory or direct measurements. These models represent a mechanistic understanding of the system and can be used to determine biological, physical, and chemical controls on system dynamics. As discussed in Nixon et al. (2009), one such model was used in Narragansett Bay to identify a possible cause of a fundamental shift in benthic-pelagic coupling within the system (Kremer and Nixon 1978). By varying one parameter of the model while keeping the others constant, the authors found that light and not temperature was driving a shift in the timing of the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom, contributing to an uncoupling of the benthos and water column (Nixon et al. 2009). A similar model applied in the York River Estuary, VA found that hypoxia in the lower estuary was partially driven by advection of dissolved organic carbon from the Chesapeake Bay, which has major implications for management of hypoxic events (Lake and Brush 2015). These mechanistic understandings of system function are critical in creating management strategies and understanding the consequences of human actions in coastal zones. In addition to explaining how a system is currently functioning, models have the ability to predict how future changes will impact the system and associated resources, while identifying areas in need of further study."}, {"section_title": "OBJECTIVES", "text": "Given our lack of understanding of the role of tidal creeks in modulation of landbased nutrient loads, the purpose of this project was to combine field measurements of water quality and ecosystem metabolism with model simulations to quantify the degree to which a representative creek system acts as a nutrient conduit, transformer, or filter.

Specific objectives and hypotheses were: Hypothesis 2a: Benthic processes in the system will serve to modulate nutrient loads from groundwater seepage.

A waypoint associated depth measurement was taken automatically every 10 seconds during the cruise (average speed 6 knots) as well as manually in areas of interest, for a total of 5942 measurements. A YSI 6600 V2-4 was deployed simultaneously during sampling to record changes in water depth throughout the survey.

All points from the shoal, channel, and marsh digitization described above were extracted and assigned depths based on the long-term datum at the Wachapreague station: upland marsh edges were defined to be at mean higher high water, upland subtidal shoal edges and marsh islands within shoal segments were defined to be at mean sea level, and channel edges and marsh islands within the channel were defined to be at mean low water.

Hourly PAR was averaged over the month of each measurement to avoid undue influence by particularly cloudy days when they coincided with sampling. Biomass specific rates from the P-I calculations were converted to volume-and area-specific rates using field measurements of water column and benthic chl-a concentrations, respectively.

Volume exchanges in the EEM were initially calculated using both one dimensional Officer box model (1980) and tidal prism approaches. The Officer box model uses freshwater input and a salt balance between each box to calculate exchanges (Officer 1980). The tidal prism method is a way of calculating flushing time that works best for shallow systems, with low freshwater inputs and large tidal ranges like the tidal creeks on the Virginia Eastern Shore (Monsen et al. 2002;Herman et al. 2007). We compared the modeled results using each approach to measured results and found the tidal prism approach produced more reasonable results. We believe this is due to the small differences in salinity between each box, which limits the ability of the Officer approach to compute fluxes. After these comparisons were performed, we chose to use the tidal prism method to calculate volume exchanges across each boundary from box surface area and the 1.23 m mean tide range at Wachapreague, VA, assuming two flooding and two ebbing tides per day.

Calibration parameters in the model included the zero-degree intercept and exponent of the temperature dependent functions for water column and sediment respiration and denitrification, and coefficients for the BMA loss terms. These parameters were adjusted to calibrate the model to match observed concentrations of water column and benthic chlorophyll-a, DIN, DIP, and DO, and measured rates of water column and sediment GPP and R from the component incubations. Once calibrated the model was used to create annual nutrient budgets by box and for the entire system. The budget for the entire system was used to assess the role of the GMR in transporting, transforming, or filtering watershed-derived nutrients by comparing nitrogen inputs from the watershed, atmosphere, and Hog Island Bay to internal processing and losses through phytoplankton uptake, benthic microalgal uptake, denitrification, and export to Hog Island Bay. The budgets for each box were used to assess the relative importance of these internal processes along the watershed to bay gradient.

Late summer water column GPP was higher than fall GPP at all sites, with the largest difference at MI (Fig 4a-c). Sediment GPP was highest at PH, followed by MH and then MI for all seasons except late summer when the pattern reversed (Fig 4d-f). MH sediment GPP was highest in spring, but showed very little seasonality (Fig 4d). PH sediment GPP was highest in early summer and 2.5-7 times higher than rates at any other site during any season (Fig 4d-f). MI sediment GPP was very low except for the late summer sampling, when it was similar to rates experienced at the other sites (Fig 4f). Rates of water column respiration were low, less than 1 g O2 m -2 d -1 , across all sites and dates. MI water column respiration was the highest for all seasons except fall when MH had the highest rate (Fig 4a-c). Water column respiration was lowest during fall (Fig 4a-c). Sediment respiration rates were highest at site MH except for early summer when PH experienced very high sediment GPP and respiration (Fig 4d-f). All sites experienced similar rates of sediment respiration in late summer, fall, and spring with the lowest rates in fall (Fig 4d-f). Early summer sediment respiration decreased from spring at sites MH and MI but increased substantially at site PH (Fig 4d-f). Water column GPP exceeded sediment GPP on all dates at MI and half the time at MH, while sediment GPP was higher on all dates at PH (and half the time at MH) (Fig 4). With the exception of one date at MI, sediment respiration was always greater than water column respiration across all sites (Fig 4).

Combining water column and sediment rates, all sites were net autotrophic (positive NEM) for all dates except late summer when MH and PH were net heterotrophic (negative NEM), and fall when NCP at MI was balanced (Fig 5a-c). All sites experienced a large increase in NEM during early summer (Fig 5a-c), and PH also displayed a large increase in autotrophy in the fall (Fig 5b)."}, {"section_title": "Component Metabolism: Overall Averages", "text": "The preceding patterns were also reflected in average rates across all seasonal samplings (Fig 6). MI had the highest average water column GPP, respiration, and NCP, while PH had the highest average sediment GPP, respiration, and NCP (Fig 6a, d). Average water column NCP was positive (net autotrophic) at all sites, while sediment NCP was mixed (Fig 6a, d). Sediment GPP and respiration were dominant at the two sites near the head of the system (MH, PH), while pelagic GPP and respiration were dominant mid-system (MI) (Fig 6b, e). The benthic to pelagic GPP ratio at the mid-system site was less than one, indicating pelagic production was more important at this site (Fig 6b), while the benthic to pelagic respiration ratio was 0.98, indicating the rates were approximately equal (Fig 6e). Benthic to pelagic ratios of GPP and respiration were greater than 1 at the headwater sites, indicating the dominance of benthic metabolism at these sites, particularly respiration (Fig 6b, e). All sites were net autotrophic on average, with system production to respiration ratios greater than 1 (Fig 6c, f). PH was the most autotrophic followed by MI with MH experiencing the lowest net autotrophy (Fig 6c). Autotrophy at PH appeared to be driven by the highest levels of sediment GPP while autotrophy at MI was driven by the highest rates of water column GPP (Fig 6a, d). NEM at MH was driven by a more balanced ratio of water column to sediment GPP (Fig 6a, d).\nIn addition to high overall rates of water column GPP, the Machipongo Intermediate site was characterized by benthic to pelagic GPP and respiration ratios \uf020\uf0a31, exhibiting a clear dominance of water column processes ( Fig. 6b, e). The opposite was true of PH, which was dominated by sediment GPP and respiration with benthic to pelagic GPP and respiration ratios well over 1 (Fig 6b, e). Both headwater sites had higher average benthic respiration compared to water column respiration, but MH had a more balanced ratio of water column to sediment GPP (Fig 6a, d). Overall, HIB water column metabolism was 3x that in the GMR, while sediment metabolism in the GMR was 2-3x that of HIB (Giordano et al. 2012). All sites in the GMR and HIB studies were on average net autotrophic, with the GMR exhibiting half the magnitude of HIB NEM (Fig 6c, f). HIB was characterized as having benthic to pelagic GPP ratios well below 1, and experienced autotrophic NEM driven by phytoplankton production. Benthic drivers led to higher GPP in the headwaters of the GMR, suggesting autotrophy is driven by benthic production throughout much of the GMR. Average net autotrophy in the GMR suggests utilization and transformation of watershed nutrients by both phytoplankton and benthic microalgae. The seasonal pattern of heterotrophy at sites MH and PH during the late summer suggest that high respiration rates are remineralizing biomass into dissolved nitrogen, consistent with late summer temperature increases."}, {"section_title": "Open Water Metabolism and Comparison to Component Rates", "text": "Net Ecosystem Metabolism as calculated using the open water method was negative (i.e., net heterotrophic) at all sites during all seasons (Fig 7). The largest heterotrophic rates occurred during late summer at sites MH and PH with the lowest rates occurring at site MM ( Fig   7). During fall, spring, and early summer all sites experienced similar rates of heterotrophy except for a larger rate at PH during early summer (Fig 7). Open water NEM was in direct opposition to component NEM for all sites and seasons except late summer at sites MH and PH, where both methods indicated net heterotrophic conditions albeit not of the same magnitude (Fig 8).\nAt sites PH and MH, open water and component sites were directly adjacent and thus directly comparable (Fig 1). Conversely, while sites MM and MI are used for comparisons, site MM was located downstream from site MI (Fig 1). MI and MM sites are similar in that they are both further down estuary and deeper than the headwater sites. A large peak in heterotrophy based on the open water method at PH and MH in late summer is in agreement with net heterotrophy measured from the component method (Fig 7). A comparative analysis across systems shows that the ratio of DIN to organic carbon inputs can predict whether a system will be net heterotrophic or autotrophic (Testa et al. 2013;Hopkinson and Vallino, 1995;Kemp et al. 1997;Gazeau et al. 2005). Based on the loads used in the model, this ratio in the GMR is 1.43 mol mol -1 , which places the system well into the autotrophic area of the curve in the aforementioned study and confirms our reliance on the component method results. In this study we believe the respectively (Anderson,unpublished data;Fig 11). Box 1 had the highest rate of denitrification and has the greatest average depth of all boxes at 2.2 m, with some places 12-18 m deep. This higher rate of denitrification experienced in Box 1 is not unexpected as Hog Island Bay only has an average depth of 1-2 m. Compared to boxes 2-5, a deeper benthos in box 1 means a smaller photic benthic area and thus less active BMA, which would lead to less oxygenated sediments, less competition for nitrate, and a greater potential for increased denitrification. Average rates of denitrification for all boxes ranged from 0.079 to 0.606 mmol N m -2 d -1 , falling within the range of rates (0-38 mmol N m -2 d -1 ) compiled by Joye and Anderson (2008). Although the GMR rates are at the lower end of this range, more in line with values from continental shelf habitats than higher values from shallow coastal systems, lower rates in the GMR are not surprising due to the presence of benthic microalgae and a large tidal range to depth ratio, which serve to oxygenate the sediments and inhibit denitrification. The large tidal range in the GMR also leads to a very low flushing time, which has been associated with a lower fraction of nitrogen inputs being lost to denitrification (Nixon et al. 1996). The depth survey of benthic chlorophyll-a concentrations indicates that the model is underestimating BMA concentrations, particularly at deeper depths (Fig. 13). This apparent underestimation could be an artifact of the light attenuation coefficient calculation in the model, but is most likely due to the fact that the modeled data set and benthic chlorophyll-a survey were conducted during the same season, but different years. Although the measurements are not directly comparable, it is encouraging that most of the modeled concentrations lie within the range of the observations, and the model reproduces the observed decline with depth. Seasonally, the model is capturing an increase, but underprecting the magnitude of BMA chlorophyll-a concentrations in box 2 during late summer, box 4 during fall, and box 5 during the spring bloom. These lines of evidence lead us to believe that if anything, the prediction of benthic primary productivity and nutrient processing in this study is conservative. Total modeled primary productivity of pelagic and benthic autotrophs in the GMR was 116 g C m -2 y -1 . In comparison to primary productivity in other systems, the GMR lies in the most frequent category of pelagic dominated systems, 100-199 g C m -2 y -1 , but well below the most frequent rates seen in systems that include benthic producers, 301-400 g C m -2 y -1 (Boynton and Kemp 2005). This could be due to the exclusion of macroalgal and salt marsh production in this study or possibly the very shallow water column, high levels of turbidity, and rapid flushing rates. Additionally, under-predicted phytoplankton standing stock in the late summer months and exclusion of the high early summer GPP rates in the model could be contributing to this likely underestimate."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Pelagic State Variables", "text": "The model captured the seasonality of water column chlorophyll-a concentrations in all boxes, exhibiting a bloom in spring and elevated concentrations throughout the summer (Fig   9a).

Modeled DIN concentrations followed the seasonal trends in observed concentrations, with peaks in late-August through mid-September, mid-November, and late spring/early summer (Fig 9b). To varying degrees, data from all boxes exhibited elevated DIN concentrations in late August through September that the model did not fully capture (Fig 14b; see below). Similarly unexplained peaks in observed DIP concentrations occurred in boxes 2-5 concurrently with the DIN peaks (Fig 9c). DIP concentrations were slightly underpredicted in all boxes except box 1, although the model captured the correct seasonality (Fig 9c).

Modeled water column respiration followed the overall seasonality of measured rates, but slightly overpredicted their magnitude (Fig 10c). Measured sediment GPP is from samples taken from a depth of 0.5 m. Since the model calculates BMA GPP in 0.5 m depth bins, model output from the 0-0.5 and 0.5-1 m intervals was compared to the observations (Fig 11a); modeled rates in these two layers should bracket the observed rates. Modeled sediment GPP was in the appropriate range except for an underprediction in fall in box 4. Modeled sediment respiration matched well with the observed rates in fall, and while overall the model demonstrated the correct seasonality, it underestimated the rates in late summer and spring (Fig 11b). Modeled denitrification (DNF) followed the simulated pattern of DIN (Fig 11c).

The event during the late summer deployment was characterized by rainfall of 14.5 cm in one day, August 25 th , and the fall event was the passage of Hurricane Sandy on October 27-30 th , characterized by 7.19 cm of rainfall. In the headwaters of the Machipongo, Hurricane Sandy caused reduced salinity, a spike in turbidity lasting 3 days, an increase in chlorophyll-a concentrations, and a dampening effect on dissolved oxygen fluctuations (Fig 14). The timing of the late summer storm event coincided with the peaks in observed DIN and DIP concentrations and the minimum in observed DO that were unexplained by the model output (Figs 9b, c and 10 a). Since the baseline model uses constant rates of watershed loading, we hypothesized that increased loading during the storm would account for the observed peaks in DIN and DIP. To attempt to match the model output to the observed peaks, we ran a storm simulation in the model. Watershed loads of N, P, and C were increased for a period of 11 days surrounding the storm; the degree of increase was tested by sensitivity analysis until modeled DIN and DIP concentrations matched observed values. The storm simulation captured the late summer peak observed in DIN with the addition of this storm, and rates of DNF slightly increased (Fig. 15). The addition of the storm did not affect the output for any other variables."}, {"section_title": "System Nutrient Budget", "text": "Model output from the baseline calibration and the storm simulation were used to develop annual nitrogen budgets to assess the role of the GMR as a conduit, transformer, or filter of land-based nutrient inputs. Inputs to the system under the baseline simulation were greatest from net exchange with Hog Island Bay, with combined watershed and atmospheric loads representing less than half the HIB input (Table 3). Atmospheric deposition was the lowest source of N to the system, at 20% of the input from the watershed, unlike in Hog Island Bay where atmospheric deposition accounted for 66% of total inputs (Anderson et al. 2010). Regarding the exchange with HIB, N was imported in inorganic form and exported in phytoplankton biomass. However, these values only account for DIN and phytoplankton N; the model does not simulate DON which if included could presumably modify or reverse this net flux. Internal processing of N was dominated by BMA uptake, followed by phytoplankton uptake and a much lower removal by DNF (Table 3). Uptake by BMA and phytoplankton were balanced near the mouth of the GMR, with increasing dominance by BMA uptake towards the shallower, upstream boxes. Denitrification was most important near the mouth, and decreased upstream. On an annual basis, phytoplankton, BMA, and DNF were predicted to uptake or remove 260%, 413%, and 46% of watershed TN inputs and 69%, 110%, and 12% of all combined TN inputs from the watershed, atmosphere, and Hog Island Bay. The August storm simulation added a total of 28,635 kgN y -1 to the system from the watershed (Table 4). This nitrogen was mostly flushed from the system to Hog Island Bay, reflected in a reduced net import of DIN, with a small portion being denitrified within the system. Other processes in the budget barely changed or did not change at all, which corresponds with unchanged model output for all parameters other than DIN and DNF.   GPP of all sites, the opposite of all other seasons in which the headwater sites had greater sediment GPP (Fig. 4). As evidenced by these data, this intermediate site is functionally different than the two headwater sites. The headwater sites were net heterotrophic only during this late summer time period, when sediment GPP was low and sediment respiration was at the higher end of the range for all sites over all dates ( Fig. 4d-f). This suggests high amounts of remineralization occurring in the benthos at the headwater sites during late summer. Simultaneously in late summer, elevated water column GPP is driving net autotrophy at MI, suggesting downstream utilization of remineralized nutrients by phytoplankton at this site (Figs. 4 and 5). The high respiration rates in late summer are probably related to elevated temperature as well as an observed phytoplankton bloom and subsequent crash in late summer, which would cause a large amount of organic matter to settle on the benthos (Fig. 16). In comparison to a previous study of system metabolism conducted in Hog Island Bay (Giordano et al. 2012), the timing of seasonal shifts in water column GPP and NCP in the GMR mirrored those of HIB, with the highest rates in both systems occurring in early and late summer. Seasonal water column GPP in HIB was 2-4x that of any seasonal measurement in the GMR. Although water column respiration in the GMR was in the range of rates in HIB for each season, the rates in HIB were on average 5x higher than rates in the GMR. Opposite this trend, GMR sediment GPP was on average 0.5-3.5x that of HIB, with HIB lying in the general range of the GMR rates (Giordano et al. 2012). While sediment GPP was consistently higher in the GMR, sediment respiration was generally of a similar magnitude to HIB, except for the large peak in respiration during late summer in the GMR. Comparatively, HIB metabolism appears influenced more by water column GPP while GMR metabolism is influenced more by sediment GPP.\n"}, {"section_title": "Baseline Model Simulation", "text": "Exchange across the mouth of the GMR indicates the creek is importing over three times the amount of N coming from the atmosphere and watershed combined, in the form of DIN from HIB (Table 3). The net import of N from HIB decreases by a third when accounting for the N in phytoplankton being exported to HIB (Table 3). The net import of N from HIB indicates that the GMR is a sink for N, and the net import of DIN and export of particulate organic phytoplankton N indicates the system is acting as a substantial nutrient transformer. Total inputs of N from the atmosphere and watershed combined are approximately equal to the N present in exported phytoplankton biomass, suggesting the system is effectively transforming watershed-and atmosphere-derived DIN into phytoplankton biomass. It is probable that the form of nitrogen being exchanged with HIB is not only as DIN and phytoplankton biomass, but also DON. Currently there is not a pool for DON in the model, so the GMR is possibly exporting large amounts of DON to HIB while importing DIN. In the aforementioned metabolism study of HIB, DON comprised approximately 83% of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in the bay, suggesting this may be the case (Giordano et al. 2012;McGlathery et al. 2007). In addition, a five year study conducted in HIB found DON was a similarly large portion of the TDN pool at >75% (Anderson et al. 2010). Conversely, a study of baseflow N loading in the creeks of the Virginian Eastern Shore found DIN was the greatest percentage of TDN, ranging from 66% to 98% (Stanhope et al. 2009). During the seasonal sampling in this study, 2% -41% of TDN was DIN, with an average of 20.3% (Fig. 17). While this percentage varies considerably in the GMR depending on season and condition, percent DIN in the GMR is on average lower than values in watershed inputs and higher than those in the adjacent bay. Possible sinks for N that are not accounted for in our model are uptake by the intertidal marshes, ephemeral macroalgal blooms, and burial. Additionally, the formulation of BMA in this model includes their ability to draw nutrients from the water column or benthos, representative of actual behavior. This can introduce a source of nitrogen to the modeled system not otherwise accounted for in N inputs from the watershed. This inexhaustible pool of DIN in the benthos means the budget presented in this study is not a closed budget, but nonetheless it is a useful way to examine relative amounts of major inputs and internal processes. Anderson et al. (2010) estimated that in addition to the watershed load of N, 33% more N enters HIB from direct groundwater discharge. This extra pool of N in the model serves to add to the amount of nitrogen taken up by the BMA, known to act as a temporary filter in shallow estuarine systems. The modeled internal rates of phytoplankton and benthic microalgal uptake of N are 216 and 343% of watershed plus atmospheric N inputs, respectively. The GMR is thus a major transformer of DIN inputs, and while phytoplankton represent only a transformation, benthic microalgae have been shown to act as a temporary sink or filter by capping the flux of N out of the sediments to the overlying water column (Anderson et al. 2003;McGlathery et al. 2007;Joye and Anderson 2008). Total denitrification in the system is 38% of watershed plus atmospheric inputs, a relatively small amount in comparison to the nutrient transformations occurring in the autotrophic community. This denitrification, although expectedly low due to the rapid flushing of the system (Nixon et al. 1996), represents a permanent sink. The GMR system is efficiently utilizing N inputs by acting as a permanent sink for almost half of the land based inputs and as a transformer and temporary sink for the remainder. Benthic microalgal N uptake is an important component of N processing throughout the entire GMR with total BMA uptake per box much larger than that of total phytoplankton uptake. BMA and phytoplankton uptake rates are similar in box 1, near HIB, and diverge upstream towards the headwater boxes 3 and 5, where BMA uptake is twice that of phytoplankton uptake. However, the model is under-predicting water column chlorophyll-a in boxes 4 and 5, so the actual difference may not be this pronounced. This modeled gradient in BMA and phytoplankton uptake reflects the pattern of benthic: pelagic GPP observed in metabolic incubations. Anderson et al. (2003) found benthic microalgae to be extremely important in capping nutrient fluxes from the benthos to the water column. Modeled rates of BMA uptake in this study were consistently greater than rates of nutrient mineralization. This resulted in a negligible or negative net flux of N to the water column from the sediments. These results suggest that BMA and the sediment microbial community are tightly coupled and provide a cap on any nutrients coming out of the sediment (Anderson et al. 2003;Anderson et al. 2010). In these earlier analyses the authors state that the calculated BMA rates are probably overestimated due to use of GPP measured only in the light. In this study, we found that our modeled uptake of N by BMA was indeed lower than that in HIB. The modeled BMA uptake, or nitrogen demand, for the growing season was 2.1-4.2 mmol N m -2 d -1 , compared to 7.4-10.8 mmol N m -2 d -1 calculated at the creek site of the HIB study (Anderson et al. 2003). The BMA uptake rates in our study are very close to the mineralization rates measured in the HIB study, suggesting that even with these lower rates of N demand, the GMR could be capable of a negligible or negative net flux of N from the sediments."}, {"section_title": "Storm Model Simulation", "text": "The late summer storm simulation served only to increase the DIN pool and denitrification rates slightly within the model (Fig. 15). No other state variables were affected and almost all of the excess DIN was flushed from system (Table 4). Because this system has such a small watershed to open water ratio, with very little freshwater inflow and a high flushing rate, large storm events lead to nutrient pulses and scouring with subsequent organic matter export. The stochastic nature of this system suggests that these tidal creeks function differently during baseflow and storm conditions. In simulating the storm event, we did not increase the volume of tidal exchange within the system, which would possibly serve to increase flushing of materials. This storm simulation confirms the system acts as a conduit for nutrients to the outer bays during large storm events, and because we only simulated one storm event and did not increase tidal flushing, the conduit role of the creeks is most likely a conservative estimate."}]
