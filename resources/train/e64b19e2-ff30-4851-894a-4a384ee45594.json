Vitamin D deficiency is associated with risk for cardiovascular event in the general population [2, 3] . Also, vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population [4] . In contrast, vitamin D supplementation was significantly associated with better survival, specifically in patients with documented deficiency [5] .\nArterial stiffness is an early marker of systemic atherosclerosis and a risk factor of hypertension [6, 7] . There are several methods to estimate arterial stiffness [8, 9] . Among them, pulse wave velocity (PWV) is generally accepted as the most simple, non-invasive and validated indicator of arterial stiffness [9] . On the other hand, ventricular stiffness is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and delayed early diastolic filling which, in turn, increase the risk of heart failure (HF), and death [10] . The left ventricular (LV) filling index (E/E ) and mitral peak early/peak late flow (E/A) velocities are accepted parameters for noninvasive LV stiffness.\nAssociation between low vitamin D and arterial stiffness in healthy subjects was investigated in only one study [11] . However, relationship between vitamin D and ventricular stiffness was not investigated so far. Vitamin D regulates the renin-angiotensin system, suppresses proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, increases vascular calcification and improves endothelial cell dependent vasodilatation [12] [13] [14] . Our hypothesis was that vitamin D deficiency will be associated with both increased arterial and left ventricular stiffness in healthy subjects. Therefore, in this cross sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the association between serum vitamin D with arterial and left ventricle stiffness in completely healthy subjects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "We studied 125 (67 male, 58 female and mean age: 60.2 \u00b1 11.9 years) healthy subjects who had no known cardiovascular disease or risk factors.

Recent clinical studies have associated low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with hypertension, coronary artery calcification, and cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, acute stroke, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Present study showed that vitamin D was independently associated with both aortic stiffness and LV stiffness indexes such as ratios of E/A and E/E in healthy subjects. The present study is the first study in the literature, which evaluate the association between vitamin D and LV ventricular stiffness in healthy subjects. The association between low vitamin D and increased arterial stiffness was demonstrated in previous studies [11, 25] . But this relationship was investigated in only one study in healthy subjects [11] . In that study, Al Mheid et al. reported that vitamin D insufficiency was associated with increased arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in the conductance and resistance blood vessels in humans [11] . The precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying vitamin D deficiency-mediated ventricular and aortic stiffness still remain unclear. However, several plausible mechanisms can explain how vitamin D may influence both ventricular and arterial stiffness. Molecular and cell biology researches have shown vitamin D receptors (VDR) to be present on vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, and cardiomyocytes [26] and possess the enzymatic system to convert the primary circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D), to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [12, 27] . Vitamin D influences cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cell function by exerting antiproliferative effects [6] . Restriction of LV filling is associated with ventricular diastolic stiffening due to ventricular structural changes, such as interstitial fibrosis or LV hypertrophy [28, 29] . It has been known that vitamin D receptors on cardiomyocytes promote proliferation [14] . Animal models have consistently demonstrated that vitamin D can act as an antihypertrophic hormone in the heart [30] [31] [32] . In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging cohort, Ameri et al. [33] reported that vitamin D sufficiency (25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL) is associated with a reduced risk of LV concentric remodeling in healthy, community-dwelling individuals.\nMoreover, vitamin D also affects the vascular and cardiac walls by regulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) [12] [13] [14] 32] . Vitamin D deficiency predisposes to up-regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and hypertrophy of both the left ventricle and vascular smooth muscle cells [34] . In vitamin D-deficient animals there is an increased activation of the cardiac RAAS system was observed in vitamin D-deficient animals and has been linked to increased incidence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and atherosclerosis [35] . Natriuretic peptides are secreted by cardiomyocytes due to volume overload and increased atrial and/or ventricular pressure.\nPrevious studies reported that 1,25(OH)2D inhibits the secretion of natriuretic peptides in atrial and ventricular myocytes [35] [36] [37] . Chen et al. concluded that the vitamin D-dependent suppression of ANP reflects a global antagonism of myocardial hypertrophy rather than an isolated inhibition of the ANP gene [38] . Interestingly, liganded VDR was also shown to increase the expression and activity of the type 1 natriuretic peptide receptor-A, which exerts antihypertensive effects, suppresses the RAAS, and inhibits myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis [38] . Activation of the RAAS and natriuretic peptides are some of the postulated mechanisms responsible for vitamin D deficiency-mediated ventricular and aortic stiffness [36] .\nAnother possible mechanism which explains how vitamin D may influence both ventricular and arterial stiffness is calcium homeostasis. Calcium flux and calcium homeostasis are crucial for the electrophysiology and contractility of the heart. Vitamin D increase vascular calcification, which contribute to the increase in arterial stiffness [23] . 1,25-Hydroxyvitamin D was shown to increase the Ca 2+ uptake in cardiac ventricular cells. 1,25-Hydroxyvitamin D effects on cardiac contractility and intracellular calcium handling were studied in an experimental study [39] . In that study, the main result was an accelerated relaxation in response to acute and sustained administration of calcitriol [39] . In our study, we showed that patients with vitamin D deficient group had higher serum calcium level than patients with vitamin D sufficient group and vitamin D level was independently associated with serum calcium. Our results supposed the possibility of relationship between vitamin D level and aortic and ventricular stiffness.\nPresent study also showed that vitamin D was independently associated with systolic blood pressure in healthy subjects. Our findings related with blood pressure are compatible with the previous studies [40, 41] . The majority of large cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between 25-OH D levels and blood pressure, and the risk of future hypertension seems to be greater in those with vitamin D deficiency [40, 41] . Human studies indicate that 1,25(OH)2D inhibits renin synthesis, which may lower blood pressure [11] . In the NHANES III study, the mean systolic blood pressure was about 3 mm Hg lower in those in the individuals in the highest quintile of serum 25-OH D levels compared with those in the lowest quintile [42] . Furthermore, a previous study in post-menopausal women reported a 7.8-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure with vitamin D replacement [43] ."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations", "text": "The present study has some significant limitations: It has been known that serum vitamin D levels vary with region, seasonality and altitude due to possible effect of sunlight. The half-life of vitamin D is approximately 3 weeks half-life, but serum vitamin D levels may change throughout the day and season of the year. So, a single measurement may not reflect actual vitamin D status. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the active metabolite. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was not measured in present study. However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D has important autocrine and paracrine roles in the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and determining intracellular levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [44] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with increased ventricular and arterial stiffness as well as systolic blood pressure in healthy subjects. Arterial stiffness plays a role on pathogenesis of hypertension, while ventricular stiffness plays a role pathogenesis of heart failure. Therefore, vitamin D may be a role in pathogenesis of both hypertension and heart failure."}]
