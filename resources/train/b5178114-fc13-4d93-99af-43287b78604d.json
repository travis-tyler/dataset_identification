[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. Alleles of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene are known to modulate the genetic risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been associated with hippocampal volume differences in AD. However, the effect of these alleles on hippocampal volume in younger subjects has yet to be clearly established. Using a large cohort of more than 1,400 adolescents, this study found no hippocampal volume or hippocampal asymmetry differences between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE 4 or 2 alleles, nor dose-dependent effects of either allele, suggesting that regionally specific effects of these polymorphisms may only become apparent in later life."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The hippocampus has a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is among one of the first brain regions to show characteristic signs of neurofibrillary tangle pathology, which can be observed pre-symptomatically in adults as young as 20 years [1, 2] . Although hippocampal atrophy is commonly seen in AD, studies have also demonstrated lower hippocampal volumes in healthy older adults and amnestic mild cognitive impairment subjects (MCI) [3] [4] [5] [6] .\nThe presence of the apolipoprotein (ApoE) 4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the development of late onset AD [7] [8] [9] , whereas possession of the 2 allele has been suggested to confer a protective effect against the disease [10, 11] . Healthy adult carriers of the ApoE 4 allele may be more vulnerable to degeneration of the hippocampus as they enter middle age [12, 13] , and show altered patterns of brain activity in response to non-verbal stimuli [14] . A recent study has also demonstrated that homozygous ApoE 4 carriers (4/4) may demonstrate wider patterns of cortical atrophy than heterozygous carriers (4/no 4), thus suggesting a possible 4 allele dose-dependent effect [15] . However, a small number of studies have failed to replicate these findings [12, 16] , and others have conversely reported advantageous effects of the ApoE 4 genotype in young individuals [17] .\nLess work has addressed the effect of ApoE polymorphisms in healthy children and adolescents, and the core aspects of neuronal development in these individuals are less clear. ApoE 2 allele carriers stave off the effects of AD [18, 19] , but whether properties of the 2 allele could have a positive effect on neuronal development in adolescence remains largely unexplored. Using a cohort of 1,412 adolescents from the IMAGEN study, we examined the possibility that the 4 and 2 alleles may affect hippocampal volume in adolescents, and either render them at risk or protect them from future age-related neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHOD", "text": "Healthy adolescents were studied from the European multi-center neuroimaging-genetics IMAGEN project [20] . A total of 1,412 adolescents had ApoE genotype available.\nMR images were acquired using 3T MRI systems from major MR manufacturers (Siemens, Philips, Bruker, and General Electric). A standardized imaging protocol was used to ensure homogeneity in data acquisition across different scanners. The protocol included a high resolution 3D T1-weighted ultrafast gradient echo volume (voxel size 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 mm 3 ) and axial proton density T2-weighted fast spin echo images based on the ADNI study protocol (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). Full details have been previously reported [20] . Quality control was carried out using previously described criteria for scanner related phantom work and to ensure adequate quality control of the T1-weighted volume images such as avoidance of wraparound artefacts and minimal levels of subject motion [20] [21] [22] . The Freesurfer analysis pipeline (version 5.1.0) was used to produce left and right hippocampal volumes for each subject. Raw hippocampal volumes and hippocampal volumes normalized by their respective intracranial volumes were determined [23] as detailed in previous publications [24, 25] . Values represent Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. Continuous variables were inspected using parametric t-tests (t-value) and categorical variables were inspected using fisher exact tests. Hippocampal volume differences were examined using ANCOVA models which co-varied for age, gender, and site ID. * Normalized hippocampal volumes (Hippocampal volume/intracranial volume) were analyzed but raw hippocampal volumes are reported in mm 3 . BMI, body mass index; Verbal IQ, verbal intelligence scale; Performance IQ, performance intelligence scale; CANTAB SWM strategy; spatial working memory task score. Blood samples were collected for DNA analysis and extraction from each subject in the study. Samples were subsequently genotyped using the Illumina Quad 610 and 660 arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) [20] . Two ApoE single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs429358 (T, C) and rs7412 (C, T), were used to identify 3 allelic variants of ApoE (2, 3, and 4) in order to define a subject's genotype.\nThe R statistical software environment, version 2.15.2, was used to perform all statistical analyses. To compare demographic statistics (age, gender, CANTAB SWM strategy scores, verbal and performance IQ), Fisher exact tests and two sample t-tests were conducted. A generalized linear model was used, adjusting for age and gender, to determine hippocampal volume differences between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE 4 and 2 alleles and possible dose-dependent effects of each allele on hippocampal volume. Comparisons of the ApoE 4 and 2 alleles were also conducted using a previously described asymmetry index (AI) [26] for the hippocampus and were tested using one-way ANOVA."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Healthy adolescents possessing either the ApoE 4 or 2 alleles did not significantly differ in terms of demographics (Table 1) . No hippocampal volume differences were observed between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE 4 allele (right hippocampus: F = 22.88, p = 0.289, left hippocampus: F = 18.9, p = 0.406) or the 2 allele (right hippocampus: F = 23.42, p = 0.103, left hippocampus: F = 18.96, p = 0.357). These results were consistent when tests were repeated on raw hippocampal volumes (Table 1) . No significant differences in the asymmetry index for the hippocampus were observed between ApoE 4 carriers (AI = 2.23 \u00b1 9.40) and non-carriers (AI = 1.90 \u00b1 10.27) (p = 0.591) and ApoE 2 carriers (AI = 2.36 \u00b1 11.01) and non-carriers (AI = 1.92 \u00b1 9.89) (p = 0.547). Furthermore, no evidence of a dose-dependent effect of ApoE 4 or 2 alleles on hippocampal volume and hippocampal asymmetry were established (Table 2) . Direct comparisons of memory and IQ performance against both 2 and 4 genotype did not produce any significant results."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, a large cohort of young adolescents was used to compare the effects of different ApoE gene polymorphisms on hippocampal volume. Contrary to some recent studies [2, 13] , no hippocampal volume differences were observed between carriers and noncarriers of the ApoE 4 allele, a major genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset AD. Studies that have demonstrated an ApoE 4 genotypic effect on structural brain phenotypes such as the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and other gray matter structures, have generally done so using older non-demented and healthy middle-aged individuals [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .\nIn healthy adults and elderly subjects, a normal asymmetry of the hippocampus exists with the right hippocampus larger than the left [33, 34] . Previous studies have suggested that alteration of asymmetry is associated with the ApoE 4 genotype [26, 35] and is progressively reduced in AD patients possessing the 4 allele [36] . In the current study, no differences in hippocampal asymmetry were found between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE 4 and 2 alleles.\nThe possibility of a gene dose-dependent effect of ApoE 4 was also investigated. Although the neuroanatomic effects of ApoE 4 have been extensively studied [15, 37, 38] , even less is known about the deleterious effects associated with the presence of two 4 alleles in children and adolescents. However, direct comparisons of 4 allele dosages in our cohort showed no differences in subject's hippocampal volumes, despite a previous study suggesting a linearly proportional rate of hippocampal atrophy to allele load [39] .\nOne possible explanation for our findings are that ApoE 4 genotype exerts a quiescent effect on the hippocampus, and as a result, neuroanatomic effects of the 4 allele in this region may lie dormant in young adolescents and gradually become more salient in earlier adulthood. Evidence of this gradual effect can be seen in studies that observe early structural changes in volumes of gray matter [2, 40] , as well as differences in white matter integrity [41, 42] among 4 carriers aged 21 and above.\nPrior studies comparing the effects of ApoE polymorphisms on brain imaging phenotypes have yielded equivocal findings; with some presenting no evidence of an 4 genotypic effect on gray matter volumes [3, 43, 44] , and others suggesting an antagonistic pleiotropic effect of the gene during neuronal development [45, 46] . Although a definitive conclusion has not been drawn, this could be due to differences in sample size, image pre-processing methods, and a lack of sample diversity or ethnic homogeneity.\nStructural MRI studies have examined perinatal brain development in infants [47, 48] with ApoE 4 found to predict reduced temporal cortex volumes. A confound of this study was that subjects were enriched for parents with psychiatric conditions, several of which are characterized by reduced hippocampal volume. Although such studies provide a better understanding of the perinatal effects associated with brain development, adolescence is also a period in which neurobiological changes may influence asynchronous brain maturation [49, 50] .\nRegional differences in hippocampal volume between ApoE 2 carriers and non-carriers were not found. Hence no evidence of a 2 protective effect was established. The putative protective effect of ApoE 2 remains a matter of debate and has generated contradictory findings. Some volumetric MRI studies do not support a disease staving protective effect in healthy older subjects [51, 52] , however, postmortem examinations have shown less AD-related neuropathological changes in 2 carriers relative to 3 homozygotes [53] . Only one study [19] was able to establish a protective effect of the 2 variant.\nDirect comparisons of memory and IQ performance against the 4 genotype also did not produce any significant results. However, as only a single test of cognition from the CANTAB battery was assessed, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility of a 4 genotypic effect on cognitive function. Nevertheless, the finding that ApoE 4 allelic status does not relate to intelligence and cognitive function fits with previous studies reporting little or no effect of the 4 allele on working memory and intellectual capacity [54, 55] .\nIn summary, this study suggests that hippocampal volume differences associated with ApoE 4 and 2 are not evident in 14-year olds, and that neuroanatomic effects of these variants may only become apparent later in life.
