Our results require confirmation with the use of longitudinal data and may not apply to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging and others; DIAN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00869817.) A lzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is currently estimated to affect more than 5 million people in the United States, with an expected increase to 13 million by the year 2050. The typical clinical presentation is progressive loss of memory and cognitive function, ultimately leading to a loss of independence and causing a heavy personal toll on the patient and the family. The costs of care of patients with Alzheimer's disease in 2010 were estimated at more than $172 billion in the United States, an annual cost that is predicted to increase to a trillion dollars by 2050 unless disease-modifying treatments are developed. 1 Alzheimer's disease has been hypothesized to begin decades before the first symptoms manifest. [2] [3] [4] Thus, longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers take many years to show the full pathologic cascade of events that lead to dementia. Furthermore, trials of disease-modifying treatment require large numbers of patients over extended periods owing to the slow progression of cognitive symptoms. 5, 6 Therefore, well-validated biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease processes are needed to improve the design of clinical trials, develop more effective therapeutics, and offer the opportunity for prevention trials. 7 On the basis of the amyloid hypothesis, 8 amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) is currently the most common disease-modifying target. Recent research indicates that the targeting of amyloidosis in familial amyloid polyneuropathy improves clinical outcomes. [9] [10] [11] However, the order and timing of amyloidosis and other Alz hei mer's disease processes that lead to clinical dementia are not well understood. We hypothesized that autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease and the more common late-onset Alz hei mer's disease 12 have similar pathophysiological features. Although autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease accounts for a relatively small proportion (approximately 1%) of cases of Alz hei mer's disease, increasing evidence 13 suggests that it overlaps with sporadic Alz hei mer's disease. Mutations in one of three genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) have been identified that cause alterations in A\u03b2 processing and lead to Alz heimer's disease with complete penetrance. The age at clinical onset of autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease is similar between generations 14 and is affected mostly by the mutation type and background family genetics. 15 We compared a wide range of pathophysiological markers between mutation carriers and noncarriers as a function of the parental age at onset in order to evaluate the cascade of events that lead to dementia. Clinical, cognitive, imaging, and biochemical measures were compared between mutation carriers and noncarriers in the first large international cohort of families with autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Me thods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY DESIGN", "text": "Participants at risk for carrying a mutation for autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease were enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study at 1 of 10 sites.

Changes begin in the brain at least two decades before the estimated onset of clinical symptoms. With the use of estimates of years from expected symptom onset, the order and magnitude of changes indicate that genetic mutations cause increased A\u03b2 42 , which is followed by brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, brain atrophy, and decreased glucose metabolism. After these biologic changes, cognitive impairment can be detected, which culminates in clinical impairment and eventually dementia. These findings suggest that the diagnosis of clinical dementia is made late in the course of the biologic cascade of autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease. The estimated year from expected symptom onset normalizes the stage of disease on the basis of the parental age of onset. Our findings suggest that once initiated, Alz hei mer's disease processes are likely independent of absolute age but rather depend on the start of processes such as A\u03b2 misfolding and other modulating factors. Furthermore, other findings suggest that amyloid deposition probably occurs years or decades before dementia symptoms are manifest in sporadic Alz hei mer's disease. 24 Previous cross-sectional studies in sporadic Alz hei mer's disease have suggested a series of changes that lead to clinical disease. 2 Our results support the hypothesis of a pathophysiological cascade and suggest the possibility of a common pathophysiology between autosomal dominant Alz heimer's disease and the much more common \"sporadic\" form.\nA strength of this study is that it shows relative changes in Alz hei mer's disease processes that occur over a period of four decades. However, interpretations of the results are not certain, because the current analyses are based on crosssectional data, which do not represent individual longitudinal changes. In addition, although many of our findings in autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease are similar to findings in sporadic Alz hei mer's disease, there were some differences. For example, trends for increased levels of A\u03b2 42 in the CSF have not been reported in sporadic Alz hei mer's disease or autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease, although this trend was predicted in autosomal dominant Alzhei mer's disease, because familial Alz hei mer's disease mutations cause increased A\u03b2 or A\u03b2 42 production. 30 Furthermore, unlike sporadic Alz heimer's disease, autosomal dominant Alz hei mer's disease typically presents with early and pronounced PIB-PET signaling in the neostriatum. 28 Although the findings of this study were largely based on PSEN1 mutations, a comparison with PSEN2 and APP mutations (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) suggests no differences in results among the mutation gene types. Owing to the younger age of the cohort, the prevalence of confounders such as vascular risk factors was low (<15%) in this cohort and not significantly different between carriers and noncarriers. Although the clinical and pathologic phenotypes of dominantly inherited Alz hei mer's disease are similar to those of sporadic Alz hei mer's disease, the generalizability of the nature and sequence of brain changes in autosomal dominant Alz hei- mer's disease remains to be determined for sporadic Alz hei mer's disease. The definition of the timing and magnitude of pathophysiological changes associated with Alz hei mer's disease has implications for the development and implementation of diagnostic and predictive tests and the design of prevention trials. 31 For example, our data suggest that amyloid deposition will develop and be detectable in all persons with a mutation while still asymptomatic, whereas no noncarriers had positive scans for amyloid deposition. If autosomal dominant Alzhei mer's disease is similar to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, this finding suggests that Alz hei mer's dementia will eventually develop in persons with positive scans for amyloid deposition. These findings suggest that the targeting of A\u03b2 earlier in the course of the disease may provide better clinical outcomes than the treatment of mild to moderate dementia after substantial neuronal and synaptic loss has occurred. 32 In summary, our findings indicate that the Alz hei mer's disease process begins more than 20 years before the clinical onset of dementia. Treatment and prevention trials can incorporate these pathophysiological changes to gauge the likelihood of future clinical success. Secondary prevention trials that are designed to prevent or delay cognitive and clinical impairment may ultimately test the amyloid hypothesis, just as the cholesterol hypothesis of heart disease was tested three decades ago. 33 Supported by the National Institute on Aging and a private nonprofit foundation (see disclosure at NEJM.org).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank the participants and their families for their altruism; the DIAN research and support staff at each of the participating sites for their contributions to this study; and Martha Storandt for input and revisions to an earlier draft of the manuscript."}]
