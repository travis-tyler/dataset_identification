[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with no known therapies. Clinical, neuropathological, and genetic studies have suggested both overlap and divergence between the pathogenesis of CAA and the biologically related condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the genetic loci associated with AD are APOE and TOMM40, a gene in close proximity to APOE. We investigate here whether variants within TOMM40 are associated with CAA-related ICH and CAA neuropathology. Using cohorts from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we designed a comparative analysis of high-density SNP genotype data for CAA-related ICH and AD. APOE \u03b54 was associated with CAA-related ICH and AD, while APOE \u03b52 was protective in AD but a risk factor for CAA. A total of 14 SNPs within TOMM40 were associated with AD (p< 0.05 after multiple testing correction), but not CAA-related \nVascular deposition of \u00df-amyloid or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common pathological finding in older persons [1, 2] and, in its severest form, is a leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly [3] [4] [5] [6] . CAArelated ICH accounts for up to 40 % of all nontraumatic ICH and is associated with a 30-50 % rate of mortality, yet lacks any known therapies [7] [8] [9] . CAA is a common finding at autopsy among the elderly and advanced CAA is present in roughly 25 % of brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease [1, 10, 11 ]. Yet, ICH occurs only rarely among these groups. This contrast suggests that the development of ICH may involve a distinct set of biological pathways from those involved in vascular amyloid deposition.\nThe substantial biological overlap between CAA and AD is reflected in the conditions' shared genetic risk factors [12] [13] [14] . Recent progress in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has led to the identification of novel risk loci for AD [15, 16] . As expected, these GWAS have consistently yielded an association signal at the 19q13.2 locus, where APOE is located. Accumulating data, however, have raised the possibility that the signal at 19q13.2 may not be entirely due to APOE, but may be the result of association with variants in other genes as well.\nAmong the genes at 19q13.2 is TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), which encodes a membrane-bound mitochondrial protein that occupies the same linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block as APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 (Fig. 1) . Some studies have suggested that genetic variation within TOMM40 is associated with AD risk and age at onset [17, 18] . Definitive testing of this association has not been possible, because the strong LD between TOMM40 and APOE prohibits the independent testing of variants within these two genes in standard genetic association studies.\nWe chose to leverage the genetic and biological similarities between CAA-related ICH and AD in order to clarify the relationship between TOMM40 and CAA-related ICH [19, 20] . Genetic variants within APOE, specifically alleles \u03b52 and \u03b54, both potently affect risk for both conditions. APOE \u03b54 increases risk of both AD and CAA, while \u03b52 reduces AD risk but raises the risk of ICH related to CAA [14, 21] . Strikingly, while the size of the effect of APOE on risk of AD and CAA is roughly similar, GWAS of equal power reveal no association for CAA-related ICH, but significant association for AD (Online Resource 1 and Online Resource 2).\nUsing genome-wide genotyping data, we performed a comparative genetic analysis of TOMM40 variants in CAA-related ICH and AD to determine whether TOMM40 associates with CAA-related ICH. This analysis was performed in individuals from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH-CAA). We used gene-set analysis to further characterize any genetic differences that emerged. Analysis was then extended to related histopathological phenotypes among individuals recruited through the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP).\nMethods\nSubjects\nGenotype and phenotype data for CAA cases and controls were collected at MGH as part of an ongoing genome-wide association study of intracerebral hemorrhage [14] . Subjects are individuals with ICH aged>55 years, who present to the emergency departments of participating centers and fulfill the criteria for definite or probable CAA-related ICH according to the Boston criteria [10, 22] . In order to minimize inclusion of subjects with undiagnosed AD in the CAA group, we excluded ICH cases with a history of dementia prior to development of the CAA-related ICH, based on interview of the patient or an informant at the time of hemorrhage [14] . Study participation was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board, and all subjects or proxies provided informed consent.\nParticipants were selected from the ADNI database (http:// www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). The ADNI is a large, multisite, collaborative effort launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the US Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a public-private partnership aimed at testing whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early AD. The ADNI, led by principal investigator Michale Weiner, MD, is the product of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, with patients recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada (http://www.adni-info.org). Subjects were prospectively screened and followed according to the ADNI study protocol [23] . The degree of clinical severity for each subject was evaluated by an annual semistructured interview, which generated an overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score and the CDR Sum of Boxes [24] . The Mini-Mental State Examination [25] and a neuropsychological battery were also conducted.\nAD cases and Cognitively Normal Controls (CNC) were selected from the ADNI database based upon their most recent diagnosis at follow-up. Specifically, participants were selected from the ADNI database if they were clinically classified at follow-up as either: (1) Cognitively Normal Controls (CNC) with CDR00; or (2) AD individuals who met criteria for probable AD (CDR 1). In order to minimize the chance that clinically symptomatic CAA subjects (i.e., with a past medical history of ICH) could be included in the AD case-control analysis, we excluded all participants with pre-enrollment history of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).\nThe Religious Orders Study (ROS), which began in 1994, enrolled older Catholic priests, nuns, and brothers (aged \u226553 years) from about 40 groups in 12 states [26] . Since January 1994, 1,166 participants, of whom 1,027 were non-Hispanic white, have completed their baseline evaluation. The follow-up rate of survivors exceeds 90 % as does the autopsy rate (546 autopsies of 581 deaths, of whom 516 were non-Hispanic white). Participants were free of known dementia at enrollment.\nThe Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which began in 1997, enrolled older men and women (aged \u226555 years) free of known dementia from retirement communities in the Chicago area [27] . Since October 1997, 1,533 participants, of whom 1,332 were non-Hispanic white, completed their baseline evaluation. The follow-up rate exceeds 90 %, and the autopsy rate exceeds 80 % (431 autopsies of 527 deaths, of whom 414 were non-Hispanic white).\nParticipants in both studies agreed to annual clinical evaluations and signed both an informed consent and an Anatomic Gift Act form, donating their brains to Rush investigators at the time of death. All clinical and pathological data were collected, and analyses were performed by study personnel blinded to genotype data. The clinical diagnosis of AD was based on the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association [28] . In addition to the diagnosis made at follow-up visits, clinical data were also reviewed at time of death by a neurologist, who did not have access to postmortem pathologic data, and a summary diagnostic opinion was created regarding the most likely clinical diagnosis (AD or normal cognition).\nAll brains were examined for pathological markers of AD using modified Bielschwoski silver stain. Summary measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were created from separate counts in five brain regions: midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, enterhinal cortices, and the hippocampal CA1 sector.

This contrast points to the possibility that the biological pathways involved in amyloid-related vessel rupture may differ from those implicated in the vascular amyloid deposition that must, of necessity, precede it. The Boston Criteria allow diagnosis of CAA-related ICH with a very high degree of accuracy [22, 43] . Virtually all patients with CAA-related ICH in the present study can therefore be assumed to have histopathologically severe vascular amyloid deposition. None of the subjects in ROS or MAP, on the other hand, had ICH despite the presence of often extensive amyloid deposition within the cerebral vessels. While vascular amyloid deposition is a common finding in the aging brain, CAA-related ICH, diagnosed through the Boston Criteria, which combines clinical, imaging, and pathological (if available) parameters [22] , is substantially less common. Furthermore, our exploratory gene-set analysis raises the hypothesis that additional variants within the TOM complex influence susceptibility to AD, particularly TOMM20 and TOMM7. While replication of these findings is essential, gene-set analysis raises the possibility that TOMM40 may play a role in clinical expression and pathological changes in AD, including vascular amyloid deposition, but not in the ICH that occurs in CAA. These results raise the hypothesis that the TOMM40-mediated increase in vascular amyloid does not trigger the breakdown in the vessel wall that leads to ICH. Potential explanations include the possibility that the TOMM40-mediated effect is insufficiently severe, or alternatively could be part of a biological pathway that is separate from the pathway that leads to vessel rupture. Vessel rupture is an aspect of CAA-related ICH that appears to involve mechanisms that are distinct from those in AD. The most striking demonstration of this is the divergent role played by APOE e2 in AD and CAA. APOE e2 promotes CAA-related vessel rupture without stimulating either plaque or vascular amyloid deposition [44, 45] .\nApoE, the apolipoprotein product of the APOE gene, acts as a transporter of cholesterol and lipids [46] . The gene has three major polymorphic forms (\u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 alleles), and it is these isoforms that modulate amyloid-\u03b2 metabolism and accumulation in the brain [21] . ApoE plays a critical role in transforming amyloid-\u03b2 from a monomeric, nontoxic molecule into a toxic, higher-molecular-weight form [21] . Whether TOMM40 might produce its effect through interaction with APOE e2 requires further study, although the LD between the two genes makes it impossible to answer this question within the present study design.\nThe TOMM40 gene encodes Tom40, a subunit of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex which lies in the mitochondria and is involved in transporting cytoplasmic peptides and proteins during mitochondrial biogenesis [18] . The role of Tom40 in regulating protein traffic across the outer mitochondrial membrane appears to be important in the development of AD, perhaps because of the unique bioenergetic requirements of neurons [47, 48] . Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative imbalance have been linked to neuronal cell death and AD [18] . Amyloid-\u03b2 appears to contribute to mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysregulation of internal Ca 2+ homeostasis, ultimately leading to impairment of the electron transport chain, reduction in ATP production, and increased production of superoxide anion radicals [48] . TOM is one of two complexes that form the major pathway for mitochondrial import of precursor proteins, the second being the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) [49] . Experiments in isolated rat mitochondria [49] demonstrate that amyloid-\u03b2 is selectively transported into mitochondria using the TOM complex. Amyloid-\u03b2 import into the mitochondria through the TOM complex may facilitate its toxic effects on neurons [49] .\nThe limitations of our study render our findings preliminary. Through the International Stroke Genetics Consortium, we have assembled a substantial proportion of available cases of definite and probable CAA-related ICH with accompanying genotype data. There is no existing CAA-related ICH cohort in which to replicate our findings. An additional important limitation is that there was insufficient coverage on the genome-wide genotyping platforms used of the TOM complex to allow inclusion of all available genes that contribute to the final protein assembly. Thus, for example, TOMM5 and TOMM6 could not be analyzed at all due to an absence of genotyped SNPs in their gene regions. We also did not evaluate any SNPs in the TOMs other than TOMM40 in relation to the pathological expression of vascular or parenchymal amyloid. Nonetheless, while our results are unreplicated, a number of features suggest they may not be false positive. The Breslow-Day p values for assessment of heterogeneity of effects were corrected for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, we detected heterogeneity between AD and CAA-related ICH for genes in the TOM complex that are not part of the 19q13.2 locus and therefore segregate fully independently of the locus. Results of multivariate logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression analyses of association of variants in TOMM40 and APOE with neuritic and diffuse plaque count and histological CAA.\nReported p values are adjusted for 235 independent tests using Bonferroni correction. APOE SNPs were directly genotyped, while SNPs within TOMM40 are derived from genome-wide genotyping with imputation as described above. Only SNPs with adjusted p<0.05 in AD case-control analysis are reported AD0Alzheimer's disease, BP0base pairs, CAA0cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Chrom0chromosome, OR0odds ratio, 95 % CI095 % confidence interval"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, through comparisons between association signals for CAA-related ICH and AD as well as histopathological phenotypes, we provide evidence that genetic variation within TOMM40 is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, parenchymal, and vascular amyloid deposition, but may have little, if any, role in the pathways that lead from CAA to ICH. Further studies are required to replicate our findings and to clarify the functional consequences of TOMM40 variants in AD."}]
