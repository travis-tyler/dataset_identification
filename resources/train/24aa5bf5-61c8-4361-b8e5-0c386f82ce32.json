[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Three satellite observational datasets and a reanalysis dataset during the period 2001-09 are used to examine four water budget components (total precipitable water, surface evaporation, precipitation, and column-integrated moisture flux convergence) associated with western North Pacific tropical cyclones (TCs) of different intensity change categories: rapidly intensifying, slowly intensifying, neutral, and weakening. The results show that surface evaporation plays an important role in storm rapid intensification (RI) and the highest evaporation associated with rapidly intensifying TCs is associated with the highest sea surface temperature. Total precipitable water in the outer environment, where moisture is mainly provided by surface evaporation, is also vital to storm RI because RI is favored when there is less dry air intruded into the storm circulation. The roles of surface evaporation and total precipitable water in storm RI are related to the enhanced convective available potential energy by moistening and warming the boundary layer. The largest amount of column-integrated moisture flux convergence associated with weakening TCs, which results in the heaviest precipitation, is because their strongest mean intensity promotes moisture transport.

Timely and precise forecasting of TC track and intensity are therefore essential to mitigate these hazards. Although both track and intensity prediction have been significantly improved in recent decades, TC intensity prediction still lags track prediction (DeMaria et al. 2014) and skill of rapid intensification prediction is still poor and thus remains an operational challenge (Kaplan et al. 2010) .\nDifficulties in rapid intensification prediction are mainly due to our limited understanding of its associated complex physical processes (e.g., Wang and Wu 2004) , which mainly include large-scale environmental controls such as vertical wind shear, relative humidity (RH), upper-level trough interactions, and synoptic flow patterns (e.g., DeMaria 1996; Hanley et al. 2001; Hendricks et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015) ; air-sea interactions like transfer of high air-sea heat fluxes associated with warm core rings and/or large ocean heat content (e.g., Emanuel 1986; Shay et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2005; Wada and Usui 2007; Lin et al. 2008 Lin et al. , 2009 Gao and Chiu 2010; Lin et al. 2014; Jaimes et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2016a,b) ; and inner-core dynamics Earth System Modelling Center Contribution Number 160. and thermodynamics such as latent heat release, convective bursts, hot towers, and mid-to upper-level warm core (e.g., Zhang and Chen 2012; Chen and Zhang 2013; Zagrodnik and Jiang 2014; Rogers et al. 2015; Tao and Jiang 2015; Zhuge et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2017a) .\nWater budget components generally contain total precipitable water (TPW), surface evaporation, precipitation, and moisture flux convergence (MFC). Given RH is calculated from both specific humidity and temperature, RH could be an indicator of specific humidity if temperature is a constant. Although RH/TPW has been used as predictors in statistical typhoon intensity prediction schemes (e.g., Knaff et al. 2005; Gao and Chiu 2012) and in probabilistic rapid intensification prediction models (e.g., Kaplan et al. 2010; Shu et al. 2012; Kaplan et al. 2015) , the moisture in the storm environment is still a poorly understood factor affecting storm intensity. High RH at the lower and midtroposphere appears to be necessary for storm rapid intensification (Kaplan and DeMaria 2003; Emanuel et al. 2004; Kaplan et al. 2010; Shu et al. 2012) , whereas Hendricks et al. (2010) argued that lower-and midlevel box average RH in the environment of rapidly intensifying (RI) TCs and slowly intensifying (SI) TCs are quite similar. Dry air intrusions can weaken TCs by enhancing convectively driven downdrafts and associated boundary layer cooling (e.g., Dunion and Velden 2004; Ge et al. 2013) , while idealized simulations (Braun et al. 2012) show that only dry air close to the vortex center leads to asymmetric convection and slows storm development after entraining into the storm circulation. Through modeling studies, Wang (2009) suggested a negative impact of extensive moisture on storm intensity by promoting the formation of outer spiral rainbands. However, by modifying RH beyond 150 km of the storm center, Hill and Lackmann (2009) showed no distinct differences in the maximum 10-min wind speed despite various outer rainband activities.\nObservational studies have investigated the relationship of moisture with Atlantic TC intensity change using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data. Shu and Wu (2009) suggested that the dry Saharan air layer (SAL) air could be either favorable or unfavorable for intensification of Atlantic TCs, depending on its location relative to TC center. Wu et al. (2012) found that RI Atlantic TCs were associated with a sharp decrease of 400-300-hPa RH from 200 to 800 km beyond the TC center at the right-front quadrant of TC motion.\nObservational studies have also been conducted to examine other components of water budget associated with RI storms, such as precipitation (Gao and Chiu 2010; Jiang and Ramirez 2013; Zagrodnik and Jiang 2014; Alvey et al. 2015; Tao and Jiang 2015; Tao et al. 2017) , surface evaporation (latent heat flux, e.g., Gao and Chiu 2010; Gao et al. 2016b; Lin et al. 2009; Jaimes et al. 2015) and MFC (e.g., Yin et al. 2015) , and have revealed that RI storms have more symmetric patterns of rainfall and latent heat flux, higher latent heat flux, but less moisture transport than non-RI storms. However, no studies have compared the roles of four water budget components in rapid intensification of WNP TCs and the large-scale environments over the WNP is quite different from those over the Atlantic. In the lower troposphere during summer, the mean circulation over the WNP is characterized by a confluence region of monsoon westerlies and trade easterlies while there is no monsoon trough and strong easterly trade winds dominate in the Atlantic (e.g., Fu et al. 2012) . Therefore, the objectives of this study are to examine the relationship of TPW, precipitation, and surface evaporation from satellite observations and MFC from reanalysis data with intensity change of WNP TCs.\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes data and methodology. Results are presented in section 3. Summary and discussion are given in section 4."}, {"section_title": "Data and methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. Data", "text": "The 6-hourly TC best track data were obtained from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Longitude and latitude of TC center, radius of maximum wind (RMW), and maximum 1-min sustained wind speed (V max ) were used in the present study. Estimates of near-surface RMW for scenes with and without clear eyes have been routinely provided by applying the advanced Dvorak technique on satellite infrared and microwave images (Kossin et al. 2007; Olander and Velden 2007) since 2001, and subjective determination may also be involved in the operational process (Chen et al. 2011) . Note that we omitted a few TCs without RMW estimates in the JTWC best track archives in accordance with Gao et al. (2016a) and Gao et al. (2017a) .\nPrecipitation data were taken from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 (Huffman et al. 2007) . TRMM satellite covers a global region from 408S to 408N. Precipitation was estimated from multiple satellites as well as gauge analyses where possible, the spatial and temporal resolutions are 0.258 and 3-hourly, respectively. TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) TPW estimates produced by Remote Sensing Systems (Wentz et al. 2015) were also used. Daily TPW data contains ascending and descending orbit segments at a resolution of 0.258.\nSurface evaporation data were derived from the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer, version 3 (IFREMER3; Bentamy et al. 2013) , air-sea latent heat flux product at daily and 0.258 resolutions, which is calculated using the bulk flux algorithm and input variables such as Quick Scatterometer (QuikS-CAT) winds, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) daily optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (SST), and near-surface specific humidity estimated from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures. SST data in the IFREMER3 product were also used in this study.\nColumn-integrated MFC was calculated using wind vector, specific humidity (derived from temperature and relative humidity), and surface pressure data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final (FNL) Operational Global Analysis at 1.08 and 6-h resolutions. The upper-bound pressure for the integration was 100 hPa. Pseudoadiabatic convective available potential energy (CAPE) when an air parcel was lifted from 1000 hPa was also computed from FNL mixing ratio (derived from temperature and relative humidity) and temperature profiles following Emanuel (1994) .\nThe abovementioned datasets were collected over the period 2001-09, during which all the above datasets are available. In total 217 WNP TCs attaining at least tropical storm strength (V max . 17 m s"}, {"section_title": "21", "text": ") were included in this study.\n) for classification represent 28%, 58%, and 90% of the total DV 24 samples, respectively. The resulting fraction of RI samples is 10% and the fractions of SI, N, and W samples are all about 30%. The RI definition of DV 24 $ 30 kt was based on previous studies (Kaplan and DeMaria 2003; Kaplan et al. 2010 Kaplan et al. , 2015 , its percentile of 90% over the WNP during our study period is similar to that of 92% and 91% over the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific, respectively (Kaplan et al. 2015) . Consistent with Carrasco et al. (2014) , RMW is negatively correlated with intensity change except for the W category with the least RMW. This is\nlikely due to the highest storm intensity of W storms, because a TC tends to be stronger with smaller RMW at the peak intensity (Willoughby and Rahn 2004) .\nBecause it is well known that the TC asymmetry is primarily influenced by vertical wind shear (e.g., Corbosiero and Molinari 2003; Chen et al. 2006) , composites of water budget components at the initial time (i.e., t 5 0 h) were therefore performed in shear-relative coordinate systems for each intensity change category. The shear vectors were northward oriented in the composite maps, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Corbosiero and Molinari 2003; Chen et al. 2006; Gao et al. 2017b) . The x and y axes in the composite maps of TPW, precipitation, evaporation, and SST were normalized by the RMW while the normalization was not applied to those variables derived from FNL data due to the relatively coarse resolution.\nUsing FNL wind data, 6-hourly 200-850-hPa mean vertical wind shear (VWS) over an annular region of 200-800 km from the storm center was computed after applying a vortex removal technique described in Kurihara et al. (1990 Kurihara et al. ( , 1993 , since Paterson et al. (2005) showed that the calculations of VWS without the TC vortex were superior. Locations of the storm centers and VWS vectors at the observational time of TMI were linearly interpolated from 6-hourly JTWC best track and VWS data. The magnitude and direction of VWS for each category are indicated in Table 2 . RI storms have apparently lower shear than non-RI storms and W storms have the strongest shear, as VWS is detrimental to TC intensification (e.g., DeMaria 1996). However, the direction of shear vector does not show significant difference among RI, SI, and N categories, which exhibit mean easterly shear while W storms exhibit mean westerly shear."}, {"section_title": "b. Description of water budget", "text": "The total moisture tendency at a constant pressure level is determined by the horizontal and vertical moisture advections and the atmospheric apparent moisture sink Q 2 (Yanai et al. 1973) :\nwhere q is the specific humidity, t is the time, V is the horizontal wind vector, = is the horizontal gradient operator, v is the vertical velocity, p is the pressure, and L is the latent heat of evaporation.

Methods", "text": "The term DV 24 is defined as the 24-h change in V max from t 5 0 to t 5 124 h and was used to define four intensity change categories: weakening (W), neutral (N), SI, and RI following previous studies (Jiang and Ramirez 2013; Gao et al. 2016b) . The definition, sample size and percentage, mean initial (i.e., t 5 0 h) intensity, and RMW of each category are shown in Table 1 . It should be noted that TC samples made landfall (which refers to the storm center crossing the coastline) or underwent extratropical transition (which is marked in the JTWC best track data), during any time of the 24-h periods, were omitted. The thresholds of 210, 10, and 30 kt (1 kt 5 0.5144 m s"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a. TPW", "text": "Although TPW variability tends to increase with increasing radius, the TPW tendency within the maximum storm size (normally several hundred to a thousand kilometers) is often negligible (Jiang et al. 2008) , thus the TPW itself is analyzed instead. The composite shear-relative distribution and radial mean of TPW for each intensity change category are indicated in Fig. 1 . Compared to mean TPW of 51.5 mm for the moist tropical sounding discussed in Dunion (2011) , TPW associated with TC circulation is generally much higher. The moist inner-core regions of all the categories are well represented; all the storms show the highest TPW of about 66-68 mm in the core regions. RI storms have higher TPW than non-RI storms in the relatively outer environment (beyond six RMWs) while RI storms have comparable TPW to the non-RI storms in the inner environment (within five RMWs), suggesting that high TPW in the outer environment is vital to storm rapid intensification. All the non-RI storms have relatively low TPW in the outer environment left of shear, especially for W storms that are associated with the lowest TPW beyond three RMWs among all four categories, indicating that dry air intrusion tends to inhibit storm rapid intensification. This is consistent with the use of TPW in enhancing statistical prediction of rapid intensification (Kaplan et al. 2015) and because high TPW implies that the amount of dry air advected into the storm circulation is relatively low and thus rapid intensification is favored. Surprisingly, W storms have as high TPW as RI storms within two RMWs. The high TPW in W storms may result from their high initial intensity (Table 1 ) and strong MFC (see Fig. 4 ) because another moisture source term surface evaporation of W storms is the lowest (Fig. 2) among four categories."}, {"section_title": "b. Surface evaporation", "text": "Surface evaporation is proportional to 10-m wind speed and SST (e.g., Gao et al. 2016b) , thus the roles of 10-m wind speed and SST in determining surface evaporation are compared. The composite shear-relative distributions and radial means of surface evaporation and SST for each intensity change category are indicated in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. The mean magnitude of 10-m wind speed for each category is proportional to mean storm intensity (e.g., Gao et al. 2016b ) that is shown in Table 1 . RI storms have much higher surface evaporation and more symmetric pattern of surface evaporation than non-RI storms in all the quadrants (Fig. 2) . Compared to storms in three non-RI categories, RI storms do not have the highest initial intensity (Table 1) but have the highest SST (Fig. 3) , thus the difference in surface evaporation between RI and non-RI storms is dominated by SST. The W storms show the lowest SST (Fig. 3 ) but higher surface evaporation than the N storms (Fig. 2) because of their high initial intensity (Table 1) . Surface evaporation decreases with increasing radius for all the categories, indicating that its radial profile is determined by 10-m winds.\nThe differences in surface evaporation and SST between RI storms and non-RI storms are statistically significant based on the Student's t test. Although surface evaporation of TCs is underestimated due to underestimation of 10-m winds by satellite microwave sensors (e.g., Gao et al. 2016b) , the comparison results demonstrate that high surface evaporation, which is 3014 dominated by high SST, is favorable for storm rapid intensification.\nc. MFC Figure 4 shows the composite shear-relative distribution and radial mean of column-integrated MFC for each intensity change category. Only areas within the radius of 300 km from the storm center are shown because MFC is concentrated in this area and there are few differences beyond this radius. Column-integrated MFC is always stronger on the downshear side for each category, with the maximum near the downshear direction, where W storms show the strongest column-integrated MFC probably resulting from their highest initial intensity (Table 1 ) and RI FIG. 3 . As in Fig. 1, but for SST (8C) .\nstorms show the weakest among categories, in agreement with Yin et al. (2015) who showed stronger MFC of non-RI storms than RI storms. The order in the magnitudes of MFC differs from that of storm intensity (Table 1) , indicating that specific humidity also plays a role in determining the magnitudes of MFC for different categories.\nd. Precipitation Figure 5 shows the composite shear-relative distribution and radial mean of precipitation for each intensity change category. The precipitation maximum is always located in the downshear left quadrant regardless of intensity change, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Chen et al. 2006; Wingo and Cecil 2010; Yu et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2017b ). The W storms have the highest precipitation, followed by RI, SI, and N storms, consistent with the order in the magnitude of mean storm intensity (Table 1 ) among categories. This is different from Zagrodnik and Jiang (2014) due to their exclusion of category 3-5 TCs, which often produce heavy rainfall, and those samples in the decaying stage of category 3-5 TCs are mostly classified into the W category. Compared to SI and N storms, additional precipitation of RI storms (Fig. 5) is supported by the moisture from FIG. 5 .

This result supports the observational findings by Alvey et al. (2015) , Tao and Jiang (2015) , and Tao et al. (2017) that the onset of storm rapid intensification is not accompanied by deep convection producing heavy rainfall. Deep convection and heavy rainfall often occur in a short period before the end of storm rapid intensification (Tao and Jiang 2015) , resulting in the heaviest precipitation at the beginning of the weakening stage (Fig. 5) supplied by the largest column-integrated MFC (Fig. 4) .\nIt is noted that the maxima of column-integrated MFC and precipitation do not overlay.

As in Fig. 4 , but for CAPE (J kg 21 )."}, {"section_title": "3018", "text": "( Fig. 5) relative to the maximum downshear columnintegrated MFC (Fig. 4) is due to advection of hydrometeors by TC tangential winds (e.g., Gao et al. 2017b ).\ne. Convective instability Figure 6 shows the composite shear-relative distributions and radial means of pseudoadiabatic CAPE for four intensity change categories. CAPE is positively correlated with storm intensification rate. RI storms have the largest CAPE among categories and are thus associated with the strongest convection around the storm center, which is favorable for storm rapid intensification. To examine the roles of surface evaporation and TPW in the largest CAPE of RI storms, vertical profiles of differences in specific humidity, temperature, and equivalent potential temperature (u e ) between RI and other non-RI categories averaged within 300 km of the storm center are indicated in Fig. 7 . Mean profiles of these variables for all the TCs averaged within the same area are indicated in Fig. 8 . Based on the mean u e profile (Fig. 8c) , temperature and specific humidity from the surface to around 500 hPa could contribute to CAPE variations. Compared to non-RI storms, RI storms are associated with higher temperature and specific humidity in the boundary layer (Fig. 7 , also higher outerregion TPW in Fig. 1 ) due to more moisture and heat exchange with underlying ocean in the surface evaporation process (Fig. 2) , resulting in higher boundary layer u e (Fig. 7 ) that contributes to larger CAPE (Fig. 6) .\nIn addition to the contribution of boundary layer thermodynamics, cooler midtroposphere of the RI category than other categories (Fig. 7b) and drier midtroposphere of the RI category than the W category (Fig. 7a) equate to boosted CAPE of RI storms. The warmest free troposphere of W storms is likely because of their strongest warm cores being associated with the highest storm intensity (e.g., Gao et al. 2017a) . The wettest free troposphere of W storms and the driest lower and middle atmosphere of RI storms (Fig. 7a) are possibly related to the associated moisture transports (Fig. 4) and consumptions (i.e., precipitation; Fig. 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Summary and discussion", "text": "Four water budget components (i.e., precipitation, surface evaporation, column-integrated MFC, and TPW) associated with different intensity change categories of FIG. 7 . Vertical profiles of differences in (a) specific humidity (g kg 21 ), (b) temperature (K), and (c) equivalent potential temperature (K) between RI and SI categories (red), between RI and N categories (green), and between RI and W categories (blue) averaged within 300 km of the storm center.\nWNP TCs are examined using satellite observational and reanalysis datasets during the period 2001-09. Among those water budget components, surface evaporation, which is dominated by SST, plays a crucial role in storm rapid intensification. TPW in the outer environment is also vital to rapid intensification. The highest TPW of RI storms in the outer environment is mainly provided by ocean surface evaporation since column-integrated MFC of RI storms is weak and precipitation of RI storms is relatively large. The roles of surface evaporation and TPW in storm RI are related to the enhanced CAPE by moistening and warming the boundary layer. In addition to boundary layer thermodynamics, midlevel thermodynamics also play a role in the large CAPE of RI storms. The largest amount of column-integrated moisture flux convergence associated with weakening TCs, which results in the heaviest precipitation, is due to their strong mean intensity, which promotes moisture transport. The results suggest that different water budget components play different roles in TC intensity change. Numerical experiments are desired in future studies to identify the relative importance of TPW in the outer environment and surface evaporation in rapid intensification of WNP TCs.\nThe positive relationship between TC precipitation and storm intensity is consistent with the viewpoint that TC precipitation amount is likely a positive feedback rather than the trigger of storm rapid intensification (Tao and Jiang 2015; Tao et al. 2017) . The finding of the largest precipitation being associated with W storms is plausibly in line with previous studies (e.g., Barnes et al. 1983; Powell 1990a,b; Wang 2002; Didlake and Houze 2009; Frisius and Hasselbeck 2009; Wang 2009; Li et al. 2014 Li et al. , 2015 , which have suggested that strong downdrafts and evaporative cooling associated with increased precipitation (Fig. 5) could reduce TC intensity by bringing low u e air from the middle troposphere down to the inflow boundary layer and suppressing eyewall convection when these low values of u e could not be restored by extracting heat and moisture from the ocean surface through oceanic evaporation process (Fig. 2) . Thus, the TC environment is relatively dry (Fig. 1) , in agreement with the notion that a competition between surface moisture and heat fluxes and low-entropy downdrafts into the boundary layer is responsible for TC intensity change (Powell 1990b; Riemer et al. 2010; Tang and Emanuel 2012; Molinari et al. 2013) , because a warm and moist boundary layer helps boost CAPE (Figs. 6 and 7), which is favorable for storm intensification and vice versa. The water budget of TCs presented in this study is not balanced because of the uncertainties in each dataset, especially in the core region, although this should not affect our main conclusions. Surface evaporation in the core region should be underestimated, since QuikSCAT tends to underestimate high winds there due to algorithm limitations particularly in the presence of heavy rain (e.g., Quilfen et al. 2010) . MFC in the core region should also be underestimated because TC winds are underestimated by FNL analysis primarily due to its coarse spatial resolution (e.g., Gao et al. 2017b ). Version 7 (v7) of TRMM 3B42, TMI, and Precipitation Radar tend to overestimate TC precipitation over the ocean, particularly heavy rain near the eyewall Zagrodnik and Jiang 2013) . The observed water budget balance of TCs would be expected if all the datasets are perfectly improved, though it seems like an impossible mission in the near future."}]
