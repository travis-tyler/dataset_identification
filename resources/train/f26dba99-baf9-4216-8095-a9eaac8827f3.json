[{"section_title": "", "text": "According to Kerlin (1995a), first-generation students are not expected to survive to doctorate degree attainment because of vulnerability to negative affects associated with their status; yet persist they do at East Tennessee State University. The desire to study the first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education and the limited number of first-generation graduate studies available, especially in the academic field of education, promoted developing this study. It was the intent of this study to offer additional empirical research toward understanding variables associated with firstgeneration persistence as encountered by East Tennessee State University's Doctors of education. Quantitative analysis derived through survey research served as an explanatory framework to investigate major variables of first-generation persistence. The survey targeted East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education who received degrees prior to June 2004. Investigation of empirical evidence revealed that unlike previous first-generation studies (Hayes, 1997;Hurley, 2002;Inman and Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;NCES, 1998;Terenzini, Springer, Yaeger, Pascarella, and Nora, 1996) the bulk (73.7%) of East Tennessee State University Doctors of Education were first-generation. Moreover, although previous studies suggested the presence of unique barriers attributed to firstgeneration status, no significant differences resulted in either identification or ranking of barriers or facilitators to degree attainment between first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education and their non-first-generation counterparts. The Survey of ETSU Doctors of Education requested respondents to prioritize identified barriers and facilitators. After plotting significant bivariate coordinate pairs among ranked barriers and facilitators, flat line (zero sloped) clusters depicted the presence of 6 weak monotone associations among variables. Facilitator rankings were associated with a respondent's age, parental college attendance, and education specialist degree, while barrier rankings were associated with a respondent's marital status at the time of degree attainment, secondary support source, and post doctorate employment."}, {"section_title": "DEDICATION I dedicate this paper to", "text": "The memory of committee member and mentor, Dr. \"Russ\" West; The memories of my first educators, Grandma Gertrude and Pop; The memory of my role model of persistence, Aunt Lee; My role model of independence, Mother Phyllis; My soul mate, helpmate, and life-partner, Husband David; Our beloved children Byron and William who prompted renewed strength; and Unnamed friends and family who tempered my iron will more often than necessary. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I believe acknowledgements begin with thanking God, my eternal teacher. My faith in God's insight and teachings has never wavered, yet strength to continue this combined professional and personal journey to degree attainment has been anything but steady. As a life-long learner, I acknowledge there are lessons still to be learned in both formal and personal classrooms; however, I am thankful that God has been with me and will be there tomorrow for the next step in my journey. This study is a collective acknowledgement of the brave and strong spirited individuals who succeeded, according to Kerlin (1995a), in the face of overwhelming odds favoring failure. Like a metaphoric bumblebee, first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education were not supposed to attain great heights, but seemingly unaware of their perceived limitations by others, they buzzed aloft to degree attainment. It has been a pleasure and an inspiration to trace their path. Vasquez's assistance was instrumental in successfully meeting deadlines and completing lengthy but necessary paperwork for the University's institutional review board process. Mrs. Proffitt's wisdom with nurturing overtones was often an oasis of insight just when I believed myself within a desert. I would like to acknowledge personal guidance received from special friend Mrs. Linda Rowe. Many have observed Mrs. Rowe's determination in a classroom environment, and her quality of never giving up personally. The combination of both qualities in one small body is that which I relied upon when believing this study would never be successfully completed. Without Linda's guidance and sometimes-swift red number six shoe placed strategically, this scarecrow would not have made it to Oz Finally, I would like to acknowledge the collective spirit of my most nurturing family. David, my eternal soul mate is more than just a husband of 33 years; he is my best friend. Sons Byron and William are the source of renewed strength and are indeed God's blessings and source or renewed strength. My family, more than even the completion of this study and degree attainment mean everything to me and I acknowledge they are the foremost reasons for my never, never giving up.

Of the comparatively few first-generation graduate studies available, most were over 10 years old and none targeted education (Bae, Coyle, & Tuckman, 1990;Baird, 1993;Bowen, Lorad, & Sosa, 1991;Chatman, 1994;Curran, 2001;Golde & Dore, 2001;Kerlin 1995b)."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This study addressed the following research questions: 1.

Both Hurley and Swail suggested that early intervention in developing first-generation students was the key to increasing first-generation attainment rates. The design of this study is to assist policymakers, administrators, faculty, and other researchers addressing challenges of intervention and institutional governance reform required by first-generation graduate students. This study offers empirical data collected regarding facilitators and barriers encountered to graduation by East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education and adds to the limited collection of literature available previously. When comparing East Tennessee State University's first-generation majority enrollment to negative affects attributed to first-generation status by most reviewed studies (Chatman, 1994;Hayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;London, 1996;McConnell, 2000;Mitchell, 1997;Norfles & Mortenson, 2002;Terenzini et al., 1996), a primary issue arose. If first-generation East Tennessee State University students persisted to become doctors of education, how did they beat odds favoring attrition? While attempting to resolve this issue, this researcher discovered neither national nor regional available studies targeted first-generation doctors of education. This study specifically targets barriers and facilitators to graduation as experienced by first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education. By comparing first-generation doctors to their non-first-generation counterparts, this study is significant in that it offers findings for contribution to empirical first-generation research not available previously. Moreover, by targeting the specific population of East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education, this study significantly reduced errors described by Worthen and Sanders (1988) as generalizability errors encountered when attempting to transfer other studies' findings (Chatman, 1994;Hurley 2002;Norfles & Mortenson, 2002)  3.

First-generation students nationally are less likely to attempt graduate courses than non-first-generation. In addition to the two primary trends discovered, this study explored how they arose by expanding on supportative secondary trends. The primary trends are shown below under the sub-headings of attainment and first-generation."}, {"section_title": "Attainment", "text": "Nationally reported doctoral attainment rates in all fields of study fluctuated in the decade between 1993 and 2003. Attainment rates during this time interval were lowest in 1993 with 39,754 doctorates conferred and peaked in 2001 with 44,930 doctorates conferred (NCES, 1998a(NCES, , 1998b(NCES, , 1998cNRC, 1995a;NSF, 2002aNSF, , 2002b. Bae et al. (1990, p.5) suggested that intensity of doctorate attrition paralleled the rise in the lengthy time-to-degree. Bae et al. concluded that the more time spent in obtaining the doctorate, the more likely the student was to quit. Moreover, \"increased age at time of entry\" (p.3) was the variable that most negatively affected time-to-degree. Tluczek (1995) warned that a decrease in commitment and an increased time-todegree interval were overlapping barriers to graduation, especially among the graduate students who had completed text work but had not completed required dissertations. Tluczek suggested graduate students' lack of commitment resulted from combined infringements of family and/or employer demands and labeled graduate students who had difficulties in finishing their theses as all-but-dissertation, or \"ABDs\". According to Tluczek, the lack of self-discipline and commitment among ABD students contributed more to dissertation non-completion than a lengthy time-to-degree interval. Tluczek hinted that both lengthy time-to-degree intervals and increased attrition rates were a direct result of the inability of doctorate students to work independently. Kerlin (1995aKerlin ( , 1995b) echoed Tluczek's findings (1995) but described ABDs slightly different by including the completion of all text work and qualifying exams but not the dissertation. Kerlin's definition of the \"ABD phenomena\" (1995a) excluded graduate students who had not completed qualifying examinations. Kerlin suggested in his two-part doctoral study that institutions could take steps to assist students, especially ABD's, by better understanding issues affecting the students' progress and completion of doctorates, as well as students' continued success in the years following degree attainment. Kerlin described doctoral graduates from \"small public universities\" (1995a), as exhibiting a \"survival-of-the-fittest\" (1995b) mentality in comparison to noncompleters. Whatever ABD definition used, Tluczek and Kerlin both concluded that the inability of first-generation graduate students to work independently directly contributed to the length of time it took to obtain the degree and the longer the graduate student spent in obtaining the degree, the greater the likelihood of attrition. Golde and Dore (2001), Hurley (2002), Katz (2001), and Syverson (1996) mirrored Kerlin's (1995aKerlin's ( , 1995b and Tluczek's (1995) findings of high attrition rates associated with lengthy time-lines and first-generation status but adopted Kerlin's ABD definition. The National Research Council (1995a, 1995b, 1998 also supported Tluczek's and Kerlin's findings of negative affects to attrition attributed to lengthy timelines when stating: Although a longer time-to-degree \u2026does not necessarily lead to noncompletion [sic] for any individual student, the likelihood of not completing the degree increases with each additional year in doctoral study, based simply on the fact that each additional year of doctoral study carries with it a positive chance that a student will decide to drop out. (NRC, 1996) Katz (2001) echoed both Bae et al.'s (1990) and Tluczek's (1995) findings of negative affects to attrition contributed by lengthy graduation timelines but included the lack of finances as another attrition factor. In a study targeting graduate education attrition, Katz submitted surveys to every listed department chair on the American Historical Association's electronic mailing list asking for views and concerns about the future of graduate education. Katz suggested attrition resulted from two primary causes: lack of funding and lack of time The 2001 National Science Foundation [NSF] Survey of Earned Doctorates targeted time spent on obtaining the graduate degree and was the first survey to base calculations of time spent on the degree by doctorate recipients' direct responses. Prior to 2001, when collecting responses, the measurement of time graduates spent on the degree relied on use of a mathematical formula that calculated time based upon variables positioned on an educational history grid. According to doctorate recipients' responses collected for 2003 (Hoffer et al., 2004), the median total time span from baccalaureate to doctorate was shortest in the physical sciences with 7.9 years and longest in education with 18.  5 years, in 20035 years, in , virtually unchanged since 19975 years, in (Hoffer et al., 2004. Due in part to NSF's (2001) collection of direct responses, data provided clarifications to earlier National Research Council [NRC] findings (1995a[NRC] findings ( , 1996 that supported evidence of extended time increasing the risk of non-completion. Hoffer et al. (2004) cited the importance of collecting doctoral time-to-degree data by stating: The amount of time needed to complete a doctorate is a key concern for those pursuing the degree, as well as for the faculties and administrations of the degree-granting institutions and national public agencies and private organizations that support doctoral study. In an effort to include findings more reflective of doctor of education data within this study, pos -doctorate literature (Hill et al., 2004;Hoffer et al., 2004;NSF, 2001)  Although this study included post-doctoral studies among literature reviewed , neither doctoral nor post-doctoral literature yielded additional relationships specific to doctors of education beyond attainment totals (Golde & Dore, 2001;Hill, 2002;Hill et al., 2004;Hoffer et al., 2004;Katz, 2001;Kerlin 1995aKerlin , 1995bNCES, 1998c;NRC, 1995aNRC, , 1995bNRC, , 1996NRC, , 1998NSF, 2001NSF, , 2002aNSF, , 2002bNSF, , 2003Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System, 2002, 2004a to women \u2026 marking the second consecutive year U.S. women were awarded more doctorates than their male counterparts\" (Hoffer et al., 2004). Although described as small, gains in non-white doctorate attainment rates where observed as a trend. Hoffer et al.(2004) and the NSF(2002b  Female doctorate recipients were slightly more likely than their male counterparts [sic] to have a father and a mother who attended college or who earned an advanced degree. (Hoffer et al., 2004, p.20) Chatman (1994), Hayes (1997), Hsiao (1992), Hurley (2002), Inman and Mayes (1999), Khanh (2002), London (1992London ( , 1996, Mitchell (1997), NCES (1998b), Norfles and Mortenson (2002), and Padron (1992) also described first-generation students as the enrollment minority when comparing between first-generation students and their non-first-generation counterparts, especially in both education and humanities' doctorate degreed fields. When comparing the number of first-generation doctorates between the fields of education and humanities, Hoffer et al. (2004) hinted that the number of first-generation doctorates was larger in the field of education compared to the field of humanities when stating: There is considerable variation in parental education attainment by race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and broad field of study. .. Doctorate recipients in the humanities displayed the highest percentages of both  (Chatman, 1994;Hurley 2002;Norfles & Mortenson, 2002) but were comparatively fewer than first-generation undergraduate studies (Hayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;London, 1992London, , 1996McConnell, 2000;Mitchell, 1997;NCES, 1998b;Norfles, 2003;Terenzini et al., 1996;Willett, 1989). Because of the limited availability of first-generation graduate studies, literature that focused on undergraduates was included in this review. A consensus of untimely degree completion existed among literature reviewed as a negative thematic affect when comparing findings between graduate or undergraduate first-generation studies (Chatman, 1994;Hayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Hurley, 2002;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;London, 1992London, , 1996McConnell, 2000;Mitchell, 1997;NCES, 1998b;Norfles, 2003;Norfles & Mortenson, 2002;Terenzini et al., 1996;Willett, 1989 Khanh (2002) recommended campus first-generation support programs for students to foster attainment success similar to recommendations made by Kerlin (1995aKerlin ( , 1995b, McConnell (2000), and Tluczek (1995).

Regional attainment data supporting differential male and female majority status among graduate degree fields mirrored differentiable national data (Hoffer et al., 2004 1998a, 1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2004b, 2004d, 2005a) , 1998a, 1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2004b, 2004d, 2005a) and national data (Hoffer et al., 2004), East Tennessee State University first-generation students' enrollment's majority status contrasted starkly to first-generation students' enrollment's minority status nationally. Yet, according to an East Tennessee State University newsletter (1998a, p.1), similarity to East Tennessee State University students to students represented by the national norm group was very high. East Tennessee State University's March 2000 newsletter reported 52 % of undergraduates were first-generation, meaning that neither parent of the student had graduated from college. Although, the first-generation majority status was slightly over half of the student population, the University's first-generation enrollment majority status contradicted that expected from the first-generation enrollment minority status nationally (Hoffer et al., 2004). Other regional literature (Chatman, 1994;Gunnin, 2002)  Many of the findings of this study concur with the review of the literature in that socio-economic and generational status play a role in Appalachian students' college experience. This study, unlike the review of literature, found that the families of many first-generation students not only recognize the value of a college education, but also fully support the academic endeavors of their college students. Although a community college's study, Gunnin's findings (2002) supported Chatman's (1994) , 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d, 2004a, 2004c, 2004d, 2004e, 2005a, 2005bGunnin, 2002) and national literature (Bae et al., 1990;Baird, 1993;Bowen, 1991;Curran, 2001;Golde & Dore, 2001;Hill, 2002;Hill et al., 2004;Hoffer et al., 2004;Hurley, 2002;Katz, 2001;Kerlin, 1995aKerlin, , 1995bNational Association of Graduate-Professional Students, 2001;NCES, 1998bNCES, , 1998cNRC, 1996NRC, ,1998NSF, 2001NSF, , 2002bNSF, , 2003Syverson, 1996;Tluczek, 1995). And when comparing differences among first-generation doctors of education and their non-first-generation counterparts, both regional and national literature offered literature that targeted first-generation undergraduate students and their non-firstgeneration counterparts (East Tennessee State University, 1998a, 2000a, 2000bHayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;London, 1992London, , 1996McConnell, 2000;Mitchell, 1997;NCES, 1998b;Padron, 1992;Terenzini et al.,1996;Willett, 1989). Yet, when seeking similar first-generation literature on graduate students, comparatively few first-generation graduate studies (Chatman, 1994;Hurley, 2002;Norfles & Mortenson, 2002) were available and none targeted education. London (1992London ( , 1996, Hayes (1997), Hsiao (1992), Inman and Mayes (1999), Padron (1992), and Terenzini et al., (1996) asserted first-generation undergraduates typically had lower grade-point-averages, had not been part of the honors programs, faced a variety of nonacademic challenges, usually came from poorer families, were often geographically constrained, and were very concerned with having a college close to home. McConnell (2000) and Khanh (2002) reiterated similar findings that supported odds favoring attrition when comparing first-generation undergraduate students to nonfirst-generation counterparts and repeated earlier pronouncements that offered evidence of negative affects attributable to first-generation status (London, 1992(London, , 1996Hayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Padron, 1992;Terenzini et al., 1996). According to McConnell and Khanh, first-generation undergraduates reported lack of finances and time as barriers toward degree attainment and suggested colleges offer support programs to help with meeting specific needs experienced by first-generation students. In contrast to studies that focused on undergraduates, Chatman (1994) Gall, Borg, and Gall (1996) indicated survey research matched well a quantitative designed study intending generalization to a population. According to Gall et al.: The purpose of a survey is to use questionnaires \u2026 to collect data from participants in a sample about their characteristics, experiences, and opinions in order to generalize the findings to a population that the sample is intended to represent. This focus on generalizing to a population is characteristic of quantitative research, but not of qualitative research. to fill out the questionnaire at their convenience, answer the items in any order, take more than one sitting to complete it, make marginal comments, skip questions, or give unique responses. According to Gall et al. (1996), when comparing between a survey questionnaire and an interviewer, although less probing and less capable of modification after distribution, a survey questionnaire promotes reduction in researcher bias possible to interviewer's mannerisms and personality. Because of the standardization and a highly structured design compatible to the quantitative approach as described by Gall et al., (Gunnin, 2002), community college experience (Inman and Mayes, 1999;McConnell, 2000), cohort experience, TTD (NRC, 1996), firstgeneration status (Hayes, 1997;Hsiao, 1992;Hurley, 2002;Inman & Mayes, 1999;Khanh, 2002;London, 1996;Mitchell, 1997;NCES, 1998b;Terenzini et al., 1996), and the ranking of limitations and facilitators perceived specific. age at time of graduation, 2.

Hypothesis 5: Collected responses from survey questions A7 -doctorate registration year, and A8-doctorate attainment year, provided the time interval between registration and doctorate degree attainment. A t-test for two independent samples used both the registered-time-to-degree variable obtained from the computation of mathematical difference between A7 and A8 obtained from testing of the previous hypothesis question 4 and the first-generation status variable obtained when testing hypothesis question 1. "}, {"section_title": "Respondents", "text": "In order to determine if the survey's respondents were a representative sample of the population of the East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education, gender and degree attainment years were compared between survey participants and the population The population was 54.4% female; participants were 54.1% female. Both groups had a median attainment year of 1992. Given that respondents did not vary substantially from the population on these two key variables, the sample appeared to be representative of the population; therefore, participants of the study would acceptably represent the population. Of the 397 doctors contacted using methods described in chapter three, 209 (53%) responded. The respondents were predominantly Appalachian (66%), white (95.2), and female (54.1%) with 60% over the age of 40 at degree attainment (see Table 1). The mean age of respondents at the time of survey completion was 55.7 (range = 35 -79). Additional key demographic responses indicated that at the time of degree attainment, the majority of respondents were U. S. Citizens (97.6%), married (82.3%), and first-generation (73.7%). Respondents received first-generation status coding if and only if both parents had not finished a 4-year university (see Table 2) and a response of some parental attendance to college did not preclude assignment to first-generation status inclusion.  Table 3, when asked to prioritize or rank the three most significant facilitators, respondents ranked as the number 1 facilitator -their spouse or partner. driving distance (18.7%), and children (13.4%). Table 4 displays the itemization of the 57 explanations offered by respondents. Moreover, when asked to rank the three most significant barriers, respondents ranked as number 1 -other, number 2 -costs, and number 3 -faculty (See Table 5). had an expected frequency of fewer than five, the total number of cells did not exceed 20%, and violation of the assumptions of chi-square for this hypothesis did not occur. More first-generation respondents were of Appalachian native status than expected. As shown in Table 6, first-generation respondents reporting Appalachian native status when compared to expected and observed counts was nine more than expected, while the non-first-generation difference of count was nine less. In this comparison, the 2X2 cell chi-square yielded a moderate significance factor (Phi = .210) indicating the existence of a relationship between Appalachian native status and firstgeneration status. Additionally, a difference in the frequency count of first-generation respondents who were between the ages of 45 -49 years at the time of graduation when compared to expect and observed counts was nine more than expected, while non-first-generation was nine less. Conversely, the difference in the frequency counts of first-generation respondents who were 50 years of age or older was 4 less than expected, while the nonfirst-generation respondents count was 4 more. The multiple celled chi-square yielded a moderate significance factor (contingency coefficient = .238) indicating that both proportions of first-generation respondents who were between 45-49 years of age and of non-first-generation respondents who were 50 years of age or older, was more than could occur by chance. A t-test for independent samples tested null hypothesis 2. As shown in Table 7, results comparing mean time intervals that elapsed from the respondents' receipt of the baccalaureate until doctorate attainment between first-generation respondents and their non-first-generation counterparts revealed both groups averaged approximately 19 years to degree attainment.  with an education specialist's degree and those who did not. A t-test for independent samples tested null hypothesis 4. As shown in Table 9, on average, respondents having an education specialist degree completed their doctorate almost one year earlier (mean = 3.98), than non-education specialist degree counterparts' average of almost 5 years (mean = 4.96). Education specialist degreed respondents' median registered-time-to-degree of 3 years was also 1 year less than their non-education specialist degreed counterparts' median of 4 years. The difference between education specialist degreed respondents' time-interval means and their non-education specialist degreed counterparts produced an asymptotical significance of .019 and indicated there was less than a two percent probability that the findings were by chance. Comparisons of mean completion time intervals to compulsory program timelines revealed differing completion ratios between education specialist degreed respondents and their non-education specialist degree counterparts. Non-education specialist degreed respondents' ratio of 4.96 years mean completion time to the 7 years allocated for completion (.71) was comparatively less than education specialist degreed respondents' ratio of 3.98 years means completion time to the 5 years allocated for completion (.80). Decision: Rejection of null hypothesis 4 occurred after comparison of ratios, means, and computations of asymptotic significance through a t-test for independent samples demonstrated evidence that the registered-time-to degree intervals are different between respondents who entered with an education specialist degree and those who did not. Hypothesis 5: Null hypothesis 5: There is no difference in registered-time-to-degree between first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education and their nonfirst-generation counterparts. Testing of null hypothesis 5 consisted of a t-test for comparison of means between two independent samples (first-generation and non-first-generation) with a confidence level of 95%. Values of the t statistic (see Table 10) computed and compared with a standard t-table produced no asymptotical significance (.40) below the acceptable alpha level. This indicated that there was no significant difference beyond a normal chance occurrence that the registered-time-to degree intervals are different between firstgeneration respondents and their non-first-generation counterparts.  As shown in Table 12, comparison of central tendencies among ranked facilitators between first-generation respondents and their non-first-generation counterparts did not produce asymptotic significances from z values below the acceptable alpha level .05. This indicated no significant differences existed beyond those created by normal chance occurrences. Moreover, the distribution of the ranked facilitator's central location of firstgeneration respondents equaled the distribution of the ranked facilitator's central location of non-first-generation respondents. While approximately one seventh of both first-generation (14.9%) and non-firstgeneration (13.5%) respondents reported no barriers encountered to degree attainment, respondents collectively offered 57 explanations (Appendix E) for barriers they had encountered but the survey did not list. Of the number of explanations offered for nonlisted barriers under the heading of other, the bulk (82.4%) was from first-generation respondents who mentioned residency requirements (21.1%) and time (12.7%) as the two largest percentages. Among all first-generation respondents (n=154), when residency as a significant barrier was examined collectively from both the 57 explanations for the sub-heading other and the 27 listed in the survey , 7.1% of first-generation respondents (n=154) ranked residency as number 1. This meant that residency ranked slightly less than that of driving distance (9.1%) and costs (13.6%) among barriers ranked as number 1 or most significant overall.        "}, {"section_title": "Summations and Conclusions", "text": "Demographic, Educational, and Postgraduation Background Findings Previous East Tennessee State University literature and studies (1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d, 2004e, 2005a) revealed that first-generation students not only composed the bulk of East The primary reasons for this study were the desire to know who the East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education are, and how they succeeded against odds favoring attrition (Khanh, 2002;Swail, 2002;McConnell, 2000). Direct responses (see Appendix D) representing the demographic, educational, and postgraduation backgrounds of East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education who attained their degree prior to 2004 and analysis using descriptive statistics and frequency sums assisted in drawing the following conclusions. Ethnicity and First-generation. The majority of respondents (95.2%) was white and mirrored the national trend of predominately-white doctorate recipients observed in literature reviewed (see Figure 1). However, unlike the predominate minority status of first-generation respondents encountered nationally by Inman andMayes (1999), NCES (1998b), and Norfles and Mortenson (2002), this researcher observer the overwhelming majority (73.7%) of respondents to the Survey of ETSU Doctors of Education were firstgeneration. This researcher concluded first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education persist in stark contrast to national trends that suggest firstgeneration status as a degree attainment barrier. This researcher concurred with Swail (2002) that there are few students of color in 4-year degreed programs after reviewing local data (East Tennessee State University, 2004f). The proportion of responding non-white doctors were comparatively less than those returned by white doctors were. Moreover, mathematical ratios between ethnicity and first-generation responses to the SEDE produced a lone statistical case of a non- Moreover, although slightly less, the percentage (67.3%) of respondents who reported post-degree employment by 4-year colleges who were first-generation nearly mirrored the percentage (74.4%) of respondents who completed additional formal study beyond their doctorate who were first-generation. Unlike Khanh (2002), Swail (2002), andMcConnell (2000)  This researcher concluded that East Tennessee State University Doctors of Education encountered more facilitators than barriers, and although reported as both a facilitator and a barrier to degree attainment, when asked to prioritize, respondents' perceived costs more as a significant barrier (14.8%) than facilitator (8.6%). Moreover, although faculty was the most recognized facilitator, respondents perceived faculty comparatively less significant than a spouse or partner when prioritizing. Hypotheses Findings This researcher concurred with Gunnin (2002) who reported first-generation Appalachian community college graduates persisted in contrast to national norms of attrition attributed to first-generation status. This researcher concluded that although there were more non-first-generation doctors than expected who were 50 years of age or older at the time of their graduation, first-generation East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education were significantly younger at the time of degree attainment and more were Appalachian natives than their non-first-generation counterparts were overall. Hypothesis 2: Time-to-Degree Differences. A t-test for two independent samples revealed both groups averaged 19-years between baccalaureate and doctorate attainment. Specifically, first-generation respondents' took 19 years and 4 months, which was slightly less than 7 months (.57 year) longer than their non-first-generation counterparts' average of 18 years and 9 months. Although first-generation respondents' median timeto-degree of 19 years was 2 years more than non-first-generation, this researcher concluded there are no significant differences in time-to-degree intervals between firstgeneration East Tennessee State University's Doctors of Education and their non-firstgeneration counterparts. This researcher concurred with Hoffer et al. (2004) who stated that time-todegree completion is likely to be affected by a number of factors including individual preferences, economic constraints, labor markets for new doctorate recipients, cultures of the academic disciplines, and institution-specific program characteristics. However, unlike Bae et al. (1990) who concluded the more time spent in obtaining the doctorate, the more likely the student was to quit, this researcher observed persistence among East Tennessee Doctors of Education although their time-to-degree was almost 10 months longer than the longest reported nationally of 18.2 years. Moreover, unlike Bae et al. This researcher concluded, although initial t-tests produced evidence that respondents who entered the doctorate program with an education specialist degree experienced a significantly shorter interval of time from first doctorate class registration until degree conferment than their non-education specialist degreed counterparts did, non-education specialist degreed respondents spent less time proportionately within time allocated to finish. Hypothesis 5: Registered-Time-to-Degree Differences. A t-test for independent samples revealed first-generation respondents reported both the longest (18 years) and shortest (1 year) registered-time-to-degree intervals, and averaged slightly less than 4 years 8 months (mean = 4.64 years) to complete the time interval that passed between registering for the first doctorate class to conferment of their degree. However, the 4 months earlier completion by first-generation respondents as compared to their non-firstgeneration counterparts (mean = 5 years) did not promote evidence of a significant difference. Unlike Hurley (2002), Inman and Mayes (1999), and Khanh (2002) who reported first-generation status promoted untimely degree completion., this researcher concluded although first-generation respondents completed an average of 4 months earlier than their non-first-generation counterparts did, no significant differences existed. Moreover, whether first-generation or non-first-generation, most respondents finished in 3 years (mode = 3 years). Hypothesis 6: Facilitator Ranking Differences. A Mann-Whitney independent sample test for ranked variables revealed rankings of the top three facilitators were not significantly different between first-generation and non-first-generation respondents. Both first-generation (18.8%) and non-first-generation (23.1%) groups reported the most significant facilitator to degree attainment as their spouse or partner. Both first-generation (13%) and non-first-generation (13.5%) ranked as the second most significant facilitator driving distance. Both first-generation (16.2%) and non-first-generation (9.2%) selected faculty as the third most significant facilitator. This researcher concluded that facilitator rankings between first-generation respondents and their non-first-generation counterparts were not significantly different. associated with their doctorate, the less likely the respondents were to rank costs as the third most significant barrier. Moreover, the more likely a respondent's post degree employment was in public pre-kindergarten through grade 12 educational environments, the more likely the respondent was to rank costs the third most significant barrier."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "It is the intent of this study to offer additional empirical research about firstgeneration doctors of education in order to reduce the comparative inequity observed by this researcher of no studies completed on first-generation doctors of education.

Described changes include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Add questions to the survey targeting income status at the time of degree attainment. Norfles and Mortenson (2002) cited concerns to the negative affects attributed to first-generation status, especially the lack of financial support and while there were some questions present in the Survey of ETSU Doctors of Education that identified the sources of primary and secondary support, more specific questions are suggested to provide clarity. 2. Use an interactive website to host the survey instead of relying on the US Postal Service. 3. Complete a survey every 5 years to ensure data reflects perceptions more closely at the time of actual degree attainment. Although the University conducts annual graduate surveys, this researcher recommends continuation of this study or one similar that targets specifically first-generation doctors of education to counteract the comparative lack of information available empirically. 4. Expand the survey to include non-successful doctoral students; especially those who withdraw or are consider ABD's (All But Dissertation). Tluczek (1995) and Kerlin (1995aKerlin ( , 1995b both concluded that the lack of self-discipline and commitment among ABD students contributed to dissertation non-completion. According to Tluczek and Kerlin, the inability of first-generation graduate students to work independently directly contributed to the length of time it took to obtain the degree and the longer the graduate student spent in obtaining the degree, the greater the likelihood of attrition. Exclusion of non-successful doctoral students was a barrier to analysis of ABD within this study. 4. Extend this study into the related masters and education specialist degree programs along with targeting of both degreed and dropout first-generation students. According to Swail (2002) who echoed Khanh (2002) and McConnell(2000) in their findings, motivation for study beyond undergraduate level was lacking in firstgeneration students and promoted problems well in to graduate school when coupled with the lack of preparation for postsecondary levels.
