[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A new coronavirus called SARS-COV-2 causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that currently produced a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus of the beta coronavirus genus that belongs to SARS-type viruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) (1) . These viruses usually cause mild respiratory infections in healthy adults and more severe and sometimes fatal effects in older adults and people with comorbidities (2) . The SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped virus with a 29.903 kb, positive sense, and single-stranded RNA genome. This genome is one of the largest among RNA viruses, and it encodes four structural proteins (E, M, N, and S), whose function is to protect the viral genome and 16 non-structural proteins (NSP) that regulate RNA synthesis and its processing, such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NSP12) and helicase (NSP13). Simultaneously, other proteins facilitate the function of viral enzymes, such as NSP7 and NSP10 (3) .\nIn December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus initially caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China; since then, it has spread to almost all countries in the world.\nFor this reason, the WHO declared it a pandemic on the 11th March, and later this new disease was named COVID-19 (4, 5) . WHO ranked the COVID-19 as the sixth international public health emergency of global concern after H1N1 (2009), Polio (2014), Ebola from West Africa (2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019).\nThus, due to the virus\u00b4s high transmission capacity, a growing incidence of infection, and the ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, and call on the world's health systems to cooperate to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (6) .\nAt the date of this publication, the COVID-19 has caused more than 16 and a half million confirmed cases and more than 650,000 deaths worldwide. America is one of the most affected regions by the disease, with more than 8,800,000 affected patients, where the USA and Brazil are the most affected countries (4,263,531 and 2,442,375 confirmed cases respectively). Peru ranks seventh among the countries with the most confirmed cases worldwide (more than 600,000 infected) , and first place in mortality rate (more than 28 000 deaths) (8) . The first Peruvian case of COVID-19 was notified on 5 th March 2020 in a 25-year-old man who arrived in the country after visiting Spain, France, and the Czech Republic.\nSubsequently, new cases began to be notified in other cities of Peru in such a way that the Peruvian government decreed the international closure of borders and mandatory quarantine at the national level on 16 th March.\nTo control the COVID-19 burden, it is necessary to understand the genomic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, identify new mutations associated with its transmission, and infer these transmission routes. Knowledge of these aspects will allow the development of vaccines, implement better disease control, and generate new diagnostic methods. In this context, our study seeks to contribute with genomic analysis of the early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemics in Peru."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "We produced seven overlapping fragments of a size between 5 Kb to 6 Kb from the genome of SARS-COV-2 by RT-PCR ( Figure 1 ). In some cases, we also get nonspecific amplification, eliminated during the fragment's purification.\nWe submitted 34 SARS-COV-2 genome sequences from Peru to the international Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. We identified six SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages (A2, A5, B.1, B1.1, B1.1.1, B1.5) according to GISAID and Pangolin analysis ( Table 2) . Most Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 sequences here obtained were classified as clade B.1 (38%, n = 13), and particularly within the sub-clade B.1.1.1 (29.4%, n = 10) ( Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis", "text": "The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from Peru, compared to the genomes of the viruses reported in different countries, were grouped into genetic clades G (85.3%) and S (14.7%), probably transmitted to people returning from Europe countries (such as Spain, Italy and Germany) and Asians countries (Taiwan). We also observed the presence of new Peruvian genotypes of the virus in early March and early April 2020, consistent with a local transmission ( Figure 2 ).\nThe Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 grouped in clade G presents the characteristic D614G mutation in the Spike (S) protein. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that case zero (LIM-01-2) was closely related to cases reported between 6 th and 10 th March (LIM-INS-002, LIM-INS-003,   LIM-INS-004, LIM-INS-009, LIM-INS-013, and LIM-INS-014) The other cases began to circulate after the border closure. These introductions gave rise to other cases, which originated viruses with their unique mutations, generating an autochthonous transmission of the virus."}, {"section_title": "Amino acid variations", "text": "We found various nucleotide variations in the Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared with the reference genome of the Wuhan strain (NC_045512), some of which suffered amino acid changes (Table 3 and S1). We observed the C241T nucleotide variation in the 5'-UTR region in 30 of 34 genomes. Some genomes present the D3G variation (9/34) in the M protein, a variation found only in samples from the PER-CII cluster. In ORF6 we found the amino acid variation I36T (1/34).\nOther variations encountered were V29L (1/34) in ORF7a and S5L (1/34) in ORF7b.\nIn ORF8, we found the L84S variation (5/34) , while the protein N presented the following changes, S197L (2/34), R203K (13/34), and G204R (13/34). In this gene, we observed that R203K, G204R, and the synonyms change 28881G>A, are characteristic of PER-CI cluster.\nWe do not find amino acid variations in the gene E and ORF10 (Table 3 and S1). Likewise, we found nucleotide variations in a minority of reads in some positions of 13 sequenced genomes that we do not observe in the final assembled genome (Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "At the end of December 2019, discovering a new virus that could cause respiratory disease in humans was announced in Wuhan-China. At that time, we all thought that the virus would take a long time for it to spread to other continents; however, after three months, the first case was reported in Peru, and from that time to the present, we continue with more positive cases per day being difficult to control this pandemic.\nIn this context, it is necessary to research to know the genomic diversity of SARS Cov2 in different regions of the country and share this data with scientists interested in developing diagnostic methods and possible vaccines.\nIn this study, we report the main clades and genomic lineages of 34 genomes of SARS- (Table S1 ).\nWe observed several mutations at different positions in the genome of circulating SARS-COV-2. It is worth highlighting the presence of the C241T (30/35) mutation in the 5 'UTR region important for transcription and viral packaging (12, 13) . The P4715L mutation (14408 C>T) in the viral polyprotein ORF1ab located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region (position 323 of RdRP), which could be related to the increase in the mutation rate (14) . This polymerase dynamics simulation indicates that this P4715L is a more stable RdRP variant (15) . The spike protein\u00b4s D614G mutation is related to the increase of the virus\u00b4s infectivity and is present in 29 of the 35 genomes reported in Peru (16) . Likewise, it is remarkable that the I119V mutation (present in 8 from the 34 genomes) is present in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 region of the spike, and we detected no variations in the RBD region.\nMeanwhile, the R203K (13/34) and G204R (13/34) variants of the N gene could contribute to the reduction of the nucleocapsid\u00b4s conformational entropy (17) . ORF3a is a carrier for K+ and Ca2+ ions (18) "}, {"section_title": "Nasal and pharyngeal swabs summited to the National Reference Respiratory Viruses", "text": "Laboratory of the Peruvian National Institute of Health for diagnostic confirmation were stored at -80 \u00b0C. We selected samples from the first cases reported in Peru and from different regions of the country. The first 34 samples, from early March to early April, were chosen following the criteria that they had an adequate viral load (Ct \u02c230) after analyzing the molecular diagnosis results by real-time RT-PCR. Viral RNA was purified from 140 \uf06dL of viral transport medium, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA samples were processed by reverse transcription and PCR to amplify overlapping fragments, using primers designed (Table 1) The amplified fragments (2 ng) were processed using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit and indexes adapters (Illumina) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer.\nThe library was sequenced using a Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit, a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 cartridge (500-cycles), and the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files generated were cleaned using Groomer and Trimmomatic (https://usegalaxy.org/). The reads mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Severe+acute+respiratory+syndrome+coronavirus + 2 + AND + Wuhan) using BWA-ME (https://usegalaxy.org). Finally, the genomes were assembled using SPAdes and compared to the reference genome using CONTIGuator "}]
