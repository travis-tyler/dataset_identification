A recent study reported that HoLEP is a safe and effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) among the elderly [1] . Compared with younger patients, patients aged \u226580 years had similar overall morbidity and 6-month functional outcomes after HoLEP [1] . Thus, HoLEP is considered a safe and effective treatment modality for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) related to BPH, and has been reported to have lower morbidity rates than other modalities [2] . Comparisons with conventional treatment modalities have shown that HoLEP has excellent hemostatic properties and causes less electrolyte deterioration [3] [4] [5] . Furthermore, in view of its effectiveness, it has been suggested that HoLEP offers a possible alternative to open prostatectomy [6, 7] .\nSince the first clinical report on HoLEP was published by Gilling et al [8] in 1996, several randomized controlled trials have been conducted. HoLEP produces clinical outcomes that are similar to those of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and open prostatectomy, but has lower postoperative complication rates and shorter hospital stays [5, 6, [9] [10] [11] . In addition, HoLEP appears to be a true endourological alternative to open prostatectomy, because it can treat very large prostates more effectively [12, 13] .\nAlthough the technique has been refined and its popularity has increased, HoLEP faces major impediments to its widespread application. In particular, the endoscopic technique is challenging and appears to be difficult to learn, meaning that HoLEP has a steep learning curve. Furthermore, these difficulties have delayed its adoption by the urological community [14] .\nSeveral reports have investigated the learning curve of HoLEP [3, 6, 14, 15] . Some authors have argued that a surgeon needs experience with between 20 and 30 cases to attain competency [3, 6] , while others have argued that up to 50 cases are needed [14, 15] . These discrepancies are mainly caused by the absence of an accurate means of evaluating the operative learning curve, that is, the lack of a proper parameter for estimating the operator's enucleation skills.\nTo date, researchers have attempted to identify parameters that can be used to determine how many cases are needed to attain competency. However, the most important consideration is which parameter is more sensitive for the evaluation of enucleation skills. Enucleation efficacy [14] [15] [16] and enucleation ratio (ER) efficacy (ERE) [17] have been used to plot the learning curve, but both focus on time and do not consider energy, although operators simultaneously consume both time and energy during HoLEP.\nTherefore, the present study was undertaken to develop a new parameter suitable for estimating the operator's enucleation skills that includes a consideration of energy consumption."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The present study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Republic of Korea (approval number: GAIRB2015-85).

The enucleated prostatic tissue was removed by transurethral morcellation using a mechanical morcellator (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) that was introduced through an offset rigid nephroscope. The bladder was maintained in a distended condition during morcellation. Lubricants were applied to the scope intermittently throughout the procedure. At the end of surgery, a 22-Fr 3-way urethral Foley catheter was placed in situ for continuous postoperative irrigation.

Laser prostatectomy has continuously evolved since Gilling et al [21] first described HoLEP in 1995. In 1998, the concept of morcellation was adopted and the technique was applied to patients with BOO [18] . However, the steep operative learning curve of HoLEP has hindered its widespread use, despite its advantages.\nResearchers have tried to identify parameters that show how many cases of experience are needed to attain competency. However, the sensitivity of a parameter with respect to the evaluation of enucleation skills is probably more important. To date, enucleation efficacy [14] [15] [16] and ERE [17] have been used as parameters for the HoLEP learning curve, but they focus on time alone, although operators simultaneously consume time and energy during HoLEP.\nThe present study is the first to confirm that like enucleation time, energy consumption also decreases as the enucleation technique of a single surgeon develops (Fig. 2) . In the present study, we sought to identify a parameter that Fig. 3 . Enucleation time-efficacy (ETE) and enucleation energy-efficacy (EEE). Gradual improvements in ETE and EEE were observed.

However, ETEE continued to increase even after 30 cases (group 3) and plateaued at 61\u223c70 cases (group 7). This means that even after 30 cases (group 3), the operator's enucleation skills continued to increase. considers both time and energy. Our results demonstrate that even after 30 cases (group 3), enucleation skills continued to improve (Fig. 4) . In addition, we found that ETEE provided a more sensitive means of evaluating enucleation skills than ERE. In other words, rather than simply assessing the efficiency of the enucleation technique in terms of enucleation time, as in previous studies about the HoLEP learning curve, it is better to assess the efficiency of the enucleation technique with ETEE, which is a parameter that combines time and energy usage (Fig. 4) .\nThe CV provides a standardized measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution, and is calculated by dividing the SD by the mean. The CV is useful because the SD of data must be understood in the context of the mean value. For comparisons between data sets with different units or widely different means, one should use the CV instead of the SD.\nIn the present study, we used the CV as the scale to assess the sensitivity of each parameter for enucleation efficiency. In fact, ER was designed to reduce the variance caused by enucleated weight [17] , and thus, ER had a lower CV than enucleated weight (31.6% vs. 82.0%) ( Table 2 , Fig. 1) . Similarly, ERE (42.9%), which is derived from ER, had a lower CV than ETE (59.4%), EEE (54.7%), and ETEE (63.6%) (Table 2), which means that ETEE had a much wider distribution than ERE, and thus, ETEE was more sen-sitive than ERE for evaluating enucleation skills.\nIn the present study, ANOVA showed that mean ETEE values changed significantly with time; that is, they were significantly different across the 10 groups of 10 consecutive cases (p=0.001), whereas no significant changes were found for ERE (p=0.057) ( Table 3 ). This means that ETEE is more suitable than ERE for showing improvements in enucleation skills.\nER is defined as the ratio of the enucleated weight to the TZV. Thus, ER seems to be a fixed constant value, and it did not increase as enucleation skills improved. ER could increase depending on the improvement of device (morcellator) performance, allowing it to retrieve the enucleated prostate tissue without loss. Therefore, we think that ERE, which is derived from ER, does not provide a sensitive evaluation of the surgeon's enucleation skills, as ER is designed to reduce the variance of enucleated weight [17] .\nIn the present study, ERE plateaued after 30 cases (group 3), which is similar to the study by Jeong et al [17] . However, ETEE continued to increase even after 30 cases (group 3) and plateaued at 61\u223c70 cases (group 7) (Fig. 4) . This indicates that for cases 31\u223c40 (group 4), the plateau of ERE did not indicate a real attainment of competency in enucleation skills. Therefore, we think that ETEE, which considers enucleation time and consumed energy simultaneously, is more sensitive for evaluating enucleation skills than previous parameters (including ETE and ERE) that only consider enucleation time.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, it is intrinsically limited by its retrospective design, despite the enrollment of consecutive patients to avoid potential selection bias. Second, the study was conducted on patients operated on by a single surgeon. Accordingly, we suggest that ETEE should be evaluated in group of several surgeons in the future, to determine if it is generally acceptable. Third, we did not investigate whether energy usage varied according to patients' bleeding tendency and vascular distribution except for prostate size, although the amount of laser energy used may vary depending on those factors, as well as prostate volume and TZV. Although no accurate information was available regarding patients' bleeding tendency, in the early stages of HoLEP surgery, surgeons generally perform surgery on patients who are not likely to bleed because of their deficient surgical technique. As the surgeon's technique gradually develops, patients with bleeding tendencies can be operated on. However, as shown in Fig. 2 of this study, energy consumption decreased as the technique developed. This means that less energy is used as the surgeon's enucleation skill develops. Therefore, we think that this clearly shows that in the HoLEP learning curve, the development of the enucleation technique can be evaluated not only by time, but also by energy usage (Fig. 3) and that ETEE is more sensitive for evaluating the enucleation skills than previous parameters (including ETE and ERE) (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, in clinical settings after the surgeon's enucleation skill has fully developed, we believe that ETEE can quantitatively measure the difficulty of enucleation due to the patient's bleeding tendency and vascular distribution."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Several previous parameters (including ETE and ERE) for evaluating enucleation skills only consider enucleation time. However, ETEE simultaneously considers enucleation time and consumed energy. The curve of ERE plateaued after 30 cases, but that of ETEE showed that even after 30 HoLEP cases, enucleation skills continued to improve. Therefore, we propose that ETEE should be used as a more appropriate parameter than ERE for evaluating enucleation skills."}]
