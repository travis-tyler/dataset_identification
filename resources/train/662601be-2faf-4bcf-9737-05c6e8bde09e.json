In an effort to increase the number of women and minorities in these occupations, many recent policies have been focused on increasing the number of female and minority students who enter college in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields.\nHowever, the NSF's Science and Engineering Indicators report (2008) finds that students who begin college as STEM majors have a lower probability of receiving a degree in their initial field than students in other majors. Of even greater concern is that women and historically disadvantaged minorities who initially intend to major in a STEM field are the least likely to persist toward a degree in one of these fields. For example at 4-year public universities in the state of Ohio, only 39 percent of initial STEM majors who are black persist in a STEM field after three years compared to 50 percent of white STEM Majors. Similarly, 40 percent of female STEM majors persist after three years whereas 52 percent of male students persist.\nIt is hypothesized that students experience better educational outcomes when they are able to interact and associate with faculty who are of their own race or gender. Thus one approach to increase the persistence of women and minority students is to increase the number of female and minority faculty in STEM departments. Female college students get better grades when a course is taught by a female instructor (Bettinger & Long, 2005; Carrell et al, 2009; Hoffman & Oreopoulos, 2009 ), however, these same studies indicate that female instructors do not increase future performance or persistence in the subject of the course. There even is evidence to suggest that female students who take STEM courses taught by female instructors are less likely to major in STEM fields. While there is research that links positive academic outcomes to having an own race teacher in elementary and secondary school (Klopfenstein, 2005; Dee, 2004) , there is little research that identifies the causal effect of having an instructor of the same race on academic outcomes in college. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the effect of having own-race instructors on persistence in STEM fields using within institution variation of the number of black faculty assigned to teach introductory courses.\nThe outcome of interest in the current study is persistence in a STEM field major, with persistence being defined as entering college with the intent of majoring in a STEM field and remaining in a STEM field major in subsequent semesters. The focus is placed on the intermediate measurement of intended major in order to identify when students begin to transition from STEM to non-STEM fields while in college. Many students change their major during their first years of college (40 percent after the first year and 74 percent after the second year). With findings from previous research that faculty have the strongest influence on students within the first years of their college experience (Canes & Rosen 1995; Solnick, 1995) , this study focuses on the student-faculty interaction that occurs during the freshmen year.\nI use a fixed effects model to estimate the effect of STEM instructor's race on student persistence in STEM fields. The key explanatory variable is the number of STEM courses in which a student enrolls in the first semester that are taught by black instructors. I use data from the Ohio Board of Regents, which includes course enrollment data for first time freshmen who enrolled between 1998 and 2002 in all public 4-year institutions in the state of Ohio. One of the empirical challenges of identifying casual effects of instructors is that students may differentially select into courses based on the race or gender of the instructor. For example, the data used in this study indicates that courses taught by a black instructor have a 10 to 15 percent higher fraction of black students enrolled in the course.\nTo address this selection issue, I instrument for whether a STEM course is taught by a black instructor with the fraction of STEM courses taught by black instructors during that semester. The fraction of STEM courses taught by black instructors within an institution varies due to several factors such as recent hires, course assignments, sabbaticals, and faculty leaving the institution. I also include a measure for the total number of black faculty in STEM fields within each institution to capture factors that may change within an institution over time. I use a similar instrumental variable to estimate the causal effects of female instructors on persistence.\nMy IV estimates indicate that having a black instructor increases the likelihood that black students persist in a STEM field. In contrast to past studies on elementary and secondary school students (Dee, 2004) , I find that black instructors in college have no effect on persistence of white students in STEM fields. These results illustrate the positive effect that own-race instructors can have on academic outcomes early on in college for underrepresented minorities.\nIn addition, I find that female instructors do not have a positive effect on the likelihood that female students persist in a STEM field (which is consistent with past studies)."}, {"section_title": "II. Background", "text": "Several theories have been presented to explain why having an instructor with similar racial or gender characteristics might increase a student's academic performance. One of the explanations most thoroughly studied in past literature is the idea that faculty members serve as a mentor or role model for students, and having a mentor or role model of the same gender or race increases academic performance (Jacobi, 1991; Crisp & Cruz, 2009) . A consistent finding over time is that students tend to choose role models who have the same characteristics as themselves (Erku & Mokros, 1984; Jacobi, 1991; and Karunanayake & Nautu, 2004) .\nMultiple studies have examined whether having a teacher of the same gender increases academic performance of students in elementary and secondary school. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979, Nixon and Robinson (1999) show that girls who have a female teacher in high school have higher levels of educational attainment. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, Dee (2007) finds that having an owngender teacher in 8 th grade increases test scores and student engagement with academic subjects.\nAdditionally, in a sample of high school aged students in Sweden, Holmlund and Sund (2006) show a positive association between grades of female students and female teachers.\nSeveral studies have examined whether female role models have positive effects on academic performance on female college students. In the past it has been difficult to identify specific role models and mentors due to data constraints, so studies have utilized the gender composition of university departments as a proxy for role models or possible mentors. Rothstein (1995) utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 and find a positive association between the percentage of female faculty at the school and the probability that a female student attains an advanced degree. Canes and Rosen (1995) look within three institutions and find no evidence that the share of women on a department's faculty lead to an increase in the share of female majors within that department. Robst, Keil, and Russo (1998) Carrel et al (2009) exploit the random assignment of both students and faculty that is unique to the Air Force Academy. They find that high ability female students who have their introductory STEM courses taught by a female instructor perform better in these and additional courses and are more likely to receive a degree in a STEM field. However, when examining all female students, they find that having a female instructor in a STEM course increases performance in that course but has no significant effect on performance in subsequent courses and no effect on graduating in a STEM field. Due to the unique nature of the university where the data for this particular study comes from, the results may not generalize to other academic institutions.\nBettinger and Long (2007) use a more representative sample, including all public 4-year universities in the state of Ohio, to examine the effect that female instructors have on female students in STEM fields. They look at whether having a female instructor for a course in a particular field increases the probability of taking additional courses in that field and receiving a degree in that field. To address differential selection into courses, they instrument for having a course taught by a female instructor with a measure of the fraction of courses within a department taught by female instructors. They find mixed results of the effect of female STEM faculty on female students. For example; female faculty have a positive effect on female students taking additional courses in mathematics and geology fields but a negative effects in the fields of biology and physics. Results of these more recent studies, then, indicate that in general that there are short term benefits for female students who have courses taught by female faculty, but it remains inconclusive as to whether these short term results translate into the outcome of interest, which is remaining in a STEM field major and receiving a degree in a STEM field.\nAdditional studies have examined the effect that minority teachers have on the academic outcomes of minority students in elementary and secondary school. use data from the mid 1960's and find evidence that black high school teachers are associated with higher test gains for black high school students. With more recent data, Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and Brewer (1995) show that a teacher's racial characteristics have no effect on how much students learn between the 8 th and 10 th grades. Using data from Texas High Schools, Klopfenstein (2005) finds that increasing the percentage of black math teachers has a significant effect on the probability that black students in a geometry class will enroll in more advanced math classes. Using data from Tennessee's Project STAR, Dee (2004) uses the random assignment of students and teachers to classes and finds that having an own-race teacher significantly increases the math and reading test scores of black students. In addition, teachers are more likely to give higher ratings to students who are of the same race as themselves , Dee 2005 . While there is documented evidence for a positive effect in elementary and secondary school, the relationship that exists between professor and student may be quite different at the college level. There has not been any research on the effect of having a same-race teacher for college students.\nThis study contributes to the existing literature of the effects of own-race and own-gender instructors on academic outcomes of STEM majors in two ways. First, it is the first quasiexperimental study that identifies the own race instructor effect on persistence in STEM field.\nSecond, it re-examines the effect that female instructors have on the decision of college students to persist towards a degree in a STEM field in a different manner than previous studies. It changes the level of analysis from course-student level to student-semester level. This allows me to simultaneously control for other courses that the student enrolls in within a given semester.\nAdditionally, this study uses variation in the number of black and female instructors assigned to teach STEM courses within an institution over time to identify the causal effect of an own-race or own-gender instructor on persistence."}, {"section_title": "III. Data", "text": "The data for this study comes from the Ohio Board of Regents, which collects data from all public universities within the State of Ohio. One strength of such a data set is that it is large enough to have sufficient power to separate the sample into small groups based on race and gender and detailed enough to match students to the instructor of each course in which they enrolled. The data consist of first-time freshmen who enrolled in one of the 13 public 4-year universities in the state of Ohio between 1998 and 2002. Three sources of student-level data are included in the present analysis: (1) information the school receives when the student first enrolls, including gender, race, age, standardized test score (ACT or SAT) and state of residence; (2) information the school records each term, such as term grade point average and intended major field of study, and (3) the courses in which each student enrolled for each term up to six years after initial enrollment. In addition there is information on each faculty member, such as race, gender, tenure status, rank, and highest degree earned which I can match with each course taught.\nThis allows me to match each student with the instructor of every course in which they enrolled.\nOne of the difficulties of examining the effect of minority instructors on academic outcomes is that many data sets have a small number of observations of either the number of minority students or minority faculty. The Ohio data used in this paper includes information on 14,448 black students and 1,613 black faculty, making it possible to estimate the effects of having a black instructor on academic outcomes for black college students. Another advantage of using data from Ohio is that the demographic characteristics of students who attend public 4-year universities in the state are similar to nationally representative samples.\n2 2 For a more detailed argument of external validity see Bettinger (2007) The five cohorts of first-time freshmen included in the data utilized in this analysis include over 157,000 students, of whom 22.4 percent initially intended to major in a STEM field.\nThroughout this study, I will aggregate subfields into a general STEM or non-STEM classification. Table 1 examines initial major choice and shows that female students initially constitute a lower percentage of STEM majors than non-STEM majors. Additionally, ACT scores are 2.4 points higher (\u224890 SAT points) among STEM majors. 3 Significant differences arise when examining the fraction of students from a particular subgroup who initially declare a STEM major. Among men in the sample, 31.8 percent initially declare a STEM major compared to only 14.3 percent of female students. In terms of initial racial differences; 22.3 percent of white students initially declare a STEM field major compared to 20 percent of black students.\nFaculty characteristics also differ between STEM fields and non-STEM fields. As shown in Table 2 , about a third of STEM field faculty is female compared to nearly half of non-STEM fields. While the fraction of white faculty is similar between STEM and non-STEM fields, within STEM fields there is a lower fraction of black faculty and a higher fraction of Asian faculty than within non-STEM fields. STEM fields have a higher proportion of faculty who have earned doctoral degrees, are of higher academic rank, are tenured and are employed full-time.\nWithin STEM fields, there are significant gender and racial differences in faculty characteristics. As shown in Table 3 , female faculty in STEM fields are less likely to have earned a doctoral degree, less likely to be an associate or full professor, less likely to have tenure, and more likely to work part-time. The racial differences in faculty characteristics are smaller, with black faculty less likely to have a Ph.D. or to be a full professor. These differences suggest that it is important to control for the observable characteristics of the faculty both between STEM and non-STEM fields and between the gender and race groups of faculty within STEM fields.\nIf the ultimate policy goal is to increase the number of female and minority students who major in a STEM field, then outcomes of interest should include indicators that are correlated with receiving a degree in a STEM field. Previous studies have examined grade performance and probability of enrolling in additional courses in a particular field as indicators for earning a degree (Hoffman & Oreopoulos, 2009; Carrell et al., 2009; Bettinger & Long, 2005) . These outcomes may not provide the best measures of intent to earn a degree in a STEM field since enrolling in additional STEM courses may be the result of a general education requirement needing to be fulfilled and not necessarily due to interest in that field or intent to graduate in it.\nWhether the individual intends to major in a STEM field major is a better indicator that can be used to show progress toward the goal of receiving a degree in a STEM field. Therefore, the outcome which is of most interest in this study is whether a student who initially intends to major in a STEM field continues in a STEM field as his or her intended major in subsequent terms in which he or she enrolls."}, {"section_title": "IV. Patterns of Persistence", "text": "Upon enrolling in college, students declare a major in the field in which they intend to graduate. In this study, persistence is defined as continuing on in the field of the initial major during subsequent semesters that the student is enrolled in classes. The data for this measure is constructed from administrative records that contain the student's intended major for each term the student is enrolled. The focus of this analysis is on STEM fields in general; thus changing majors within STEM fields is counted as persisting in a STEM field (i.e. a student who initially declares a major in chemistry and then changes the following semester to a biology major is considered as persisting in a STEM field). The same is true among students who transfer within non-STEM field majors.\nLower persistence rates exist among those who initially enter STEM fields compared with those who initially enter non-STEM fields. Table 4 In addition to differences in persistence rates across fields of study, there are significant differences in persistence rates between gender and racial groups within STEM field majors. The results in the top panel of Figure 1 indicate that even after the first semester, females who initially intend to major in a STEM field are less likely to persist than their male counterparts. 4 The persistence rates between STEM and non-STEM majors is significantly different at the 1% level Black students have significantly lower persistent rates than other racial groups. Much of the white-black persistence gap may be explained by differences in previous achievement of students, proxied with ACT test scores, who enter into these fields as measured by standardized test scores. Figure 2 shows that controlling for ACT test scores reduces the white-black persistence gap by over half. However, ACT test scores do not explain the difference in persistence rates between males and females as the male-female persistence gap is virtually unchanged when controlling for test scores."}, {"section_title": "V. Methods", "text": "The objective of this study is to test whether students who have their STEM courses taught by an instructor with similar racial or gender characteristics are more likely to persist in a where ijk e Persistenc is a binary outcome equal to one if student i at school j in cohort k is a STEM major in the second semester given that student i's initial major was in a STEM field.\nThe key variable of interest is the number of black STEM instructors. i X controls for student characteristics such as race, gender, ACT test score 5 , and state of residence. Also included in the equation are controls for observable characteristics of instructors such as rank, tenure status, fulltime, and graduate assistant. To account for structural differences between majors within STEM fields, \u03b8 is a set of dummy variables for the initial major of student i. There may also be specific programs implemented by individual universities that may affect a student's decision to remain in a STEM field major; thus I also include institutional fixed effects ( j \u03b4 ), and cohort fixed effects ( k \u03b4 ) to account for differences over time. This equation is estimated for white and black students separately to differentiate the effect that black instructors have on white and black students respectively. I also use this same model to estimate the own gender effect of instructors on persistence.\nAs in Hoffman and Oreopoulos (2009) , I start by assuming that first semester courses are chosen independent of the characteristics of the instructors of the course. Based on this assumption, I use a fixed effects model to estimate the correlation between the number of STEM courses that are taught by female instructors and the outcome of persisting in a STEM field after the first semester. There reasons why the assumption that students randomly sort into classes in their first semester may not be a valid assumption. For example, although students sign up for classes before coming to campus, they can access information about potential instructors online or there may be opportunities to switch classes during the first week of school. Table 5 displays the correlation between the race of the instructor and the racial composition of the students in the course. A course taught by a black instructor has approximately 15 percent higher fraction of black students in the course, once including institutional and year fixed effects. This point estimate does not change once controlling for the field of the course or the observable characteristics of the instructor. Among STEM courses, a black instructor is correlated with a 10.5 to 11.2 percent increase in the fraction of the students who are black. Table 5 This instrument is similar to that used by Bettinger and Long (2005) , but can be seen as an improvement because it aggregates fields to classify them as STEM versus non-STEM.\nBettinger and Long conduct their analysis on more refined measures of field of study (i.e.\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.) and use proportion of courses taught by female faculty to instrument for having a female instructor. While this controls for selection within a field, there may be selection across closely related fields of study based on faculty characteristics. For example the choice set may not just be sections of introductory chemistry courses, but it may include other physical science courses such as chemistry and physics. Thus aggregating to a higher level better accounts for the type of selection that occurs.\nMost of the focus of selection issues is targeted at the demand side, that is the students who enroll in STEM courses, yet there may also be selection on the supply side, or the type of individuals who become faculty in STEM fields. It may be the case that female faculty in STEM fields are systematically different than male faculty in these fields. To account for these differences, I include controls for the tenure status, rank, and highest degree earned of the faculty who teach introductory courses. There may still be other factors that differentiate male and female faculty that are not controlled for within these measures of faculty characteristics, but to identify these differences is not possible with the data."}, {"section_title": "VI. Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effect of Matching on Race", "text": "Results from fixed effects model suggest that additional black instructors are positively correlated with an increase in the persistence of black students in STEM fields. The third column of Table 6 shows that, controlling for the number of courses a student takes, black students are 4.5 percent more likely to remain a STEM major after the first semester for each additional STEM course that they take from a black instructor. This result is only marginally significant at the 10 percent level. Column two of the fixed effects model shows no statistical relationship between white students who have STEM courses taught by black instructors and persistence.\nLimiting the sample to those individuals who enroll in courses in the second semester shows similar results 6 . Another specification examines whether the student had at least one STEM course taught by a black instructor since very few students had more than one black instructor in a STEM course. 7 As shown in Table 7 , point estimates are similar as previous specifications and show a positive correlation of 3.4 percent. These specifications suggest that having a black instructor is associated with an increase in the persistence of black STEM majors of 3.4 to 4.3 percent. There is no significant correlation between enrolling in courses from black instructors and persistence in STEM fields for white students across the specifications.\nAs discussed in Section V, students sort into classes based on the race of the instructor.\nTo address selection, I instrument for having a black instructor with the number of black instructors assigned to teach introductory courses. Controlling for the total number of courses in both STEM and non-STEM fields, first stage results in the bottom panel of Table 6 indicate that a higher fraction of introductory STEM courses taught by a black faculty increases the number of STEM courses that a student takes from a black instructor. The high F-statistic suggest that problems caused by weak instruments are not an issue in this analysis.\nThe second stage results suggest that the fixed effects model underestimates the true effect that black instructors have on black student persistence in STEM fields. By instrumenting for the number of courses taken from black instructors, Table 6 shows that for each additional STEM course taught by a black instructor increases the likelihood that a black student persists in 6 Results from this specification is available upon request 7 Of the black students who had at least one black STEM instructor during their first semester, 77% had only one black STEM instructor.\na STEM field by 38.5 percent points. As shown in Table 7 , examining whether a student has at least one STEM course taught by a black faculty member indicates this large positive effet.\nAdmittedly, this is a very large point estimate, but it is imprecisely measured as the standard errors are quite large. The important interpretation should be that it is positive in sign and statistically greater than zero. It does not seem to be the case that, after controlling for rank, tenure status, and degree, the results are being driven by unobservable characteristics that make black instructors more effective in encouraging all students to persist in STEM fields. As shown in the second column of Table 6 , black instructors have a statistically insignificant effect on the persistence of white STEM majors. This insignificant effect is also evident in other specifications as exhibited in Table 7 ."}, {"section_title": "Effect of Matching on Gender", "text": "Results from the fixed effects model displayed in Table 8 suggest that for female students, each additional STEM course that is taught by a female instructor is correlated with a 2.1 percent decrease in the probability of a female student persisting in a STEM field after the first semester.\nWhile this estimation includes those who drop out, another specification limiting the sample to those who remain enrolled in school in their second semester yields similar results. Table 9 examines another specification using a binary measure of whether the student had at least one STEM course taught by a female faculty (76 percent of students who have at least one course taught by a female instructor only had one such course). Female students who have at least 1 STEM course taught by a female instructor are 1.6 percent less likely to persist. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the assumption that first semester instructors of courses are chosen at random by students.\nUsing the instrumental variable strategy discussed previously, the results from the first stage regression illustrate that the fraction of introductory STEM courses taught by female faculty is positively correlated with the number of courses that students take from female instructor in both STEM and non-STEM courses. The bottom panel of Table 9 presents the first stage, and shows that the F-statistics reveal that problems caused by weak instruments will not be "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study examines the hypothesis that students who have STEM courses taught by an instructor of their own gender or race are more likely to persist in a STEM major. The empirical evidence provided in this study suggests that female students are no more likely to persist in a STEM field when they enroll in courses taught by female faculty. This finding is consistent with previous findings that, on average, female instructors do not have a significant effect on persistence of female students in STEM fields.\nThere also is significant evidence suggesting that black instructors increase the persistence of black students in STEM fields. While a positive effect of own-race teachers has been indicated in high school settings in previous research findings, this study is the first of its kind to indicate this effect in post-secondary institutions. Whereas a previous study shows that black teachers have a negative effect on academic performance of white students (Dee 2004) , the results in this study indicate that black instructors in college do not have an impact on the persistence of white students in STEM fields. These results suggest that policies to increase the minority representation among faculty members might be an effective means of increasing the representation of minorities who persist and ultimately graduate within STEM fields.\nOne of the limitations to this study is that it is focused on factors that affect the decision to persist after one semester. About 20 percent of individuals who change majors from a STEM field to a non-STEM field do so after their first semester. However, most of the transition from STEM majors to non-STEM majors occurs at the end of the freshmen and sophomore academic years. Therefore, an extension of this research will examine the decision to persist at the end of each school year.\nIn addition, while of the line of research in the current analysis is designed to identify the effects of instructor characteristics; it does not seek to identify mechanisms causing these effects.\nTo recommend specific policies to increase persistence of women and minorities it is essential to understand the mechanism which might be driving the results. Future research should explore possible mechanisms influencing why own race instructors have a positive effect and own gender instructors do not have a significant impact on persistence of students within STEM fields. The coefficient on the dummy variable is the difference in mean that is presented. Next I include ACT score, and report the coefficient for the dummy variable of female.
