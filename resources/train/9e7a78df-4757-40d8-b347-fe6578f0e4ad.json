In Malaysia, there have been 10,219 confirmed cases with 130 deaths reported as of September 20, 2020 [2] , out of a total population of 32.7 million, giving a cumulative incidence of 31 per 100,000. COVID-19 was first identified in Malaysia on 25 January 2020 with early sporadic cases mainly associated with travel from China and Singapore. The second wave of infection began in early March 2020, and was associated with attendance at a religious mass gathering held by the Tablighi Jamaat group in Kuala Lumpur between 27 February to 3 March. This gathering was attended by 16,000 people, including about 1,500 from overseas, including Australia, Canada, Nigeria, and India, and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei and Philippines [3] . As the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased, Malaysia had the highest number of confirmed cases in Southeast Asia in March and early April. A movement control order, or lockdown, restricted movement except for necessity, work, and health circumstances from 18 March. Through rigorous public health measures, case numbers began to fall, allowing phased lifting of restrictions after 3 months.\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus from the family of Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus. There are currently more than 100,000 publicly available complete or near-complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with over 100 lineages identified. As the virus is rapidly evolving, it is important to understand the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 to track virus evolution and local and global spread.\nHere we report the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 patients from University Malaysia Medical Centre (UMMC), a designated COVID-19 hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Our objective was to study the genetic diversity and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, relative to the regional and worldwide virus lineages. In particular, we were interested in determining the possible role of the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in national and regional spread.\nGenomic surveillance improves monitoring and understanding of current SARS-CoV-2 spread within a country and can help inform public health measures."}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "This study was approved by the University Malaya Medical Centre ethics committee (no. 2020730-8928).

Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA) with random hexamers. Multiplex PCR was performed with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, USA) using two pools of 109 nCoV-2019/V3 primer sets to generate overlapping 400 nucleotide amplicons. PCR products were pooled into one tube and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA). The iTrue library method was used for library preparation [6] . Libraries were sequenced using iSeq 100 reagent kit (Illumina, USA) on the iSeq 100 system (Illumina, USA), with output of 1 \u00d7 300bp reads."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatic analysis", "text": "The sequenced reads were analysed using Geneious Prime 2020 (Biomatters, New Zealand). Reads were trimmed for quality using default parameters and mapped to reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number MN908947). Leftover gaps were sequenced separately by conventional Sanger sequencing using the nCoV-2019/V3 primers set and consensus sequences were generated. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT with default parameters [7] . Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with RAxML 8.2.11 implemented in Geneious with default parameters (generalized time-reversal (GTR) + gamma substitution model and bootstrapped 1000 times). The analysed Malaysian sequences comprised the 58 samples from this study and 57 other Malaysian genome sequences available at GISAID (www. gisaid.org) as of September 20, 2020 [8] , which include 4 previously published by our centre [9] . Therefore, 62 of the Malaysian sequences were from our centre. Variant analysis was performed among all Malaysian sequences using Geneious. Unique nucleotide mutations were further confirmed using the CoV-GLUE online tool (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk) [10] . Lineage groups were classified according to the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner online tool (www.pangolin.cog-uk.io) [11] .\nSARS-CoV-2 lineage B.6 complete genome sequences up to September 20, 2020 were retrieved from GISAID. A total of 1,497 B.6 sequences, including 75 Malaysian B.6 sequences (43 from our study) were available in the GISAID database. Of these, 1,122 high quality B.6 sequences with > 29,000 bp, < 1% Ns and < 0.05% unique amino acid mutations were aligned using MAFFT with default parameters in Geneious. The alignment was then subjected to maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses using IQTREE v1.6.12 [12] , using the GTR+F+I +G4 nucleotide substitution model and assessing branch support by the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test with 1,000 replicates. The ML tree was visualized using FigTree v1.4 [13] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Fifty-eight whole genome sequences with >99% reads mapped to the reference genome were generated, with average coverage depth of 944\u00d7 (range, 74\u00d7 to 7119\u00d7; S1 Table) . The consensus sequences have been deposited in the GISAID database (accession numbers EPI_ISL_501176 to EPI_ISL_501228, and EPI_ISL_506996 to EPI_ISL_50700). All other Malaysian whole genome sequences (57 sequences) available in GISAID were added to the analysis, making a total of 115 Malaysian sequences.\nNine Although lineage B.6 (which also belongs to GISAID clade O and Nextstrain clade 19A) was the most common in Malaysia, only 1,497 B.6 sequences had been reported globally out of over 105,568 sequences available as of September 20, 2020, a rate of 1.4%. Even after considering 17 sequences generated from the current study which were part of a healthcare-associated cluster, B.6 remained the most frequently detected lineage in Malaysia. Of the 62 cases from our centre, comprising 58 from this study and 4 from an earlier study [9] , 7 had direct links to the Tablighi Jamaat gathering-4 had attended and 3 were contacts of attendees. All 7 had B.6 lineage viruses, thus establishing a link between the Tablighi Jamaat and the B.6 lineage.\nThe Tablighi Jamaat lasted from February 27 to March 3, 2020, and the first reported B.6 sequences globally were from Malaysia, Philippines and Taiwan on March 4 (Fig 2A) . Within a week of the Tablighi Jamaat ending, there was a large increase in reported COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, with the vast majority being associated with this gathering. This was accompanied by a spike of lineage B.6 in Malaysia and other countries (Fig 2A and 2B ). From March 3 onwards, lineage B.6 sequences comprised 46/61 (75.4%) of sequences from our centre and 29/39 (74.4%) of sequences submitted by other Malaysian centres, indicating that this finding was not specific to our centre. This increase in cases led to the imposition of a nationwide movement control order on March 18.\nOf the 1,497 globally reported B.6 sequences, 1,422 (95%) originated from Asia Pacific countries. Singapore had the highest number of sequences (664), followed by India (532), Australia (81), Malaysia (75), USA (25), Philippines (16), Timor-Leste (14), Canada (13), United Kingdom (10), Thailand (9), Taiwan (7), Brunei (5) and Israel (5) . In several Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Timor-Leste, Philippines and Myanmar), lineage B.6 became predominant and accounted for 50-100% of total sequences in GISAID (Fig 2C) . Of the 7 Malaysian B.6 cases with Tablighi links, sequence 188407 and 3998 clustered with sequences from Singapore, India and Australia; sequences 2063 and 5096 clustered with sequences from Singapore; sequence 2875 grouped with sequences from Singapore, India and USA; sequence 2297 linked with Singapore, India and New Zealand; and sequence 1399 clustered with those from India, USA, Oman, Australia, Taiwan, Canada, Guam and Sierra Leone (Fig 3) . The appearance and surge of overall COVID-19 cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and B.6 lineage cases in Malaysia were thus temporally linked, as were B.6 lineage cases in other Asia Pacific countries.\nSeveral distinct mutations were observed among the Malaysian B.6 sequences. The 17 sequences in the healthcare-associated cluster had a non-synonymous mutation C25549T (P53F) in ORF3a (Fig 1) . A secondary cluster within this healthcare-associated cluster contained six sequences with an additional mutation C21627T (T22I) in the spike protein. Eight Malaysian sequences, including 6 from this study, had the additional substitution C6310A, resulting in the amino acid change S1197R in nsp3. This C6310A mutation led to reduced sensitivity by 1,000-10,000 viral copies (> 10 cycles) with one of the commercial real-time PCR assays used in our laboratory when compared to the well-established Charit\u00e9 assay [4] and updated primers/probes issued by the assay manufacturer in response to this likely sequence mismatch (S2 Table) . Some mutations were unique to Malaysian B.6 genomes, such as C2508A, A3223G, C9438T, C9803T, C13329T, C20823T, C26607T, A29086T and C29218T; others, including C6310A, T7621C and C19524T, were also observed in B.6 sequences from other countries including Singapore, Australia and India (Fig 3) .\nThe mutation D614G in the spike protein, which may increase infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 [14] and has become prevalent in many countries, was only observed in 13 (11.3%) Malaysian sequences from lineages B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1 and B.1.36 (S3 Table) , but was not present in lineage B.6. None of the 41 rare receptor binding variants described in GISAID-including the two most common, S477N and N439K -were observed in the Malaysian sequences."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In Malaysia, the Tablighi Jamaat mass gathering became the largest COVID-19 cluster, resulting in the screening of over 42,000 individuals, with 3,375 confirmed cases (33% of national cases) and 34 deaths, of which 29 (85.3%) were aged 50 and above. Multiple generations and at least 17 sub-clusters linked to this gathering were detected [14] . Of the cases, 825 (24.4%) were foreign nationals from 28 countries, including Southeast Asian countries, Australia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh [15] . Religious gatherings were recognized early in the pandemic as a significant factor in the spread of COVID-19 [16] , with large clusters associated with events in India, Iran and South Korea [17] [18] [19] [20] .\nWe established a direct epidemiological link between the Tablighi Jamaat event and lineage B.6 viruses for 7 cases. The first reported B.6 viruses date from a week after the Tablighi Jamaat event started. Thus, the appearance of the B.6 lineage, and subsequent surge of overall COVID-19 cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and B.6 lineage cases in Malaysia were temporally linked, as were B.6 lineage cases in other Asia Pacific countries. The diversity of the 7 Tablighilinked Malaysian B.6 sequences (Fig 3) suggests there may have been multiple B.6 strains involved in the initial exposure, which is compatible with the large number of attendees from many different countries who could have been the sources. The participants spent several days in large indoor congregations with shared eating and sleeping arrangements [3] , which would have led to extensive transmissions. After the event, non-Kuala Lumpur residents (Malaysian and foreign) would have returned to their areas of residence.\nAttendees at the Kuala Lumpur event also apparently acted as sources of further extensive transmission occurring at two subsequent Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Pakistan and India later in March [21] . This may explain a later rise in B.6 in India in late March (Fig 2B) . The first known COVID-19 case in Brunei returned from the Kuala Lumpur mass gathering and 52.6% of subsequently reported Brunei cases were associated with this event as of early April [22] . Southern Thailand also experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 after Thai participants returning from this event had a reported 29.3% attack rate [23] . Other Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines and Vietnam also reported imported cases associated with this gathering [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . A caveat is that the number of whole genome sequences reported from developing countries in Asia is relatively low and likely underreports the true incidence of B.6. However, it is notable that this lineage is a very minor contributor in developed countries with greater sequencing efforts (Fig 3C) . Detailed, publicly available epidemiological data are also not available for most of the B.6 sequences outside our centre, and would be very useful to further support the involvement of Tablighi Jamaat participants.\nWhole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in our centre not only allowed important insights into local and regional epidemiology, but was also used to track networks within a healthcare-associated cluster, which will be reported elsewhere. Furthermore, public sharing of sequences contributed to identification of the C6310A (nsp3-S1197R) mutation affecting the sensitivity of a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay, leading to updated primers/probes. This mutation is present in only 0.7% of global sequences, but as many as 708 (47.3%) of 1,497 available lineage B.6 sequences, and within our centre we estimate that the reduced sensitivity of the original assay impacted 10% of positive samples. With many diagnostic kits now on the market and the continued evolution of the virus, this shows the importance of choosing reputable manufacturers who are open about the primer and probes used [29] and diligently monitor new circulating sequences for potential primer/probe mismatches [30] . Assays targeting more than one gene are also preferable [29] .\nThere were 40 (34.8%) non-B.6 lineage sequences reported from Malaysia, including 15 from our study. At least 25 (62.5%) reported recent international travel (including 3 of the earliest cases from lineage A, imported from China), compared to just 2/46 (4.3%) of our centre's B.6 cases. Our sequenced cases with lineages B.1.1, B.2 and B.3 had travelled from Europe and a single B.1 case had returned from a cruise to the Americas. The B.1 and B.1.1 lineages are the most common in Americas and Europe [31] . The small numbers of other non-B.6 lineages indicate multiple introductions from overseas that failed to establish significant transmission in Malaysia, as the movement control order from 18 March closed the country's borders and mandated quarantine for all incoming travellers. However, by this point the B.6 lineage had established community transmission, reflected by the local acquisition of disease in most of our B.6 cases without direct or discernible links to the Tablighi Jamaat event.\nIn summary, initial COVID-19 spread and the predominance of lineage B.6 were temporally and epidemiologically associated with the Tablighi Jamaat religious gathering, and led to established community spread during the second wave in Malaysia. Attendees at this event likely spread strains of the B.6 lineage to other countries in the region, including Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia. Further sequence and epidemiological data are needed from Malaysia and other countries in the region to understand the full extent of the spread of B.6. The use of genomic data is important to rapidly identify possible transmission chains and provide a framework for the response to COVID-19. the horizontal axis is the same as (A). Countries with fewer than 5 lineage B.6 sequences are included in \"others\", comprising Brazil (1) Table.

A difference in viral RNA of one log or 10\u00d7 in the initial template concentration is equivalent to a Ct difference of 3. "}]
