[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Hippocampal injury in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process is region-specific and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures of localized hippocampus (HP) atrophy are known to detect region-specific changes associated with clinical AD, but it is unclear whether these measures provide information that is independent of that already provided by measures of total HP volume. Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association between localized HP atrophy measures and AD-related measures including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta and tau concentrations, and cognitive performance, in statistical models that also included total HP volume as a covariate. A computational technique termed localized components analysis (LoCA) was used to identify 7 independent patterns of HP atrophy among 390 semiautomatically delineated HP from baseline magnetic resonance imaging of participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Among cognitively normal participants, multiple measures of localized HP atrophy were significantly associated with CSF amyloid concentration, while total HP volume was not. In addition, among all participants, localized HP atrophy measures and total HP volume were both independently and additively associated with CSF tau concentration, performance on numerous neuropsychological tests, and discrimination between normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD clinical diagnostic groups. Together, these results suggest that regional measures of hippocampal atrophy provided by localized components analysis may be more sensitive than total HP volume to the effects of AD pathology burden among cognitively normal individuals and may provide information about HP regions whose deficits may have especially profound cognitive consequences throughout the AD clinical course."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process is hypothesized to begin with the overproduction and aggregation of amyloid beta in the brain, followed by the development of neurofibrillary tau pathology in a stereotypical chronological and spatial progression (Braak and Braak, 1991; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002) . According to this schema, neurofibrillary pathology appears first in the transentorhinal region, followed by entorhinal cortex and the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus (HP), finally extending into the CA4 and subiculum HP subfields. It is hypothesized that neurofibrillary pathology in these regions eventually causes neuronal dysfunction and death that leads to impaired memory function, which is the cognitive hallmark of early disease. Measures of medial temporal atrophy from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including total HP volume, are therefore believed to be sensitive to early AD pathology and the cognitive decline that presumably results from it (Barkhof et al., 2007; Bobinski et al., 1996 Bobinski et al., , 2000 Bourgeat et al., 2010; Csernansky et al., 2004; deToledo-Morrell et al., 2007; Gosche et al., 2002; Jack et al., 2002; Jagust et al., 2008; Silbert et al., 2003; Whitwell et al., 2008) .\nTotal HP volume, however, is limited in its ability to account for the complex organization of the HP as a collection of functionally interconnected subfields; most investigators combine the contributions of CA1-4, subiculum, dentate gyrus, and possibly other subfields into an overall HP volume measure. Because these regions are damaged differentially by AD-related neurofibrillary pathology, total HP volume may reflect a mix of damaged and healthy subregions early in the AD course.\nPartly for this reason, a number of methods for measuring localized HP subregions have been developed. Early efforts measured areas of slices oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal HP axis (Laakso et al., 2000) . Another approach measured, at thousands of HP surface points, the \"thickness\" of the HP in terms of distance from the surface to a central HP axis (Frisoni et al., 2008) . Another method performed high-dimensional warping of HP to a common anatomical template, followed by statistical analysis of the warping using principal components analysis (PCA) (Csernansky et al., 2005) . By relating spatially variable HP measures to clinical diagnosis of AD, AD risk factors, and other markers, these methods have suggested that a characteristic spatial progression of HP neuronal loss may be detectable in vivo from structural MRI (Csernansky et al., 2005; Laakso et al., 2000; Morra et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2009) .\nThese methods for localized HP structure measurement have been limited, however, in their ability to provide measures that integrate HP surface measurements over local neighborhoods, while at the same time being concise and sensitive to AD-related changes. The HP slicing approach loses information about the possibly complex spatial pattern of HP change by collapsing all of the information in an entire slice down to single measurement of surface area. The thickness approach conversely provides the user with thousands of highly localized measurements that do not reduce to a concise set of numbers summarizing broader patterns. The PCA approach does summarize the subject-to-template deformation into a concise set of spatial patterns, but these patterns are not anatomically constrained and therefore typically cover multiple disconnected regions. The biological information contained within each spatial pattern can therefore be difficult to interpret (Alcantara et al., 2007) .\nConversely, localized components analysis (LoCA) provides anatomically constrained information related to structure of the HP (Alcantara et al., 2007 . Like the PCA approach, it attempts to condense HP shape characteristics into a small number of measurements, each of which describe the structure of a set of HP surface points. Unlike the PCA approach, however, each of the LoCA measurements describes a single, spatially localized neighborhood. We have previously shown that this method can provide sensitive measurements of biologically relevant subregional changes to a variety of brain structures, including the HP (Harris et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2009 ).\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate whether anatomically constrained subregional HP shape measurements may add additional information beyond total HP volume to identify aspects of hippocampal structure that are associated with AD pathology and late-life cognitive performance. To accomplish this, we used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI) to relate MRI-based HP measures to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based AD pathology measures, clinical neuropsychological instruments, and clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. According to the recently described temporal sequence of biomarker changes in AD , changes in CSF amyloid precede changes in total HP volume among cognitively normal individuals possibly by years, and yet pathologic studies have shown that HP injury is already occurring among those with abnormal CSF amyloid concentration (Braak and Braak, 1991; G\u00f3mez-Isla et al., 1996) . Because a marker of such mild and early HP damage could play an important role in early detection and quantification of AD pathological effects, we focused on cognitively normal participants, while additionally extending the analyses to mildly impaired and demented groups."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).

Measurement of HP volume is achieved first by placing manually 22 control points as local landmarks for the HP on the individual brain MRI data: 1 landmark at the HP head, 1 at the tail, and 4 per image (i.e., at the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral boundaries) on 5 equally spaced images perpendicular to the long axis of the HP. Second, fluid image transformation is used to match the individual brains to a template brain (Christensen et al., 1997) . The fluid transformation is used to label HP pixels in the native space of the subject scan, resulting in a binary image representation of the HP structure. The number of HP voxels in this space is counted to obtain the total HP volume. This method of measuring HP volume agrees strongly with fully-manual delineations, with a documented intraclass correlation coefficient between semiautomated and manual volumes of 0.94 (Hsu et al., 2002) .

We first created 1-to-1 correspondence between subjects at 300 homologous HP surface points using a radial surface mapping approach (Thompson et al., 2004) . Briefly, medial curves were threaded down the central anterior-posterior axis of each HP. For each HP, 15 HP slices were then generated by intersecting the HP with 15 planes that cut the HP perpendicular to the medial curve. Within each slice, rays were then cast along a set of 20 evenly spaced outward directions from the medial curve toward the HP surface. Correspondences were then established across HP between cast rays that had analogous slice position and casting direction, and HP surface points at which corresponding rays intersected the surface were assumed to be in correspondence. The resulting HP surfaces, each containing the 300 corresponding surface points, were then globally aligned to a common space using Generalized Procrustes Alignment (Gower, 1975) . PCA was then applied to the set of aligned HP, resulting in a set of shape components: each shape component can be interpreted as a mode of deformation that linearly deforms the population mean HP. When a set of shape components are determined, each subject HP can be described by a set of shape component coefficients: these quantify the degrees to which each of the shape component deformations must be applied to the population mean HP to produce an HP shape that matches that of the subject. The LoCA method iteratively modifies the PCA shape components to force each one to cover a spatially localized HP subregion, while simultaneously trying to obtain the best fit of all subject HP using the smallest number of shape component deformations possible. The result is a small set of shape components, each of which represents a prominent mode of localized HP shape variability across the population (Xie et al., 2009) . Coefficients for the shape components that accounted for at least 3% of HP shape variability were analyzed."}, {"section_title": "Biomarker measurement", "text": "CSF samples were obtained by the individual centers, then banked and batch-processed using a standardized protocol, under the direction of Drs. Leslie Shaw and John Trojanowski of the ADNI Biomarker Core at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (Shaw, 2008) .

For each such shape component, separate models were estimated that had CSF measures of amyloid and tau, clinical neuropsychological test instrument scores (see Table 2 for list) and clinical diagnosis (normal vs. MCI vs. AD) as outcome variables. For each fitted model, the independent effect of the LoCA coefficient was assessed, and this was compared with the effect of HP volume in a model lacking LoCA variables, to assess the relative strengths of association between the outcome measure, and total HP volume and localized HP atrophy respectively.\nAmong neuropsychological instruments, scores for clock drawing, cube copying, digit spans forward and backward, MMSE, Boston naming, CDR sum of boxes, and delayed story recall had skewed distributions across the population of subjects who received an MRI. Therefore, the scores on these tests were treated as integer values, and Poisson regression was used to determine whether predictor values were associated with a greater or smaller number of test points (CDR sum of boxes scores were rescaled to account for the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 scores). Scores on the remaining test instruments, as well as the CSF measures of tau and amyloid, were reasonably normally distributed, so linear regression was used to relate predictor variables to outcome variables.\nWe fitted separate models among those clinically diagnosed as cognitively normal at baseline, those diagnosed with MCI at baseline, and those diagnosed with AD at baseline. Then, for comparison, we fitted combined models including individuals across all 3 baseline diagnostic categories.\nFinally, logistic regression models were used to determine the degree to which the predictor variables increased or decreased the probability of being diagnosed as MCI at baseline, compared with cognitively normal; and the degree to which the predictors increased or decreased the probability of being diagnosed as AD at baseline, compared with MCI. These models were estimated across the entire population of individuals who received an MRI.\nIn each of these models, appropriate statistical tests were used to assess the independent predictive power contributed by each of the predictors. To correct for multiple comparisons, we ran permutations tests with 1000 permutations on each fitted statistical model, and report the p values for these permutation tests (Werft and Benner, 2010) . Whenever there was a significant effect of total HP volume on an outcome variable, we report the number of units difference in the outcome measure that was associated with a 0.1 mL difference in total HP volume. Linear change in each local HP atrophy measurement was associated with a linear change in the local HP thickness: that is, the distance between the central HP axis and the HP surface point that atrophied the most severely in response to a change in this measurement. Whenever there was a significant effect of a local atrophy measurement on an outcome variable, we report the number of units difference in the outcome measure that was associated with a 1 mm difference in local HP thickness."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "General characteristics of all study participants are shown in Table 1 . The subgroup of individuals who received both MRI and CSF measurements was broadly similar to the overall sample of those who received an MRI. As expected, the groups indicate stepwise differences in cognitive measures, HP volume, tau pathology, and CSF amyloid beta, with those in the MCI group displaying higher pathology burden and cognitive impairment compared with the normal group, and the AD group displaying higher pathology burden and cognitive impairment compared with the MCI group. However, the difference in CSF amyloid beta burden between MCI and AD groups was not statistically significant.\nSeven independent measures of regional HP atrophy, each of which accounted for greater than 3% of HP structural variability across the population, were derived from our LoCA method. Together, the measures accounted for 46% of the variability in HP surface point positions across the cohort. These 7 measures summarized atrophy to the anterior and posterior portions of the inferior head, the superior portion of the medial head and superior, inferior, and lateral portions of the body (Fig. 1) . Of the 2 measures accounting for atrophy to the lateral body, the first represented focal deficits to only a limited portion of the lateral body, along with slight deformation of the posterior aspect of the body in the superior-inferior direction. The second represented substantial atrophy to a broader extent of the lateral body, along with lesser degrees of reduction to the superior, medial, and inferior aspects of the tail. These measures accounted for 11.5%, 7.9%, 7.5%, 6.9%, 4.6%, 4.2%, and 3.2% of hippocampus variability respectively. The magnitudes of Pearson correlations between pairs of the measures were all less than 0.3. The magnitudes of Pearson correlations between HP volume and the measures summarizing atrophy to the inferior head regions were less than 0.5, and all other correlations between HP volume and LoCA measures were less than 0.25. Therefore we concluded that the LoCA measures and total HP volume were not entirely redundant with each other."}, {"section_title": "Associations between LoCA and CSF measures", "text": "The association between HP volume and CSF measures of amyloid beta and tau were highly significant when all subjects were included in the same model. Repeated analyses restricted to individual diagnostic categories, however, revealed that HP volume was not significantly associated with either variable within any diagnostic category.\nConversely, LoCA measures that quantified atrophy to the inferior-anterior HP head and the superior and inferior body were significantly associated with a CSF measure of Carmichael et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 33 (2012 ) 1124 .e31-1124 total amyloid beta 1-42 among cognitively normal individuals (Table 3) . In these models, each millimeter decrease in local HP thickness was associated with an amyloid beta decrease between 9.9 and 12.4 pg/mL. In addition, the LoCA measure of atrophy to the superior body was also significantly related to CSF amyloid burden among individuals diagnosed with MCI at baseline, but no LoCA measure was associated with CSF amyloid burden among those diagnosed with AD at baseline. In the MCI model, a 1 mm decrease in local superior HP body thickness was associated with a 6.18 pg/mL decrease in CSF amyloid concentration. In each such model relating LoCA measures to CSF amyloid burden, HP volume was an independent predictor that was not statistically significant. No LoCA atrophy measure was significantly associated with total tau burden in any model that was restricted to 1 of the 3 baseline diagnostic groups individually. Similar to total hippocampal volume, however, in a model containing individuals from all 3 groups together, a significant association between CSF tau and an LoCA measure of the superior HP body was observed (p \u03ed 0.012). HP volume remained a statistically significant independent predictor in this model (p \u03fd 0.001). In this model, a 0.1 mL decrease in total HP volume was associated with a 3.37 pg/mL increase in CSF tau, and a 1 mm decrease in local superior HP body thickness was associated with a 4.1 pg/mL increase in CSF tau. Figs. 2, 3, and 4 provide renderings of the degree of local HP deformation that corresponds to hypothetical participants with varying levels of amyloid and tau. For Fig. 2 , we considered a hypothetical male participant in the cognitively normal group whose age (77.0) and total HP volume (2.1 cc) were exactly at the cognitively normal average. Given a prescribed level of amyloid burden, we determined the degree of local HP deformation that is required by the statistical model in combination with the provided age, gender, and total HP volume to predict that level of amyloid burden. We then deformed the population mean HP by the requisite degree of local deformation to generate the rendering. The renderings show the local HP deformations corresponding to the median, first quartile, and third quartile of amyloid values among the normal group. The renderings suggest an increasing degree of atrophy to the medial HP head and body as one moves from right to left in the figure, corresponding to increasing amyloid burden (i.e., decreasing concentration of amyloid in the CSF). For Fig. 3 , we generated analogous renderings showing the local HP deformation for a hypothetical average male MCI participant associated with amyloid levels at the MCI median, first quartile, and third quartile. The renderings suggest that in this group, a focal deficit to the medial HP body is associated with increasing amyloid burden (moving from right to left in the figure) . For Fig. 4 we show the local HP deformation for a hypothetical average participant from the overall sample whose tau burden is at levels corresponding to the mean values of the normal, MCI, and AD groups.

According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, in vivo markers of amyloid beta, tau, neuronal death, and cognitive function are believed to become sequentially abnormal in response to a cascade of biochemical events initiated by excessive brain amyloid beta production and accumulation (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Jack et al., 2010) . In this schema, an increase in amyloid burden precedes the release of tau into the CSF and atrophy to medial temporal structures before clinically significant cognitive decline is evident (Sluimer et al., 2008) . Because HP atrophy is known to follow a characteristic spatial pattern during this pathological progression, it is plausible that changes in localized HP measures may precede changes in total HP volume as HP injury follows amyloid and tau accumulation. The finding that our LoCA measures of regional HP atrophy were associated with CSF amyloid concentration among cognitively normal individuals, while total HP volume was not, supports this notion and therefore suggests that LoCA may be sensitive to the earliest phase of the amyloid cascade. Localized HP measures may thus be useful in imaging studies that probe the earliest stages of AD-related brain changes.\nThe localized HP measures were significantly associated with CSF amyloid, but not CSF tau, in the cognitively normal group, suggesting that the LoCA measures may be sensitive to HP injury in the AD cascade that is not directly mediated by tau pathology. The reduced dendritic arborization and spine counts observed in HP subregions in pathologically confirmed AD may account for such HP injury (Falke et al., 2003; Ferrer and Gullotta, 1990) . Reports of dendritic spine loss or altered dendritic morphology in the HP of AD transgenic mice that overproduce amyloid, yet generally do not accumulate tau, support the hypothesis that tau accumulation is not a prerequisite for such dendritic injury (Knafo et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2004) . Given these reports, we speculate that our HP measures may have been associated with amyloid concentration among the cognitively normal group due to HP injury not directly due to tau pathology, such as degeneration of dendritic processes, while the LoCA measures did not associate with tau in this group because tau levels had largely not yet risen to abnormal levels in these individuals. The LoCA measures associated significantly with CSF tau burden across the entire cohort, supporting the notion that tau changes impacting macroscopic HP structure may occur relatively later in the pathological progression. Confirmatory studies, however, will be needed to show how sensitive LoCA measures are to the earliest HP changes related to AD brain pathology.\nThe second key finding of the study is that localized HP atrophy measures were significantly associated with a CSFbased measure of tau pathology burden, performance on an array of clinical neuropsychological instruments, and discrimination between clinical diagnostic groups, even after controlling for total HP volume. Again following the hypothesized chronology of changes to markers of amyloid, tau, neuronal death, and cognition, this finding may suggest that even after the accumulation of amyloid and tau have led to pronounced HP neuronal death and markedly reduced HP volume, the localized atrophy measures continue to provide independent information about the spatial pattern of HP losses associated with tau accumulation. Significant associations between LoCA measures and cognition suggest that MRI measures of hippocampal subregions may be more specifically associated with the cognitive systems affected by AD pathology. Indeed, the LoCA measure associated with tau appears to correlate with elements of both CA1 and subiculum (Frisoni et al., 2008) , HP regions known to be affected early in the AD process. This LoCA measure is also strongly associated with cognition, even after correcting for total hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that deficits in specific subregions may have especially profound cognitive consequences. This finding underscores the importance of understanding the functional organization of the HP as a network of distinct subunits that contribute differentially to common cognitive tasks (Amaral, 1993) . On a practical level, this finding suggests that localized HP measures may provide value above and beyond that already provided by HP volume for modeling the effects of AD pathology on the brain and cognition.\nThe key limitation of the study is the lack of multiple measurements of amyloid, tau, HP structure, and cognition per individual over time. Lacking these measurements, this study used cross-sectional measurements together with the hypothesized temporal sequence of AD-related changes to draw inferences about relationships between changes in HP measures and longitudinal changes in amyloid, tau, and cognition. Further establishing the utility of the localized HP measures as early AD markers requires analysis of relationships between longitudinal HP change measures, based on multiple MRI scans per individual and longitudinal changes in the other markers. The raw longitudinal data for this analysis is available from ADNI, but a longitudinal analog of LoCA needs to be developed; that is, a method for concise measurement of per-individual longitudinal changes to localized HP regions over time based on multiple MRI scans. Future work should involve development of such a method and application to longitudinal data such as that provided by ADNI.\nAnother important limitation is the lack of ethnic diversity among participants. This study excluded the small number of ADNI participants from non-Caucasian ethnic groups due to their heterogeneity and the confounding effects ethnicity may have on brain structure. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the natural history of structural and cognitive changes leading to dementia may differ between ethnic groups (Brickman et al., 2008; DeCarli et al., 2008; Stavitsky et al., 2010) .

Carmichael et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 33 (2012 ) 1124 .e31-1124 between hippocampal and cognitive changes suggestive of clinical AD in an ethnically-diverse cohort (Xie et al., 2009) , the current findings relating AD pathology burden to LoCA measures need to be replicated in an ethnically diverse cohort to clarify their generalizability."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.
