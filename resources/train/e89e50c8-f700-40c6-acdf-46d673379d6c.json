[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene play an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, the APOE \u03b54 allele is an established genetic risk factor for AD, while the APOE \u03b52 allele is a protective factor against AD. However, the mechanism underlying this impact of APOE genotype on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. This study sought to investigate the influence of APOE genotype on cognition and neuroimaging features in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 177 participants were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 101 MCI patients and 76 CN individuals. A 2 \u00d7 3 (consisting of two groups and three APOE genotypes) analysis of covariance was carried out to measure the influences of diagnosis and APOE genotype on cognition and brain features, assessed based on global functional connectivity density (gFCD) and hippocampal volume. In addition, a mediation analysis was carried out to investigate the indirect influence of neuroimaging features on the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. This analysis revealed that APOE genotype had an influence on brain function in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In addition, an interactive influence between diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on general cognition, immediate memory, executive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Finally, this mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal volume and gFCD in the thalamus may mediate the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group.

Individuals with the \u03b54 allele have increased risks, while those with the \u03b52 allele show decreased risk of developing AD (Seripa et al., 2009; Fei and Jianhua, 2013; Liu et al., 2013) . However, the neuropathological mechanism underlying the opposite outcomes on cognitive function is still unclear.\nIn the last few decades, many studies investigated the impact of APOE genotype variations on brain structure and function in individuals with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy elders using neuroimaging and genetic analysis (Spampinato et al., 2011; Troyer et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015) . Most of the studies focused on the neural basis of the APOE \u03b54 allele and investigated the group differences in brain structure and function between \u03b54 and non-\u03b54 carriers. Because of the relative rarity of the \u03b52 allele, studies examining the influences of the APOE \u03b52 allele on the neuropathology of AD are still lacking, and the mechanisms underlying the impact of the \u03b52 allele on AD development remain unclear (Suri et al., 2013) .\nWith recent advances in neuroimaging, genetic imaging approaches have been widely used to explore the genetic impact on the brain, of which structural MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) are the most widely used technologies. A large body of work has focused on the relationship between APOE genotype and AD pathology. Many prior studies have examined the structural and functional differences in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, resulting from the presence of \u03b54 (Schuff et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Sinclair et al., 2017) . More recently, researchers have paid more attention to the impact of the APOE \u03b52 allele on the brain. Using both task-based and restingstate fMRI (rs-fMRI), Trachtenberg et al. (2012a; 2012b) . found that hippocampus activation and functional connectivity were similarly changed in \u03b54 and \u03b52 carriers when compared with those in \u03b53 carriers in cognitively normal (CN) elders. Shu et al. (2014) also demonstrated that APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 carriers both showed decreased functional connectivity compared with carriers of homozygous \u03b53 in CN elders. However, Chen et al. (2016) found opposite outcomes of APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 on the intrinsic entorhinal cortex functional connectivity in the middle temporal gyrus. Altered functional connectivity was correlated with episodic memory in the preclinical stage of AD (amnestic MCI) (Chen et al., 2016) . In addition, the influences of APOE genotypes on hippocampal volumes have been frequently examined. Hostage et al. (2013) found dose-dependent influences of \u03b54 alleles on hippocampal volumes in AD and MCI patients, as well as those of \u03b52 alleles in CN elders. Therefore, the hippocampus is the most widely studied and affected part of the brain in early stages of AD (Schuff et al., 2009 ). However, whether and how altered hippocampus volume and brain function is implicated in the opposite role of APOE genotypes in cognitive performance in the development of AD remains unclear.\nIn the present study, we used global functional connectivity density (gFCD) mapping, a new data-driven, voxel-wise method, to measure the function of the whole brain based on rs-fMRI data. We investigated the impact of the APOE genotype (\u03b52+, \u03b53/\u03b53, and \u03b54+) and its interaction with disease status on cognitive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in CN elderly and MCI patients. Importantly, mediation analysis was used to explore potential intermediate phenotypes in the relationship between the APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the CN and MCI population. We hypothesized that APOE \u03b52 will have a particular impact on cognitive performance, hippocampal volume, and brain function in CN elders and MCI participants compared to the APOE \u03b54 allele. In addition, we hypothesized that the gene-brain-cognition model may potentially be able to elucidate the mechanisms underlying APOE-associated cognitive impairment in the MCI group."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 .

A battery of neuropsychological tests were used in this study, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), AD assessment scale -13-item cognitive subscale (ADAS13) for general cognition. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a powerful tool for assessing memory and learning (Schmidt, 1996) . In this study, we used the RAVLT-immediate (sum of scores of trials 1-5) to assess participants' immediate memory, the RAVLT learning (score of trial 5 minus trial 1) to assess learning, and the RAVLT-forgetting (score of trial 5 minus the score of delayed recall) and Logical Memory test (delayed recall score) to assess delay memory. The scores of the Trails B test were used to assess participants' executive function. The naming of the neuropsychological test used in our study will be available from the merged table provided by the ADNI, and the derived summary scores obtained from the RAVLT measurements can be found in the ADNI data dictionary 3 . The diagnosis of MCI was based on the guidelines described in the ADNI protocol, including the following: (1) complaints with regard to memory-related problem or observation of such problems by a partner; (2) a specified education-adjusted cutoff score on the Logical Memory test; an MMSE score between 24 and 30; a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5; a Memory Box score of at least 0.5; and (3) relatively well-preserved daily life activities.

Briefly, the image processing protocol included motion correction and registration, non-uniform intensity normalization, Talairach transform computation, intensity normalization 1, skull strip, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and the deep gray matter volumetric structures, tessellation of the gray matter/white matter boundary, automated topology correction, and surface deformation with intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to other tissue class. The image data were processed based on the 2010 Desikan-Killiany atlas (Fischl et al., 2004) . We selected the hippocampal and entorhinal cortical volumes for structural analysis, as these two regions are usually affected in the early stages of AD and MCI. The fusiform was selected as a reference region in the structural analysis. The bilateral hippocampal, entorhinal, and fusiform volumes were summed in the analyses to increase the statistical power of the analysis.

In addition, the gFCD calculation was restricted to the gray matter regions with a signal/noise ratio of >50% to minimize unwanted effects from susceptibility-related signal-loss artifacts (Tomasi and Volkow, 2010) . To increase the normality of the distribution, grand mean scaling of the gFCD values of each voxel was divided by the mean value of the qualified voxels of the whole brain.

First, multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to explore the influence of the APOE genotype on cognitive performances in the MCI and CN groups, separately, after adjusting for the effects of age, sex, and years of education. Subsequently, the APOE genotype was set as an independent variable (X), and the APOE genotype associated with cognition performances (the MMSE and ADAS scores) was set as the dependent variables (Y). Because a significant association between X and Y is not a prerequisite to testing a mediation hypothesis (Hayes and Rockwood, 2017) (Hayes, 2013; Gong et al., 2017b) and adjusted the effects of sex, age, and years of education as covariates. This model was based on 10,000 bootstrap samples for assessing the bias-corrected bootstrap confidential interval (CI). The indirect influence was determined as significant at 95% CI, with a null hypothesis without indirect influence.

Four main findings were observed in our study. First, the APOE \u03b52 allele had a protective outcome on immediate memory, executive function, and hippocampal volume in the development from normal aging to MCI. Second, compared to APOE \u03b54 carriers, APOE \u03b52 carriers showed increased gFCD in the thalamus network, posterior DMN, and decreased gFCD in motor network. Third, the diagnosis state and APOE genotype synergistically contribute to brain functional alterations, especially in executive control network (ECN) and anterior DMN. Fourth, using the genebrain-cognition model, we found that the hippocampal volume and thalamus function mediated the APOE genotype-associated cognitive performance in MCI patients. Taken together, these findings further extend our understanding of the influence of different APOE genotypes on cognition and brain and suggest that the gene-brain-cognition model may be used to determine the complex neural mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of AD. The association between APOE \u03b54 and cognitive decline has been demonstrated in AD, MCI, and normal aging in many studies (Whitehair et al., 2010; Wisdom et al., 2011; Prada et al., 2014; Suarez et al., 2014) , and the protective outcome of APOE \u03b52 on cognitive decline has been observed in AD patients (Corder et al., 1994; Suri et al., 2013) . However, the positive outcome of the \u03b52 allele on cognitive function has not been replicated in healthy individuals. The present largest single-sample study has not found any association between the \u03b52 allele and special cognitive ability across all age ranges (Marioni et al., 2016) . Sinclair et al. (2017) found that the \u03b52 allele showed positive outcomes on episode memory and executive function in early to mid-adult life (ages 23-67). In the present study, the APOE genotype was associated with general cognitive performance (MMSE and ADAS13 scores) in the MCI group, but was not associated with any cognitive domains in CN elders or MCI patients; this can be attributed to the small sample size in this study. Interestingly, the interactive influence of diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on the measure of immediate memory (RAVLT-immediate) and executive function (Trails B test) (Figures 1B,E) . Both immediate memory and executive function are thought to be dependent on the brain function in the regions including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Penney, 1989; Zelazo, 2015) . These findings indicate the influence of APOE genotype on special cognition domains and brain regions during AD progression.\nChanges in hippocampal volume serve as a sensitive and early biomarker of neurodegeneration in AD patients, and APOE \u03b54 is associated with atrophic hippocampal volume in AD (Liu et al., 2015) and MCI patients, but not in CN elders (Farlow et al., 2004; Morra et al., 2009) . A previous multicohort study found a linear reduction in hippocampal volumes in AD and MCI patients with different APOE genotypes, i.e., \u03b54 carriers < \u03b53 carriers < \u03b52 carriers (Khan et al., 2017) . Our study did not find differences in the hippocampus between the CN and MCI groups and the influence of APOE on hippocampal volume in the pooled group. However, the interactive influence of diagnosis and gene was found in the hippocampal volume (Figure 1F) , and the result indicated that the \u03b52 and \u03b54 alleles had different influences at CN and MCI stages. The opposite outcomes of \u03b52 and \u03b54 on hippocampal volumes also point to the early pathological underpinnings of the APOE genotypes on cognitive function.\nConsistent with previously reported abnormal brain functions in MCI patients, the MCI patients showed dysfunctional gFCD in the bilateral DLPFC (Wu et al., 2014) , the core hub in the ECN (Vincent et al., 2008) . These results support the idea that the abnormal functional connectivity in ECN may be an early biomarker of AD progression. The influence of APOE genotype on the intrinsic functional brain was found in the SMN (the bilateral precentral gyrus and thalamus) and posterior default mode network (PCC) (Biswal et al., 1995; Raichle, 2015;  Figure 3) . A previous study reported that the APOE \u03b52 carriers have robust white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy) in the right thalamus when compared to \u03b53/\u03b53 carriers in CN elderly individuals (Chiang et al., 2012) and that the APOE \u03b54 allele shows additive gray matter volume reduction in the precentral gyrus (Cacciaglia et al., 2018) . Our findings showed the influence of APOE on brain structure, and the reverse influence of APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 on SMN might indicate a counterbalance of brain function in SMN in the preclinical stage of AD. Regarding the impact of APOE on DMN, some studies showed increased DMN in young \u03b54 carriers and decreased DMN in older \u03b54 carriers (Filippini et al., 2009; Sheline et al., 2010) , but other studies found similar DMN alterations in \u03b54 and \u03b52 carriers among CN elderly individuals and MCI patients (Trachtenberg et al., 2012a; Shu et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2017a) . In our study, the gFCD in the posterior DMN was higher in \u03b52 carriers than in \u03b54 carriers. It is possible that the APOE genotype has different influences at different ages and disease development stages. Therefore, exploring the interactive influence of diagnosis and APOE genotypes is important for elucidating the influence of genes on the brain at different stages of AD development. We found that the interactive influence of diagnosis and APOE genotype on brain gFCD was located in the ECN and anterior DMN (MPFC). There were opposite alterations of ECN and DMN from CN to MCI in \u03b54 and \u03b52 carriers, and, unexpectedly, brain function was decreased in \u03b52 carriers and increased in \u03b54 carriers in MCI patients compared to CN individuals (Figure 4) . As the DLPFC plays an essential role for executive function and cognition control processing, while the MPFC is related to the self-referential mental activity (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014), we speculate that \u03b52 and \u03b54 alleles play opposite roles in executive control and self-referential mental processing during the AD development.\nImportantly, the mediation analyses showed that the link between APOE genotype and cognitive performances was mediated through the hippocampal volume and gFCD in the thalamus in the MCI group. In other words, the protective outcome in APOE \u03b52 carriers and detrimental influence in \u03b54 carriers on cognitive performance might be attributed to their different influences on hippocampal volume and thalamus function in MCI. In particular, even the direct association between APOE and immediate memory is not significant, and the APOE genotype could significantly influence memory performance through its influence on hippocampal volume in the MCI group. The hippocampus is the core region for memory processes, and this region is altered early in the development of cognition decline. Recent evidence indicated that APOE might regulate neurogenesis in the hippocampus (Hong et al., 2016; Tensaouti et al., 2018) . The thalamus, which integrates multimodal information across different cortical networks, has been considered the hub of the functional network and plays a critical role in cognitive flexibility (Halassa and Kastner, 2017; Hwang et al., 2017) . The mediator role of the hippocampus and thalamus in APOE-related cognition performances in MCI might indicate the neuroplasticity and cognitive flexibility protection mechanism underlying the APOE \u03b52 allele-mediated outcome on cognition. In this regard, our findings suggest that hippocampal volume and thalamus function could be predictors of cognition performance and potential treatment targets in MCI with different APOE genotypes. Thus, we propose that the gene-brain-cognition model could be a useful tool to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying the gene influence on cognition.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, our study had a small sample size and was a cross-sectional study because the longitudinal data of fMRI are limited in ADNI dataset. We did not include the AD group in the study because of the small number of patients in the AD subgroup with the APOE \u03b52 allele. Second, Iacono and Feltis recently reviewed the newly analyzed data and proposed that the APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 alleles have antagonistic pleotropic influences on cognitive performance and brain structure and function across the human lifespan (Iacono and Feltis, 2019) . The present study explored only the influence of the APOE genotype in elderly individuals; further studies should investigate the influence of APOE during different periods of life. Third, the cognition domains in the present study included only episode memory and executive function but did not include declarative memory, attention, and visuospatial function. Therefore, further studies should involve neuropsychological tests with special referential cognition domains. Fourth, homozygous and heterozygous \u03b52 and \u03b54 allele participants were pooled together in the present study since there were so few participants in the homozygote groups. We have provided this information in the Supplementary Material. However, we believe that the current study provides a useful starting point for further exploring APOE-associated behavior and for imaging investigations in patients with AD."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the APOE \u03b52 allele has specific protective influences on immediate memory, executive function, and hippocampal volume during AD progression.
